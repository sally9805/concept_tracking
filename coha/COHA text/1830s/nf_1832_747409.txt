txt vary the case , id this respect , if in fact A was merely in jest , and only intended to terrify B , if B believed him to be in earnest , and killed him under the mistaken supposition , that he had no other way to save his own life . The reason is , is , that B could not know what limits A had set to his unlawful design . In case of such disastrous consequences , therefore , it would seem , that 6 must be excused ; and A 's blood must rest on his own head for his folly . For a similar reason , if A should make any such dangerous assault on B 's family , or one of the persons , whom by the law of nature he is bound to protect , B , by that law will have a right to make use of any force , which may he necessary for the defence or protection of such person ; and if A is slain in the conflict , and the assault could no otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , in no other way be prevented , it would seem by the law of nature , B must be excused . The reason is , that nature does nothing imperfectly ; and therefore no other limits can be set to this right and duty of protection , but those which are set by the exigency of the case . For , those persons whom nature has set under the protection of others , she has given them a right to protect effectually ; and , if the right to protect , ceases before coming to such extremity , then it would cease at the time when the assailant was most desperate , and consequently when protection would be most needed . But this is obviously absurd . And therefore , by the law of nature , a person may protect to the last extremity , those whom nature has placed under his x ) r her protection . Sec . VII . The defence of , property , A similar train of reasoning will lead to the conclusion , that , in a state of nature before the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect his property ; and , for this purpose may proceed to any extremities , that such protection may require . It is true , that the loss of property is not an injury , in its own nature , irreparable , but , as there is no tribunal of justice , in a state of nature , to which an injured party may apply for redress , it must follow of course , that he has a right to prevent the commission of the wrong , by any measures , which General Rxglifs. 36 are necessary fqr that purpose , provided always that be doe$ no wrong to an innocent third person . But , because a party injured will have a right to reparation after the injury is com* mitted , which however he will be unable to compel without the use of force , to infer , that he has not a right to ue the same force , to prevent the injury , would be unreasonable , especially as there is no certainty , that he will be able to obtain reparation by any means whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If therefore , one person should attempt to rob another , it can not be doubted , that , by the law of nature , the party assaulted noiay resist , and repel force by force , to any extremity that may be necessary to defend bis property* And , for the same reason , that a man may repel an assault upon his person , made for the purpose of committing a robbery , he may also , by natural right , make use of any force , tha may be necessary to prevent another from destroying bis bous or carrying off his cattle by open and . direct violence . For , in a state of nature , he has no tribunaHo apply to , eit ) ier for protection or reparation , and must therefore either protect himself , or remain unprotected , and be liable to be plundered without any chance of redress . But , it seems , he would have no right to proceed to such extremities with an unresisting thief , whom h &; detected in the act of thft . Sec . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person has suffered an injury from the wrongful act of another , which is completely terminated , the injured party , by the lajv of nature is entitled to reparation for the injury , which he has thus sustained . If this is withheld by the wrong doer be may resort to force to obtain it , doing no injury which is unnecessary for that purpose , and which has no tendency to repair the loss . Thus , in a state of nature , suppose A attempts to take away B 's horse by force , and convert it to his own use , it is obvious that , by natural right , B may justly resist the unlawful act of A , even to the last extremity of taking his life , if he can in no other way repel A and prevent the robbery . But , after A has forcibly taken away the horse , B has no right to take the life of A , becaose the act is already committed ; and tfikiog A ! s life , Ijias no tendency to repair the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sustained . But B will have a right by the law of nature , to retake the horse from A 's possession , whenever he findsjt , and , for this purpose , may proceed to the last extremity , if A should resist , while both are living in a state of nature . The reason is that the horse still remains the property of B , notwithstanding A 's robbery For , it is obvious , that A can gain no property in the horse , by his own mere wrongful act . A 's possession of the horse being wrongful , B , who has the right of property , may deprive him of it , and may use any measures which may be proper for that purpose , and which A 's obstinacy may render necessary , since A 's wrongful possession can neither confer on A any new right to the property thus obtained ; nor take away any former right from B. But , if B can not find his horse , he will have a right to take A 's horse , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of distress , until A restores the horse , or makes other satisfaction for the wrong , to B 's acceptance . If B can find no property of A , which he can take , he has a right , by the law of nature , to restrain A 's person , until he makes compensation , if A has it in his power to do so . But , if he has not , then B may justly compel A , if he can without taking his life , to labor for him , until compensation is made . But , though A should absolutely refuse to labor for B , or otherwise make such satisfaction as he has in his power , B has no right by the law of nature to deprive A of life , or mutilate his limbs , or do him any irreparable injury , because this has not the slightest tendency to repair the injury which B has sustained . But B has a right to restrain his person , until he is willing to make full satisfaction , or , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Again ;  --  Where A has done an injury to B , irreparable in its nature , B has the same right of enforcing all the reparation , which A is able to make ; but , under no circumstances whatever , has B a right to deprive A of life , or mutilate his limbs , for the reuson before assigned , that no such act has the slightest tendency to repair the injury which B has sustained . Again ; so long as B is merely enforcing satisfaction , A has no right to resist , until he has voluntarily made , or until B has compelled him to make reparation or satisfaction , either complete , or to B 's Oeneral RighU* 527 conteQt , or all that the circumstances of the case admit . But after either of these has been obtained , B has no right to proceed to further extremities , and if he should , A'l right to resist will commence , precisely where B 's right to compel or coerce , terminates or Ceases . From these considerations , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured , whether the injury be capable or incapable of reparation , in its own nature ; or whether , from a concurrence of circumstances , he is able or unable to obtam redre3s , he has no right whatever to inflict any injury on the wrong-doer , either by way of avenging his own wrong , or punishing him ; and whether it be done to deter the offender , from a repetition of the offence , or as a warning to others . These various positions will be examined separately . And first , in relation to the right of avenging injuries , and the lex talionis or right to retaliate , it may be remarked , tliat , by ! the law of nature , a party injured has no right to demand any higher redress , than complete reparation , which consists in being put in the same condition be was in , before the injury took ' place . To do a similar injury to the wrong-doer , has not the slightest tendency to this object ; and instead of doing himself right , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to do , merely because there is no earthly tribunal to which he can apply for justice , he merely commits another wrong himself . The particular direction in Leviticus * breach for breach , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , ' it is believed , is not to be considered as a part of natural law , or , as declaring a natural right in the injured party , to retaliate an injury , but is rather to be considered as a direction for the legislator of the Jews , as to the punishments to be prescribed in their laws for certain crimes ; or , as a law to be enforced by the judges of that nation , on the offences comprised within the intent of such command or direction . For , in this way , the offender could never complain of the injustice or inequality of his punishment , when the judgment pronounced against him was , that be should suffer the same evil which he had caused to another . There is therefore no such right at all as that of revenge* or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a presumptuous 28 General Rights . /z/ infringement of that prerogative , which the great Creator has reserved to himself , when he says , ' Vengeance is mine . ' 2 . With regard to the supposed right of an injured party to punish his wrong-doer , a similar train of reflections will show that no such right exists . For , all that the party injured can claim in a state of nature , and by natural right , is reparation , which , as has been just suggested , he may compel by force , subject to certain restrictions . The reason is , that all men are by nature equal ; but the right to punish , implies superiority on the part of the party punishing ; for , otherwise , he could have no jurisdiction over the offence . And though nature , from the necessity of the case , constitutes an injured party the judge of the extent of the injury , for the purpose of obtaining redress , so far as the satisfaction of his own conscience is concerned ; yet , the wrong-doer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly far less when the question of punishment is brought up . As the injured party , therefore , has no power or rightful authority to determine the extent of punishment to be inflicted on the ofl ! ender , he can have no right to punish at all . The power and authority to punish , must belong to some tribunal , having jurisdiction , which it is very dear can never result to an injured party , from the injury itself alone ; since the right to enforce reparation , or to obtain redress is totally distinct from an authority to inflict punishment . Whence then , it may be asked , can society derive its right to bflict punishments for crimes ? To many persons , it will be a sufficient answer , that all regular , established governments , however liable to commit occasional errors and mis  - -  takes , are God 's vicegerents on earth , and therefore have sufficient authority to punish crimes . Others may be reminded , that , goveminent is grounded on an express or tacit compact , made by the constituent members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by it , and to submit to such sentences , as the courts of the government may award agreeably to the laws , as a penalty for the violation of them . But , here it may be replied , that this answer is not satisfactory , where the sentences involve the sacriflce of human life ; because , if , agreeably to the opinion of the greater number of pious and * General Rights . 99 religious men , no person has a right to take away his own life , it follows , that he connot confer any such right upon society , by any compact which he may form for that purpose . For this excepted case , therefore , as society can derive no authority from consent expressly or tacitly given in the formation of government , a different source of lawful power must be sought . This , however , will readily be found in the natural right of selfpreservation , or self-defence . This right each individual has from nature ; and however it may be modified in the organization of society , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws made by virtue of that compact , is by no means either given up or abandoned . The various individuals of society , therefore , by constituting their rulers their defenders and protectors , may , and without doubt do , confer on them the right to use any means necessary for their protection , which the several individuals possess themselves . The Tight , which society has , to punish with death , a murder committed within its territory , seems to foUow . Because , though no single individual of the society would have any such right to punish , while in a state of nature ; nor , even after the formation of the society , could have any such right , unless it wera conferred on him by the rulers ; yet , the society itself , and their rulers , as their delegates , would have such lawful power , because the society itself could not subsist , if they had dot authority to deprive of life an offender , whose crime showed that he was an enemy of mankind , a disorganizer not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of every individual who was obnoxious to his malice , as often as the case occurred , if he could do it with impunity . As therefore nature has formed man for society , for mutual protection and benefit , and as it is impossible that society can subsist in security without an authority to deprive of life , those offenders , whose crimes strike at its foundation , it seems to follow , that society possesses this right over such capital offenders , as necessary to its self-preservation . Sxc . IX . Of the pretended right to make war . Under the law of nature , it will.be difficult to point out an instance , wliere an individual has a right to make war on another , if it 90 General Rights . is to be considered , as affording a justification for offering violence to , him , in any other circumstances than those already suggested under the heads of the right of self-preservation. ' * the right of self-defence , ' fac . &c.; For , a war for the purpose of retaliation , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving a warning to others , it is believed , is wholly unauthorized by natural right . Suppose , in a state of nature , that A has slain the son of B , yet , by the law of nature , B has no right to deprive A of life , because A 's crime is nished and can no longer be prevented , since B 's son can not be restored to life . B can derive no authority or right from the pretence , that he means to protect the rest of mankind , because it does not appear , that they are in any immediate or unavoidable danger , nor that he has any authority to act as their ruler or protector . Neither has he any authority , as judge , to punish a crime , when he has no lawful jurisdiction to determine on the merits of the case . For , it is possible that B 's son may have been slain on a justifiable occasion . The reader may be referred to the case narrated in the Bible , where Abner slew Asahel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asahel 's brother Joab . In the case supposed , the principal injury is done to the person slain . This injury the father has no naturd right to avenge , because this authority belongs to the Supreme Being alone . If , therefore , the father arrogates to himself this office , the assumption seems obnoxious to the charge of impiety , because , it seems to imply , a disbelief in the existence of a God , or a distrust in his justice . Yet , if the fatiier should sustain any peculiar loss or damage from the death of his son , it can not be doubted , that , by the law of nature , he will have a right to enforce reparation , in the same manner , as , if the damage arose from any other wrongful act . But , in a state of nature , the punishment of the principal crime must be left to the Ruler of the Universe . Why then , it may be asked , may not the punishment of murder be left to him , if committed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given an express command to punish wilful murder with death . This command , it is supposed , is addressed to the rulers of every organized society , who , in this respect , must consequently be considered General RigMs , 31 as invested by him with the necessary authority to try and punish the crime . For , it is much more reasonable to suppose , that this power is confided to an impartial tribunal , than to consider it as left to be exercised by the paitiality and violence of privale feeling . In the former case , guilt must be proved before it is punished ; in the latter , innocence itself , might not always be able to obtain even a hearing . - Sec . X. Of the right to form associations , and organize sQciety . The true doctrine on this subject , it is believed , will be best illustrated by the following imaginary case . Let it be supposed , then , , that five thousand families are living peaceably , though in a stale of nature , on a territory of sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let it be supposed , further , that some few of them , who are scattered among tiie rest , are desirous of forming a society for their mutual protection , but that the greater number , disliking the restraints of society , and preferring their natural liberty and independence , refuse to join in this project . Here , it can not be doubted , that the smaller number have a perfect right to form such a society , notwithstanding the refusal of the others to unite in it . Because man is formed for society , and has a natural right to provide for his security and happiness , in any way that he has a physical power to do , so that he violates no duty of religion , and infringes no right of the rest  --  of mkind . It follows , therefore , that the dissenting families have no right to prevent the formation of the society . For , though they may be apprehensive of ill-consequences from the neighborhood of such a society , they have no right on that account to interfere with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be ill-grounded . The dissentients , consequently , will have no right to molest the society or any of its members , until some injury has actually been offered by them . When this happens , the individual injured by the society will retain his natural right to demand and enforce reparation in the manner already suggested in a preceding section . On the other hand , it is clear that , the society would have no right to compel any of the dissentients to come under its regulatiois or obey its laws ; because , in relation 32 General Rights . to them , the constituent members of the society gain no new rights or powers by forming their association and agreeing upon a government . Their laws therefore will not bind those who refuse to enter into the society , as respects whom , the members of the society will retain the same rights which they had before its formation , though the power and authority to enforce those rights will probably be entrusted to the rulers of the society , and not be enforced by the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the association , or the constitution of the society . It is thus apparent , that the smaller number of families , derive no right to control the majority , from the mere act of forming a society . Let us consider , then , whether if the society had been formed by the greater number , they would have a right to control the smaller number , and compel them to join in it , or submit to its laws and regulations . To determine this question , it will be sufficient to suppose the society to be formed by the precise number of 499 families , and that there are 501 dissentients . Now , it is obvious , that if two of the dissentients alter their opinions and join the society , the dissentients will then become smaller number . But , can it be supposed for a moment , that , by the law of nature , where there is no previous agreement to that effect , the change of opinion in two persons , shall take away the right of refusing to join th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be absurd ; for , where there is no previous agreement in restraint of a natural right , it never can be taken away by the mere act of a third person . If it could , it " would be improperly called a right , since its existence would depend on such person 's discretion . It is thus evident , that there is no natural right , in the major number of the inhabitants of a territory , while living in a state of nature without any government , to control the smaller number , either by compelling them to join in the formation of a government , or by making laws for the regulation of their conduct . Each individual therefore , in strictness , has a right to refuse to join in the original formation of the society , and yet retains atl his natural rights entirely unimpaired . Two important consequences follow from the doctrine just General Rights . 33 stated . 1 . As each individual has a right to refuse to join the society , he may stipulate for what terms he pleases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join in forming the association . And , if those terms are agreed to , and he accordingly joins the society , those terms must be kept , for , if they are violated , he will have a right to return to his state of independence* Suppose , for example , that the smaller number should stipulate , that it should be partf the social compact , that no law should be enacted , unless by the voice of two thirds of the members ; this would be binding upon the whole society , and could never be altered , without the consent of all . If this stipulation were infringed , the constitution would be violated , the compact would be broken , and consequently would cease to be binding , and the society would be dissolved so far as concerned the dissenting members . This is sufficient to show , that the right of the majority to govern , however fair and equal , ha no other foundation , than the agreement of the original members of the social compact , not being at all grounded on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large in another place . 2 . As no individual , in a state of nature , can justly be compelled to join in the formation of society ; so the society , or , those who propose the formation of one , have an absolute right to refuse admission to its rights and privileges , to all those persons whom they dislike , for whatever cause . It follows , that they may justly stipulate for whatever qualifications they think best , of character , abilities , or property ; and no person , not possessing such qualifications , will have any just Cause of complaint , at being excluded from the society , for die want of them . But after these qualificatioUiS have been once agreed upon , unanimously ( for the majority have no natural right , in this respect to bind any but themselves , ) these qualifications can not rightfully be altered , so as to disqualify any of the members , without the consent of every one , including even the party thus to be disqualified . If this were not so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practised . For , if they agreed unanimously on certain qualifications at first , and then the majori had a right to alter them , and accordingly did so , it /z/ 34 General Rights . is evident , that all those , who would not have joined the society on the terms contained in the alteration , would be defrauded of their natural right , if they are compelled in this indirect way to submit to the will of the majority . In any such case , their natural right to recede will revive , and , if they should continue to dwell in the territory of the society , they will become merely resident aliens , owing allegiance to the society no longer than while they abide within its boundaries . Having considered some of the principal rights , which men have in a state of nature , previously to the formation and organization of society , and having established as an axiom that no individual can justly be deprived of the exercise of them , unless in consequence of his own assent , expressly or tacitly given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , it may not be amiss in this place , to touch very briefly upon the origin of society and the principal objects and inducements , which men probably had in view in both . These inducements and objects will more readily appear , if we consider the inconveniences , which must unavoidably attend any considerable number of families , living in the neighborhood of each other in a state of nature . One of the first inconveniences which would be felt , would be the want of a commoa tribunal of justice , to determine questions of conflicting claims or rights . For , on the supposition , that all these families at first were living on friendly terms with each other in general , it is impossible that disputes and controversies should not , sooner or later , arise among some of them . The consequence would then be , that , for want of such a tribunal , every individual who considered his rights infringed by another , would immediately make use of all his exertions to obtain reparation ; while , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would maintain his wrong , if possible , from the same motives which first led him to commit it ; and , if h considered himself in the right , would , with still better reason , defend himself to the last extremity , from what he would then consider unlawful aggression . The two parties , in all probability , would soon commence hostilities , each uniting to himself all the other families , whom he could induce to take a part in his cause . The more effective party would prevail in the conflict , and , according to General Rights . 3 the barbarous practice of early ages , the conquered party would either be slain fn battle , massacred after the defeat , or compelled to serve their conquerors as slaves . The leader of the conquering party , who very possibly might be the individual who had induced them to take up arms in the first instance , would very naturally obtain great influence over all his followers and adherents , either by distributing among them the spoils'ofthe vanquished , or by reason of the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal prowess , as displayed in this petty warfare The advantages , which they had derived from acting in concert , and from the organization of their forces , which however imperfect , would be sufficient to enable them to perceive the superiority of a regular force , over a confused and disorderly multitude , would naturally prompt them to continue in society with each other , and their recent success would fix their choice upon their lead* er . Without descending into minute pai ; ticulars and details , all of which would vary with circumstanees , it is very apparent that the leader would gradually enlarge his powers by usurpation , and in this way would soon render his office , which , in the first instance , being bestowed from merely personal con- " siderations , would unquestionably be elective , hereditary in his own family . The subjects , after they bad several times experienced the evils which naturally attend a war for the succession between two or more competitors , would gladly submit to any such arrangement as would permit them to have the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderous contest , in order to decide who should be the ruler . This account of the origin of monarchy , it is believed , has often been verified by the experience of nations , and if the history of early limes may be trusted , more than one may be traced to beginnings not materially variant from it , in principle . It may be remarked here , transiently , that though there are three simple forms of government ; viz : 1 . a Monarchy , where the power of the government in the last resort , is settled in an individual , who has a power to nominate his successor to the throne ; 2. an Aristotracy , where the same power is exercis- 36 General Rights . ed by a certain limited number of individuals , who have the power of keeping their body full , without any interference of the people ; 3. a Democracy , where the whole body of the people make the laws and decide on all public measures , and form collectively the fountain of all political power ; to which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as limited or elective monarchies ; republics , k.c . &lc.; Yet , it is believed , that monarchy alone , naturally succeeds to anarchy , where men live in a state of hostility and violence , without any regular government . Yet , however unlikely , it is very possible that either a democracy or an aristocracy may ' be established , in the first instance , as a form of government . Thus ; to continue the detail of the consequences of the former supposition , let it be supposed further , that , after the establishment of the organized society under the control of a military leader , and which comprised part only of the whole number of families the neutral party , or those who took no part in the contest , seeing the slaughter or subjugation of those who had been defeated , should entertain a wish to secure tliemselves , as far as possible , from the chance of a similar catastrophe , ( which suggests the other principal inconveniences of a state of nature , viz. insecurity of life , liberty and property ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a society , more or less organized according to circumstances ; and , if there were no particular individual among them , conspicuous over the rest , for superior wisdom , military prowess , the number of his family or hired attendants , or great wealth , it is not unlikely that they might agree to be governed by the direction of some small number of warriors or sages , constituting a council or senate , and who appeared to be most able to guide them by their wisdom and experience , and protect them by their military skill and vakr . Here , in the mere act of agreeing to submit to the control of these worthies , the heads of the families , who constitute the elements of society , would act AS members of a democracy . But , as soon as the agreement was once made , the government agreed upon would be an aristocracy But , if , instead of adopting either of these steps , the heads of families should assemble together , and make an agreement General Rights . 37 with each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations , as they should agree upon , either unanimously , or by a majority of two thirds , or by a simple itiajority , and should afterwards choose a certain number of officers , either for a dertain time , or removable at pleasure , or during good behavior , to enforce obedience to those lawsj and distribute ? justice , they would then constitute a pure democracy . It is not intended in this place to discuss the respective advantages of these various forms of government . But , where there is a large extent of country , containing within it many various nations under distinct governments , none appears to be more safe than an hereditary monarchy . The consequence of being govern ed by an elective monarchy is seen in the fate of Poland . A simple democracy would immediately fall a prey to a neighboring monarchy . The delay and dissensions of their councils would be such , that without taking into the account the ver ' probable chances of corruption , the monarchy would overrun the democracy , before the members of the latter could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one should object here the long continuance of the Roman Republic , surrounded by the most warlike nations , many of whom were governed by kings of great military skill , it may be replied , that Rome was rather an aristocracy , than a democracy from the time of the expulsion of the Tarquins , to that of Julius Caesar notwuhstanding occasional and partial changes in the government . Yet Rome was saved more than once during that period , by the decisive measure of appointing a dictator , an officer who possessed absolute power for the terra of six months , and who could not be called to account for any measures however arbitrary and tyrannical , which he chose to adopt during that time . An aristocracy is a far more effective form of government than a democracy . This is very ap* parent from the history of Venice . But the inequality of rank would be an insurmountable objection to the adoption of such a form of government , among freemen who acknowledge no natural superiority of right in one man over another . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union of the American States should be dissolved , that those States which attempt to preserve the republican form of government , 38 General Rights , will easily be overrun by those who adopt a more energetic form . The principal inducements , which men , living in a state of nature , would have , to form an organized society , would seem to be , 1 . To have a tribunal , to which they might apply for the redress of any infringement of their natural rights , and thus prevent dissensions among those who were desirous of living together on friendly terms , from maturing into broils , outrages , and murderous conflicts , which dissensions , for want of such a tribunal , would necessarily arise from conflicting claims and pretensions ; 2 . To secure their persons and property from molestation by external enemies . There are no doubt many other benefits arising from the organization of society , which , if they had been foreseen , might very probably have offered , of themselves , sufficient inducements to adopt that measure ; as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement in trade or barter , as well as in manufactures , a rapid advancement in art and science in general , ias well as every species of practical or speculative knowledge , necessarily accompanied with an increased degree of humanity , civilization , and refined social intercourse . Without mentioning other advantage 's , which might be enumerated , or wasting time in an unprofitable descant upon these , it should be observed , that these benefits are not to be obtained without a partial relinquishment of some of those natural rights which pertain to men individually before the organization of society . Among the rights which are thus relinquished in a gfe ) siter or less degree , the most usual are , 1 . the right , which in a state of nature , each individual has of redressing his own wrongs , personally ; 2. the right of acting as he pleases , and consulting his own happiness alone , provided that he infringes no duly of piety and religion towards his Maker , and neglects or violates no obligation of justice , charity and humanity towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there appears to be an almost total relinquishment of it to the government , in the first formation of the society . There certainly is with regard to all those wrongs , wliich come within the jurisdiction of any of the tribunals or courts establishedby the government . But ; with relation to those wrongs , the redress of which is not thus provided for , it would General Rights . 39* seem most expedient for the welfare of society , to consider , that the members of the community in forming a government , for the purpose of enacting laws and establishing tribunals of justice , had agreed to submit to the legislature , or to the Judges of the courts to determine , whether any grievance or injury complained of is of such a nature , or of sufficient importance to demand the aid of the court , and if it be not in their opinion , had agreed to pass it over in silence , until the legislature should alter such opinion , and see fit to interpose and provide a remedy . 2 . In relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remarked , that it is with a view to this right , that governments are usually esteemed to be more or less free , precisely as this freedom is more or less trenched upon by the laws of such governments respectively . On entering into a Social compact , the members might very naturally stipulate for the reservation of certain particular liberties or exemptions , which reservation ought to be strictly observed and complied with by the rulers or constituted authorities . If they are slighted or trampled upon , the power of the rulers will so far be usurped , and their government tyrannical . But , with the exception of those reserved rights , the members of the society would be considered as agreeing to relinquish to the government so much of their natural freedom of action as should become necessary , from time to time , to obey and observe such laws and regulations , as the rulers , within their constitution or social compact , should think expedient to enact and promulgate for the general good . It . would not be , therefore so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they relinquish for the good of society ; as it would be a power to limit , restrain or wholly take away the exercise of those rights , which they would confer on the rulers , with a stipulation express or tacit , that such power should never be exercised except for the general and equal good of all . For the true idea of government seems to be , that it is established by the people , for the preservation of their natural rights in general by a partial sacrifice of a few particular ones . But , It is not merely , the fireedom of action , which each i 40 General Rights . individual relinquishes in a greater or less degree to the con-* trol of government ; but be agrees also to do whatever the rulers shall judge expedient for the general good of the whole , with a stipulation , express or tacit , that legislation shall be general , and comprehend all the individuals of the society to whose circumstances it may be equally applicable . As men , in relation to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly be subjected to the control of another , or any number of others , without his consent ; or , unless he has committed some crime , or has come under some obligation . As , therefore , it can not be supposed that any individual would originally have agreed to join with others in organizing a society , where he would not stand on equal ground with the rest , any law which would tend to degrade him below the rest , must be inequitable and in violation of an implied understanding . For , in strictness , no law can be binding , if inconsistent with the restrictions contained in the social compact or constitution of the society , and beyond the powers intended to be granted in it . Having stattd in very general terms , though with as much distinctness as the necessary limits of this chapter , and the nature of the case , would conveniently permit , the rights which men have in a state of nature previously to the organization of society , and touched slightly upon the inconvenitncies of a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unite and form a government ; having also briefly considered some of the natural rights , which it is necessary , that men should relinquish in a greater or less degree , according to circumstances , to the government of the society , in order to obtain the objects of its organization , this chapter will conclude with a few remarks upon those natural rights , more or less of which are usually retained by the members of society , notwithstanding their entering into such an organized union . Division . 2 . Of those rights which are usually retained in organized society . Sec . I. Self defence in cases of extreme urgency . The first and most important of these rights , is that of self-defence . This right is reserved to every individual , in all cases , where General Righii. 41 there is not time sufficient to apply to the government for protection . So that , if a man is assaulted , and his life is in extreme danger , and he has no opportunity to apply to the police , because his case will admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of society as well as by the law of nature , if he takes the life of his assailant , svppasing always that he hoi no other way to save his own . For , in any such case as this , society can not afford him that protection , which was one of the principal motives , which led him to unite with others in the formation of it . His natural right to protect himself in any such extremity , is therefore always reserved to him . But , where the aggression is threatened previously to its being actually made , no individual has a right to make preparations for his own defence , personally , if such preparations constitute a disturbance of the public peace . In any such case , the individual threatened ought to apply to the proper officers of the society for that protection , which it is their duty to afford him . Sec . II . Of qualified liberty of action ; freedom from unnecessary restraints requisitions and exactions &c.; Where the people form a social compact , contained in a written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , may be defined with precision . But , where there is no written consjdtution , the extent of such powers is ascertained by usages and precedents , that is to say , by the practice of the rulers , sanctioned by the silent acquiescence of the people , in peaceable and quiet times . In different societies and under different governments , the powers of the rulers , and the consequent restraint on the natural liberty of the subjects , vary greatly . Civil liberty consists in not being restrained from acting , and not being constrained to act , by any law which does not conduce to the general welfare . But , it may be asked , how shall it be ascertained whether a law conduces to the general welfare or not i The answer is , this is submitted to the wisdom and discretion of the rulers . But , it may be asked again , is there no restraint upon the exercise of this discretion ? The answer is , that they are restrained from enacting laws , or /z/ 42 General Righit. adopting any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertained by usage or contained in a written document or compact . But , it may he asked again , who shall determine whether a law is or is not agreeable to the constitution or social compact ? The answer must be , the tribunal ( if any ) provided in the constitution , for the determination of such questions , must decide . But , if none is provided , then that person or persons in whom the power is vested in the last resort , by the frame of government , whether a monarchy , an aristocracy , or a democracy , will have the constitutional right to determine . But , where the act in violation of the constitution , is committed by the very person or persons , to whom the supreme power of the government is given by the constitution ; there is no peaceable remedy , if the illegal laws or measures are persisted in , after petition and rfemonstrance by the subjects ; for the truth is , the frame of government is defective , and the conduct of the rulers or ruler is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint upon natural liberty or freedom , may vary under different constitutions or forms of government , it is obvious that it may also vary greatly under the same constitution at different times , owing to the various interpretations and constructions put upon it , by persons of greater or less integrity and intelligence . The definition of the freedom , which men have in a state ot nature , of consulting their own happiness it i all they do , so as they offend against- neither religion nor morality , that is , provided they transgress no divine law , and do no injury to the rest of mankind , is sufficiently intelligible and plain . But , in a state of society , this single right branches out into a great variety of rights , each of which has received a distinct appellation . The first division of this natural liberty or freedom , is into a freedom from restraint , and a freedom from exactions or requirements . By relinquishing the*fir6t , we become liable to be restrained by the laws of society , from doing many things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect liberty to do , without committing any wrong or injustice . By relinquishing the second , we become liable to be bound to do , by virtue of our social compact , and the laws made under it , many things , General RighU. 43 which , in a state of nature , we were under no such obligation to do , and which , from the general maxim of the natural equality of all mankind as to their rights , no man or body of men could have any right to compel us to do , without some previous consent or other act of our own . Under the former of these branches of natural liberty , viz : freedom from restraint upon the right of action , may be comprehepded , 1 . The right of expatriatioiu That a citizen of any community , in ordinary cases , has a right to leave its territory at pleasure , and reside in some other country , and cast off his native allegiance to his own , seems to follow of course , from the preceding view of the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true , that this right has been absolutely denied by some , who hold that a man can never shake off the allegiance which may be claimed by his native country . This , however , seems something like setting up an idol , and is entirely contrary to the principles acknowledged in the constitution of the United States . For , if a foreigner can not become an American citizen , without committing a crimQ , or at least doing a manifest injustice to the country of his birth , why is the naturalization of aliens permitted among us ? Why is it thought worthwhile to inquire into the character of an individual , who , by the very act of applying for naturalization , which renders such inquiry necessary , shows that he is not &t; to be a citizen of any other country , since he roust first throw off his allegiance to his native land ? But , though this may furnish an excellent theme for declamation , which will be omitted here , such opinion seems not to be sufficiently well grounded to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a man 's country ? Is it the place of his birth or residence ? This would be a very unreasonable supposition , unless taken in connexion with its inhabitants , its frame of government , and its laws and institutions . For , a roan can not owe allegiance to inanimate nature , as roounn. tains , rivers , and groves , whatever poets may imagine . Nei-s. ther can it consist in the government , laws , and institutioQs ; for , if 80 , . then to change them in a material point , would deprive a man of his country . It must then consist in the inhabitants forming a society , the identity of which is preserved , 44 General Rights . like that of a river , by perpetual succession under the government to which he has either expressly or tacitly agreed , on the territory subject to that government , and belonging to its citizens . If a man owes allegiance to any of these , let it be first supposedtbat it is to the government . But if it is owed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be due to the persons of the rulers for the time being . For the government in any other sense , is a mere abstraction . In monarchies , it is admitted , allegiance is due to the king , as the feudal head of the nation , and who is acknowledged to be the lawful political master and lord of his subjects . But such allegiance ' can be claimed only in monarchies and aristocracies . In our republic , to whom is allegiance due ? The answer must be , that no such allegiance is due to any one . But , with * regard to the state of which he is a citizen , each one 's allegiance is limited by the terms of the constitution made by the citizens of that state , and to which he has either expressly or tacitly assented . The same remark applies to the constitution of the United States , to which we must resort , if we would know precisely the kind of allegiance which is to be considered as due from the citizens of the Union . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he pleases , or expatriation , in either of those CQmpaots , it follows that a man may rightfully expatriate himself , and throw off his supposed natural allegiance to his own country , whenever he pleases , provided he was not personally a party to the original compact , and has never taken any oath of allegiance , either to the slate of which he is a citizen , or to the United States . For , obligations like these , whatever the common practice may be , are not to be assumed and cast ofi again at pleasure . But , perhaps it will be urged , that a man 's country consists properly in the succession of inhabitants in the territory and under the government " of which he is a resident native citizen ; and that , it is to these inhabitants in a body and in their political capacity as a nation , that allegiance is properly due . But , it may be replied , if he is under an obligation of this kind to them , every other citizen is also under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation to each other . This Generul Rights . 45 supposition would gratuitously and unnecessarily impose redprocal obligations upon every one of the citizens of a country to remain in it subject to its allegiance , however adverse it might be to his interest or happiness ; when on the contrary , it would be much more agreeable to natural freedom , to consider every individual as having a right to expatriate himself , and form new connexions at discretion . Whether an American citizen can throw off his allegiance or not , without an act of Congress to authorise him , seems not to be judicially settled . 7 Wheat . 283 , . Further , if a man is under obligations to any one , it must be to his parents ; yet nature sets him free from all ties but those of gratitude , affection and reverence , as soon as he arrives at maturity . If then he beccmies free from them , there is certainly but little reason , why he should be under any higher obhgations , in the ordinary course of events , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , voluntary en- gagements to them . It is not intended , however , to palliate or excuse , the conduct of any individual , who should see fit to exercise this right at a time when his country is in a state of peril or distress from hostile aggression , and hasi need of his assistance in its defence . The gratitude , which would be due to it , from hini , on account of the protection it has afibrded him during his youth , and the advantages which he has derived from its vari* ous laws and institutions , and the civilities and kindnesses which he has received from his fellow-citizens , would render his conduct deserving of the same reprehension as that of a son , who should refuse to relieve the necessities of his parents on the ground , that gratitude is a duty of imperfect obligation , and that tie had a natural right to do as he pleased in relation to the subject . Neither is it intended to deny the perfect right of the government of the country , to adopt such measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its citizens , who , not satisfied with renouncing their allegiance , should take up arms against their country , and abuse their knowledge of the weak points in its defences , to insure its overthrow . 9 . TTie rights of conscience , and freedom of inquiry . In a /z/ 46 General Rights . state of nature , these rights , as well as others of a similar kind , are derived from the natural freedom from the control of others , to which all men are entided ; while again this natural freedom results from the natural equality of all men t is to their rights . If these rights are relinquished on the formation of society , it must be by virtue of the constitution or social compact of the society or government . But , if not so relinquished , either expressly or by tacit acquiescence , they remain unimpaired to the members of the society or body politic , and the rulers have no right to do any thing to infringe them . It is not necessary , however , in order to authorize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a power for that purpose should be expressly given in the constitution . It will be sufficient , if the constitution imposes no restraint on the government , to prevent the exercise of such authority , and that a particular emergency has arisen , requiring such legislative interposition . For , unless expressly prohibited , their general authority to provide for the public welfare , would be amply sufficient for this purpose . These remarks , however , can apply only to open acts , opinions promulgated , and doctrines openly taught and inculcated . For , under a general power to provide for the general welfare , to institute a scrutiny into private opinions , and to require men to avow or disavow them , whether in relation to religious , moral or political subjects , would be an act of mere usurpation , and grossly tyrannical . Yet , a government , it is obvious , may be author ized by the citizens who frame and adopt it , to exclude from the rights of citizenship , or naturalization , all foreigners , who refuse to disclose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the same reason , may be authorized by their citizens , to impose a test whether religious or political , on the citizens themselves , the refusal to take which , should be . considered as a disqualification for office , whenever the public good requires such a measure . But , in most cases , the adoption of any such course would be highly odious . For the same reason , if it were part of the constitution , that no individual , though born within the country , should have the rights of citizenship , if he should profess any other religion than that of the state , such person would be a mere resident alien . General Rights . 47 And if the legislature , being authorized for that purpose by the constitution , should deem it expedient to exclude from its territory , all persons , who were not of the same religion with that of the government , there would seem to be no absolute violation of natural right in this , though it would seem to be an act of gross intolerance , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To express this doctrine in a few words ;  --  as every man in a state of nature , has a right to exclude from hi$ household and family , every individual of bad chankcter , notorious for bad principles or corrupt practices , it csinnot be doubted that , in organizing a society , the constituent members may confer a similar power on their government by using express terms for that purpose . A general authority to take care of the public welfare , would also be sufficient for that purpose , unless the exercise of this general power were expressly restrained in this particular instancy . Under any such authority , whether express or implied , the government would have a right to banish from its territory , any individual who should undertake to teach or disseminate opinions dangerous to the peace or welfare of society . And on this subject , the rulers or constituted authorities alone , would be the proper judges . It will make no dijSerence , in this respect , of what nature such opinions or principles may be , or whether they relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , by the constituted authorities are thought to lead , to injurious consequences . For , erroneous opinions on the subjects of religion and politics , are found by experience to be a fruitful source of public troubles and disturbances , with their bloody concomitants , tortures , rapine , murder , massacre and civil war : while erroneous opinions in relation to morals , may soon sap the foundation of innocence and virtue , and raise on their ruins , a temple dedicated to vice , corruption , abomination , Dagoa and Moloch . Can it be doubted then , that the open teaching , promulgation and inculcation of false and dangerous opinions , should immediately be stopped ? The gov- ' ernment , supposing them to have full authority from the peo pie on this subject , should exercise a sound discretion in relation to it . If they merely punish crimes and immorality when they occur , they perform only half of their duty ; since they i 48 Oencral Rights . ought to stop the sources of corrupt practices at the fountain bead , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most perfect freedom of inquiry should be allowed , for the sake of informing the conscience . For , it can not be supposed , that any individual , by coming under the obligations of society , intended to surrender his liberty of conscience , or his natural right of worshipping God according to the dictates of his own reason , to the mere opinions of other men as fallible as himself . Still , no christian government can be under any obligation to tolerate any grossly immoral or indecent practices , under the pretence of indulging religious freedom . For , such practices constitute a disturbance of the public peace , and are an offence or nuisance to all the orderly citizens . For similar reasons , the public teaching of a false religion , or the open inculcation of doctrines , professedly aiming at the subversion of all religion , should be silenced by public authority . For , the government acting on the behalf of the people , have a perfect right to adopt such measures as they may judge necessary for this purpose , provided they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private satisfaction of each individual 's own conscience . It may be objected here , if these observations apply equally to all forms of government , where is the freedom , which is so much boasted of under democratic or republican forms of government . The answer is , that as , under a monarchy , it was never intended to deprive the people of the power of doing good ; so under a republic or a democracy , it was never intended that the people should beree to do evil ; and , if there is less power and opportunity of domg good under a fnonarchy , and greater liberty as well as temptation to do ill under a republic or democracy , it is no part of the design of the framers of such governments ; but such consequences naturally attend the greater or less degree of freedona enjoyed under each , respectively . To restrain the introduction of dangerous opinions among the people , is no infringement of their liberties ; on the contrary , it is the most effectual method of preserving what the people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz : their tranquillity and happiness . General Rights . 49 Here it . may be objected again , if this doctrine is true , then the rulers for the time being , will be the sole judges of the truth as well as the tendency of all avowed opinions , and open practices . Consequently if they chance to be in an error , the truth will be kept from the people . The answer is , it is no part of the duty of the government to regulate the consciences of individuals ; but every person ould be left at perfect liberty to form his opinions as he pleases , provided he does not disturb others with them . But , where the people and the government are agreed in the general grounds of their religious faith , it would be very extraordinary , if they had not a perfect right to exclude from their territory , any ipersons , who should disturb the public peace by attempting to introduce a new one . These remarks , however , so far as they respect opinions on religious subjects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , where , on account of the great number of religious opinions , universal toleration is one of the fundamental articles of the constitution or social compact . Nor will they apply to persons , who profess to come as divine ambassadors , provided only they are furnished with those divine credentials , which furnish the only safe criterion , by which uninspired persons , can , in every case . distinguish between enthusiasm , fanaticism , or imposture , and true inspiration . But if , having no other evidence or assistance than other men , they undertake to disturb and revolutionize society , with the visions of their own imaginations or the mere deductions of their own understandings , without any other sanction or authority than enthusiastic reveries , or supported alone by the self-blandishing but fallacious supposition of their own intellectual superiority , and the ignorance and delusion of others , the government , having sujSicient authority from the people for that purpose , will do no more than their duty in gendy sending them out of the country without further molestation . Neither are these remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it were intended to deter them from what they consider their duty , in attempting to spread the divine revelation among the heathen . On the contrary /z/ 50 General Rights . this most benevolent intention , this attempt to comply with or fulQl the divine command , ' Go preach the gospel to all nations , ' can not in the fallible view of our narrow understandings , be too much applauded . Still , they should be careful not to disseminate as divine truths , any mere opinions or inventions of men . If unfortunately they should propagate error , what thanks can they deserve ? Certainly nothing more than the praise of good intentions , accompanied with the discouraging abatement , of having done harm instead of good . In this case , it is obvious , there is ample room for aa apparent conflict of rights and duties . For , the missionary ipay possibly mistake the peculiar tenets of the sect to which be belongs , for the only essential part of divine revelation , and esteem it his duty to spread them even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band , the government of the country may consider those peculiar tenets , as nothing more than pernicious errors , and consider it their duty to put a stop to the dissemination of them . Where a christian missionary goes among the heathen , thus exposing himself to toil , danger , hardships , and privation Jn the service of the great Master of our religion , there can be but one opinion , as to his merit and bis reward . On the other band , can there remain a doubt , that an enlightened christian community niay adopt decisive measures , to prevent the propagation of delusibn , fanaticism , or any doctrines of sufficient plausibility and having a tendency to disturb the public tranquillity , by subverting the true religion in the minds of the weak and defenceless , and introducing in its place , principles productive of confusion and numberless disorders /z/ Suppose , again , an enthusiast should be so zealous as to go to Rome for the purpose of converting the Pope , a case which history informs us has actually happened ; what better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given in the instance alluded to , viz. to be sent to a mad-house ? Might not the Pope very properly answer his exhortation , by saying , * Friend , it appears , that you have come hither , for the purpose of converting me to what you believe to be the true doctrine of the christian religion . Your design , though in General Rigktk , 61 some measure vainglorious , is filled with benevolence ; and if you have any new revelation , of the authenticity of which you can furnish satisfactory proof , I am ready to listen to it with the deepest veneration and humility . But , if you have not , what vanity can actuate you to suppose that I shall substitute your infallibility in the place of that , which is commonly ascribed to my office . * If I am sincere in the profession of thie . Catholic doctrine , can you be so simple as to expect to convert me to your opinions without the advantage of any other revelation , than I have myself , by the superiority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sincere , what occasion is there for your kind offices ? Would you take up arms against a shadow ? * 3 . The right of property . As society is organized for the security of property as well as life , this right remains in full force , and can not be invaded without'the grossest tyranny and oppression . - This right however is not infringed by equal taxes for pubfie purposes , imposed by adequate legitimate authority . A misapplication or misappropriation of funds in the public treasury , however , must be considered as a violation of this right , though it is also a great breach of public trust . Any regulations introduced by law , for the transmission of property by descent , or directing the mode of transferring property on a sale , will be free from exception on this account ; provided that no estate actually vested under a law , is divested . by the operation of a law afterwards enacted . In any case ) where . an individual fails to receive what he had stipulated for , or what otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an omission to comply with . the laws of society , it must be ascribed to his own imprudence or negligence . 4 . Rkt of equality . As men are naturally equal in their rights , there can be no doubt , as has been already remarked , that 116 individual would he Ivilling to join in organizing a society , unless he were put on an equal footing with others , as to all the rights secured to him in the social compact , or constitution of the society . It would obviously be no violation of this principle if , in the constitution itself , it had been d 52 General Rights . stipulated and agreed , that certain classes of persons , which classes should be accessible to allj should have greater powers , or should be exempted from certain public burthens . There is nothing unfair or unequal in this , in reality . Neither would it be a violation of this principle , if a law should be passed , making men liable to certain common burthens for the benefit of society , as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempt them from such burthens , as soon as they arrived at a certain other age , as in the case of military service . Because the law is general in its application , and the difference of condition occasioned by it , is merely temporary . Since every man , however aged , has once been young ; and the young , if they live , will certainly arrive at an age , at which they too will in like manner be exempted . But , it would be a violation of this principle , if the legislature should attempt to alter by law , the requirements of individuals made in the constitution in order to qualify them for the exercise of certain civil rights , either by adding to or taking from them ; or , by imposing new conditions , or removing old ones . And therefore a disqualification of individuals by law , grounded on distinctions not recognized in the constitution , is a violation of this principle . For the same reason , a sacrifice of the interests of particular individuals , or inhabitants of particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , even in favor of the public at large , is a violation o ( this right . But the government is generally considered as having authority to apply private property to public uses , if an adequate compensation is made to the proprietor , especially in cases of great emergency . Where the operation of a law is , to prefer one class of citizens over another , the question , whether the law is to be considered as a violation of the natural right of equality , will depend upon the previous question , whether this effect is one of the principal inducements to pass the law ; in which case it is tyrannical , as emanating from an usurped power ; or , whether , without having such inducement , the principal operation or effect of the law , is to give such a preference ; in which oasei , it is unjust because unequal in its operation , and if c6n  --  - General Rights , 53 tinued after notice of its effects , is also arbitrary and oppressive ; or whether this unequal effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary attendant upon some great public advantage , the obtaining of which , was the sole object which the legislature had in view in the passing of the law ; in which case , it will be no violation of private right . But , as one class of citizens ought not to be sacrificed for the l ) enefit of another , or , even of the public , the latter , out of the great advantage which they derive from the law , ought to make satisfactory compensation to those persons , who are sufferers by its enactment ; the Joss to be ascertained by impartial appraisers or assessors . If the public are not willing to make this compensation , the wrong to the property of the suffering class or individuals , is neither more nor less than a robbery under pretence of law . But , if the public cannbt afford , out of the benefit which they derive from the passage of such law , to make such compensation , it is conclusive proof , that the law is inexpedient as well as unjust ; since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal operation of a law is to give a preference to one class of citizens over another , this is not a case for compensation ; but is a direct violation of the right of equality , to be waived by the injured class alone . As soon as this effedt is ascertained , therefore , the law should be immediately repealed . 5 . The right of freely discussing public measures , SfC . Another right , which , it must necessarily be presumed , the people mean to reserve to themselves in every free elective government , is that of discussing the qualifications and characters of all candidates for public offices , who consent to stand for them , as well as the character , conduct , and general measures of all public officers . This subject will be considered more at large in Part II . Chapters 1 and 2 . But in governments so framed , that misconduct in the chief ruler or magistrate , does not by their constitutions , involve his disqualification for office , or his removal from ii , whether it be elective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , for each citizen to have a right to comment hiarshly upon him , foifttfae purpose of bringing him into hatred /z/ 64 General Rights . or contempt with the people ; since it could have but little tendency to correct public grievances , but might lead to public disorders and disturbances , and thus , instead of removing evils , might aggravate some and occasion others . For , it would be impossible to prevent the right of animadversion on the conduct of a bad prince , from being perverted to an unjust vituperation of the character and conduct of an eixcellent one . On the contrary , is it not very possible , that under a good prince , there might be thousands of factious demagogues , who , under the pretence of patriotism , the public good , and freedom and the rights of man , and other topics of popular declamation , might asperse and vilify their rulers ; while under a cruel and merciless tyrant , whose public life was a disgrace to human nature , and whose administration of public affairs , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from fear would have remained in perfect silence and perhaps have been most conspicuous for abject sycophancy and fawning servility ? Under all arbitrary governments , therefore , seditious speeches and writings are considered but little short of treason , to which they direcdy tend . 6 . The right of petition and remonstrance . Another right retained by the people in all free governments , and which it is believed , is seldom denied under the most arbitrary and tyran nical , is that of representing to the government any particular ' Such conduct is perfectly natural , when it is considered , that demagogues and false patriots are actuated by the same motives , as the courtiers and flatterers of kings . For , it is to power wherever placed , that each class equally bows . In monarchies , they are induced to pay court to the opinions and wishes of the king , if they would rise to employment in the state With the same object in view , in democracies , they suffer neither honor , conscience , truth , justice , decency , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices , or selfish interests . With ouch , the voice of the people , right or wron is the voice of God ; and whatever is unpopular is unpardonable . If they have sagacity enough to foresee in what direction the majority of the people will incline , it is there such persons will always be Ibund , justifying or recommending in advance , measures which the people would blush to commit individually , as private citizens ; and , instead of using the information which a superior education has given them , in endeavoring to remove popular errors , mistakes and prejudices , and settling the public opinion on true principles of* religion . Justice and morality , prostituting dieir silperior advantages and influence , in confirming such errors , opinions and prejudices , rather than incur the risk of the displeasure of the people , by attempting to set them right /z/ General Rights , S5 evil or grievance , which the petitioner sufiers from any Iw or other public measures , and requesting its removal , or that suitable compensation be made him for the damage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be considered any infringement of this right , that the petition should be made in decent and respectful terms , however contrary it may seem to the opinions of those persons , who from a mistaken idea of the true principles of democracy , think there can be no freedom , where the private citizens may not affront and insult with impunity their superiors in office . 7 . The right to reform the government . On this critical aind dangerous subject , it seems difficult to establish any certain principles of general application , which will not be liable to be abused and misapplied , and which consequently may not mvolve in their operation , if injudiciously carried into practice , the most lamentable and disastrous results . A profound historian indulging in some reflections upon the American Revolution , makes the following observations . To overset an established government , unhinges many of those principles which bind individuals to each others #@# A ' long time and much prudence , will be necessary to reproduce a spirit of freedom , without which , society is a rope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers , when invading their liberties , forms the comer stone of American Republics . This principle , though just in itself , is not favorable to the tranquillity of pres ' - ent establishments . The maxims and measures , which in the years 1774 and 1775 , were successfully inculcated and adopted by American patriots , for oversetting the established government , will answer a similar purpose , when recurrence is had to them by factious demagogues for disturbing the freest governments that were ever devised . ' It should not be overlooked , though it may seem to imply a contradiction in terms , that the strict enforcement or asser tion of our most perfect rights , under peculiar circumstances may sometimes constitute a crying sin , as being a violation of some duty , which though of the strongest obligation in a religious and mcral point of view , is usually called or defined a duty of imperfect obligation j because those persons who are the objects of it , have no right themselves to compel its pei i 56 General Rigkti. formance . This is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and towards individuals ; and is equally so in relation to our civil and political rights in a state of society , and towards the public . But , io the latter case , the consequences may be infinitely more disastrous , and wholly remediless . The following remarks are to be taken , subject to this qualification . No government can have any legitimate foundation but in the good of the people ; for , the people were not made to be governed for the interest or pleasure of the rulers ; but rulers were set up and established to protect the people , and direct them by salutary laws and regulations , in the pursuit of their welfare and true interests . Where the people have good sense , and the virtues of self-denial , and the love of justice , as a nation , so as to know how to redress their wrongs on other nations , if any should be offered , and so as to be contented to do without , what they can not gain without wrong to others , tbey have no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view , originate with themselves But , if they have not this good sense and these virtues , they will soon fall a prey to usurpation , as a punishment for their folly and injustice . What nations have , and what nations have not , this intelligence and these virtues to a sufficient extent , may be conjectured , but can only be certainly determined by experience . To think so , and to be able to do it , are different things . To overthrow a monarchy is one thing ; to establish a permanent , free , popular government is another . The characteristic qualities of a people , which may lead them to the former , are not of themselves sufficient to enable them to effect the latter . The form of general government established by American sages , though most admirable , is not perfect ; and will stand no longer than while a portion of the same wisdom , patriotism and disinterestedness , which actuated them , shall continue to animate the public councils . Governments were established at first , in days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , crafty and bold , reduced the weak , timorous , simple and defenceless to a state of subjection . The latter , in this way , became slaves to the former , in the first instance ; and afterwards , by a grad- General Rights . 57 ual melioration oj their condition became subjects , while the companions of the leader or conqueror , became nobles . This however was not always the , case . For , in some instances , it is probable , where the weak were not immediately overrun in the first invasion , they were . able by uniting and forming themselves into an organized society , adopting an exact military discipline , and inventing armour as well as improved weapons of offence , as shields , darts and swords , to prevail over those , who , relying merely on their gigantic stature and resistless bodily strength , had never felt the necessity , and consequently had never thought of any such expedients , but at best , had never made use of any weapons more effective than the stone , the stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it was in this way , that Chedorlaomer , the first conqueror on record , aubdued the various tribes of giants , enumerated in the holy scriptures . For , he had no divine assistance , and no mention is made of the superior stature of his soldiers or subjects . But they dwelt in cities , and must therefore have made some considerable advances in civilization and the necessary arts . But the nations or tribes whom he conquered , it is apparent , lived in a savage state ; and were most of them conspicuous for their lofty stature ; viz. the Emims , who are compared to the sons of Anak , of whom it was said , * Who can stand before the Anakims , ' the Rephaims , or giants , of whom it is said in the scriptures Og , the King of Bashan , was the last survivor , and whose stature , according to the scripture account , could not have been far from fifteen English feet ; the Horims , who dwelt in caves and holes in the ground on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were literally Troglodjftes . These giants were in a great measure destroyed by Chedorlaomer , and it is most probable without any miraculous aid , by superior weapons , and military skill alone . But , when other nations of gigantic men succeeded , such as the Anakims and the Amorites , who were acquainted with warlike implements and defensive armour , and subject to military discipline , it was impossible for the Israelites to conquer them without divine assistance , and the three sons of Anak , who struck terror into the hearts of the Israeliiish spies , with the exception of Caleb and Joshua , it is probable fron the same ac- /z/ 58 General Rights . count , were not cut off , until they were upwards of fourscore years of age ; ther being no evidence that , under the divine economy , the ordinary course of nature is ever disturbed by a miracle without necessity . In later times , governments are chiefly grounded in the first instance on conquest or usurpation . For we see in history , Kings are dethroned and are succeeded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay or dissension , or corruption , and are annexed to the empire of the conqueror ; monarchies are subverted and succeeded by anarchy and confusion , until the turbulent authors are cut ofi one chief being left to trample on the people 's liberties and reduce them to a more abject state than they suffered before . In a few instances , the people have rescued themselves from oppression , and have established a mild and free government . Legitimate governments may be of any form whatever , whether a monarchy , an aristocracy , a democracy , or a combination of these . Where they are not established by divine appointment , they must be grounded , according to natural right , in the will of the people , express or tacit . A people , therefore , it is evident , without any government , when organizing a political society and forming a nation , may adopt any form of government which they think expedient , whether monarchy , aristocracy , democracy , or a republic . Whatever form they adopt , . is a legitimate government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of right to attempt to subvert it , or to excite the people to do so . Yet individuals who are dissatisfied , have a right to consult their happiness and leave the country ; but so long as they reside within it , they are bound to obey the laws . But , if the rulers should abuse their legitimate authority , and oppress the people by acts of tyranny and cruelty , the people , after petitioning for redress of grievances in vam , if unanimous , ( otherwise not , ) will have a natural right to remove their rulers , choose others in their room and reform the government , and adopt a new constitution if they see fit . A bare majority of the people , however , has no such right . This extreme right , on account of the terrible usually attending its exercise , notwithstanding the most tyran* General Rights . 59 nical and unjustifiable conduct in the rulers , in most cases it would be very wrong , indeed a great sin , to put in force . For , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which almost invariably attend them . The risK of violating many duties , which , though of imperfect obligation , can not be disregarded without incurring a degree 6i guilt and responsibility , proportional to the calamitous consequences which must necessarily follow , roust therefore make every reasonable and conscientious person pause and deliberate long , before he arms himself against his rulers ; and it is very probable , that it is in part for such reasons , that we christians are commanded to submit to the powers that be . ' But , in fact , the people are seldom or never unanimous for a change of their government , even when it is of the most arbitrary form , and their rulers are tyrants . Where they appear to be so , ( and especially if the administration is mild , and the people do not stand in awe of it , ) it is owing to the dread and fear which the orderly citizens entertain of the threats , outrages and massacres of revolutionistSv and anarchists , which are greater than the respect or regard , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer capable of pro ' tecting either them or itself . Many of these citizens , therefore , in such cases , through mere apprehension , side with the unprincipled and disorderly , in order to escape their violence , ( though being suspected , on account of the previous respectability of their characters , their hypocrisy is not always successful in this respect , ) when they would prefer to submit to the measured oppressions of any regular government , rather than be exposed to the capricious and illimitable envy and malignity of Ignoble and unprincipled disorganizers . Ther  - -  is seldom , therefore , an occasion where such right cqn be said to exist at all ; and it would be a rare case indeed , that would render the exercise of it perfectly justifiable . In the original formation of a government established by the people , it is their consent which renders it legitimate . But , though the government should commence unjustly , as by conquest or usurpation , yet , if the people afterwards acquiesce in it , no succeeding generation has any greater right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free consent ot 60 General Rights . the people in the first instance . For , the generation which acquiesces have the same right to adopt the government under which they live , that a people without a government , have to form and establish one . The voluntary acquiescence of the former , is equal in its effects to the free choice of the latter . The contrary supposition would be attended with many inconveniences , if not absurdities . For , suppose a democracy is established by the free choice of the people , what sanction has this government , after the generation has passed away , which first established it ? Certainly none but the tacit acquiescence of the people which succeed . In any such case , can we suppose that a political leader has a right to endeavor to persuade the people that their rulers oppress them , and , in this way , induce them to resist , throw off , or dissolve the government ? For , without dwelling upon the probable consequences , mobs , riots , insurrections , rebellions , civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overthrow of a settled government is invariably attended ; and the anarchy and confusion , and suspension of the distribution of justice , which immediately follow ; and the establishment of a military despotism , which would in all probability be the termination , and the only effectual one , of these horrors ; whence could a demagogue derive this right ? . Can such a pretence owe its origin to any other source , than an abuse of the great liberty which is permitted in a democracy ; but which In a stronger government , would well be considered as a crime of the greatest magnitude and atrocity , tmd which would immediately be punished as it deserved ; or rather would rarely show itself , having no hopes of escaping punishment in case of a failure in the attempt . For , the confident expectation of escaping with impunity , is the chief origin of the fervid and inflammatory declamation against imaginary political ovils and abuses , in the pretended patriot and lover of the people , as well as of the lawless violence of an ignorant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the exercise of , what they affect to believe , some of the rights of man . When in the first formation of a constitution , a mode of amending the frame of government is pointed out in that instrument or political xiompact , all amendments and reforms made General Rights . 61 in the mode prescribed , though not unanimously agreed on , are doubtless as valid and binding , as if they constituted a part of the original compact , to which all the people had unanimously assented in the first instance . And here it will make no difference , whether agreeably to such mode of amendment , the alterations in the constitution are to be made by the rulers themselves , or by the people convened in their primary assemblies . But , as the majority have no natural right to frame a government in the first instance , which shall bind the minority who dissent , though the minority may silently ratify it by their peaceable acquiescence , if they see fit ; it follows that a , mere majority have no right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may do so . in the mode prescribed for that purpose in the constitution itself . It seems to follow , therefore , that though the people , if unanimous , have a right to change their form of government , even vvhere there is no provision for any such alteration in their constitution ; yet , the rulers may justly enact laws to punish with exemplary severity , any persons who should attempt to excite the people to make radical changes in the government , or to remove , in an irregular and disorderly manner , those who preside over the administration of public affairs . This authority naturally results to the rulers , from the general power which is bestowed on them , either expressly or by implication , to provide for the public safety and welfare ; and the exercise of it is justified , not only by the bad motives which usually actuate innovators , such as disappointed avarice , or ambition , envy , vanity , and a desire of self-aggrandizement ; but , because of the infinite evils which attend an attempt to overthrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or factions , as they invariably are on such occasions . Farther ; if it were permitted to individuals to excite the people to overthrow their government , or change it in an irregular manner under the plausible pretext of reforrti , then nothing could ever remain sacred or established among mankind . It can make no essential difference , whsit the form of government may be , which it is desired to overthrow . Yet , it is certain , that where the form and administration of the government , is most arbitrary and despotic , and consequently 62 General Rights , where there will be the most just ground of complaint , there will be less of it made , through fear . On the contrary , where the government is most free , and there is consequently less danger of punishment for seditious or treasonable practices , unprincipled demagogues , from a desire of becoming popular , will pretend public abuses where none exist , and exaggerate those which do . Not but that there are tyrannical abuses of authority in democracies and republics , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excite less apprehension and alarm in popular governments ; because in them the power , however it may be abused , is supposed to be limited , and the evil consequences of such abuse , are definite and circumscribed* But in monarchies , where the political power exercised by the ruler is either arbitrary , or , at least very great , the abuse of it excites alarm ; because the extent of the abuse , or of the evils that may be occasioned by it , can not be either distinctly perceived or foreseen , or precisely ascertained . It is for this reason , that , under the government of an arbitrary tyrant , there is no one but must entertain apprehensions for his own personal safety . Yet , for the most part , timid and conscientious persons , are desirous of a strong , though not of an arbitrary government . Because , from its very structure , a strong government is most likely to be permanent , and they consequently feel a greater confidence that they shall be protected from the innovations , abuses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the unprincipled , dissolute and flagitious , always desire a weak government , in order that they may be at liberty to practise wickedness with the greater hope of impunity . Where the form of government is strong and eflTective , the just and peaceable therefore , enjoy the highest degree of that rational liberty which consists in the security of their persons and property , and the quiet and undisturbed exercise of all their civil and political rights , free from the molestation of the turbulent and licentious . On the other hand , where the form of govemmept is weak and tottering , and the rulers , from a desire of popularity , neglect a discharge of their duty , and are consequently timeserving and inefficient , the turbulent and unjust 6njoy the highest degree of freedom and impunity in General Rights . 63 their insoleDt practices of fraud , violence and imposition upon those , who hve Dot the power to protect themselves , and , whom , the rulers through an apprehension of a loss of popularity , are base enough to leave unprotected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they find their freedom to commit wrongs with impunity , is restrained by them . They therefore make an outcry for liberty , and for a repeal of such laws . But laws to prevent wrong nd injustice do not deprive well disposed persons of any freedom ; because they would do no wrong and comnrit no crime , if there were no law against them . They therefore are in favor of such laws , to protect society and themselves against tho lovers of such liberty . And as the good , who alone may safely be entrusted with such freedom , i. . a state of exemption from such laws , never complain for want of it ; so , those who do complain , are the very persons in whom such confidence can not be placed . Lastly ; though it can not be doubted , that where all the people are unanimous , they have a natural right to alter their government , whether any provision for such alteration is made in their constitution or not , because the government is intended for their benefit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible tyranny , cruelty and oppression might be continued from generation to generation , unless there were some miraculous interposition of providence ; still the wise and prudent will be very cautious how they engage in any such enterprises ; some of which , seem to have been signally marked with the divine displeasure . The reader will readily recollect that the same nation , which dethroned and beheaded Charles I , a legitimate monarch , under pretence that he had made use of an unwarrantable stretch of his regal authority , which however was not well defined , was compelled to submit to a bloody usurper and ruthless tyrant , who died peaceably in his bed . And here the sturdy republicans of parliament , who had deprived the nobles of their constitutional authority , and who made it almost a matter of conscience to withhold due reverence and respect from their lawful sovereign , were compelled by Cromwell both a republican and a fanatic , and as bloody and ferocious as themselves , but far superior to them in ability and decision of 64 General Rights , character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , after all , were thrust out of parliament by him with the utmost scorn and contempt . What massacres followed the decapitation of the mild and benevolent Louis XVI ? What a succession of demons afterwards controlled the public affairs of France , who , deluding the infatuated people with the ceaseless , false and senseless outcry and jargon of liberty , equality , the rights of man , tyranny , priestcraft , aristocrat , democrat , citizen and patriot , never hesitated to violate every precept of religion , every moral duty , and every feeling of humanity , and carried their extravagance to the height of the most blasphemous impiety . Were the horrors , which thus succeeded to the overthrow of this established government , a judgment from heaven , or were they merely the natural consequences , which may always be expected to flow from the prevalence of anarchy , atheism , and unbounded licentiousness ? Certainly , no tyranny can occasion such evils , as an intoxication of the intellect , arising from an influx of false principles on the subject of religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before they join in any attempt to overthrow / ) r revolutionize their government , under any pretext whatever . It is true the people may be unanimous in subverting their government , and yet afterwards , they may not be able to agree in forming a new one , and , if so , they will be in a much worse condition , than they were in , under that which they have rejected ; because , to destroy is not the same as to reform . Will it not be worse than living under any regular government , to remain in a state of anarchy and confusion , until the different parties and factions , are reduced by battles , massacres and assassinations , under one ; and another government is established by force or fraud , ten times more arbitrary and despotic than that which they have been induced to overturn ?

Oemrai Rigkti. 65 /z/ Cf the Social Compact of the Citizens of the different States in the American Union , in the formation of the General Con* . stituiion , taken in connexion with the real or supposed com pact of the citizens of each State , in the formation of its own Constitution or State Government . In order to form distinct ideas on the subject of the present chapter , it will be necessary to consider the situation of the thirteen states which first adopted the general constitution , immediately previous to that important transaction . From the year A. D. 1776 , when Congress declared the colonies free and independent states , the war with Great Britain was carried on under articles of confederation , the powers codferred on the Provincial Congress , by which , may be considered as constitutmg the first general government of these territories or provinces . The project of a union , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years previous , by commissioners appointed by the colonies , at the call of the crown . These commissioners met at Albany , in July , 1754 , and as among them , were found such discordant materials , as Governor Hutchinson , Grovemor Pownall , and Dr Franklin , entertaining political opinions so very different ,  --  it might be a matter of curiosity to exambe thoroughly a plan of government which is principally ascribed to Dr Franklin , and to which , it appears , the others agreed . It must suffice however , to observe , that the general government was to unite the colonies of Massachusetts Bay , New Hampshire , Connecticut , Rhode Island , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina and South Carolina , and be administered by a President General , to be appointed by the crown y and a grand council , to be chosen by the representative of the people of the several colonies , met in their respective assemblies . The assent of the President , who constituted the /z/ 66 General Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand council ; the members of which were to be chosen every three years . The general government was to have power to make treaties with the Indians , &c.; ; raise and pay soldiers , and equip vessels , &c.; ; to make laws , to lay and levy general duties , imposts and taxes . Each colony was to retain its own constitution , except so far as it might be altered by the act of parliament which should establish the general constitution ; that is , so far as they were inconsistent with the general constitution . Any colony however , was to be at liberty to defend itself on sudden emergencies . This project , though agreed to by Pownall and Hutchinson , was rejected in England . To return ; the government established by the articles of confederation , though it carried the country through the arduous conflict with so powerful a country as Great Britain , yet would hardly have been sufficient to do so , if the sense of common danger , as well as an enthusiastic ardor in pursuit of what they esteemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . These powerful motives supplied what was wanting through the inefficiency of this system , and without their aid , the struggle for independence would have been weak and unsuccessful . But the hurry of arms , and the uncertainty of the final result of the conflict , rendered it impassible , while the suspense lasted , to remedy the evils and defects of this system of confederation , though they were most sensibly felt ; since Congress were not able to bring into the field , or to sustain while there , so much of the strength of the country , as its extreme exigencies frequently required . The desperate struggle might not have been of so long continuance , if the provincial congress had been able to enforce its requisitions , instead of being obliged to rely on the provinces or states , for that purpose . After the termination of the war , which was brout to a successful close in 1783 , by a treaty with Great Britain , acknowledging the independence of the United States , and the bond which connected them with that country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature , and consequently were at liberty to assume whatever relations towards each other , they thought expedient , or could agree upon . It is General Rightt , 67 true , they were at that time associated or allied together by the articles of confederation , and whatever duties or obliga*-tions they had assumed upon themselves by virtue of those articles , were still binding . Yet , as those articles were generally admitted to be insufficient for the purposes for which they were adopted , and it was proposed , if practicable , to frame a govemment less liable to this objection , the articles of confederation may be wholly overlooked , so far as the subject of this chapter is concerned . The relation which the several states had to each other at that time , being thus settled , it remains to consider , what relation the citizens of each state had to their own state governments and towards each other , when the federal constitution was adopted . This is sufficiently evident . Because , as soon as the connexion of the provinces or states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty of 1783 , acknowledging their independence , the authority of the several state governments , over their respective citizens , was either the result of an express compact by the people of each state for the formation of a state government ; or , without any such express compact , derived its sanction , in part , from long previous usage under the colonial or provincial government ; and , as to the restj though in some few instances it might seem to be founded on a temporary assumption of power , arising from the extreme urgency of the case , yet was immediately ratified by the approbation of the people , or sanctioned by their peaceable and ready acquiescence. of For , the stte constitutions were adopted by the people of the respective states at difierr ent periods of time . Some , while the revolution was going on ; ome after the termination of the war ; and some but lately . Some of these , therefore , must be considered as being governed , from the time of the declaration of independence to the formation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by rulers chosen under a temporary government , grounded merely on a supposed or implied compact , to conform to the usages adopted while under the colonial government , as far as was consistent with the change of condition and circumstances ; because the colonial government was dissolved , and yet no other had been expressly agreed . 68 General RighU. upon ; and the colonial government being abolished , there remained no authority for any other , except such as must be inferred from the acquiescence of the people . If , at this critical time , therefore , any acts should appear to be done by the rulers , beyond their express authority , in order to insure the public safety merely ; yet the urgency of the occasion , the danger of delay in order to obtain the express concurrence of the people , and the fair intentions of the rulers , seem to furnish a sufficient excuse . For , it can not be doubted , that in cases of extremity , where there is not time to wait for express instructions , the rulers having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they think necessary to preserve the citizens , though such acts are not strictly within the scope of any powers expressly delegated to them , will do well to assume this responsibility . And though such acts , if performed by the rulers from motives of personal aggrandizement , or other considerations merely selfish , would have deserved the severest censure and animadversion , as consisUng in a tyrannical usurpation of power ; yet , when actuated by a regard for the general welfare alone , the rulers have resorted to them from a want of any other safe resource , they become highly praiseworthy . It is true , if such acts are thought inexpedient by the people , and as so are rejected by them , they will not be binding upon any one ; yet , until so rejected , they may be considered as sanctioned by the tacit acquiescence of the citizens ; and if they are adopted or expressly approved of by the people , they become as efifectual as if authorized by them in the first instance . By a reference to the state constitudons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegated in them by the people of each state , vary in extent and duration ; yet they are all republican in their form , consisting of a legislative body , variously divided , an executive or chief magistrate , and a judiciary . These for the most part are independent of each other ; and , with the exception of the judiciary , depend on popular suffrage for their offices . In some states , however , the judges also are elected by the people . It does not , however , come within the limits of this work to enter into any particular detail , as to the forms of the various General Rights . 09 state goveraments . For full iDformation in relation to them , reference must be made to tbe collections of the laws of each state , and to its history from the time of the commencement of hostilities in the American revolution , down to the time when such constitutions were respectively adopted . From the view of the subject that has just been taken , however concisely and imperfectly , it sufficiently appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal constitution , the people of the several states were living under legitimate state governments , independent of each other , and having no further connexion with each other , than by means of the articles of confederation ; and , consequently , that if those articles had been abolished , without the substitution of the present constitution or some other , the states would have been as entirely free from all dependence upon each other , as the kingdoms of France and England are at this moment . When the constitution therefore , was submitted to the different states for then : consideration , to be adopted by them if they thought expedient , each state , being thus wholly independent of the rest , considered itself , and was considered by all the others , and without doubt very justly , at perfect liberty either to accept or to reject it at discretion , and this without any obligation to take into view any thing beyond its own interests . The circumstance that a majority of the states were in favor of its adoption , bad no operation whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  ach state had then a natural right to act for itself , without being justly subject to the control of any other state or nation . If the two states of the thirteen . North Carolina and Rhode Island , had thought best not to join the Union , they would have remained in a state of nature in relation to the others , that is , with all the rights and liberties of an independent tribe or distinct people , and would neither have been bound by its laws , nor could justly have been compelled to submit to its power . V During the war , the articles of confederation , as has been suggested already , were found defective in many respects ; especially , because under them , the congress could neither raise men nor money of themselves ; they could not adopt any general measures for the public safety , unless the states were 70 General Rights . unanimous ; and could do but little more than recommend measures to the different states , which their legislatures adopted , enforced , rejected , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war , the confederation had no power whatever to provide for the payment of the national debt ; foreign nations hesitated to enter into treaties with the states , because under the articles of confederation . Congress had no power to enforce a compliance with it by the several states . Another defect was that thirteen distinct judiciaries had a constitutional right to decide on the same subject . And generally , as observed by a distinguished historian and biographer , it was found impossible for a government to answer the purposes for which it was established , while the enforcement of its decrees or acts , depended on the discretion of other parties . Further ; the unsettled state of public affairs after the treaty of 1783 ; the want of subordination of the people 10 their respective state governments ; the want of good faith in some of the state governments ; and the consequent want of some sufficient tribunal to compel its observance ; and the little regard paid by some of the state governments , to the most earnest recommendations of Congress ; rendered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that established by the articles of confederation . On account of these defects , as well as many others , it was thought advisable to amend these articles , so as to remove as far as possible , all the evils arising from them . A motion was made accordingly by Mr Madison , the late president , for a proposition to all the other states to meet in convention , and digest a form of government adequate to the exigencies of the Union . It was not intended however , at this time by Congress , to introduce an entirely new system , but merely to amend that of the confederation . For the delegates to the convention were appointed , * for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation and reporting to Congress alterations therein . ' The defects of that system however were considered incurable , and the convention , though perhaps in strictness it did not come within the terms of their commission , made a draught of the present constitution , with the exception of the General Rights , 71 amendments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizens of the United Slates for adoption : This constitution being afterwards ratified and adopted by all the states , all objections on account of the previous informality just alluded to , are wholly removed by the voice and sanction of the people . It was at first adopted by eleven of the states only out of thirteen , and North Carolina and Rhode Island afterwards acceded to it . The present constitution of the United States is therefore a social compact made by the inhabitants of certain territories , which , previously to its adoption , had local governments established within them , organized with powers , which acknowledged no superior , as long as they did not overstep the limits set to them either ex:pressly or tacitly in the respective state constitutions . But , in the adoption of the general constitution , the supremacy of the state governments , as well as the independence of the states was limited in the same degree precisely , as they became bound by their own voluntary act , to obey all laws made by virtue of the general constitution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it by the people of the United States being taken from the state governments , if it had ever been conferred on them , was bestowed on the general government ; or if otherwise , was directly granted by the people to the general government . This is apparent , because the general constitution was made or agreed to , by the people of the thirteen states , the people of each state then constituting a distinct independent tribe or nation , and each tribe or nation acting in its original capacity , as one of the elements of this compact , and exercising those natural rights which belonged to each as an independent tribe or nation before this genera compact was made in the constitution of the United States . It would seem to be a great mistake , to suppose that this general constitution was made by the state governments , on behalf of the independent nations under their government ; for , they had no authority from the people of their respective states to do any such act : On the contrary , special delegates were chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express purpose of deliberating upon , and , if they thought fit , of adopting the constitution proposed . The ordinary repre 78 Oeneral RighU. sentatives of the people elected to serve m the state goyemments , were not intrusted with the management of this importapt transaction , but recourse in each state was had to the highest known abilities and integrity , which it was supposed might be drawn forth on this occasion , however averse to aim at making a figure in legislative assemblies . It may be objected , that agreeably to the preamble to the con  - -  stitution of the United States , the constitution is to be considered as adopted by the people of all the states , acting as the elements of a single nation , without any reference to the state governments , or to the fact that they were members of independent organized societies already existing . But the preamble , on the supposition that this is its true construction , merely shows the light in which the people agreed to be viewed in the adoption of the constitution . Their agreement however can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the true one , seems to result from the following considerations . 1 . If the people of the United States had intended to adopt a constitution , in their collective capacity as one great nation , without any reference to territorial or state governments , or to the independence of each individual state , there should have been no calling of separate state conventions for the adoption of the constitution , but delegates should have been chosen from all the states to one general convention , for the purpose of deliberating upon and adopting and ratifying it . But , in fact , after the constitution was approved of by the convention , whose whole authority in strictness was confined to revising the articles of confederation and proposing alterations in them , the ratification of the constitution was given by delegates chosen by the several states for the purpose of deliberating upon , and , if they saw fit , of adopting and ratifying it . The L constitution therefore was adopted by the citizens of the seve* ral states , acting as distinct nations , the ratification being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state conventions . 2 . If the constitution were instantaneously abolished , the union would be resolved , not into one nation in a state of anarchy as to national supremacy , but into the several nations inhabiting the territory of the respective states , and under in- General Rights . 73 dependent and supreme heads ; for , all those powers which are taken from the state governments expressly by the constitution , or tacitly by the mere act of adopting it , if the constitution should be abolished , will , without any further act immediately revive to the slate governments respectively . 3 . The compact made in the general constitution , may be rescinded by the people in the same manner which was adopted in the making and ratification of it , t. e. the same majority of all the states acting as nations , may rescind it . The states or nations , acting politically , are therefore the elements of the general compact , and not the individuals of all the states , acting as the elements of one great nation . 4 . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th &_^onstitution,; even if every state legislature in the United States were unanimously in favor of rejecting it , yet , it is only because the people of the respective states have never entrusted them with any such power . Yet , it is apparent , if the people in each of the states should give the power to decide on this momentous subject , to delegates chosen by them to meet in their respective state conventions , those delegates might dissolve the union . 5 . If the constitution was framed and adopted by the people of all the states , acting as members of one great nation , then this absurdity would follow , that if there had been a majority in any individual state against adopting the constitution , still that state must have come in , because the majority of the people of the United States were in favor of adopting it . This shows conclusively that , however the people were willing to h ; ive the constitution viewed after its adoption , they in fact acted as independent nations in adopting it .

In ving a constructbn to the consdtution , it should be re-membered , 1 .

That the government of the United States can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the constitution , either expressly or by necessary implication . 3 . That the words of the constitution are to be taken in their natural sense , without restriction or enlargement . 4 . That , where the constitution contemplates and authorizes a certain object to be efiected , all proper means , not expressly prohibited by the constitution , may be adopted to effect that object . 5 . That , though the powers delegated by the constitution are limited in extent , yet they are supreme within their limits , in the exercise of them . That , consequently , 6 .

On the powers of Congress . ' - Congress derives its existence and all its powers from the constitution . An act of congress , therefore , made contrary to any express restriction of the constitution , is absolutely void . 3 Dal . 399 . And , for the same reason , an act of congress , in enacting which there is an attempt to exercise powers , which are not given in the constitution , will be void . See 1 Cranch. 176 . Because the constitution is the only authority which they have , and beyond which they ought not to go . To prevent all doubts which might otherwise arise on this subject , it is declared in article tenth of the amendments to the constitution , that , ' the powers , not delegated to the United States , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . ' But a law may be void in part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other respects . See 3 Wash . 313 . Yet it is not considered necessary , that a power should be given in express terms , if it can be made out by necessary implication from an authority which is expressly granted . See 1 Wheat . 304 , 330. 4 Wheat . 316 . And this is in conformity with what is familiarly called the sweeping clause in the constitution , viz. : Art . 1 , sec. 8 , by which congress are empowered ' to make all laws , which shall be necessary , and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , ( that is , the powers previously enumerated in the constitution ) and all powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or ofBce thereof .

And for the same reason , where the end is within the intent of the constitution , all means which are plainly adapted to that end , and are not prohibited , may constitutionally be employed to that effect . See 4 Wheat . 316 . In any such case , if the means are appropriate , bow far they are necessary for that purpose , utider the * sweeping clause , ' is a question for the decision of congress , and not for the supreme court of the United States . Ibid . It was therefore decided hat congress has power to incorporate a bank . Ibid . Further ; in construing the extent of the powers created by the constitution , it is held , that there is no other rule , than to consider its language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connexion with the purposes for which they were conferred . See 9 Wheat . 188 . The reason assigned is , that the framers of the constitution must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense , and to have intended what they have said . By article VI . of the constitution , treaties made agreeably to it , are also the supreme law of the land . It is obvious , however , that a treaty made contrary to the constitution will be void ; because it would be absurd , if the treaty making power , which derives all ' its authority from the constitution , could contravene the constitution itself . For the same reason , if a treaty were made , containing stipulations , or concessions , which the president and senate under the constitution , have no authority to make , it would be void ; for instance , if they should attempt to cede part of the acknowledged territory of a state , without the consent of the people of that state in regular convention , it must be void , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed , that the consent of- the legislature of such state would not avail in any such case , unless specially authorized by the people to act on their behalf , in relation to this subject f because no such authority is conferred by their state constitution . A treaty made subsequently to an act of congress , and in* 93 Gmerai Rights , compatible with any of its provisions would so far operate as a repeal of the act . The reason is , that the treaty making pow* er is established by the constitution , and is supreme within its department ; provided , only that it is not inconsistent with the constitution , nor requires the exercise of any power not granted in it . On the other hand , if an act of congress were enacted after a treaty , and inconsistent with it , though in any other respect not inconsistent with the constitution , though the inconsistency aoKDunted to an intentional violation of the treaty ; yet there does not appear r to be any sufficient foundation for an exception to the validity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violation of the treaty might lead to a war ; but it should be recollected , that congress has the power of declaring war , which is a far more decisive measure than infringing an article in a treaty . It is probable the courts would be gov erned in their construction of the law , in any such case , by the apparent intention of congress , whether the object was avowedly to infringe a treaty or not . It is not within the limits of this work to examine minutely the precise extent of ppwer probably intended to be bestowed on congress , in the enumeration of powers contained in section 8 , of Article 1 of the constitution , some of which would singly require a volume for that purpose . It is the less necessary , because the concise expressions made use of in the constitu* tion , to define these powers , are sufficiently clear for ordinary occasions , and professional gentlemen will be obliged of course to resort to the different series of original reports , the index aone to each of whichj makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks on some of them must suffice . Under section 8 of the constitution , congress is authorized to lay and collect taxes , &c.; ; but they must be uniform throughout the United States . A restriction is laid upon this general power , in section 6 , #@# that no capitation or direct tax shall be laid , unlessv in proportion to the census , &c.; It seems , agreeably to the construction , that has been given to this clause in section 9 , that the only taxes which it is necessary to apportion among the states , whenever congress shall see fit to lay them , are the land tax and the poll tax , no others being considered as direct taxes , within the intent of the Gemral RighU , 99 coDStttutioQ ; and , consequeotly , all other taxes which congress may impose , agreeably to the constitution , must be laid uniformly . See 3 Dal . 171 . This power to tax is co*extensive with the territory of the United States , and congress has no power to exempt any state from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheat* /z/ However , it is Jxeld , that congress is not bound to extend a direct tax to the District of Columbia , or to the territories though they may do so at discretion . See ibid . A question may here be raised , whether , under the first clause of section 8 , just referred to , congress has any right to impose taxes , except for the purpose of raising a revenue* The whole clause reads thus : ' The congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts , and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States : but all duties , imposts , and ex* cises , shall be uniform throughout the United States . ' In order to discover the true interpretation of this clause , it may afford some assistance , so far as the present question is concerned , to take it in connexion with the two next , which authorize congress ' to borrow money on the credit of the Uniteid States , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several states , and with the Indian tribes . ' In the construction of the . first clause alone , a question may be raised , whether that part of the clause to pay the debts , and provide for the common defence and general welfare , ' is to be taken as a distinct authority from that of laying taxes , , or , whether it is to be taken as expressing the purposes for which alone congress have the power of taxation . If the fof- mer construction were the true one , then congress would have an unlimited discretionary poWer of taxation . This power however , it is believed , the states in adopting the consUtutiout never intended to confer on congress . It will be recollected that , at the close of the war of the revolution , which was a long and severe struggle , and during which , the country had suffered much from the inefficiency of the articles of confederation , the states were oppressed with a heavy public debt which congress , under the confederatioPi was wholly incapa- i 94 General Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard for the safe* tj of the states , in case of another war ; the wish to pay the public debt , and thus redeem the suffering credit of the states ; and , in general , to provide for the public welfare , by a closer union of the states ; were some of the principal motiyes for adopting the present cofnstitution . It will be remembered , that the power of taxation created one of the greatest obstacles to the adoption of the present constitution ; and , it is probable that some of the states would never have ratified it , if they had considered the constitution as bestowing on congress an unlimited power of taxation . What then are to be the limits to this power ? The answer must be that congress has no constitutional power to impose taxes , except in three cases , viz. : 1 , to pay the public debt ; 2 , to provide for the common defence ; 3 , to provide for the general welfare . With regard to the exercise of this power in the two first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here the national honor , as well as the national safety , is concerned . But , with regard to the third , it may be asked , who shall determine , in any case , when the public welfare or interest may be advanced by the expenditure of money ; and consequently , though neither the public debt nor the public safety is concerned , it will be expedient for the public to raise money by taxation . Certainly there Can be but one answer to this question , viz. r that congress has the right to determine at discretion , whether it will advance th public interest to raise money in this way  - -  For , this power of raising money is merely ancillary to an appropriation of it . Since , if congress think that the appropriation of a sum of money will contribute to the general welfare , they may use their discretion to raise it accordingly . And why should there be a distinction between siich a power , and all others , in this respect ? Must not the persons entrusted with the power , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion ? It is certainly left to their discretion , 910 to impose any taxes , unless th6y think it expedient ; then , why is not the power , to impose taxes when they think it expedient for the general welfare also left at their discretion i If it should be asked , what is meant in the constitution by the words ' general welfare , ' jt may be answered , that , what- General Rights . 96 ever contributes to advance the true interests of the country , may be eonsidered as conducing to its welfare , and so far will come within the meaning of the words in the constitution . But here , the word * general ' is the emphatic word , and not * welfare . ' For , when the constitution was first adopted , it can not , reasonably be supposed , that the states adopting it , would have been willing that monies should be raised among them by a general tax , to be appropriated and expended to obtain any benefit merely partial ; that is , for the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , though tbiby paid their proportions of the taxes , derived no advantage m to_the expenditures . On this account , the states stipulate in the constitution or national compact , that congress shall ' have power to impose taxes , fcc. to provide for the general welfare , and for the same reason very naturally require , that all duties , &c.; shall be uniform throughout the United States . As it would be unconstitutional , therefore , to lay an unequal tax , . as well as an act of oppression to those who were com* pelled to pay the larger proportion of it ; so it would also be unconstitutional to expend the money collected by it , with a view to give some peculiar advantage to some one or more of the states , only , as well as oppressive to those who bore their share of the burthen , while others reaped all the betiefit . It is not to be supposed , however , that it is practicable to pffe- serve a perfect equality , or a precise proportion in any such case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the states , respectively . But , as a principle or standard of right , this equality or just proportion should never be lost sight of for a moment , in any public measures whatever . Further ; whether it is necessary or not , to impose a cer-r tain tax in order to provide for the public welfare , belongs to congress alone to determine , and for two reasons ; , Because this restriction is given in the constitution in order to furnish congress with a rule , by which to decide in what cases to impose taxes , according to the intention of the parties to that compact . This is a sacred trust confided to the presumed integrity and justice of congress , and which , it would seem , they could hardr ly violate without being conscious of it ; 2 , Because no other persons are entrusted by the constitution with the import.Pt 96 General Rights . office of determining whether a tax is necessary for the general welfare or not . The supreme court of the United States has no jurisdiction to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , if it should once be made to appear , that such taxes are not conducive to the general welfare ; as if the purpose for which they are imposed , is expressly declared in the act which imposes them , and the appropriation as there made , it is self-evident , is to effect some object of a partial nature , perhaps it may be assumed that the supreme court might well decide , that the tax does not conduce to the general welfare , and therefore that congress has no authority under the constitution to impose it . To illustrate ; suppose congress should enact a law imposing a new tax , and should appropriate the money to be collected by it , to build a pew state house in Connecticut , or any other state ; can any one doubt that this law would be unconstitutional , and that the supreme court of the United States would decide diat , it was void ? And yet , if no unconstitutional appropriation should appear on the face of the Act , the court could hardly have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar restriction must Jbe implied , upon the power which is given in the second clause ' to borrow money on the credit of the United States , though there is no express qualification annexed to the exercise of this power Because it can not be supposed , that is was intended by the constitution to give congress a power to do that indirectly , which they have no constitutional power to do directly . For , if this restriction is not extended as well to the power of raising money by borrowing , zds to that of raising it by imposing taxes , congress will have the power of borrowing money on the credit of the United States for whatever objects they choose ; and , having in this way created a public debt , may then exercise the power df taxation for the purpose of raising money to discharge it ; though the objects for which the debt was created at first , were such as the constitution never contemplated , as furnishing an occasion for raising ! noney by taxation . But this is too irrational to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow izioney on the credit of the United States Creneral Rights . 97 for any other purposes than to pay the puUic debt , and provide for the common safety and general welfare of the United States . It may be remarked here , transiently , that , tha right of expending the public money , must necessarily be limited to those objects , for whicK alone congress is authorized to raise it . For , if congress have no authority , to raise money by the imposition of taxes , or by borrowing , except to answer the necessary purposes before mentioned , it mu$t follow , that con congress can appropriate the public money to no other purposes ; unless we can suppose the absurdity , that though congress have the power to raise money for a constit ; utional purpo3e only , yet , as soon as it is collected , they may apply it to one for which they could not constitutionally have raised it . It follows , that congress has no right , under the constitution , to appropriate money , , except for general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of all the states . Equality of benefit to all , should also be observed here , if practicable , though it is not of so much consequence as it is that the public burthens should be borne equally , or rather proportionally . For , as long as each state derives a benefit from a public measure , greater than the burthen , which it sustains by paying its proportion of the money expended to eflTect it , there will be no ground of complaint , though one state , owing to some natural or accidental advantages , should derive ten times as great a benefit from it as the rest . But , where one state bears a heavy burthen in consequence of some public measure , and derives no advantage from it sufficient to compensate for that burthen , while another istate derives a very great advantage from it , but bears no greater burthen , perhaps a roach lighter one , there is sufficient cause for complaint , on account of the inequality , which it is apparent , could never have been in the contemplation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It follows from the same train of reasoning , that congress has no authority , , under the constitution , to appropriate money to make internal improvements in any case , where the advan* tage of them is to be derived by one or more particular states only . For , such internal iroproveinents , in the territory of aay /z/ 98 General Rights . particular states , should be made by the states themselves , at their own expense . The other states have nothing to do with them ; and , by the compact which they have made in the constitution , they never entrusted congress with any power to appropriate money in this way . If , however , an internal improvement in any particular state , will be of service also to the interests of the United States , there should be a comparative estimate made of the particular interest of the state , and of the general interest of the United States ; and the expense of making the improvement should be defrayed in just proportions out of the state treasury and that of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrangement then c(H)gress will proceed no further than the general interests require . . A more convenient arsangement in this respect , it is believed , would be , for congress to make an annual appropriation of a certain sum of money , more or less , according to circumstances , to be paid over to the state treasuries , according to the ratio of the apportionment of direct taxes , or representatives to congress , and to be disposed of either in internal improvements in the states respectively , or to such uses as the state legislatures should direct . ' of these two modes oi making internal improvements would be constitutional and equitable ; but , it is believed , that to expend money in internal improvements for the benefit of certain states only , to which they make no proportional contribution , is within none of the powers of congress , and is equally - unconstitutional and inequitable . But , it may be objected here , if this be so , whence does congress derive authority to expend money in the erection of fortifications on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is principally derived by those states only . The answer is , that one of the principal motives which the states had for forming the union , was to insure the safety of all of them without distinction . It is the duty of the general government , and they have ample power in the constitution , to protect any state that happens to be in danger at any time , from foreign aggression , at any expense , however great to the union , and though the others may be perfectly safe . The ad- General Rtghii. 96 vantage here is mutual , because it ; is altogether uncertain , which state may first need the assistance of the States , In the early settlement of soine of the inland states , since the adoption of the constitution , fortresses and blockhouses , and military posts uid stations were erected and maintained by congress , in performance of their duty of defending the set tiers , some of which are still kept up , though the task of main-taining them is daily growing less and less necessary . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereafter arise to any of them from any new enemy , it will equally become the duty of congress to protect them out of the public treasury , at whatever cost . And , if by taking any particular measure of precaution or prevention , the danger may be avoided , or , if it should come , may be more eaisily repelled , it is within the constitutional discretion of congress to adopt uch measures in ad- ' vance . As therefore congress is bound to protect all the states equally , and as the commercial states on the sea-coast , will be secured or defended from attack much tnore eflctually , by ' erecting fortifications along dieir shores and in their harbors , it will not only be a justifiable expenditure of the public money under the constitution , but perhaps the most economical Boode of securing the safety of those states , that can be adopted . The erection of light-houses and the building of ships of war , are justified on a difiTerent ground . The first is to secure the shipping from the dangers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , as it is well known that the commerce which is carried on by means of merchant vessels , is advantageous , not only to the exporting and importing states , but likewise to those who consume foreign commodities , and those who raise produce , or manufacture goods for exportation , the security and protection of it concern the general welfare . The third clause above referred to , authorizes congress to regulate commerce , &c.; ; and it may be asked . Has congress any authority , under it , to impose duties on imports ? To answer this question , the true meaning of the parties to the constitution should be considered , without resorting to any refined or artificial construction . For this purpose , it will be necessary to know what is meant by regulating trade , and whether it d ) 00 General JUgkis. is ever necessary for the mere regidation of trade , to laj a tax OD imports , and if so , whether such a measure was at all in the contemplation of the states , when they authorized congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fully examined in Smith V. Ogden ; and it seems that the power to regulate commerce , includes also the power to regulate navigation . It extends also to every species of commercial intercourse between ibe United States and foreign states , and among the several states of the union ; but does not comprehend the commerce between individuals in the same state . This power may be executed to its utmost extent , as far as it is granted by th constitution . It does not comprehend the power of laying duties or imposts , on exports or imports , which is one of the branches of the taxing power ; but it extends equally to every species of vessek , however propelled , or however employed 9 Wheat . 309 . It will immediately occur to an attentive reader , that the constitutbn , in the first clause referred to , having given authority to congress to impose taxes and duties for certain specified purposes , requiring that they should be uniform ; and , in the second clause , having authbrized doogress to borrow mon. - ey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxation , or raising money was wholly dismissed from their mmds . It would seem probably therefore , in framing the next clause , which gives power to congress to regulate commerce , the thought of domg k by means of imposts and duties never occurred to them . If , then , there are any other measures , which congress can naturally adopt for the regulation of trade , without resorting to imposts and duties , those measures proba bly are what the iiramers of the . constitution had particularly in view in this clause . It should be remarked here , that the whole clause authorises congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , and with the Indian tribes . Now , it is expressly forbidden in the fi ( Ui clause of section ix . to lay any tax or duty on articles exported from any state , &c.; ; it is clear , therefore , at though cotigress has the power to reg  --  - ulate commerce , to do it by the impositioQ of duties or taxes , qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce , were subjects of the highest interest and importance to most if not all of the states which first joined in the adoption of the constitution , it can not be supposed , that by giving congress a power to regulate trade , they meant any thing else than a power to adopt such measures , as they should think best calculated to advance and increase It . Can it be imagined then that , under such a power of regulating trade , congress has a constitutional authority to adopt measures injurious to it , for the purpose of advancing some other interest ? Certainly not . If so , then it is quite clear that congress , under the power of regtdating trade , has no conistitutional authority to lay a duty ob imports , for the mere purpose of eq- /z/ couraging manufactures ; though , if it can be made to appear , that by the imposition of such taxes or duties , trade or commerce will be advanced , it can not be doubted that congress has such power ; and this is a subject that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider , whether , if the general welfare of the states will be promoted by taxing imports , congress has not the power , under these clauses in the constitution , to lay such taxes , even though they may be unfavorable to the interests of trade . It may be remarked here , that in giving a construction to the constitution , what the states really intended , should be the guide ; and the words used in the constitution should always be taken , not independently and by a strict construction , but with a reference to such intention . However advantageous , therefore , it may be for the interests of the United States , that a certain power should be given to congress , if such power does not appear to be given in the constitution , or , if it may possibly be considered as coming within the comprehensive range of a very general expression , in ' all probability could never have been in the contemplation of the states to bestow on con  --  - gress , it can not be sustained by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting the constitution , each state must be considered as having acted on its own judgment with regard to the powers , which it was willing to joiii in confiding to ccHigress. lough a certain power , therefore , may have been considered very proper tdbe granted to congress by one or more states , yet some particular state may have thought otherwise , and therefore may have refused to confer it . In any suchxase , to endeavor to make use of general words , m their most comprehensive sense , in order to prove that a certain power is given by them to congress , which such state never contemplated , would be a dishonorable attempt to make the constitution a catching bargain . But there never can be any necessity for resorting to so degrading an expedients For , if it will be advantageous to the common interest of the United ' States , that congress should have a certain poWer , and it is doubtful whether It is granted to them by the constitution , it wouM be General Rights , 103 far better to propose an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doubt , and either grant or deny the power expressly than by an artificial or subtle constructioa of the constitution , usurp a power not distinctly granted by it , to the great dissatisfaction of the dissentients. , But it may be objected perhaps , that by a fair interpretation , the power may be considered , as given by implication , or , that it is given according to the literal sense of the words ; and , if it is submitted as an amendment to the constitution , it may be impracticable to convince a sufficient number of those who have the power to make amendments , to render it efibctual as such . The answer is , if the grant of the power to congress is at all doubtful , and the expediency of it is so uncertain , , that a sufficient majority can not now be obtained to insert k as an amendment to the constitution , it will be better to conder it as not granted , than to exercise it against the opinion of so many dissentients , as to its constitutionality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the proposed inquiry , it may be observed , that congress undoubtedly has a power to impose taxes , iipposts and duties , &c.; on imports , in three cases , and in those only , viz. : 1 , to pay the national debt ; 2 , to provide for the common defence ; 3 , to provide for the general welfare . But what was the intended operation of this power to impose duties , &k^; ? It seems clear , that it was to raise money , which was afterwards to be appropriated and expended in obtaining one or more of these objects . Because the duties are to be imposed , 1 , to pay . the public debt , which can not be done without collecting and appropriating money ; 2 , to provide for the common defence , which can only be done by appropriating the money collected from the dudes , to the pay of the army or navy , which congress is authorized by the constitution to raise , or maintain , he . he . ; 3 , to provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money collected from the dudes , to defray the expense of any measures ol general expediency . The injury done to the trade of the country by laying heavy duties in order to pay the public debt , in the first case , or , in order to provide for the public safety , in the second , must be borne , if necessary , as a concesion made to justice , or- a sac- 104 General Rights . rifice to necessity . But , if the tax or duty is imposed to provide for the geueral welfare , a distinction should be taketi . For , if the sacrifice made in the loss of trade , is general to aD the states , and the benefit derived from the sacrifice is likewise generdlj then the whole becomes a question of political expediency , for the decision of congress , whether trade shall thus be burthened with taxes , in order that the money raised by them should be expended in promoting such measures or not . But , if one state alone is to suffer in its trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the other states , without sufiering any material disadvantage in their eommerce , are to derive the whole advantage of such measures , this will be wholly contrary to the true intention of the j ) arties to the constitution , as well as taking a very unfair and dishonorable advantage of the state thus oppressed . There is nothing at all refined in this doctrine , since it is grounded on plain principles of justice and honesty , which every man of integrity would blush to transgress in the com* mon transactions of private life , and which ought not to be disregarded or overstepped by statesmen and liticians , however high their stations and offices , and however great their popularity . Theapplication of this doctrine is easy . Congress has no constitutional power , under the three first clauses in Article 1 , section viii . to impose taxes or duties of . any kind , except for the purposes of revenue . Because , thoiigh such a power may seem , at first sight , to come within the very general words of the constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real intention of the states , at the time of its adoption . It remains , to consider the final question , whether any part of the constitution gives congress a power , either expressly or by necessary implication , to hnpose a duty on imports , for the acknowledged purpose alone of encouraging doitiestic manuiactures . Any person cqnsuhmg the ccmstitution-for the purpose of ascertaining whether such a power is given in it to congress , would very naturally torn to those places in it where taxes , duties , and the rulatioD of trade are mentioned i and , if be General Righti. 105 could not find any such power granted to congress , either in express terms , or by necessary implication , he would be very apt to give over farther examination , and conclude that no 5uch power is delegated by it . But , in all probability , the true reason why nothing can be found in the constitution in relation to such a power in express terms , is , because at that time manufactures were so little advanced in this country , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison with the important objects particularly contemplated in its adoption . For , it was not until Hamilton drew up his report on manufactures , that the subject attracted the public attention in this country , which it deserved . The country at that time being in debt , and it being necessary to raise money to pay it , as well as for other purposes , the constitutionality of which was never doubted ; and the least burthensorae way of raising the money being by the imposition of duties on imports , the sole question was , upon what articles it would be the best policy to lay duties . The present constitutional question , whether congress has a right to lay duties for the mere purpose of encouraging manufactures , was not much thought of ; because , as the payment of the public debt was a sufficient constitutional ground for the imposition of duties , it was unnecessary to look for another . According to the policy recommended by that distinguished politician but , which whether wise or unwise , has long prevailed in commercial and manufacturing countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign growth or manufacture , as interfere in our own market with similar articles of home production . The reason is , because if this were not done , foreign growers and manufacturers , owing to the greater cheapness of labor in od countries , and greater capital , superior skill and experience , and perhaps other causes , which it is not material to consider here , would be able to undersell us in our own market , and the consequence of which would be , that our own countrymen would be discouraged from manufacturing , &c.; ; because the low price at which they weuld be compelled to sell , would prevent their receiving reasonable wages for their labor . Where therefore congress have the constitutional power to /z/ feiy imposts , the hioney arising from them berng necessary to pay the public debt , or for other constitutional purposes , sucb considerations of public policy , are properly allowed to designate the articles upon which the duties should be laid . But where there is no such foundation , the money not being wanted for any constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , until some other constitutional occasion , if there be any such , occurs for the exercise of this power In relation to the present subject , therefore , no conclusive iiiference can be drawn from the recommendations of Hamilton , whatever weight may be due to his opinion . The following considerations may perhaps afford some assistance in determining this point . The constitution was adopted to promote the general welfare of all the states . But , though this is self-evident , no power is given to congress in express terms , to provide for the general welfare , except in the single case of laying taxes , 8z ; c. ' to provide ' * for the general welfare . ' Yet , this is either immediately or remotely the sole object of every power enumerated in Article I. section 8 . But , as the states were apjprehensive that congress might either usur powers not granted to them , or misuse those that were , certain powers are expressly denied to congress , and the exercise of some of those which are granted , is restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given to the constitution . 1 . As the sole object of the formation of the union , was to provide for the general welfare of the states , it ipay be considered that congress have the power to adopt any measures whatever for that purpose , which they may the &fc; expedient , with the exception of such as involve the exercise of powers , expressly forbidden either wholly , or in certain cases only which are specified . If this principle of construction should be adopted , it will follow , that the enumeration of the powers expressly conferred on congress in section -8 , of Article I. will have no other operation thaq to state in express terms , what would have been understood without them , on a feir construction of a mere power to provide for the general welfare . It will be necessary then to suppose , that this enumeration was made merely for the purpose of preventing all doubt , as to the most important of the powers , as far as the stjites could agree on the subject . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone are inadequate to the contemplated object , to imply or infer , not only all the powers which we necessary to carry the expresseci powers into execution , for this the constitution grants in the sweeping clause , but also , all such powers as shall be necessary to promote the principal object of the union , viz. : the general welfare , with the exception of those powers and acts ony , which are expressly prohibited in the constitution . Under this construction , the pripcipal question miglitlbe settled at once without dijBculty . For , then , under this generail power to promote the general welfare of the United States , ilF it were expedient to lay a duty on imports for the mere purpose of encouraging domestic manufactures , congress might constitutionally do it , because it is not forbidden in the constitution in eatress terras . In such case , the policy of the mea* sure , the articles on which the duties should be imposed , th ( amount of the duties , and the duration of the act imposing them , would all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , would be liable to the objection , that the constitution , after enumerating certain powers , provides that aU powers not given in it to congress , are reserved to the states or the people . From this reserviation , thoid powers are excepted which are necessary to the exercise of those which are expressly given . And therefore if this reservation has any operation at aU , it must apply to all powe ! which are neither expressly granted in the constitution , not necessary to the exercise of those which are so . It is true , tsertain powers are forbidden to congress ; yet , as it was not supposed that the enumeration of denied powers was so complete , that congress might constitutionally exef cise any powers not enumerated and forbidden , this reservation of powers rioi granted was made , in express terms . Now , it is apparent , if congress have the power to adopt measures of every kind whatever which they think expedient for the general welfare , with the exception of such only as are expressly forbidden , or depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the express general reservation of all pow- lOS General Righti. ers norgranted , becomes wholly inoperative . Since , notwith-* standing this reservation , congress will have authority to exercise any powers and do any acts , not expressly forbidden , if they should consider them conducive to the general welfare . The other construction is grounded on the supposition , that the states being jealous of their rights and interests , and consequently desirous of guarding against the possibility of any usurpation of powers by congress , having expressed the general objects of the union in the preamble to the constitution , as a hmitation of the purposes for which the powers delegated in it are to be employed , have made an enumeration of all the powers which they were willing to entrust to congress , and after having expressly forbidden the exercise of some of those powers in certain cases , and also having expressly denied certain other powers in any case , in order that there might re main no doubt at all on the subject , have finally made an express reservation of all powers not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last principle of construction will be , that congress , for the general purpose of providing for the general welfare , can exercise no other powers , than those which are granted in the constitution in express terms , and such others as are so necessary to the exercise of them , that the latter , the express powers y can not effectually be exercised without the former , the implied powers . Under this latter construction , the power of imposing duties on imports , for the sole purpose of encouraging domestic manufactures , is not authorized by the constitution . . But , perhaps the reader wiH come to the conclusion , that , with regard to some few particulars , the decision of which , at the time of adopting the constitution , was a matter of no immediate necessity , and which , if stated in eocpress terms , would never have received the sanction of all the states , the constitution is not so much an exen ) - plification of a compact , in which all those who adopted it , actually agreed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aH that was agreed , but leaving matters which they could not agree upon , couched under a veil of general words , with a reservation as to their construction . But the whole subject is submitted to the discerning reader* General Rights* 109 m Division iji . Of the iPowers and Duties of 1the President . The executive power of the United States , by the constitution is vested m the President . It belongs to his department therefore to execute every law , which corigress have authority to make under the constitution . 9 Wheat . 733 . But , if the President should mistake the construction of an act of Congress , and in consequence of it , should give instructions not warranted by the act , any aggrieved party might recover damages against the officer acting under those instructions , which though given by the President , would furnish no justification or excuse . See 2 Cranch , 119 . For the same reason , the President can not alter the effect or operation of a law by his proclaniation . But , in general , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President , but , the means to be used in the discharge of it are not pointed out , he may adopt those which are most proper for that purpose , provided they are not repugnant to the constitution , and are not forbidden by any act of congress . Ii is held accordingly , that , in time of war , the President has a righvto use all the customary means to carry it into effect . 1 Gal . 563 . It may be remarked here transiently , that the President , in all cases , where his official authority and duty are not brought in question , is nferely a private citizen , and is bound by all the ordinary duties and obligations of one . Accordingly , it has been held that , if his testimony is necessary in any case , for the purposes of justice , he may be siibpoened into court as a witness , and may be required to produce papers , if regularly notified , in the same manner as an ) other individual . However , it is uite clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to divulge or disclose any part of any documents or affairs , which the public interest requires should bef concealed . See I Burr*s Trial , 183 . Under the constitution , ( article ii . section 2 ) the President has a power to nominate , and by and with the consent of the Senate , appoint certain officers of high standing and great re- /z/ sponsibility . In the same sdction power is given to congress to vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they shall think proper , either in the President alone , the courts of law , or , in the heads of departments . Congress has exercised this authority by the creation of such offices as the public occasions require , the appointments to whi6h have been distributed accordingly . Under the power given by the constitution to nominate aod by and with the consent of the Senate , kjc. it is held , that the act of nomination is entirely discretionary with the President . He may therefore nominate whom he pleases . But , unless sanctioned by the consent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if the Senate agrees to the nomination , the appointment becomes complete ; and it becomes the duty of the president to give the officer a commission . This he can not legally refuse to do , because the constitution requires the President to commission all officers of the United States . If so , it would seem , that if the President should make a nomination to the Senate , and they should con cur , be will afterwards havd no right to recall his nominatioa without their consent . Where the President appoints an officer , who is not removable at his discretion , the officer may demand his commissioD because the appointment confers legal rights upon him , which can not be resumed . If therefore the commission has been been made out and signed by the President , the officer will be entitled to a mandamus to the secretary pf state , requiring him to deliver to the officer , his commission or a copy of it from the record , which is made by law of eqoat efficacy . See 1 Crancb , 137 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the appointment , and 4t usually is impossible to show the appointment otherwise than by proving the existence of the commission : still , there are cases , where the appointment is plainly complete , before any commission is issued ; for example , where the courts or heads of departments have authority to appoint officers , who must have their commissions , from the President . 1 Cranch , 137 , 155 . Where the President is iatrusted by the cqpstitution with General RtgJm . Ill a discretionaipy powet , his acts in the exercise of it are not suHijected to the examination of the Stiprerae Court of the United States . But , if a specific ' doty is assigned to him by laWf and the rights of individuals , depend on the performance of l ! hat duty , if the President should refuse to perforin it , any individual injured by the refusal , has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy . See 1 Cranch , 155 . The heads of departments for the same reason , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the exercise of his legal or constitutional discretion are , in like manner , exempt from the control of the judiciary . But , where either of refuses to perform a particular duty assigned to liim by law , and which the President has no right to forbid , ( whether he actually forbids it or not ) as to record a patent ibr land , or a commission , &c.; the courts of the United States are bound to afford redress , precisely as if those duties were to be performed by any individual , who was not one of the heads of department . It is the duty of the President to caiise all constitutional laws to be enforced , and there does not appear to be any pretence of constitutional right en his part , to decline the performance of any duty assigned to him by an act of Congress , on the ground that such law is unconstitutional . The question of the constitutionality of a law , is no where submitted to him by the constitution . Such question belongs to the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a very insufficient counterpoi3e to the wisdom of the two houses of congress . It is true , the constituon gives him a qualified veto on all bills which have passed both houses of congress , so far as to require , in case of his disapprobation , a majority of two thirds of each house , fee . to constitute such bill a law . But , after a law is Once constitutionally passed , with or without his approbation , if he may refuse to perform the duty of putting such law in execution , he will obviously have an absolute veto on all laws , which may call for his assistance to enforce them . This veto is not contemplated in the constitution . If therefore a law should be unconstitutional , he incurs no responsibility by putting it in force , until the Supteme Court decide it to be so . It i very desirable , however , /z/ 113 General Righd. that any person , who considers a law to be unconstitutioDal , and who will suffer an injury by its being put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should have a right to apply to some proper tribunal for process to suspend the execution of it , until the question of constitutionality can be finally settled . And here it may not be amiss to consider what remedy is provided by the constitution , in case the President should be guilty of any official misconduct . By Article II . Sect. 4 , the President , &; c. &; c. is made liable to impeachment for treason , bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors . It will be unnecessary in this place to make any comments on treason and bribery and other high crimes , but in relation to misdemeanors in office , it may veiy properly be asked in what they can consist , as contradistinguished from the three former charges . To answer this question clearly , will be rendered more easy , by considering in what respects the President may violate his official duty . This , it is apparent , may take place in three ways , viz. ; 1 . By refusing to execute the laws and treaties of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the constitution ; though in some cases , this may amount to treason . 3 . By an arbitrary and corrupt use of an authority lawful in itself , but which was intended to be exercised with a single view to the public good , to answer the purposes of selfish intrigue . In England , the King is not ' constitutionally answerable for any of his official conduct ; but , as it is presumed , that he always acts by the advice of his ministers , they are held personally responsible for all political measures adopted during their administration . Some of them have , suffered capitally for such alleged misconduct . It is on this account , in part , that ministers send in their resignation as soon as they find that the majority of parliament is against them . J3ut , in the United States , the President is answerable for his own official conduct ; and is liable to impeachment for any default in the discharge of his duty . But , though the constitution contemplates the possibility of the President 's being impeached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present time , no such impeachment has ever been moved for ; . and Ainless unfitness , or incapacity or a Otn &a; JRk 113 ilteglect of dvitgr k to be eodsidiered as a ground fot indpbacfa ment ) peiaps never will be ; For the President 's autboritjr seems so distinctly marked out in the constitutiony and he is 90 hemmed in by the barriers of superior as well as co-ordinate authorities that there are but few cases , where he would be able to_the usurp authority without its being felt by some of the other branches of the government , which would hardly fail indignantly to repel the encroachmentw If the President should* be so indiscreet as to command an unconstitutional or illegal act to be done , it would be no excuse or justificadon to the officer who executed it . It would hardly seem to afford sufficient foundation fot an impeachment , if the President should make use of the discre  - -  tion , which is intrusted to him by the constitution or the laws of the United States , imprudently and injudiciously . For , ill any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honetf exercise of such ability , as they see fit to elevate to this high office . But , they have a right to expect integrity and fair purposes and intentions . And , therefore , if the President should pervert the powers , confided to him by the constitution , to be exercised for the promotion of the general welfare , to the purposes of favoritism , partial or local interests , politidai intrigue or the mere confirmation or advancement of his own authority , he would well deserve to be impeached . Because , in this way , he sacrifices the general interests of the nation , to liie purpose of buyitig over and corrupting a party or faction* From the imperfection of humanity , a mere error of judgment , a casual omission of duty , not persisted in against conviction , ought in no case whatever , however unfortunate the con*-eequences , to be the subject of an impeachment ; but a deliberate refusal , either to execute a law , to observe or enforce the observance of a treaty , or to abide by and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court of the United States , would perhaps be as gross a violation of the President 's duty , as , considering the very limited extent of his power , can well be imagined For , by refiising to execute a law , he usurps to himself the authority of putting an unqualified VETO upon the acts of the national legislature . He also assumes a dispensing power as to the discharge of his own duty ; /z/ i 114 General Rights . /z/ as , if be bad a discretion wbether to perform it or not , and constitutes himself a judicial officer , to judge of the constitutionality of a law , when his office is merely ministerial to execute it . For , by the constitudon , whatever laws Congress see fit to enact , it is his duly to execute . To neglect it wilfully , is an assumption of authority , a denial of the wisdom of the general legislature , and a contempt of their authority . And in all cases where his assistance is required to execute the laws , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Congress is deprived of the power of legislation . For , of what avail are laws which are not enforced ? The same remark applies to treaties . Under the constitution , the President has no discretion in relation to the observance and enforcement of them . The constitution requires , that he should execute the laws ; it also makes treaties , &; c. the supreme law of the land . Treaties consequently are laws , which he must execute , and this can be done in no other way , than enforcing their observance . The assumption of a dispensing power , in this case , may be attended with worse conquences than a refusal to execute a law of congress . For , a refusal to execute or observe a treaty , made with a powerful nation , may be the means of involving the country in a ruinous war , the consequence of which possibly might be the dissolution of the Union , by the dismemberment or die separation of the states . If he should in like manner refuse to observe a treaty made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to redress its own wrongs , he may be the means of stamping on the national character a mark of dishonor , which , after the wrong is once done , and consequently has become irremediable , no lapse of time will ever be able to efiace ; but which will remain a source of regret and mortification to future generations , as a proof of the breach of faith of their ancestors . Further , would there not be just reason to apprehend , that , it might bring upon the whole nation , if they should sanction such an act in their ruler , the punishment of the oppressor , the curse of those who remove their neighbor 's landmark , the judgment upon those who unrighteously slay and afterwards take possession ? ' See ' 1 Kings , chap xxi . Oeneral Rights . 115- The wilful perversion of a legitimate authority , however difficult it might be to establish it by proof , would also be a misdemeanor . Let it be supposed , for example , that there is a vacancy in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President , provided it be done by and with the ad* vice and consent of the senate , if in session . Suppose the President postpones the nomination until after the recess of the senate , in order to usurp to himself the unqualified power of appointment , is not this in direct violation of the constitution ; and , if it is done wilfully and not through mistake of his power , is it not an impeachable offence ? The case would undoubtedly be highly aggravated , if the President should appoint , during the recess of the senate , a person who had previ- * ously been nominated by him to the senate , and whose nomination had been expressly negatived by them . The appointment of certain officers , which it would be superfluous to enumerate , is vested in the President alone , by the laws of the United States , made by virtue of an article in the constitution . Many , if not all such , are removable by the President at discretion . This provision , generally speaking , is conducive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in office , a public officer may have lost the confidence of the President , or of the public , and may also cease to be qualified to discharge its duties . Besides , as the President is considered in some measure accountable for the neglect or failure of duty of those , whom he either appoints to office , or retains in it , it would seem no more than proper , that he should have the privilege of selectbg those persons in whom he is to confide . Further , if the President were considered as having no right to remove a public officer , against whom no default could be proved , the tenure of the office would be changed . It would no longer be during the discretion of the President , but during good behavior . Great latitude of removal and appointment , therefore , should be permitted . Yet , it is obvious , very great abuses may be occasioned , if such an authority may be exercised arbitrarily and corruptly , without animadversion . Suppose , for example , the President should see fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , it can never be a proper subject of inquiry , wbetber the PneaideBt had or bad not  --  good and suffiiciDf reason for such a measure ; because the President is under UQ obligation to assign reasons for the exercise of this discreUoo ; andy if any sufficient cause for the reoiioval can be supposed without impeaching the officer 's character , which ought not ts be done on mere surmise , such cause in fairness should b. taken to be the true one . But , if the President should see fit to assign as a reason , any cause wholly unfounded in fact , and which he had no good reason to believe , or , which waft perfectly consistent with a faithful discharge of the officer 's duty , and especially , if it were any cause , which would bare 9 tendency to reduce all officers , who are removeable at the President 's discretion , to become his mere servile instrumeatSf as to all acts , whatever , as well without , as within the sphece of their official duties , and whether such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the severest reprehension . Because , it would be a tyrannical abuse of the discretion , m trusted to him by law for the public convenience , to the grati-r fication of his ill will or arbitrary disposition . So , though tho removal of one or more particular individuals from office , with " , out assigning any reasons , might possibly be free from any in*-vidious remark , however unexceptionable the characters of such persons might be ; yet , if any President should , as soon as conveniently could be done , after entering upon his office as President , dismiss from all offices holden during his pleasure , all the former incumbents , and replace them immediately with such persons as had been most active in procuring his election , this also should be a sufficient cause for an impeachment ; because it tends to produce , not only secret and indirect , but , open and palpable bribery and corruption , in bargains and : stipulations for offices , not in consideration of services done for the public , but for services rendered and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all of which is nothing less than selling the people , and pocketing the price . If such behavior in office id not liable to impeachment , of what avail is it , that it is regarded with disgust and contempt by ev-* ery man of integrity . Yet , it must be an extreme case , that would render it expedient to impeach the President of the United States , The Omertd It ? great delay and consequently expense , whidi must attend so iioportant a trial before so Bunierous a tribunal as the senate , , prosecuted by the still more numerous bouse of representatives ; the neglect or suspension of other public business during the trial ) which would probably be the consequence , would hardly be compensated by the removal of the President from hb office the term of which is only four years , and more or less of which must be consumed in bis administration previous to the impeachment , as well as afterwards during the trial . To these may be added the danger , that the course of justice may be impeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which might lead to civil commotions and disturbances , the final issue of which , it might be impossible to foresee . In most cases , therefore , it would be best to trust to the discernment and influence of the more intelligent of the citizens , it the presidential elections , to take care that a person who had once been guilty of malversation in this important office , should not have a second opportunity and if his misdemeanor amounted to a high crime , as treason , or bribery , to make it the subject of an indictment , where the trial will be speedy , and on conviction , the court will award a suitable punishment . But if the default originates from mere incapacity , that is , a want of knowledge , experience , or natural abilities , let the people by their electors , at the regular expiration of his official term , select some other individual better qualified for the discharge of the duties of this high office , and peaceably restore the former incumbent to that station in private life , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of more resppnsibility , by the possession of very limited abilities . But nothing can be more unbecoming a worthy citizen , than lo make any charges of this kind , against the principal executive officer of the United States , upon mere surmise or suspicion , having no other foundation , than , that the President has eoiercised his discretion in certain cases , and that his motives are unknown , Fqr , in all governments , power must be confided somewhere ; when so confided , it is liable to abuse ; otherwise , there would be no confidence If then the possi- /z/ 118 General Rigf. bility of an abuse , is a sufficient foundatioD to infer its ac tual existence , who can be secure from suspicion , from cal umny , or even from conviction on an impeachment i Division IV .

Cfthe respect which ought to be paid to its decisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jay . 1 . General remarks . The judicial department of every government , is the rightful expositor of its laws , emphatically of its supreme law . 2 Pet . 524 . In every well constituted government , it has been observed , the judicial power should be coextensive with the legislative , and must be capable of deciding every judicial question which grows out of the constitution and laws . See 2 Wheat . 397. 6 Wheat . 264 . Accordingly , under the constitution of the United States , the jurisdiction of the judiciary is coextensive with the constitution , laws and treaties of the United Sates , when the subject is submitted to it in the form prescribed by law . 9 Wheat . 738 . See 5 Peters , 20. 6 Wheat . 264 . For that power is capable of acting , only , when the subject is thus presented . Ibid . So , under the constitution , the courts of the Union have jurisdiction also of all controversies , between two or more states , between a state and citizens of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , citizens or subjects . 6 Wheat . 264 . In the former class of cases , the jurisdiction depends on the character of the cause ; in the latter on the character of the parties . For , whatever may be the subject of the controversy , these parties have a constitutional right to come into the courts of the Union . 6 Wheat . 264 . Whenever , therefore , the correct decision of a case either in law or equity , depends on the construction either of the Constitution , or the laws of the United States , or of any treaty made under their authority , it falls within the jurisdiction of the national judiciary . General Jtights. 119 For it is held , where a right is protected by a treaty , it is sanctioned against all the laws and judicial opinions of the . states , and whoever may have the right , it is protected . But , if the person 's title is not affected by the treaty , and if he claims nothing under it , his title can not be protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , the judicial power of the United States is vested in one Supreme Court , and such inferior courts , as congress may establish . It will be remarked , that under the constitution , original jurisdiction is given to the Supreme Court in certain specified cases , absolutely ; in other cases , appellate jurisdiction only is given , with such exceptions , and under such regulations , as the congress shall make . ' On this subject , it is held , that where jurisdiction is not given originally it shall be exercised by appeal . Where it is given expressly by appeal , original jurisdiction is excluded . But where orna/ jurisdiction is given , if another tribunal may also take cognizance , the power of appeal from that tribunal is not necessarily negatived . See 2 Wheat . 397 . As the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is pointed out by the constitution , it can not be lessened or enlarged by an act of congress . For congress can not transcend the authority confided to them by the constitution . See 1 Cranch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the nature of their institution . Thus , to fine for contempts ; to imprison for contumacy ; to enforce the observance of an order , &c.; are powers which can not be dispensed with in a court ; because they are necessary to the exercise of all others . See 7 Cranch , 32. - Yet , it is held generally , that the judicial power granted in the constitution , can only be exercised in the cases and the modes prescribed by congress . See 3 Cranch , 170. 1 Cranch , 9. 3 Dal . 237 , 6 Cranch , 312. 2 . Of the original jurisdictiori of the Supreme Court , In cases alSecting ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , the Supreme Court has ortgtnaZ jurisdiction , by the constitution . Yet , it is held , that congress are not prevented from qwq The Supreme Court has also original jurisdiction in cases where a state is a party . On this subject , the following diatinctions seem to be settled . A state may sue another state , or the citizens of another state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state may be sued by another state or by a foreign state . But , by virtue of the eleventh amendment of the coa  --  - stitution , it is established that the judicial power of the United States shall not extend to a suit brought against a state , by the citizens of a state , or those of any foreign state . This amendment however excludes the jurisdiction of the federal courts , in suits only where the state is named defendant cm record . 9 Wheat . 732 . For although the claims of a state may be ultimately affected by the decision of a cause , yet if the state be not necessarily a defendant , the coutits of the United States are bound to exercise jurisdiction . 5 Cranch , /z/ And where a state obtains judgment against an individual , and the court rendering such judgment , overrules a defence set up under the constitution or laws of the United States , the transfer of the record into the Supreme Court , in order to inquire , whether the judgment violates the constitution or laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced or prosecuted against a state within the eleventh amendment . See 6 Wheat . 264 . Under the construction , that has been given to the constitution , any ybren state may sue any of the United States , before the Supreme Court of the United States , and for this purpose , it has been held , in general , that the Supreme Court will consider as sovereign and independent states or nations , ( and codsequently foreign nations ) those powers , that are recognized as such by the executive or legislative departments of the government . See 5 Peters ; cites 4 Cranch , 241. 4 Wheat . 64. 3 Wheat . 64 . Yet , it seems , if a domestic , dependent nation ( in which light the court viewed the Cherokee Indians in this case , ) should be wronged , as a nation , the Supreme Court will not entertain jurisdiction of any suit brought by them against such &mend; Ritthii. .

The supreme court in any such case , can neither redress past wrongs , nor redress future ones , because to do this effectually , would require the exercise of political power , which is not intrusted to the court . See 5 Peters . 20 . But though the supreme court has original jurisdiction in certun cases under the constitution , it does not fcdlow that congress may not also vest concurreti jurisdiction in some other national tribunal , as for instance , the circuit court ; because the word original is not to be taken as exclusive . See 2 Dal . 417. 6 Wheat . 632. 3 . Of its appellate jurisdiction . The appeUate juris* diction of the supreme court , may be exercised in all cases specified in the constitution , other than those , in which it has original jurisdiction ; and their exercise of such jurisdiction over the state tribunals , - is not restrained by the constitution . 6 Wheat . 254 . The appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court , being given subject to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' will depend on the construction ven to the judiciary act and other acts of congress , taken in connexion with the constitution . Under these acts , it maybe exercised either by appeal from final decrees of the circuit courts or courts exercising the powers of circuit courts ; or , by writs of error from final judgments of such courts ; or , by a certificate from a circuit court , that the opinions of the judges are opposed on points stated ; or , by writ of error from the final decrees or judgments of the high- est court of law or equity in a state in certain cases ; or , lastly by writs of mandamus , prohibition , habeas corpus , certiorari , procedendo . But , no writ of error lies from the supreme court to the circuit court , in a criminal case . 3 Cranch , 159. 2 Dal . 197 .

And no writ of error to the circuit court will Ue , where the /z/ 133 Creneral Righii. matter in dispute is not of greater value than $9000 , exclusive of costs . Under the judiciary act , the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court extends to a final judgment or decree , in any suit in the highest court of law or equity of a state , where is drawn in question the validity of a national treaty and the decision is against its validity . So , where a statute of the United States is drawn in question in the same manner , and the decision is agsunst its validity . So , where an authority exercised under the United States is drawn in question , and the decision is against its validity . See 1 Wheat . 304. 6 Wheat . /z/ But , it is only , where the state court decides against the claim set up under the laws , &c.; of the United States , that the supreme court has appellate jurisdiction . 6 Wheat . 598 . It is not sufficient that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the decision was against the party , it must appear , that his title depended upon the statute 12 Wheat . 117 . And generally , it seems , under Sect. 25th of the Judiciary act , 1789 ch. 20 , the supreme court has no appellate jurisdiction , in a suit where the construction of a statute of the United States , or a commission under them , is drawn in question , unless some right , title , privilege or exemption is set up by the party , under such statute , and the decision is against it . 12 Wheat . 117 . So , where in any such case , the validity of a statute of any state is drawn in question , as being repugnant to the constitution of the United States nd the decision is in favor of its validity , it must appear that the right of the party depended on its validity , otherwise the court will have no jurisdiction .

If , in a case depending before any court , a legislative act all conflict with the constitution , it is admitted that the court must exercise its jument on botb and that the construction must control the act . The court must determine whether a repugnancy does or does not exist , and in making this determination must construe both instruments . 2 Pet . 524 . Mr Justice Johnson in 1 Pet . 614 , asks * What is the course BighU. 1 of pmdenee and dutjTi idiere cases of difficult distributicm as to power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to yield , rather than encroach . The duty is reciprocal , and will no doubt be met in the spirit of moderation and comity . In the conflicts of power and opinion , bseparable from our very peculiar reladons , cases may occur , in which the main tenance of principle , and the administration of justice , according to its innate and inseparable attributes , may require a different course ; and when such cases do occur , our courts must do , their duty , ' &C.; In the establishment of this court , it is evident that the states mtended to provide a supreme tribunal , not only for the decision of all cases , arising in the ordinary course , under the laws and constitution of the United States , but those also , where the rights or claims of any of the states , mit seem to clash with those of others , or with the laws , constitution , rights , or authority of the general government . In these cases , the jurisdiction of the court is final and conclusive ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal to which an appeal can be made . And , though it can not be doubted , but , that from the imperfection of human reason , they must sometimes err in judgment ; yet , however important the interests may be , which are affected ; however high and powerful the parties in any such case ; the decision of this court must be submitted to and obeyed , even though it should be unjust . This consequence necessarily results from the theory of the government , established by the constitution . For , the decrees of all tribunals of final jurisdiction , are equally liable to the objection , that they may sometimes err . But , as erroneous decisions must be of rare occurrence ; and , as it is better that an erroneous decision should sometimes occur , than that parties should have no tribunal to apply to in case of conflicting pretensions , which they are unable to settle by negociation , the consequence of which would be an appeal to force , the supreme court may be considered as the standing arbitrator , agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the cases alluded to . The decisions of this court must therefore always be regarded as made agreeably to truth and justice ; and , though a state may consider a decision wrong , and 196 Gmieral Righii. its interests in consequence of it injuriooaljr aflfoeted , still such state has no right to disregard and disobey , and fiur less to resist the decision of the court . For , they can have no better ground to resist , than the opinion which they entertam of the justice of their case . But , unless they are to be judges in their own cause , this amounts to nothing , because the other party may have an equally good opinion of his side of the questbn ; and , to prevent the evil , which usually arises from such conflicting claims or pretentions , is the very object sought for in estabUshing a common tribunal . There is no mutuality in a general submission to arbitration , where one parQr considers it binding in all cases submitted , whether the decision is for or against him ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own favor . Still the decisions of the supreme court are not to be considered as conclusive evidence of absolute right , politically speaking . For , there is nothing to prevent any state , which considers itself injured by a decision of the supreme court , from urging the injustice of the decision , as a ground , either for amending the constitution , or , for repealing a law of the United States , so far as either of them may have furnished occasion for an unjust decree . It may be observed here , that though the quesdon , whether a certain law or other public measure , be constitudonal or not , in a government of laws , would appear to be very properly submitted to the highest court in the naticm ; yet it does not seem quite reasonable or proper , that the decision of so important a question , should in any case depend upon the opinion of a bare majority of the judges . Since , where a law has been enacted , or other public measure adopted , with the joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has also received the Preadent 's approbation , to suflbr it to depend on the opinion of a bare majority of the judges , to decide whether it is constitutional or not , is to leave it tii nteh case in the power of the single individual , injiose opinion turns the scale , to control the collective voice and wisdom of the whole government . For , it b possible that a law may be enacted unanimously by congress , and be approved of by the President , and , on a question in relation to its coostitutionalily be- Cknerai Righis. 127 fore the supreme court , may be decided to be unconstitutional , by the turning voice of the least able of all the judges on the bench . It would seem more proper in every case , to presume so far on the prudence and wisdom of congress and the President , as to trust in the first instauce , that they would not transcend their authority by enacting an unconstitutional law ; and therefore to consider every law as constitutional , until it had been decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the judges of the supreme court , notwithstanding the opinions of a majority of their number should be agamst it . The constitutionality of a law of any of the states , however , has no claim whatever to be treated with the same respect . For , the majority of congress can seldom or never have any particular or paruiZ interest to serve , in the passage of any unconstitutional law , which in its own nature must be of general application . But each state has its own private interest to consult , distinct from that of the rest , and this interest there is good reason to apprehend , may sometimes tempt the state governments to make unconstitutional attempts to enact and enforce laws , by which the rights of others may be injuriously affected . The presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a state law , consequently , must naturally be much weaker , than that of an act of congress . It would seem therefore a very reasonable distinction , to consider every state law , in relation to the federal constitution , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the state , until it had been decided to be unconstitutional by a majority of the judges of the supreme court of the United States ; while a law of the . United States should be considered as constitutional , until decided not to be so , by a majority of two thirds of the judges of the same tribuoal . The increase of the States in population and wealth , and consequently in political power , is so rapid , that , in all probability before many years will have elapsed , it will be found necessary to adopt some new measures , in order to give the supreme court more weight and strength , in proportion not only to its respectability , as the highest tribunal of justice in the United States , but as the best and firmest barrier , against any usurpation , or tyrannical abuse of political power . It will 138 General Bighit. be found expedient to enable this court to enforce its right ecus decrees instantly in cases of oppression , arising from an abuse of power in violation of the constitution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States should be placed within the protection of thb court so eflbctual** ly , against oppression by an unjust exercise of political power that after a decree in his favor , neither of them should C ( hitinue in jeopardy a day longer than may be necessary to give notice of the judgment of the court . In the theory , the beau ideal of the federal government , no doubt this was intended ; and , by the laws of the union it would seem , that an insurrec tion or levying of troops with or without a pretence of political power , for the purpose of resisting the execution of a decree of the supreme court of the United States , must be treasonable . Yet , where there is no other resistance to the decree of this coun , than what is implied in a simple act of disobedience to it , the penality of the clause of nan omiitaa should be of a severity proportioned to the importance of the case . For , what can be a greater disgrace to the government of the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open ly contemned and disregarded ? To relieve the judges of this tribunal , of part of the great responsibility , which is placed upon them ; to preserve this court as incorruptible , impartial and independent , as it always has been ; to protect it from the obloquy , which upright decisions always occasion in the unjust and unprincipled some such measures as the two following would seem to be advisa* ble to be adopted before many years . 1 1 . To increase the number of judges as high as twelve , at least . S. To establish a seniority among the states , so that , as vacancies hereaftclr arise on the bench , each state in its turn may have the appointment of one of the judges of the supreme court . The appointment might be entrusted to the Governor by and with the consent of the senate of each state . It would be found expedient , also that the Union should be classed under four ' ions of six states each ; and it would be sound policy for the prevention of jealousies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the same division in succession . This would prevent any predominance in the supreme court , of the North over the Southi or of the East over the Weft , and vice versa . In general the policy of havii one department of the gjen* eral government ) depend upon another co-ordbate department , finr the appointment of its officers , seems liable to exception , if it is intended to be , as it ought to be perfectly independent* For the same reason , they ought not to be liable to be removed by an address of both houses . For , while they are exposed to this danger , if any political question should be brought beJpDre them , in which the dominant political party in congress for the Ume being , has any surong interest or bias , the judge will be liable to lose their offices , Uf their views of jus* lice do not coincide with the feelings ola majority of congress . For the same reasons , they ought not to be under any obligations to the President for their nominatioii . All such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence of a judge , and consequently his impartiality , in cases where the President 's views , feelings or interests are concerned m any case brought before the court ; and though such suspicions , it is believed , are almost invariably groundless , yet a judge ought not to be placed in a jtuation , where he may feelan inducenent ungratefully to decide against one to whom he is under obligations and whom he believes to be in the rights or othervrise be exposed to the calumny and obloquy of the illiberal , as if he had sacrificed justice to partiality . The supreme court of the United States is the firmest stay and support of the Union . Being the least swayed by faitj considerations , it is the most upright , and consequendy , in a literal as well as figurative sense , it is the most firm and sta his . Having its foundation in principle , and not in faction , ambition , love of popular applause or selfish interests , it is the most to be relied on of all the departments of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dignity and independence . For , while this department , of the general government is kept spotless and incorruptible , and while it has power to enforce its decrees ; though intrigue and corruption should taiot every other part of the government , the union of the states , and the constitutional or political rights of each individual citizen will still remain unviolable. /z/ i ISO General RighU. 5 . This Chapter it is believed umnot be better terminated than by the quotation ofthefoUotring passages in the opinion of Ch . Jus . Jaj/y in the case of Chisholm v. Creorgia . Prior to the date of the constitutioDy tbe'people bad not any national tribunal , to whicb tbey could resort for justice . The distribution of justice was then confined to state judicatorieSi in whose institution and organization the people of the other atop ad no participation , and over whom they hisd not the least control . There was then no general court of appellate jurisdiction , by whom the errors of state courts , aflfecting either the nation at large , or the citizens of any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obliged to acqui. esce in the measure of justice , which another state might yield to her , or to her citizens , and that even in cases , where state considerations were not al ) eays favorable to the most exact measure . There was danger , that from this source aniniosi ' * ties would in time result ; and as the transition from animosities to hostilities was frequent in the history of independent states , a common tribunal for the termmation of controversies became desirable , from motives both of justice and policy . Prior also to that period , the United states had , t : taking a place among the nations of the earth , become amenable to the laws of nations , and it was their interest , as well as their duty to provide , that those laws should be respected and obeyed . In their national chatracter and capacity , the United States were responsible to foreign nations for the conduct of each state relative to the laws of nations , and the performance of treaties , and there the inexpediency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the courts of delinquent states , became appart . While aU the states were bound to protect eachy and the citizens attach , it w  --  8 highly , proper and reasonable , that they should be in a capacity , not on** y to cause justice to be done io each , and the citizens of each ; but also to cause justice to be done by each , and the citizens of each ; and that , not by violence and force , but , in a stable , sedate , and regular course of judicial procedure . These were among the evils against which it was proper for the nation , that is the people of all the United States to provide by a national judiciary , to be instituted by the whole nation , and to be responsible to the whole nation . Oeneral Righit. 131 Let us now tunx. to the constitutioD The people therein declare that their design in establishing it , comprehended six objects . First , To form a more perfect union . Second , To establish justice . Third , To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common defence . Fifth , To promote the general welfare . Sixth , To secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity . ' *** It may be asked , what is the precise sense and Isititude , in which the- words to establishjuaticef as here used , are to- be understood ? The answer to this question will result from the provisions made in the constitution , on this head . They are specified in the second section of the third article , where it is ordained , that the judicial power of the United . States shaU extend to ten descriptions of cases , viz. First To all cases arising under this constifutlon ; because the meanings construetiofij and operation of a compact j ought always to be ascertain ' ed by aU the parties or by authority derived only from one of them . Second , To all cases arising under the laws of the United States ; beeausCf ds such laws constitutionally , madcj are obligatory on each state the measure of obligation and obedience ought not to be decided and fixed by the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deriving authority from both the parties . Third , To all cases arising under treaties made by their authority ; because , as treaties are compacts made by , and obligatory on , the whole nation , their operation ought not to be affected or regulated by the local laws or courts of apart of the nation . Fourth , To all cases affecting ambassadors , or other public ministers and consuls ; because , as these are offi " esrsofforeign nations , whom this nation are bound to protect and treat according to the laws of nations , cases affecting them ought only to be cognizable by . national authority . Fifth , To all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction , because as the seas are the joint property of nations , whose right and privi hges relative thereto , are regulated by the law of nations and treaties such cases necessarily belong to national jurisdiction . Sixth , To controversies to which the United States shall be a party ; because , in cases in which the whole people are interested , it would not be equal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the justice due to others . Seventh , To con his GMtal Righii. troversies between two or more states ; becMsej domatte fmnjuiHity requires y that the contentions of states should be peaeea " hly terminated by a common judicatory ; and , because , in a free country , justice ought not to depend on the will qfeiiher of the litigants . Eighth , To coDtroversies between a state and citizens of another state ; because in care a state , that is off the citizens of it , has demands against somie citizens of another state , it is better that she should prosecute their demands in a national court , than in a court oj the state to which those citizens belong ; the danger of irritation and criminiUions arising from apprehensions and suspicions of partiality being thereby obviated . Because , in cases where some citizens of one state , have demands against all the citizens of another state , the cause of liberty and the rights of men forbid , that the lot " ter should be the sole judges of the justice due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and equal citizens should have free , fair , and equal justice. * Ninths To controversies between citizens of the same state , claiming lands under grants of different states ; because , as the rights of the two states to grant the land , are drawn into question , neither of the two states ought to decide the controversy . Tenth , To controversies between a state , or the cidzens thereof ; and foreign states , citizens or subjects ; because , as every nation is responsible for the conduct of its citizens towards other nations ; all questions touching the justice due to foreign nations , or people , ought to be ascertained by , and depend on iuitional authority*** * This last clause refers to tiie ground of the partiealar point decided in the case Chisholm y . GeorgjUi , viz. , that under the constitution a state might he sued by a citizen of another state . Tn consequenee of this deeiiioD the eleventii amendment to the constitutioQ was made . Stttmi RgMif. tSS /z/ ( y the P &^eN; ddegaUd t Ike State G# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the people of the several states have formed a politicat ttnion by the fedrd constitution ) for the purpose of providing for the general welfare of ail ; and , for the more effectual ix tuinment of this object have agreed ' upon a frame of governtbent for the United Stated , thus constituting themselves to a certain extent a consolidated empire or govehiment ; in the same manner , die people of e &ch; of the states in the union , have formed a social compact with each other , and have agreed to adopt a state government , for the purpose of providing for the safety and happiness of each and of all the inhabitants , residing within their respective territories , ' t'he general vemment has the care and control of all the external relations of all the states collectively ds one great natibn ; the state governments have the regulation of the internal affairs . of their respective states , and it is their duty to provide for the domestic safety and tranquillity of each citizen . The former protedts the whole nation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign enemies , and all other political dangers , arising either from external or internal causes ; the latter regulates the social intercourse of private individuals with each other in all the various relations of society , and furnishes as far as is practicable , a protection against private violence , fraud or other injustice . As the former depends upon the will or assent of the whole people of all the states in the Union ; so each of the latter depends upoa the will or assent of all the people of each state collectively . As the national compact of the United States is contained in the federal constitution ; so the social compact of the people of each state , is contained in their state constitution , respectively . For the more clear illustration of this doctrine , an example may be taken , viz : The people of the state of Massachusetts have made a social compact with each other , in their state constitution , for the 134 Gmural Rigkf. purpose , among others , of securing their natural rights , as far as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case they act as individuals ; they have also , collectively made a compact with the inhabitants of each of the other states collectively , for their mutual safe and defence against foreign enemies , the terms of which compact are contained in the federal constitution ; in this case , the inhabitants collectively of each state , act as a distinct tribe and independent nation . In this manner and to this extent , the whole people of the United States , by the adoption of the federal constitution have become one great nation , with this qualification , however , that , if the union should be dissolved the whole nation will not be resolved into its primary elements , J. e  --  the people in a state of anarchy , or , in a state of nature , but merely into those elements of a second order , viz. into the tribes or nations , which now reside on the territories of the states respectively , and which are now , and would then still continue to be , in subjection to the respective state governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the federal constitutions shall be paramount in power and obligation to the constitution of the respective states , so that , if there should be discovered any incompatibility between the former and any of the latter of these , it is the latter which must yield . And as some of the state constitutions were adopted previous to the fideral constitution ) , and some afterwards , it follows , that if any of the powers previously bestowed by the people of any of the states , on their respective state governments , m their state constitutions , should be found inconsistent with any powers afterwards conferred by them on the federal government in the federal constitution , the exercfse of those powers by the state governments would be so far taken away , or more properly suspended . On the other hand , if the people of any state , since the adoption of the federal constitution , have granted any powers in the State constitution ; to their respective state governments , and those powers should be found incompatible with any power previously granted to the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state constitution will be considered as so far void . In the former case , it is presumed that the people of the states j by their adoption ol the federal constitution have agreed to waive the General Bighii. 135 pYoyisioDS of One state constitution , so far as the inconsistency extends In the latter , it is considered not to be within the power of any state , to curtail the powers granted in the federal constitution , without the consent of the other states . From these general propositions , as a basis , it follows , that any article xx provision in a state constitution , which may interfere with the provisions of any national treaty whether made before or . afterwards , if agreeable to the constitution of the United States , will be so far void . And lor the same reason , if any article in a state constitution should be found to interfere with an act of congress , whether enacted before or afterwards , agreeably to the constitution of the United States , will also be so far void . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made agreeably to the constitution of the United States , is entitled to the same respect as the constitution itself , since each must be made by virtue of powers granted by it . But , where a certain power is granted to congress in the federal constitution , which without any inccHisistenoy or inconvenience may also be exercised by the states the grant to congress , does not necessarily imply a prohibition to the states to exercise the same power . But , where the exercise of the same powers by both the federal government and the respective state governments , is incompatible , if both should legislate on the same subject , the act of congress must prevail and will suspend not only all laws made by the states concerning that subject , but of course the power itself in the state constitution , t'or example , congress have the constitutional power to pass a general bankrupt law ; but , until they exercise this power , the states may enact a bankrupt law within their respective territories . If confess ? afterwards enact  --  general banknipt law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of the state legislatures to act on the same subject . If congress then repeals the general bankrupt law , the power of the state to legislate on that subject , again revives . See 4 Wheat . 122 . It may be remarked here mcidentally , that , as the states can not directly impede or hinder the exercise or operation of any of the constitutional powers of congress , or of any department of the general government , for the sanoe reason any law of a state , which imUrecily tends to the same purpose , will be 80 far void . See ' 4 Wheat . 316. h wtll be obned on onmiltdai some of the ttate cooati t a tioDs , that they eoataia words expressive of a grant of poweri wfabh though limited y are within the limits* Theeei it is obvious , most be suspended on aonuUed , so &r; as thej are irreconoilable with the constitution of the United States , or any treaty or act of congress , made by virtue of it . But , if it should ever happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fault on the part of the state govemmeota , it cau ' - not be doubted but that all sMch sovereign powers expressijf granted in the state constitutions , will immediaty revive and be in force , until altered or resumed by the people of those states respectively . Subject to thcise few restrictions and rules of constniction , the powers delegated to each state government by the people of the state , may be readily ascertained by consulting the 3tate constitution . And here it will be observed , that some of thee social compacts , have a declaration of the natural rights of the citizens prefixed , with an intimation how many of them , and to what exteut , they are submitted to , or exempted from the control of the state government erected by the state constitution ; or , from the powers granted by it to the state rulecs . If any contradiction should seem to exist between the bill of rights and the constitution of any state , in any particular respect , it would seem reasonable to consider the constitution a the compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d legated , and the bill of rights as merely the basis or substrafpoiy on which such delegation is predicated . The consututioii therefore , in any such case , where the iutent of it is clearly expressed , ought not to be restrained by the bill of rights But where the iutent of the constitution is not precisely ascer* tainable of itself , it would be very proper to consider the biU of rights , as furnishiug the best means of iascertaining the true meaning of those who framed the constitution , and giving a just construction to it . Wher the bill of rights is clear , do " claring explicitly what fights the people are entitled to enjoy in relation to a particular subject , if the constitution is silent in relation to it , all laws or regulations of the legislature made not to preserve but to contravene , limit , or infriBge sjjch rights , are void ; because they will have been eaactedy Vfkkawtt any iMtbority from the people .

The frame of government of each ' of the states , is very similar m principle to that of all the rest , flaob of them has a governor , or chief eieeutiye officer , with or without a coun- cil ; a legislature , eonsisting of an upper and a lower house , . or a senate and bouse of representatives ; and a Judiciary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted by the legislature by virtue of powers conferred as them for that purpose , in that compapt . The governors are chosen for one or more years ; but no pne holds bis office either for life , ofs during good behavior Tbp democratic priiciple , which Juns ttirough all the state governments , as well as the government of the United States , is most discoverable in the legislature , consisting of a senate or upper house , a body of men , presumed to be distinguished for their gravity , dignity of character , experience and wisdom ; and , a lower house or bouse of representatives or delegates , supposed to consist of men arrived at mature agei but retaining their full strength and capacity for active business . These characteristic qualiSeasons however are sometimes lost sight of , and are frequently found interchanged in the two houses It is not very unu. qual to see youthful sages in the senate ; it is. not uncommon to behold in the lower house , ardent temperaments , whose desire to render themselves conspicuous by their eloquence , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the states have taken care , that the lower house /z/ 138 General Rights . shall not become so numerous , as to be liable *br possibility , to assuqe the appearance of an irregular or primary assembly of the people . Some however still continue oppressed as with an incubus J by a bouse of representatives excessively numerous , which the people have frequently , but in vain , expressed a wish to have diminished . The disadvantages , which might naturally be expected to result from too numerous a house of representatives , are , 1 . Unstable legislation ; many new members are desirous of ' rendering themselves conspicuous by the introduction of some fancied reform , and this , without being well acquainted with the state of the laws then in force . The disadvantage of fre- , quent changes in the laws , is , , that the people never know when they are safe ; for , they hardly can have time to learn what the laws are before they are repealed , atid new ones enacted . 2 . A great increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probability , would arise , in part , from the zeal of the members to seem active in the service of the people ; and partly , because the proximity of a member of the house , would frequently suggest to bis neighbors a variety of applications to the legislature , which might hardly be thought of under other circumstances . The time consumed by the legislature , in the consideration of private applications respecting affairs of little or no moment to the public , may frequently be of more value in a pecuniary point of view , than the grant or denial of the application ; yet , as every member in the house has a right to be heard on every subject , the time consumed in any debate , may obviously depend upon the number of speakers who choose to avail themselves of this right ; this naturally suggests , 3 . Prolonged debates and almost inter " minable speeches . The propensity to indulge in popular declamation , which excites ambitious persons to deliver long harangues before numerous assemblies , loses much of its foixe , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of individuals , each of whom the orator perceives to be a man of experience and discernment , and consequently not likely to be agreeably affected , or at all influenced by common place appeals to popular prejudices or predilections , the flourishes and sallies of debating clubs or the rhetoric of the academies. general Rightr. 139 4 . A vast expense to the state not only directly in money actually expended f but indirectly , in the waste oj time , which might he m4 ) re profitably employed . This is a subject of frequent remarki but the amount of the loss arising to the state in this way , is not estimated as it ought to be , from not being considered with sufficient attention , and submitted to calculation . Let it be supposed then that the senate contains forty members , and the house of representatives double that number , which , if the difference in years and experience , and consequently in weight of character , is considered , will be a reasonable or proportional estimate . . Suppose the pay of the representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel fees of each member , one with another , to amount on an average to five dollars for both coming and returning , and the seision of the legislature to continue ninety days . Then the whole . charge on the state for a single session of the house of representatives , will be composed , so far as the present subject is concerned , of the following particulars . The attendance of eighty members , at two dollars a day for ninety days , will amount to $14,400 ; to which adding the travel fees of eighty members at five dollars apiece , viz. four hundred dollars , the whole amount will be $14,800 . On the other band , let it be supposed , that the house of representatives contains five hundred members . Then , at the same rate , it will be seen , that their pay , being two dollars a day , for five hundred representatives , for ninety days , will amount to $90,000 , and their travel fees will be 2,600 ; the whole amount of both will be $92,500 . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there would be an . annual saving to the state of $77,700 in money . If it is further considered , that , in all probability , the sessioa of the legisla , ture would be shortened , at least one third , by the reduction of the numbers of the representatives , in consequence of the subtraction of unim jK ) rtant business , the suspension of unprofitable debate , and the infrequent recurrence of questions of order and formality , , there would be a further saving of $4,800 , with about half as much for the senate , viz. $2,400 ; amounting together to $7 , ? 00 to be added to the former saving of $77 , - 700 . The whole saving to the state , in money alone , in con- ) 40 General Aigkts. dequeneis of thus reducing the ntitxtber of repreentadvei f thus appears , would probably be 84,900 . This howeVd would not be all , as appears from the Allowing consideration ! It would be a degrading estimate of the value of the service of those individuals , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services are wanted at all , to ' suppose that their private business , which they are obfiged U neglect while they are attending in the house of representatives , would not bring them in , as much as the pay which they nsceive for their public duties . On the supposition , then , baf the public good would be as well provided for in a less nutne rous house of representatives ; and that the attendance of aD beyond the proposed number of eighty representative , h. wholly useless ; and that each of those members , on an aver* age , would , in his private capacity , or , in his regular calling , perform services , or earn , to the amount of two dollars a day ; it will appear , that the public lose by having five hundred representatives , the amount which four hundred and twenty o them might earn in ninety days , at two dollars a day , deduct-* ing however every seventh day . This loss will readily be found to amount to $75,600 . And though it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the treasury of the commonwealth ; yet , it ought by no means to be wholly neglected by those , who wish to form a cottect judgment of the expediency or inexpediency of public measures . Under these views of this subject , can any one donbt , that it would greatly advance the public interest , in any such Case , to reduce the representation in this manner and to this extent ? Or , if eighty members of the house were selected , can any one doubt , that they would be a far more wise and efficient body than the whole number of five hundred , though includ* ing the sande eighty ? Would not the public service be better consulted and sooner performed ? Would not the commonwealth in that case , be better able to afford to attend to minute business , at the same time that less of it would be brought before the legislature ? Would not there be fewer laws passed , and would they not be more likely to survive the session of the legislature at which they were enacted ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better fer the other four hundred ' attd tweo representatiTes to remain at home ? But , perhaps It wSl be objected , that it will be impractica-* ble to apportbd this reduced number of eigbtf , properly or Equally . But , in fket , there needs be but little difficulty on the subject . Let the apportionment be , diat each county send one , and then let the rest of the eighty representatives , be ap- portioned among those counties whose population entitlea them to more than one representative , in proportion to th number of inhabitants , or the rateable polls , or the qualified Voters for representatives , as may be judged best . If it should be objected , in any such case , that the mode of electing representatives , will , in this viray , become too much assimilated to that of electing senators ; the answer is , that , let the representatives be chosen in what way they may , still they must be chosen by the people of the same state , who elect the senators . To district the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , is mierely a piece of political pedantry , and would be attended with no benefit whatever . Its only recommendation is a - show of wisdomi But , perhaps it will be objected , that the representatives are in the nature of agents for the towns by which they are chosen ; and , if this mode of apportionment should be adopted , the towns would lose their agents . The answer is , that this would be a general benefit and not a disadvantage . Because , it would be much better that , the representatives should consider themselves , as the representatives of the people of the state , and owing a duty to the whole state , than consider themselves as the mere agents or instruments of the towns which send Aem , and accountable to them alone for their behaviour in office . If they consider themselves in the former light , they will feel bound to consult the general good of the whole state , though it shotlld happen to be inconsistent with some inconsid erable local interest . But , if they consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tempted to sacrifice the good of the state , to that of the little clan which elects them , whenever those interests come into competition , from an apprehension that otherwise , they shall not be again returned to the legislature . 142 General RighU . : If the representatives are chosen in the way suggested , and their number is limited to double that of . the senate , they will become at the same time more independent , and more respected . Petty intrigue and compromise ; will be . more likely to cease . There will be less fluctuation in the laws , and there will be a greater probability that the weak point in a democratic government , may become equally its ornament and stronghold . The future historian will probably smile at the simplicity of the citizens of any state thus situated , who should confide the task of reforming its representation in this particular , to the representatives themselves , Whose numbers are to be reduced by the amendment . Is it to be expected that the representative of an inconsiderable village , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the house of representatives , even though he should relieve the village of a large proportion of its state tax ; a consequence , which it has been shown , will certainly follow from the reduction of the . number of the representatives ? That they ought to be reduced , few will risk their reputation for political sagacity , so far , as to deny ; but , the object of a denial of its expediency may just as well be obtained , by refusing under one pretext or other , to concur in any amendment which can be proposed and making it a theme for never ending debate . If the people wish to have this measure adopted , they should take care to give their representatives explicit instructions to that effect ; for , it is an evil , which yearly increases with the growth of the country , and will never remedy itself . 2 . With regard to the powers delegated to the state governments by the people of the respective states , in their state constitutions , it may be remarked , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of ' regulating the election or appointment of all public officers ; making provision for the administration of justice ; providing for the support of the government of the state , and adopting such measures , and enacting such laws from time to time as shdll be found expedient for the safety , welfare , growth and general prosperity of the state ; always however in subjection to the powers delegated to the general government in the constitution of the United States . General Rigkii , 148 For the purpose of obtaining these general objects , particular powei% are given in the state constitutions , more or less extensive and subject to various restrictions . Beyond these express powers and such others as must necessarily be implied , in order to render the exercise of those which are expressed , effectual , neither the legislature nor any other branch of the state government , can constitutionally proceed . If they should attempt to do soj it would be an attempt to usurp power ; and their laws or other acts ' would be void and without obligation .

Per Cu- /z/ The acts of a state legislature may therefore be void , either ' because they are contrary to the constitution of the United States , or to some treaty or act of congress , made under its authority .

So , if an act of a state legislature , should tend to hinder , or burthen , or control the operation of any constitutional law enacted by congress . So , if a state legislature should enact a law , without having any authority under the state constitution , and especially if contrary to any prohibition contained either in it , or in the bill /z/ 1415 ' General Rig/Ui. of rights . The restrictions upon the Powers of the States will be further considered under Chapter VL And here a question may arise of great importance and deep interest to the United States , as well as to each of the several states . As the constitution of the United States is a compact , by which the citizens of the United States have delegated to their rulers certain limited powers , and have made an express reservation , either to the states or to the people , of all powers not delegated in it ; suppose one of the states , or a private individual should be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enacted an unconstitutional law ; what remedy can be had ? It has been seen before , that an unconstitutional law , whether enacted by congress or by a state legislature , is equally void , because it is an infringement of the national compact . If the officers of the federal government or of the state government , should attempt to enforce it , any private individual injured by it , might bring his action and have the question of the constitutionality of the law settled in the last resort , before the supreme court of the United States . If the law were decided to be constitutional , there would be an end of the question , so far as concerns any private individual . But , if the law of congress had a particular bearing on the interest or policy of one or more of the states which considered the law as not authorized by any powers , really intended to be granted to congress by the federal constitution , however it might seem to be included within them by the generality of the terms made use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , without being driven to the necessity of impugning the correctness of the decision , and without having recourse to the rash and treasonable attempt of forcibly opposing the law , or the decree of the supreme court grounded on it . might justifiably adopt the following course of measures , if thought expedient ; viz. 1 . They might send a remonstrance to congress , alluding to the decision of the supreme court , and stating , that though the question of the constitutionality of the law , might be considered as so far settled in the affirmative , in a technical sense , that it must be considered as the law of the land and obeyed as such , until repealed ; yet , they did not consider such law , as General Righ. 147 eomitig , in fact , within the real intention of the parties to the constitution . They might then state their objections to it , and show the inequality of its operation , or in what manner it tended to silcrifice the interests of the states complaining , either to that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more particular states , or , in general point out in what respect it was unconstitutional . They might conclude with requesting a repeal of the law , or a modification of it in those offensive particulars . If the offensive law were not repealed or modified ;  --  2 . They might appeal to the states ; t. e. either to the respective states , or to the respective state governments , both or either , as might be thought expedient , stating the whole case , and all the public proceedings , which had taken place in relation to it . They might also state theinjury or injustice , which they and their interests suffered in consequence of the operation of the law . They might then request the citizens , to instruct their representatives in congress , by a declaration in convention , to endeavor to procure a repeal of the law . They might also call on the state legislatures , to declare , what in their opinion the true construction of the constitution of the United States , in relation to the offensive law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , if an opinion favorable to its constitutionality were expressed /z/ 3 . They might setid a second remonstrance directed to congress , another similar one directed to the legislatures of the several states , and a third of the same import , addressed to the citizens of each of the states collectively , as members or constituent parts of the Union . This remonstrance might contain in substance , that , though under a strict construction of the constituti ( Hi , it might perhaps be considered , that con- congress had a power to pass the law complained of ; yet , in feet , it never was in the contemplation of the states remonstra ' - ting , to grant congress any such power ; that the exercise of it was injurious to them , and that they therefore requested the constitution might be so amended , as to restrain the exercise of such power for the time to come . If this application also fisiiled of obtaining the desired object ;  --  Lastly : They might send a remonstrance addressed to the respective states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 148 Oeneral Rights . States , as forming collectively one great natioo . In this rexmonstrance they might state , that , when the constitution of the United States was adopted , the states remonstrating did not intend to enter into such a compact , as that national agreement bad been ccmstrued to contain ; that , under this instrument laws had been enacted , which were subversive of their interests , and unauthorized by any power which they had intended to grant by that compact ; that they had made application for redress , in every mode which could reasonably be expected of them , but in vain ; that the union , thevetare , had not been attended with all the advantages , which they bad contemplated in adopting it ; and on the contrary , some evils had . resuhed to them from it , which more diaq counterbalanced all the benefit which they had derived from it , or could expect from a continuance of their connexion with the union ; and that therefore , they requested the consent of their brethren , associates , and fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw themselves from the union . Further than this , it is not thought worth while to carry the supposition , because it is hoped , that such extraordinary- folly will never b found either in the people of the United States , or , in the people of any state ; or , in those delegates or representatives , to whom the people of either government may intrust the decision of this momentous question , as to dissolve the union on any such account . * * * * Haying skipped the crimson page , which might naturally be expected here , since , let the attempt at separation be commenced how it may , there is but little hope , that it will ever be effected without bloodshed ; suppose the union to be dissolved , and that the calm of peace has at length succeeded , what will become of the fdme and renown of those distinguished statesmen , who framed , and persuaded the people of the United States to adopt , the present admirable system of geieral government ? certainly , if this attempt to induce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictates of rson , religion and virtue , should prove unsuccessful , the foundation upon which the reputation of those politicians for wisdom , isjgrounded , will be swept away by torrents of vice and corruption ; and the names of most of those who have been flattered Cknal Rights . 149 by holidaj oratory , that their gk would be imperishable , will be effaced fix ) ni the ooluoins of time , before this century has passed away* But , what is this in comparison with the degraded and imbecile state , to which this now great and flourishing republic will infallibly be reduced ? Two other questions naturally suggest themselves here . 1 . If a law should be passed by congress , or any other public measure be adopted by the federal government , injurious to the interests of a particular state , and which should be decided by the supreme court of the United States to be constitutional , does the right , which the state has of adopting the course of remonstrance , jut considered , belong to the govememment of the state or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , to the citizens ? ' The answer obviously must be , that , since , agreeably to the constitution of the United States , all rights , not delegated in it , are reserved to the states , or to the people , the determination of this question will depend upon the respective state constitutions . For , if the people of any state have given this superintending power to their state rulers in their constitution , those rulers will have the right to interpose , in the cases and in the manner before suggested and to that extent , but no further , between the general government and the people of their slate . For , that such a power may be delegated by the citizens of each state , to their state rulers in general , or to the legislative , or the executive , or the judicial department singly , can not be doubted ; But , unless this power is thus expressly delegated , it must remain in the citizens ; and , in that case , the interference of the state government itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurpation of illegal authority . It will not be denied , however , that , if the legislature of any state , should feel convinced that a law injurious to the interests of the state , and not warranted by the federal constitution , or the real intention of those who adopted it , had been enacted by congress , they would be bound to make it known to the people of the state , so that all proper measures might be adopted to procure its repeal . But , further than this , the state governments can not constitutionally proceed , without authority 150 Crenercd BighU. from their citizens . For , within the powers delegated in the federal constitution , the government of the United states v &; the government , not only of all the states taken coUectivelyy as one great nation ; but , also is the government of each state taken separately ; in the same manner , that within the powers delegated in the state constitutions , the state governments have the sovereign control of the affairs of the respective states , provided they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither the federal government , nor any of tb9 state governments can justly transcend their assigned limits . On examination of the state constitutions , however , it is believed , that no such power will be found to be given to the state governments , either expressly or by necessary implication , to interpose between the federal government and the citizens of any of the states ; indeed , there would seem to be a manifest impropriety in intrusting any such power to them , if it is considered in what manner the state governments are Organized . For , as the governor , as well as the members of the state legislatures , are chosen for short periods only , there could be but litde dependance placed upon the permanence of any measures which , in an emergency of this nature , they might see fit to adopt ; since however wise , firm and consistent the characters of the rulers may be , the administration of public afiaira in popular governments , will always fluctuate , more or less according to the , frequency of elections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the public sentiment will immediately remove from ofiSce , all those individuals , whose offices are elective , and who are not pliant enough to accommodate their professions to the doctrines of the times ; and will put in their place , persons entertaining different opinioQS , and who consequently will kdopt a difibreot course of public measures . Besides , though the individuals usually selected for the public service , may be esteemed by the people , well qualified to atiswer the ordinary occasions of the public , by enacting the necessary laws for the regulation of the internal afifairs of the state , and in the exercise of the powers conferred on the state governments in the state constitutions ; yet , it is not at all unlikely , that , for the more importt occasions of altering the state constitution itseify  --  fo the General RMgli4i. 151 moroentous crisis of assuming a new attitude with regard to the federal government , as well i an unexpected relation to the other states , the citizens of a state would think it expedient to call upon the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less would he thought adequate to direct them in any so dangerous a conjuncture . Further ; though aspiring men , even in the highest offices of the state administration , if restricted to the exercise of the powers conferred on them by the state constitution , would have but little opportunity of disturbing the tranquillity of society , m the common course of afbirs ; yet , if any power were conferred on such persons by the people , or , if they were permitted to usurp a power , to interfere in the manner before suggested , or , in any other manner between the government of the United States and the citizens of their own state , the most , dangerous consequences might ensue . Because the strong desire , which such persons always have , to distinguish themselves in the eyes of the citizens T ) f their own state , might prompt them to seize upon every pretence to rail against the general government ; and , as far as inflammatory harangues seditious and turbulent resolves , messages and addresses would go , to set it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of an actual encroachment upon some of the rights of the state , instead of adopting the wise and magnanimous course of friendly expostulation and remonstrance , thus giving the general government an opportunity of retracing its steps and redressing the grievance , if there were one , would gladly avail themselves of any such occasion , and from motives of selfish aandizement would be tempted to raise the standard of hostility , in the rash and unprincipled attempt to dissolve the union by force . Yet , what could they hope 4o gain by any such attempt ? Certainly , the most probable consequence would be , that , though they might bring upon their own state the illimitable horrors of intestine war , they would ultimately be compelled to submit to reasonable terras of compromise , and observe the national compact to which all have agreed . It would be desirable , without doubt , that the power , now under consideration , should be confided to the governor and the members of both houses of the legislature of the respective d 153 Chtteral Righii. states iTtbeir term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less reason to distrust the consistency as well as perma  - -  nence of their public measures ; because , they then , would become the guardians and prbtectors of the rights of the state against the encroachments , not of the general goyemment , for of this there is hardly a possibility , but of the legislativedepartment of it . If then , congress should enact a law , which the authorities of a state considered to be unconstitutional and injurious to the interests of the state , those state rulers would immediately take care to have the question of its constitutionality determined by the supreme court of the United States ; and , if aggrieved by their decision , would adopt the regular course before suggested , so far as was just and exp dient , without the necessity of convening primary assemblies of the people , a measure selddm desu-able , or in any manner disturbing the tranquillity of the public mind . The suppose tion indeed is possible , though perhaps it would be better to consider it impossible , that there might be a final difference of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient consequence , to demand for their preservation , the dissolution or dismemberment of the union . But , as it seems really haypossible , that a necessity for adopting a measure so fatal to the strength and prosperity of this now great and flourishing nation , should ever arise from any other cause than the selfish or angry passions of the leaders and partizans of the variousparties or factions , which already distract the country ; if the people of the United States , or those of either of the several states , ever have recourse to this miserable alternative , they will have nothing to which to ascribe the loss of the happiness , , whiclij if they choose , they , may enjoy under their complicated but admirable system of government , and the total decline of their rank among the nations of the earth , but their infatua- tion , their ignovance of their true interests , their misplaced confidence in superficial orators and selfish statesmen , and their weak concessions to rude importunity and senseless clamor . 2 . It may be asked ; are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , with regard to what are generally considered as constitutional questions ? Cfeneral Rights . 153 The answer must be , that , in one respect , there are limits , but in another , ther9 are none . It would seem , that congress must always be bound by a decision of the supreme court of the United States ; but the states are not always bound . If the supreme court should decide , that a law is unconstitutional , congress must always be bound by the decision , because the authority of that court to decide upon the constitutionality of all laws enacted by congress , proceeds from the same source from which congress derives all its authority , to enact laws . They therefore can not deny the authority of the court , in this respect , without removing the foundation of their own powers But with regard to the states , th case is different . For , the states have delegated to the government of the United States certain limited powers only , and , for the purpose of providing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed to them , have erected the supreme court to decide , in the last resort , whether they exceed their powers or not If therefore the supreme court should decide that any measure of the government of the United States is unconstitutional , it would be considered from that moment illegal and void , and the general government would be bound by the decision . But , if the supreme court should decide that the mea* sure is constitutional , a further question may arise , which iS whether the point decided , comes within the jurisdiction of that court a limited in the constitution of the United States ; for , if it does not , the decision of the court will not bind the states . In order that the supreme court should have jurisdiction in relation to a particular subject , it must either be conferred in the constitution in express terms , or it must be necessa ry to the exercise of some authority expressly delegated in the constitution . In either case , there would seem to be but little question as to the jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction conferred on them in the constitution , over the subject matter involved in their decision . If they have not , their decision , though obligatory on the national government , when given against them , because this court always has authority to decide that a measure , purporting to be adopted under the authority of the constitution , is in fact unconstitutional ; yet , if given in favor of the general /z/ 154 General Rights . government and against the states , will not be bindbg . It iB true , within the jurisdiction conferred by the constitution , every decision of the supreme court , must be submitted to by the states , since , by adopting the federal constitution they have agreed to do so ; and , on the improbable supposition , that the court should make an incorrect decision in fact , still it must be considered as correct , and obeyed as such , there being no higher court of appeal provided by the constitution . But , how can the states be bound by the decisions of the supreme court , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to them by the states , in the federal constitution ? If it is asked ;  --  how can it be ascertained , whether such jurisdiction is granted in the constitution , or not , otherwise than by the construction given to it by the supreme court , and which they dione are authorized to decide in the last resort ; the answer must be , that the question , whether a certain jurisdiction is conferred in the constitution , or not must be determined by a reference to the constitution itself . This subject is not left to the mere discretion of the court . For , as this court can neither extend its jurisdiction beyqnd the express limits prescribed to it ; so neither can it assume jurisdiction in cases where the constitution is silent . It can never depend upon mere construction . For , where the constitution is entirely silent in relation to a particular subject , and where the powers delegated to the supreme court can be exercised without giving authority or jurisdiction in relation to that subject , it must be self-evident , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no small argument of the excellence and wisdom of the provisions in the constitution , that , in order to find cases not provided for in it , recourse must be had so frequently to absurd or at least very improbable suppositions . Let it be supposed then for a moment , that the supreme court should assume jurisdiction of a suit , commenced by a citizen of a state against another state , and that the court should decree against the state sued , can it 1 ) 0 imagined , that the state would be bound to submit to the decree ? Certainly not ; because one of the amendments to the constitution of the United States , expressly provides , that the judicial power of the federal government shall not extend Creneral Bights. 155 to such a case . Suppose again , that this court should entertain jurisdiction on a prosecution for a crime , committed within a state and against the laws of the state alone , would not any judgment which this court might pronounce in this case , be wholly void ? No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of delegated powers , can depend upon the construction of the delegate alone . No one can be so absurd as to imagine , that the limited jurisdiction of any court , however high , can be extended by the mere construction of the court itself . This sviject will be farther examined in a different conneociany in the need chapter . 156 General RighU. /z/ Of the Independence of the States and the Sovereignty of the Union considered together and how far the latter is consistent with the former . To form just and adequate ideas od the subject of the present chapter , it may not be amiss to consider shortly , what would be the condition of the several states , if the Union among them were peaceably dissolved , and , with that single exception , every thing else were left in the same situation that it now is . The people of each state , it is apparent , would then find themselves in possession of a distinct territory , with a separate regularly organized government , fully authorized by the people for the regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any power to wage a foreign or offensive war ; yet having full authority to resist invasions from without , and to suppress tumults and insurrections within ; and generally to provide for the public peace and the domestic tranquillity of its citizens , and the support and maintenance of the government . Under such circumstances as these , and acknowledging no earthly superior in any other government or tribunal whatever , it is impossible not to perceive , that each state would be completely sovereign and independent . It was in this condition , that those states of the American Union claimed to be , which agreed to the articles of confederation ; and , with the exception of that compact , this was the situation those states were in , which first agreed to adopt the federal conrtitution . It i thusvapparent , that the constitution of the United States isthe only restraint , which the several states have imposed upon their own independence . It is also the only bond that unites them under one government . A proper regard for their own interests , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , and might also induce them to ' form alliances for mutual protection against external aggression . But such conse- General Rights . 157 consequences would greatly fall short of the advantages , to be derived from a union , under a constitution like that of the United States . For , the general government , being invested by it with all the powers of peace and war , and with the control also of the whole resources of all the states , vdthout being under any necessity of consulting the local authorities , in these respects has all the consistency and strength of a great empire , with no other restraint upon the exercise of the vast powers thus bestowed in the constitution , than requiring , that they shall be employed for the general good of all the states , and not to advance any partial , local , or sectional interests . The independence of the several states , . is therefore confined to the relation existing among them , as individual states . But , no state is independent of the union , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the federal constitution . Their absolute independence is limited , just so far as they have seen fit to limit it themselves , in that national compact ; but no further . What then is the construction , that ought to be given ta this compact , in this respect ? Two principles of construction are laid down in express terms , in the amendments to the constitution , and which consequently have become part of the constitution on itself . 1 . That the enumeration in the constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . ' 2. * The powers , not delegated to the United States , by the constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people. * It is believed , that the former of these principles is not whdly free fit ) m obscurity . The intent of it , however , probably was , that the enumeration of certain rights eocpressly re-* tained by the people shall not be constriied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up in the constitution , and not contained in such enumeration . Among the powers most characteristic of sovereignty , given to congress in the constitution , are , 1 . The power of laying taxes , duties , imposts and excises , for the purpose of paying the national debts , and providing for the common defence and general welfare , &c.; 2 . The power to regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several states , be . /z/ 158 General Rights . 3 . The power to establish a rule of naturalization . By the present rule established by the exercise of this power , an alien may become a citisen of the United States , without being a citizen of any of the states . For , though by naturalization he becomes entitled to the privileges of a citizen of the United States , and consequently to the privileges of a citizen of that state to which he belongs , or wherein he may see fit to reside ; yet , if the union should be dissolved , he would be come again a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abode , saw fit to adopt him . 4 . The powers to coin money ; to establish post roads ; to raise and support armies ; to provide a navy , &cc.; The restrictions upon the authority of congressy are merely such restraints and limitations , as the people of the United States have seen fit to impose on their government , and are not the exceptions merely of powers , reserved to the state governments . The restriction upon the authority of the states , relate to the exercise of such sovereign powers , as the citizens of the states , if they had thought expedient , might have entrusted to their respective state governments ; but , having confided some of these powers to congress , and having expressly restricted congress from the exercise of the rest there would be an apparent inconsistency and impropriety , in permitting the states to exercise them . No state , therefore , can enter into any treaty , alliance or confederation , whatever . This applies as well to tireaUes , alliances and confederacies , &c.; between two or more states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more of the states , and a foreign nation . But , though certain powers are denied or forbidden to the state governments , in the federal constitution , which the people of the respective states might otherwise have delegated to their respective state governments ; it by no means follows , that other powers not mentioned among those which are thus forbidden or denied , may , of course , be lawfully exercised by the states . For , this must depend upon the language of the state constitutions themselves , respectively . The general superintending power , intended to be bestowed on congress , by the federal constitution , is also apparent from the provision , that the United States shall guarantee to General Rights . 159 every state in the union , a republican form of government . This expression admits of considerable latitude of interpretation . It is probable , however , that any form of government , where the rulers were not hereditary , and depended for their appointment upon the choice of the people , would be considered a republic , within the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , therefore , saw fit to adopt a state constitution , in which the governor and senate were chosen for life , or during good behaviour , and to vest in them the discretionary exercise of all the powers , which the state governments may now properly exercise , under the federal constitution , the government would still be a republic , within the meaning of the constitution ; and , if those state rulers did not abuse their powers , in an attempt to overstep the limits prescribed by it , the general government would have no right to interfere . The supreme political power of the government of the United States , is further apparent , from the clause Jn the constitution , in which the people of each of the states agree , that the constitution , and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof , and all treaties made , or which shall be made under the authority of the United States , shall be the supreme law of the land ; and the judges in every state shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any state to the contrary notwithstanding- ' Perhaps there Is not a clause in the whole federal constitution , the strict observance or enforcement of which , is more essential to the dignity of the general government , than the one now under consideration . For , if the judges of the state court were not bound to conform to the constitution of the United States , in their decisions , nor to obey the laws of the union , then one of the principal objects in view in the formation of the union , would not be obtained ; and in fact there would be no union . But , as laws , which are enacted by congress under pretence of a power , which in fact is not granted by the federal constitution , are not binding , it may be asked , how shall it be determined , whether such power is granted or not , when a case , involving the rights of individuals under a law of the United States , comes before one of the state courts , and an objection is made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 160 General Rights . naturally suggests itself , is , that congress should generally be presumed to have acted within their constitutional authority , unless the contrary is clearly demonstrated . The state judge ought therefore to decide accordingly . But if he is convinced , that the law is enacted without such constitutional authority , be ought to decide so . If any authority is given at all to a state judge to decide in any such case , he must have authority to decide correctly f that is , according to the impartial dictates of bis own judgment . A judge has no right in conscience , to decide contrary to what he believes to be the justice of the case , on the supposition , that the case will be carried to the constitutional tribunal in the last resort ; for this may not take place . Any party , however , aggrieved at the decision of a state court in any such case , may always have a hearing before the supreme court of the United States ; and when the question has been once settled there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts in all such cases from that time , by which they will be bound to govern themselves , whatever their own private opinions may be . In order to strengthen the arm of the general government , the federal constitution has wisely given authority to congress to pass all laws , which may be necessary for the exercise of the powers , granted in the constitution . This clause is one of the greatest importance , because , though this auxiliary power might have been considered , as necessarily implied from the grant of the principal powers themselves ; yet the omission would probably have given rise to innumerable objections and cavils . Under this clause , congress has a sufficient author ! to apply an adequate remedy for every difficulty , that may arise in the execution of the powers granted in the federal constitution , and consequently , in putting in force all laws made by virtue of those powers . In pursuance of this general authority , given in the sweeping clause of the federal constitution , congress has taken care , by the creation of proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct from the officers of the several states , to render the execution of the laws of the United States entirely independent of any act of any particular states , or of any of their officers , and without the necessity of requesting the consent or co-operation of Chneral Rights , 161 the executive , legislative or judicial departments of the states , where such laws of congress are to be put in force . But , if it had been necessary , in any such - case , to have the previous consent of the states , the execution of the law might liave been greatly delayed , perhaps wholly frustrated ; or , if the officers of the states were employed in the execution of the laws of the United States , as there would be no obligation upon them to perform such services , unless perhaps the several states enacted laws for the purpose of rendering it so , it would remain optional with such officers , whether to execute them or not . For , it has been found by experience , that the idol popularity , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resign his office , rather than offend the citizens of the state where he resided , by discharging his official duties . But , in general , the officers of the United States , not depending upon the states either for their appointments or for their continuance in office , supposing them to have a proper regard for their official oaths , can have nothing to hinder or delay them in the discharge of their duties . For , on the extreme supposition , that a law of the United States is unconstitutional , as well as impolitic and injurious to ihe interests of a particular state ; still , unless it is decided to be unconstitutional by the supreme court of the United States , the officers of the general government are bound to enforce it . Nor is it clear , upon what ground , except a regard for the dictates of prudence , forbearance and temporary expediency , they would be bound to regard a decision of the state courts to the contrary , if they should assume to themselves a power to determme upon the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the construction , which ought to be given to a law of the United States , and ground their decision in the cause before them , upon the unconstitutionality of the law , the person aggrieved by the decision , if a private individual , may have bis remedy at the regular constitutional tribunal , but will have no pretext whatever to resist the decision of the state court . But , on the extreme supposition , that a law of the United States requires One of the officers of the national government to perform a certain duty , and one of the state courts decides the law to be unconstitutional , is or is not the officer of the United /z/ 162 General Rights . Slates , however high and responsible his situation , bound at his peril to await the decision of the supreme court of the United States on the subject , before he undertakes to enforce the law contrary to the decision of the state court ? Whatever the prevailing opinion may be on this subject , as to the legal duties , there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost delicacy , moderation and forbearance ought to be used in all cases , where by possibility there may be a clashing of jurisdictions . The aim of each party should be , not so much to assert his strict right in the first instance , as , by mild and prudent measures , to put his adversary in the wrong , in the hope that the supreme court of the United States , whenever the case is regularly brought before them , will award ample redress to the party injured . And here , it is worthy of remark , that the principal cases , where there is reason to apprehend that public disturbances may arise between the general government and the states respectively , must result from a disagreement in opinion between the courts of the United States and those of the states . This is a singular proof of the prudence and foresight of the framers of the constitution . For , in generaly such is the love of regularity and order , and the prudence and moderation of those persons who preside over the tribunals of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both with regard to those of the United States and those of the several states in the union , that the framers of the federal oopstitution were well warranted in supposing , that they had avoided , as far as possible , every occasion , which might give rise to internal disorders and civil commotioQSi on account of the undefined and undefitiable powers and rights of the general and state governjnents respectively , when they had taken care , that no such unfortunate circumstances could ever happen , where one party or the other would not be manifestly and grossly in the wrong ; the case of cduflictidg jurisdictions between the courts of the United States , and those of the state courts , being a solitary exception . And , it is believed , until some late unfortunate occurrences , to which it seems unnecessary to make further allusion , most reflecting persons would have come to the ponclusion , that if there were no other sources of public troubles and dissensions between General Rig/s. 163 the United States add the several states , than such as arise from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their conflicting sentences and decrees , the country might enjoy a slate of uninterrupted tranquillity and repose forever . But , if the legislature or the executive of a state , having come to the concjusion that a law of the United States was unconstitutional , notwithstanding a decision of the supreme court to the contrary , should array an armed force to resist the execution of the law , such conduct would undoubtedly be treasonable . See 2 Dall. 346. 4 Cranch , 75. 1 Paine , 265 . So , if they should attempt by tha use of similar violent means , to enforce a law of the state , which had been decided to be unconstitutional , by the same court : And , for the same reason , if they should resist in the same manner , the execution of a decree of the supreme court of the United States . - Neither would it be a crime of small magnitude with regard to the state itself , if the governor or legislature of a state , should vetiture to adopt any such rash measures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the state governments no power of opposing the measures of the general government , under any circumstances . If any such power is ever exercised by the state authorities , it will be an act of dangerous usurpation , for which they will be answerable to their constituents , perhaps on an inpeachment , perhaps on an indictment for a treasonable conspiracy . For whence can the governor or legislature of a state derive authority or Jurisdiction , to decide whether a law of congress or a decision of the supreme court of the United States , is unconstitutional ? If the citizens of the states had ever intended to bestow such power on the state rulers , the adoption of the constitution of the United States by those citizens , would have abolished such intention . For , a clause in it declares that it shall be the supreme law of the land ; but , this is altogether inconsistent with a power in the governor or the legislature of any state , to oppbse any measures , adopted by the general government by virtue of powers delegated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal for the decisioa ' of constitutional 104 General Rights . questions ; consequently , the state authorities have no jurisdiction of any such question . On the extreme suppositioo , that the supreme court should usurp jurisdiction of questions not submitted to them by the constitution , the right to remonstrate belongs to the states , that is , to the citizens of the respective states ; and not to the state rulers ; for the plain reason already suggested , that the citizens have not delegated this power to the state rulers , either expressly or by necessary implication , in their state constitutions . The constitution of the United States is the solemn compact of all the states , adopted from motives of the greatest expediency , or rather necessity . But , of what utility can it be , if the execution of laws or decisions made under its authority , may be resisted , whenever the governor or legislature of a particular state , under whatever pretence , believe or affect to believe such laws or decisions to be unconstitutional ? Such an act of opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration of the general government for the time being ; foe the government being of the nature of a company or association , is a mere abstraction , and consequently impassible ; but the wrong is evidently offered to the other states , that compose the federal union .

It might be supposed , at first view , that in ordinary cases , there would be but little reason to apprehend , that the rulers or government of any state , would ever array themselves in opposition to any measures of the general government . Because , if a state legislature should enact a law for any such purpose , it would be merely void , and the citizens of the state itself would not be bound by it , and would be protected by the constitutional tribunals of the union , in their disregard or disobedience of such law .

The same rule would apply to the courts of the state . For , if they had not adopted the same views or opin- General BighU. 165 BODS as the gpyernor and legislalure of the state , they also , would decide that such oppositioD to the general gofreinmeDt was illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . enacted by the legblature for such purpose , were void ; and , in any such decision , they would be sustained by the supreme court of the United States , and ought to be protected by the power of the union . But , if the highest courts of a sute should undertake to decide , that a decree of the supreme court of the United States was unconstitutional , and refuse to obey it , or waSkt it to be - obeyed , or to be enforced by the civil officers of the United States ; and the governor and legislature of the state should raise an armed force to resist the power of the national government , and should make an actual opposition to it ; this , it can not be doubted , would be treason in all persons in the state , whether rulers or citizens , who voluntarily took an active part in it But , it would not necessarily amount to a dissolution of the union , unless the citizens of the state sanctioned the vidence of their rulers , with their express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that purpose . It would amount to nothing more than a rebellion and should be treated as such . The quiet and sober-minded citizens of such state should be protected against the violence of the insurgents , and the latter should be reduced , as soon as possible , to a state of civil subordination to the federal government . But , according to the theory of the whole system of state governments , taken in connexion with the federal government , if the people of such state should sanction such measures of the state government in their primary assemblies , such state , in effect , would already have separated itsdf , violently and irrularly , from the federal union . The relations afterwards subsisting between that state and the other states in the union , which would not necessarily be dbsolved by the secession of one or more particular states , would depend upon the moderation and forbearance of the administration for the time being . For , the federal government , without perhaps having a strict right to compel any state to continue its adherence , contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters of such state , would unquestionably have a right to chlm it a full satisfaction of aU just demands as well as an indem- 168 Creneral Rigftts. hoped , that it will never become necessary , even under the most threatening appearances , to resort to any harsher meaisures than persuasion or remonstrance . If the majority of the citizens of a state should be in favor of adhesion , there would probably be but little occasion for the general government to interpose for the preservation of tranquillity and order . And , if the majority were in favor of separation , the proximity of a small national force without the limits of the state , would be a sufficient protection for the njinority , who adhered to the federal government , if they should be threatened with violence , and who should be cautioned against the use of any force but in repelling aggression . By this moderate course of measures , the temporary excitement would soon subside . When the fit of intoxication was over , which would soon be the case if not imprudently exasperated , intemperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nraderation . A total change would take place in the public sentiment , and consequently in the state administration . As the people of the state resumed the exercise of their reason , they would supplant iu office , folly and rashness , by good sense and a spirit of conciliation . If unfortunately there should be an attempt to array an armed force in opposition to the general government , it would probably be suppressed in a moment . The most turbulent and violent of the leaders , and consequently idolized by the credulity of the abused people , as an illustrious patriot and hero  --  who perhaps fancied himself a state Washington  --  being arrested , would see his partiza'ns abandon him to his fate . Being then tried and convicted of treason , he would be surprised to find himself regarded by the multitude whom he had attempted to mislead , neither as a patriot , nor a renowned hero , not even as a martyr of liberty , but merely as an unsuccessful political incendiary ; while the citizens of the state , having learned a useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having put in office men of sound judgment and deliberate consideration , would be surprised to find that they can live in happiness and prosperity all their days , notwithstanding the fancied oppressions of the general government . To return ; from the preceding observations and reflections . General Rights . 169 it can not be difficult to determine how far the United States constitute a single consolidated empire ; and , in what respects , they are merely a confederacy of independent nations . And it is evident , that there is not the slightest inconsistency either theoretical or practical , in relation to the subject , if rightly considered . For , within the powers delegated to the legislative , judicial and executive departments of the general government , the United States form one grand consolidated empire , and within the preserved limits of these delegated powers no other difference can be discerned between this government , and the most absolute monarchy on earth , while , in the actual exercise of no greater powers than these , except in the single circumstance , that the monarchy restrains itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution . So far therefore as the exercise of the powers delegated requires , the states cease to be independent , and consequently , sovereign and independent . The state governments however , it must be repeated , have nothing to do with this subject . It concerns merely the citizens of each state , taken collectively as forming a distinct tribe or nation ; the general government , formed by the constitutional compact between all these states ; and the citizens of all the states taken in their new relation to each other under this national compact , as fellow citizens of the American republic . It is true , that a citizen of each state has , in certain respects , the freedom of all the other states ; but should the union be dissolved , it will be found , that he derives this advantage from the federal constitution alone ; and whether he is afterwards to be considered as an alien , or as a denizen of any other state , will depend upon the laws of that state alone . That it was not intended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , than is necessarily implied ip the exercise of the powers delegated in it , is evident from th express provision of the constitution , that , no new state shall be formed by the junction of two or more states or parts of states , without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned , as well as of the congress . ' Further , the states , in many respect , seem wholly independent of the union . The government of the United States /z/ -f 170 General Rights . can not appropriate an acre of land belonging to any state , or assume exclusive jurisdiction over.it , without the assent or grant of the state . If an officer of the United States commits a crime against the laws of any state , he is amenable to the state court where the crime is committed , and the judgment of the state court will be final . If the officer should set up a defence under the laws and constitution of the United States , for the purpose of bringing the case before the supreme court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther into the merits of the case , than to ascertain whether the laws or constitution of the United States are at all brought in question ; and if not , the judgment of the state court will be permitted to take its course . The slates are perfectly independent of each other , and their dependence on the general government is just so much as they voluntarily agreed to , in giving the government of the United States a supremacy in ' certain defined respects , by the adoption of the federal constitution . They are sovereign within their own territory , therefore , in all other cases ; and if congress should violate this sovereignty by enacting unconstitutional laws , the state wronged may have the subject examined before the supreme court of the United States , the tribunal of last resort for constitutional questions , and if the law should be decided to be unconstitutional , it will lose its validity . But , it may be objected here , and the objection deserves consideration , If the supreme court is the tribunal of ultimate resort for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what avail is the express limitation of the powers granted by it to the federal government ? For , if congress should pass an unconstitutional law , and the supreme court should declare it to be constitutional , to what remedy can any state or individual injured by it resort ? Certainly to none that is not paramount or collateral to the constitution itself , as , for instance , a convention of the states , in order to amend it by declaring its intention so clearly as to prevent the possibility of misinterpretation . This subject has been partially discussed ante p. 152 . A few remarks , in further illustration of the view there submitted to the discerning reader , but in a General Rights . 171 different connexion , it is hoped will be eiccused here . Suppose congress tonact an unconstitutional law , and the supreme - court of the United States , making the same mistake with the members of congress , should decide it to be constitutional , must a state submit to liave its rights sacrificed ? To answer this question correctly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested in the place just referred to , to wit : that , as the constitution is a compact of the several states in the federal union , conferring certain powers on the federal government , and reserving others to the states ; where laws are made , the subject matter of which is within the powers granted to the general government , the supreme court is the proper tribunal to decide whether they are constitutional or not . But , if the subject matter of the law , rs not within the powers delegated to the general government , no state can justly be bound by such law , even on the absurd supposition , that the supreme court should decide it to be constitutional . Here It may be objected again , if this court has no conclusive jurisdiction , except where the subject matter of the law is within the powers delegated to congress , it follows , that this court will have no authority to decide a law to be constitutional , except in cases where there is no need of any such decision , viz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , made use of in defining the powers of congress . But , the answer is , that the subject matter of a law may be clearly within the powers granted to the general government , and yet tbe law may be unconstitutional . In any such case the court will have jurisdiction to decide ; and though they should decide wrong , the decision will be binding on the states . To illustrate : The power of taxation is delegated to congress ; yet , if congress should impose an unequal tax , the law would be unconstitutional and consequently void ; but , as the subject matter of the law is within the power delegated to congress , the supreme court has a power to decide finally in relation to it . On the other hand , as the constitution confers no power on the general government to interfere in the municipal concerns or internal organization of a state , if congress should enact a law to control either in any respect , it would seem , that it would be void , and though the 172 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional , the decision would not bind the states , because the subject matter of any such law , does not come within the powers delegated to the general government . In cases like these , it can hardly be supposed that the several states , in the formation of the federal constitution , intended entirely to resign to the supreme court , the right not merely of construing that compact , for this is not doubted , but of extending it by construction to matters not contemplated by it . How far these remarks may apply by way of analogy to the case of enforcing the decision of an arbitrator , appointed by the United States and a foreign government , in relation to disputed boundaries between the foreign government and one of the states ; and how far this point ought to depend upon the inquiry , whether the state whose territory is concerned , had previotLsly consented to such arbitration or not ; or how far these remarks may be considered applicable to the case of a slate , which has forcibly taken possession of a territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is protected by treaties made with the United States , is submitted to the discerning reader . Let it be supposed , further , that congress should require the justices of the peace holding commissions under the several states , to perform certain acts when requested , under a certain penalty , there can be no doubt , that though such law might be a sufficient authority to the justice to perform the act , so far as the United States is concerned , yet it would be wholly void as to the penalty ; because the subject matter of the law , so far as requiring 2 : state officer to perform any act under a penalty , does not fall within any provision of the federal constitution . It is true , the state officer may lawfully do the act for the sake of the fee , which he may be entitled to claim for it under the act of congress ; but in any other respect his services will be merely gratuitous . Who then , it may be asked , is to decide whether a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? It seems , that the supreme court has conclusive and unquestionable jurisdiction to decide , that a certain power is not granted ; that the court has also conclusive jurisdiction to decide that a certain power is incidental , that is to say , absolutely necessary to the exercise of some General Rights . 173 other power expressly granted in the constUution , and consequently that such incidental power is also granted . But , unless they determine such power , not being an express one , to be thus incidental , they can not bind the state by a decision , that the law made by virtue of it , is constitutional . So , the supreme court can not bind the states by a decision , that a certain power is incident to a certain other power , where such supposed incident power is expressly prohibited in the constitution . But , if the constitution does not expressly prohibit the exercise of the power , decided by the court to be incidental , the decision of the court will conclude the states , even oq the supposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supreme court has jurisdiction at all , as no other tribunal is provided for the correction of errors , its decision must Jbe taken for as near an approximation to absolute right , as the fallibility of human nature permits ; and consequently should be submitted to by the states , who have so far constituted that court their final arbitrator . The express words of the constitution of the United States are , that " the constitution and the laws of the United States tvhich shall be made in pursuance thereof , and all treaties made or which shall be made he . It is plain then , that it is only those laws which are made in pursuance of the constitution , that will bind the state courts , even although sustained by a decision of the supreme court , unless that court has constitutionally a jurisdiction over the subject matter . In the case however of the most manifest usurpation of power on the part of congress , it would be highly unjust as well as inexpedient , for any state to arra ) * itself againsj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never with propriety be ascribed to the people of the union , who have expressly refused to congress the power to pass any unconstitutional law . Until the people have received notice of it , and have had a full opportunity of learning the true state of the case , and of electing another set of public officers , any such unconstitutional act should be ascribed to the general administration only . Till that time , any state which considers itself aggrieved , will best consult its interests. , by restricting the exercise of its powers to endeavors to enlighten the public mind , and , in this way , induce them to elect wiser legislators . i 174 General Rights . /z/ Of the rights reserved to the people of the United Slates ; not being granted either to the general government , or to the state governments . In the formation of the federal constitution , it was judged best , on the whole , though there was considerable difference of opinion in relation to the subject , not to introduce into it any bill of fights . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was thought , that if no bill of rights was inserted , all rights and liberties not relinquished to the general government , in the constitution , either in express terms , or by necessary implication , would be considered as retained by the people ; while , on the other hand , if a bill of rights were introduced in the constitution , and any right or liberty chanced to be omitted in the enumeration , such right or liberty so omitted , would be considered as relinquished to the general government , by implication . Some of the members of the state conventions , however , and particularly of the Virginia convention , where this subject was thoroughly discussed , were strongly in favor of a bill of rights , and some of the amendments , which were afterwards made to the constitution in consequence of the strenuous efforts of those members , contain in express terms a reservation to the people , of certain rights and liberties , which it would be difficult to show congress had any right to interfere with , independently of such reservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people in express terms , for the purpose of avoiding , as much as practicable , all doubts in relation to the subject . For the same reason , two clauses were inserted among these amendments , declaring in substance , that powers not delegated by the constitution are retained ; and , that a partial enumeration of rights should not be construed to deny or disparage rights not contained in it . In a state of nature , the rights of ' an individual might be General Rights , 175 summed up in a single expression , viz , that he had a right ta do whatever he had a power given him by nature to do , provided he violated no precept of religion , and was guilty of no wrong to others . But , in the innumerable relations of organized society , though all a man 's rights may be summed up ii a manner almost as brief , viz , that he is restrained by no law or duty from doing anything which does not violate any rule of religion or morality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of society ; yet , it will , be best in order to furnish a more distinct and clear idea of these rights , to take a review of the more important of them separately . For this purpose , since no particular order is observed the constitution , none needs be observed here . 1 . Religious Freedom , Under the 6rst amendment of the - constitution , congress is prohibited from * making any law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . ' The reason of this prohibition may be traced in part , to the general spirit of toleration , which ' prevails throughout the Unile# Slates . It is not a necessary conclusion however , that all the various sects are thus tolerant ; but , as . the population is divided into a great number of difierent sects no single one of which constitutes a majority of the whole , it would be vain for any particular sect , to encourage thoughts of being established as the religion of the whole union . As therefore , there is no probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ascendancy in this country by means of political power ; and as unprofitable contests for that object , would create rancorous disputes among those sects , and tend to bring the general cause of Christianity into disesteem with the feeble minded , and give an occasion to the adversary , ' it has been thought best to provide for a general toleration of religion . The power to make regulations in regard to religion , therefore , must remain in the people of the United States ; and though at first sight it might seem , tht the citizens of each state might authorize their state rulers to impose religious restraints , yet , as this would interfere with Art . IV , Sect. 2 , of the Federal Constitution , it seems that it can not constitutionally be done . 2 . Freedom of speech and of the press . By the same amendment congress is prohibited from passing any law . abridging /z/ 176 General Rights . the freedom of speech or of the press . These two rights are not further noticed here , being made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The right of the citizens to bear arms . The second amendment to the constitution , declares , that * the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . ' The reason assigned in the amendment for this restriction on the power of congress , is sufficient to show its true construction . This reason is , ' because a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state . ' Certainly , it is impossible to provide any other mode of defence which shall be at the same time so safe so cheap , and so effectual as that of a well organized miliiia . For , every able bodied man , with the exception of those who are exempted because they are engaged in the discharge of other public duties , is bound to assist in the public defence ; and consequently , with the exception of the small number referred to , the number of the whole militia of the United States , is limited only by that of its effective citizens . The chief excellence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's warning becomes a soldier ; and when the exigency is over , at a moment 's warning retires again to the calm and usual pursuits and occupations of peace . To repel a sudden invasion of a foreign enemy ; to put down a domestic insurrection at its first commencement ; to protect the country from any attempt to usurp power by persons not confided with it , are occasions , in which the policy of the militia system is very apparent . Another advantage , which however is not quite so obvious , is the assistance which it is always ready to lend the civil arm of the government ; in preserving domestic peace and tranquillity ; in the execution of the process of the law ; and in suppressing the tumults and riots and other disorders of the less informed citizens , when under the influence of their own unruly passions , whether excited by some unfortunate occasion , or exasperated by the false reasonings or representations of designing and unprincipled leaders or declaimers . The influence of the militia system in these last cases , is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much felt by those whose irregularity of conduct can only be restrained by the consciousness of a superior controlling power , which ff . /z/ General Rights . m they can not withstand , and therefore will not attempt to pro-* voke . ' Their inefficiency in the field against a regular army , arises from , and i consequently in tlirect proportion with the follow-* ing circumstances ; viz ; want of military skill apd experiencOi in the officers ; want of respect for their superiors , and of a spirit of subordination , in the private soldiers . The officers are unable to teach ; the privates will not learn . The officers neither know how to comnvand , nor how to enforce obedience . The privates will neither submit nor obey . The whole results in a total disregard of discipline , a want of confidence in their officers , and a distrust of themselves and of each other . These defects however may be remedied by drilling and ex* ercising tinder officers , who have had an opportunity of seeing service . - There is but little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be traitors among them ; but having their own interests to protect , and being in reality the country itself , it would be absurd to suppose that they would ever betray themselves . It is true , that they may ruin themselves by acting under erroneous views of their own interests . But this is incident to human nature . The provision of the constitution , declaring the right of the people to keep and bear arms , 8z ; c , was probably intended to apply to the right of the people to bear arms for such purposes only , and not to prevent congress or the legislatures of the dif* ferent states from enacting laws to prevent the citizens from always going armed . A different construction however has been given to it . It is a common practice in some parts of the United States , for individuals to carry concealed about their persons , some deadly weapon , and such as is not much used as a regular weapon of attack or defence , in the army , as , a dirk or a loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is really unconstitutional to restrain it by law , ought to be discountenanced by all persons who are actuated by proper feelings of humanity or a just regard for the dictates of religion . For , what does this practice in a civilized community imply ? In what light does the wearer expect to be viewed ? Is he under the influ- /z/ 178 General Rights . ence of unmanly timidity ? Has he not sufficient courage to declare his sentiments , unless supported by the consciousness that he has a deadly weapon at hand , to which he can appeal , m case of any difficulty or quarrel ? Or , is it vanity ? If so , then he must frequently display his pistol or dirk . But the weapon of a soldier , worn by one who is not so , becomes the badge of a fop or coxcomb . Or , does he mean to act the part of an assassin , and gratify his temper or malignity by stabbing or shooting the first person who happens to offend him or who is unwilling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirays attended with fatal results , in those parts of the country where this low bred practice is most prevalent , would seem to demand the interposition of the legislature , if it might constitutionally be had . . However , the courts and juries may do much , if they will set their faces agamst it . This they may do with perfect propriety and without either violating the constitution , or overstepping any legal principle . To constitute the crime of murder , it is not necessary , that the act should arise from malice against any particular individual , it is sufficient , if it results from an unprincipled disregard of the lives of other people in general ; as , if a man maliciously or wantonly rides a horse used to kick , mto a crowd of people , or turns loose in the street a furious wild beast , and any one loses his life in consequence of it , it will be murder . And , there appears to be no reason , why a man , who arms himself with a deadly weapon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who offends him , and afterwards uses it upon some provocation which does not constitute a legal excuse , and kills his antagonist , should be regarded , in any other light than a murderer . There are without doubt circumstances , which may justify a man for going armed ; as , if he has valuable property in his custody ; or , if he is travellmg in a dangerous part of the country ; or , if his life has been threatened . But under other circumstances , it ought not to be tolerated or countenanced ; because the presence of such weapons has frequently turned a quarrel into a bloody affiay , which otherwise would have terminated in angry words , or at most an inconsiderable breach of the peace . While on this subject , it may not be amiss to suggest , that Oeneral Rights . 179 tf the state legislatures would pass a law , providing that if any man shocild by writing , or by advised speaking , either in a person 's presence or absence , charge him with any fiiilure of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not for the purpose of demanding legal reparation ; or , should apply to such person the contumelious epithets , usually resorted to for the purpose of insult , he should be liable to a certain heavy pecuniary fine , or to imprisonment for a certain number of days , to be remitted at any time upon asking pardon of the injured party in open court , either verbally or in writing , according to the manner of the offence , it would probably tend to put a stop to duelling . The public sentiment too , ought to be corrected with regard to acts of personal violence . When an assult and battery has been committed , the jury seldom assess sufficient damages ; the judges too frequently impose such inconsiderable fines , that an injured party is frequently discouraged from attempting to obtain redress by law , and untess he b a conscientious man , prefers to resort to modes of redress which die law forbids . 4* The quartering of soldiers . It is provided in the third amendment of the constitution , that no soldier shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the consent of the oiwner ; nor , in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed by law . ' This provision is important to the comfort of . the citizens . When soldiers are quartered on the inhabitants of a place without their consent it gives rise to many abuses and impositions on the part of the soldiers , and a great deal of ill will on the part of the citizens . To live at free quarters , is little else than making booty and pillage of every thing , at discretion . In a state of war , the exigencies of military service may frequently require that soldiers may be quartered on die inhabitants . To leave the regulation of this matter to the discretion of the commander in chief of an army , would be to subject the persons and property of the citizens to the risk of outrage , bsult and violence , without any other means of redress than such as depend on his arbitrary will . The citizens have prudently guarded themselves as far as practicable , by requiring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the 4th amendment , the persons , houses , papers 180 General Rights . and effects of the people are secured from unreasonable arrests , seisures and searches . No warrants therefore shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath , he . By these provisions all general warrants , for searching or seizing persons , property , or papers , without particularly describing the object of such process , are made unconstitutional . The propriety of securing the liberties of the chizens in these respects , is nnanifest from the arbitrary and tyrannical use of general warrants which has freqtiently been resorted to in Great Britain . 6 . The 6th amendment declares , that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictnient by a grand jury , fcc . &c.; One of the principal objects of this provision , was to exempt persons who belong neither to the army or navy of the United States from trials by a court martial , or other tribunals not known to the common law which might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or safeguard , on the part of the people , against any acts of violence , imposition * or oppression which may be practised upon them in war or peace , by military commanders , eitlier by direct outrage , or by subjecting tbm to summary trials and convictions before officers under their command , and consequently more or less under their influence , by the most odious and least to be depended upon of all trials , that by court nkartial . This bow ever will prove inadequate to protect individuals , whenever the people become so infatuated as to connive at acts of arbitrary power in popular leaders For , such leaders , depending on the weakness or sottishness of the multitude to overlook , perhaps to applaud , all acts of tyranny or oppression oommitted on individuals , so long as a pretence is held out , that they are done for the public good , Without considering that no individual can be oppressed without at the same time threatening the liberty and safety of all , will be very much inclined to trample on any obstacles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights f others may b sacrificed in consequence . But , if the people have the good sense to consider , that the greater the power of the offender the more necessity there must always be to bring him to justice ; and that no public services whatever are a sufficient s - ' General Rights . 181 warraot for the violation of the laws of the country and the rights and liberties of the citizens , and sustain the decisions of the tribunals of justice in assertion of those rights by an open avowal of such sentiments , thee will never be any danger of a loss of freedom from aijy such usurpation of unconstitutional power . 7 . The same amendment provides , that no man shall be compelled to give evidence against himself . This provision forbids the enactment of laws , which shall authorize the infliction of torture , imprisonment , or any other means of coercion , in order to compel an accused person to confess his guilt , and is in perfect accordance with the principles of the common law which excludes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats or promises , of favor made by persons acting judicially , or officially S. The same amendment provides , that ' no person shall be deprived of life , liberty or property without due process of law , Sec . Sec . This clause seems not to be aimed so much at the tyrannical conduct of persons in power , acting under ati usurped authority , as to prevent congress or the legislatures of the states from intrusting a power over the lives or the liberties of the citizens to public officers in command , and from confiscating the estates of individuals without the formality of trial , by mere unprincipled acts of legislation . Bills of attainder are prohibited in the constitution , in Section ix , Article 1 . Even this prohibition , it seems , is not wholly superfluous . Before the adoption of the constitution , a man by the name of Phillit ) s was attainted by a bill of the legislature of Virginia , and was executed under it . 9 . Under amendment sixth , the accused shall enjoy the right tp a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humane provisions , are made to prevent the possibility of unfairness or oppression , from being practised upon the humblest or most obnoxious individual in society . An accused person can not now be detained in prison , as otherwise he might be , from year to year , at the discretion of the court or the public prosecutor , but has a right to demipd a trial at the regular time , and can  --  - not justly or constitutionally be deprived of it , or delayed without sufficient cause . If there is no substantial reason for de- 182 General Rights , lay , he must either be tried or discharged without trial . If any other rule were adopted , he might be kept in perpetual imprisonment , under one pretence or other . The absence of material witnesses on the part of the prosecutor , is not of itself a sufficient cause for putting off the trial , unless it appears also , that the public prosecutor has made every reasonable exertion to procure their attendance , and that he will probably be able to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sufficient cause for delay even then , if the prisoner is willing to admit that the absent witness will testify in the manner the prosecutor states in his affidavit he expects him to testify ; or , if the- person accused can produce the record of the convictioa of such absent person , of any crime that renders his testimony inadmissible in a court of justice . Neither ought the indisposition of the public prosecutor , to be considered as a sufficient reUson for putting off a trial , where the accused party is suffering imprisonment in the mean time . The liberty of the citizen ought not to depend one moment on the health of the public prosecutor . If any of the jurymen are not impartial , u 6. , if they have any personal interest in the result of the trial ; if they have expressed a decided opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner , they ought to be taken from thejiiry either on the challenge of the prisoner , or that of the public prosecutor , or , on the challenge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to the public as well as to the accused party . The prisoner must also be tried in the district where the crime is charged to have been committed . This is provided , in order that he may liot be liable to be oppressed by being taken away among strangers , who , not being acquainted with his previous character , would derive their first impressions with regard td it , from the nature of the accusation itself . It may not be amiss here , to suggest , that an innocent person accused of a crime , should be very cautious in the voluntary relinquishment of any formality , which the law require to be complied with in criminal trials . All those formalities are directed for the purpose of protecting innocence from the possibility of an unjust conviction . They are all grounded on some sufficient reason , though that reason may not always appear , or may not be applicable to every case . They ought General Rights . ' 183 not to be so numerous or so hard to be complied with , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they can not be liable to this exception , since notwithstanding the strict observance of them , the mnocent sometimes are convicted . The cae is easily conceivablci that a person perfectly innocent , may , from the force of concurring circumstances publicly known , be generally believed to be guilty of the crime of which he is accused ; and the court as well as the jury and the witnesses , may be so satisfied of it , and of the plenary proof which it is expected to adduce against him , that the unfortunate individual may be considered as virtually condemned in the minds of all , even before the trial is com* menced . It is here that the wisdom and humanity of these requirements and technical formalities are most manifest . For , if they are strictly observed , the court and jury , however stiong their prepossessions may pdssibly be agaitist the prisoner , if they pay ordinary attention to the proceedings , will not fail to perceive whether there is or is not sufficient legal evidence of the prisoner 's guilt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be convicted except from one of those errors or mistakes , which it is mcident to the imperfection of human nature sometimes to commit . The prisoner must be acquainted with the precise nature of the accusation , so that he may know what to defend . This notice must be given him seasonably , so that he may have a reasonable time to prepare for his defence , and procure the ' attendance of his witnesses . This he is entitled to process , to compel , and of this right congress can not constitutionally deprive a prisonei% He is also entitled to the assistance of counsel in all criminal cases . In capital ones , if the prisoner IS unable to retain counsel at his own charge , it is the humane and invariable practice of the court to assign him such as he requests , and to the honor of the legal profession , it is due to remark , that the task is seldom if ever declined without sufficient reason , and when undertaken is discharged with a disinterested zeal and ardor , which always secures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshot the mark and defeated the purposes of justice , by procuring the acquittal of undoubted guilt , contrary to both laW and testimony . 184 General Rights . 10 . The eighth amendment provides , that excessive bail shall not be required . This is supposed to be intended to prevent the requiring of excessive or unreasonable bail , in cases of bailable mmmaZ charges only . There is however no reason , why it may not extend to cases , where the defendant in a civil action , is held to bail for an unreasonable amount for the purpose of oppression . It seems however to be a direction for magistrates , and not either for the legislature or for sheri &,; &c.; Where a prisoner charged witba bailable offence , is brought before a court or magistrate having authority to hold him to bail , or to let him go upoti his givmg bail , by what rule is he to be guided in settling the amount to be required , agreeably to the spirit of the consitution ? The design of bail is either to relieve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon his giving sufficient caution or se curity for his appearance at court , at the proper , time to take his trial ; or , it is to compel a person at large to give such security , under the alternative of being committed to prison till his trial comes on . To relieve from imprisonment and to secure the appearance of the accused , are therefore the two objects , which the magistrate is to have in. view ; but , where both can not be obtained , the former must yield to the latter . The magistrate here has a right to use a proper discretion . It is obvious , if the person accused , being released on bail , sees fit to Vbscond , his recognizance will be forfeited , and his bail be held responsible for the amount . If therefore , previously to his going off , he should deposit a sum of money with his bail , sufficient to indemnify them against the forfeiture of the recognizstnce or bail bond , the purpose of justice will be eluded , so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet the bail will be held harmless . Where the crime charged therefore is f an odious or infamous nature , and the evidence strong , and the person accused is rich , or has opulent parents or influential friends , the highest bonds should always be required . So , if he is a transient person , high bail should be required ; otherwise he may deposit a sufficient sum of money with some one to induce him to procure bail for him , and then abscond . But , where the crime is not of an infamous nature where the evidence is slight , and yet not suffi- General Rights . 185 sufficiently so to warrant the discharge of the person accused ; if he is poor , fee . Sec. the lightest bonds should be required . The eighth amendment also prohibits excessive fines . This is a direction to the legislatures as well as to the courts and to magistrates . If therefore a law should be passed , imposing a ruinous fine upon an inconsiderable offence , or otherwise wholly dispropordoned to the magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this amendment . So , where a crime is punishable by fine and imprisonment , at the discretion of the judge , this discretion is a reasonable discretion , Le . the best exercise of his honest judgment , and must not be confounded eithqr with whim , caprice , or vindictive feelings . A man 's farm or stock in trade , ought never to be made a sacrifice , to the ruin of himself and the distress of his family , but , if necessary to make an example , he should rather be imprisoned for a longer period , and a more moderate fine be imposed . For similar reasons , if a law should be passed , requiring a specified and very heavy fine to be imposed in all cases of crimes of any particular class , and allowing the judge no discretion , though the offence in some cases might be very slight , it can not be doubted that such a law would be contrary to the spirit of the constitution . Nb express restriction is laid in the constitution , upon the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demand unreasonable bail , which merely exposes the individual concerned , to imprisonment in case he can not procure it ; as it is forbidden to impose unreasonable fines , on account of the difficulty the person fined would have of paying them , the default of which would be punished by imprisonment only , it would seem , that imprisonment for an unreasonable length of time , is also contrary to the spirit of the constitution . Thus in cases where the courts have a discretionary power to fine " and imprison , shall it be supposed , that the power to fine is restrained , but the power to iniprison is wholly unrestricted by it ? In the absence of all express regulations on the subject , it would surely be absurd to imprison an individual for a term of years , for some inconsiderable offence , and consequently it would seem , that a law imposing so severe a punishment /z/ i 186 xeneral Rights . must be contrary to the intention of the framers of the constitution . Under the same aniendment the infliction of cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarous and cruel punishments inflicted under the laws of some other countries , and which profess not to be behind the most enlightened nations on earth in civilization and refinement furnish sufficient reasons for this express prohibition . Breaking on the wheel , flaying alive , rending asunder with horses , various species of horrible tortures inflicted in the inquisition , maiming , mutilating and scourging to death , are wholly alien to the spirit of our humane general constitution . Yet the statute books of some of the states , are disgraced by laws justly chargeable with barbarity . Is not whipping a punishment sufficiently severe of itself , when required to be inflicted on the naked back , without the savage direction that , the stripes should be ' well laid on ? ' Is not the punishment of death sufficient ? Must the atrocious spirit of revenge be gratified , by having the culprit burned alive ? 11 . In the fifth amendment will be found a prohibition to take private property for public use , without just compensation . It would seem no more than justice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its fair value at that time , with the usual rate of interest on that amount , until the time of paying for it this being the nearest approximation that can be made , to the actual detriment which the owner has sustained . Where the legislature do any act . of this kind , it can not of itself constitutionally determine the amount of compensation . See 2 Dal . 304 . There are some other rights , which are reserved to the people , though not mentioned in the general constitution . Among these is the right of self-defence , in cases where the danger is so imminent , that tfie person in jeopardy , may suflr irreparable injury , if he waits for the protection of the laws . It is true , if he survives , the justice of society will afford him such separation as its own power permits ; but he is not bound to submit to this alternative ; and as the compact between him and society is mutual , if society is unable to protect him , his natural right revives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Rights , 187 Another right , reserved to the people though not mentioned in the constitution , is that of expatriation . Every citizen who has not entered into an express compact with the government by swearing allegiance , may leave the country and disisolve all ties with it but those of gratitude and affection , at pleasure . This right is acknowledged indirectly by the constitution ; for otherwise , it would not have established a rule of naturalization , by which aliens who desert their native country , may become citizens and patriots here . See ante p. 43 . The people also according to the democratic theory , have a right to alter their constitution and frame of government , as Aey please , if unanimous . This right is inalienable ; no express stipulation can deprive them of it . It is true , that a mode of amending the constitution is pointed out in it : but , as this mode of amendment is only agreed upon by the people of the United States , as a safe and convenient one ; the same authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mode of amendment , and adopt whatever form of government they see fit . This however is the right of revolutionizing , which however it may be viewed in the abstract , if taken in connexion with its concomitant circumstances and attendant consequences , viz. the unsettled state of all laws and institutions ; the base and profligate practices of ambitious men to mislead the people ; the insecurity of property  --  of life itself , and the extreme improbability , that a people who have been so foolish as to abolish a tolerable government , on account of some theoretical defects , wilLhave sufficient wisdom to adopt a better , should cause a case , where such right may be exercised with propriety , to be regarded as potentia remotissimay an incredible supposition . See ante , p. 55 . An important right , and one which is expressly reserved to the people , in the constitution , is that of assembling peaceably . This is one of the strongest safeguards , against any usurpation or tyrannical abuse of power , so long as the people collectively have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , and individually have independence enough , to express an opinion in opposition to a popular but designing leader . But , if they are ignorant or misinformed in this respect , the exercise of this right will be pernicious , if 188 ' General Rights . their rulers are governed by any expression of the sentiments of such of them as see fit to exercise it ; and will be useless , if they are not at all influenced by it . This right includes not only a right to assemble in order to petition for a removal of grievances , but also a right to assemble for the purpose of deliberating upon public measures* For , it can not be supposed that they have a right to assemble for the purpose of petitioning only , when a short coosultation may perhaps be sufficient to convince them , either that their is no grievance at all ; or , that it is unavoidable ; or , that it will remedy itself ; &lc.; &c.; any of which will be sufficient to satisfy the people , that an application to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless . The proper occasion for the exercise of this right would seem to be , where a law has a different operation from what congress intends , and is oppressive in any ' respect , either to the people in general ; or , to any particular class of them ; or , to the inhabitants of any particular state , district , territory , or section of the country . In any such/ case , those persons who suflfer the inconvenience or grievance , may well send a petition or remonstrance to congress on the subject . But then it should be subscribed by those only who belong to the saSet " ing class or district . For , the object of it must be to show to congress the true state of the case , and in this way to let congress perceive the inapolicy of the law and the necessity of its repeal . But , if signed by petitioners or remonstrants , who have no interest in it , and who know nothing about its consequences from personal experience , it will be a mere attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mere optnions.oi those who sufier no grievance , which are wanted , nor theories , however ingenious , but the results of experience . For the same reason , when diflerent classes of citizens suffer different grievances from a particular public measure , each class should remonstrate separately , and slate only the real grievances which it suffers , itself , without noticing those which it supposes other classes to suffer . For , of these , those other classes are the best judges , who can petition for themselves if they think it expedient . Nether should their petitions or remonstrances be filled with lectures or disquisitions on specula- Oeneral Rights . 189 tnr &; points in political economy ; for , though sudh disquisitions may serve the purposes of making an ostentatious display of the talents or eloquence of the persons employed by the remontrants to frame their representation or petition ; in any other view , they are useless and impertinent , as it is to be presumed , , that the greater number of the members of congress are acquainted with the elements of that science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If remonstrances or petitions were draughted subject to these restrictions , and contamed those grievances only which the petitioners really felt , it can not be doubted that they might be of service to the public interest ; because they would then give congress information which might be depended on , as to the operation of their laws , and congress  --  ight thus know the result of experience in regard to public measures , which they might previously have adopted with no better light , than such as they had borrowed from theory or analogy . But such petitions or remonstrances should be carefully distinguished from one , which owes its origin to individuals , whose interests are concerned to procure the enactment or repeal of some particular law . For , these persons , if they happen to possess any considerable standing among the people , may very easily create a faction , by keeping their own private mterests out of sight , and , at the same time calling assemblies and making great pretences of regard for the public interest , which they afiect to consider to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by aspiring young men to bring themselves into notice , and , if none are invited to attend the meeting as is frequently the case , but those who are favorer bk ' to the object of it , it is very probable that every * patriotic ' and spirited ' resolution will be adopted ' unanimously ; ' and that many thoughtless spectators , who attend the meeting for the mere purpose of entertainment , from hearing a descant on one side of the subject only , will be brought to believe , almost any thing which the orators and leaders see fit to assert . In this way , a few selfish individuals , if possessing , singly , only a small share of influence in society , by uniting together , and then drawing in others , who are so simple as to believe , that their have no other aim than the public good , 190 General Righii. may set on foot a faction , which may endanger the tranquiUity of the whole Union . A petition or remonstrance , deriving its origin from such a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to congress while legislating for the general interest of the community ; but , on the contrary , is a gross abuse . Again : Suppose a law to be already enacted , which certain persons think will be detrimental to their interests ; still , if no detriment has already followed , the time to remonstrate has not arrived . Because , they ought to take for granted , that congress has weighed the matter and its consequences deliber- ' ately , before passing the law . When a grievance has actually taken place , it would be very proper for the persons mjured , to send a remonstrance , or petition , stating Jacts , to congress , with a request that they might have an opportunity to verify them by testimony . Such an opportunity , it would be very proper to afford the remonstrants ; but all argumentative matter should be regarded as superfluous . For , it is the business of the representatives and senators , to argue the question of general expediency , especially those , who come from the neighborhood where the remonstrants reside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if such senators #@# or representatives dissent from them , and express themselves accordingly in the senate or house , the remonstrants have the regular course of redress , of choosing others . If however they can not succeed in the attempt on account of the preponderance of another class of interests , congress will perceive at last , that the remonstrance is nothing more than the expression of a wish on the part of a minority , that their interests should supersede those of the majority ; it being presumed , however , that congress is acting constitutionally . When grievances , which are stated in a remonstrance , are verified by testimony , it is to be presumed , that congress will provide a remedy for them , if it can be done without making a sacrifice of interests , which are of more importance . Where a grievance affects a particular class of men only , it is absurd for those to subscribe the petition or remonstrance , who do not belong to the class ; or , if they do , are not sufferers by it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights . 191 alone , it is absurd for blacksmiths , tailors , shoemakers , &; c. he , to subscribe the petition ; because they must know that their interests are uot afiected , and if they subscribe it , it will be an attempt to practise a species of imposition on congress . It is on this account , that every one who subscribes a petition to congress , ought to add his trade or occupation , and if he does not , the name should be struck off . in this way , the greater the number of remonstrants , the greater also would be the weight of the remonstrance , because it would then appear that each of them personally , felt a share of the grievance , which it was the object of the remonstrance to remove . But , if the remonstrance is merely filled with abstractions , and plausible speculations , and * eloquent , ' ' spirited ' and * patriotic , ' declamation , and subscribed by persons who do not mention their particular occupations , &c.; it is odds that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a scheme to overawe congress , concerted by a few influential persons , who have some private ends in view , and have drawn in the simple and unwary to subscribe what they know nothing about , and have no interest in , unless in fact it is one adverse to the remonstrance . An attempt of this kind , however , would seldom be attended with much success , if both houses of congress always had the necessary firmness and steadiness . But , in popular governments , where men are elected to office because they are popular , the principles of those of them , whose popularity has little better foundation than watching the vane of public opinion , will seldom hold out long against a turbulent and insolent expression of the will of those , whe are supposed to be fthe people , but , who , in fact , are merely the restless dissatisfied , ambitious and grasping part of them . Where any public measure is adopted by congress , which any class of citizens , or portion or district of the country considers oppressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is constitutional or not . This the supreme court of the United States is the only constitutional tribunal , having jurisdiction to determine . The mere opinions of the majority of any convention of individuals , assembled by their own autbori- /z/ 192 General RigJUs . Xy only , are entitled to no weight or consideration in congress . For , they are not the constitutional advisers of congress . Tliey are not recognized as acting in any official capacity , nor have they any jurisdiction as a court . It will be sufficient therefore , for such assemblies to deliver their opinions to congress , when asked . But , if congress give them any weight , they wrong those quiet citizens , who stay at home and confine their ingenuity to the management of their own afiairs , confiding , that no other class of citizens will have any greater share of public influence than themselves ; but who , if they find that there is any advantage to be gained by forming conventions , and sending remonstrances to congress , will soon learn the lesson . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congress is exclusively to decide . Here too , the opinions of any conventions not legally called under the authority of the United States , or of any of the states , are entitled to no weight . For , if congress is to be goverqed by any such opinions , the convention with which they originate , in effect becomes tlte congress , and congress is thus deprived of the exercise of its own power and discretion . But in fact , a remonstrance so indecorous as to express opinions to congress , and point out the path in which it ought to tread , should be lightly regarded . Further ; if it comes from a majority of the people who belong to a class or district , whose interests are supposed to be peculiarly concerned , but who are in the minority in congress , it reflects great disgrace upon their representatives , as if they were unable to manage the afiairs intrusted to them . Would it not be better then to send abler ones ? On the other hapd , if such representatives have faithfully discfaajed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still are unable to convince congress , is it not apparent that the weight of reason in the minds of a majority of the members , is unfavorable to their view of the subject ? The choosing of delegates from different states in the union , to form a convention , with a view to induce congress to adopt any public measure , is a still greater abuse of the right of assembling , reserved to the people in the constitution . The organization of any such body of men , by choosing a president and General BigUs. 198 secretary &c.; and any high-toned resolves &c.; which they might adopt , would tend to excite mistrust , suspicion and alarm . What would they have ? For , either they are the majority , in which case their conduct is absurd ; because , they may remove from office those representatives who do not act agreeably to their wishes ; or , they are the minority , in which case by organizing themselves , they expect to gain some advan tage of . influence , which will turn the scale in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . But how i3 this to . be done ? Do they mean to extort from congress the adoption of any public measure , which to the minds of the members does not seem expedient ? Do they mean to overawe hy their boldness , the representatives of the people whom they are unable to convince by their arguments , when urged by their constitutional representatives in congress ? But , if the members of congress , under the influence of some undefinable apprehension , should comply with the wishes of such convenp tion , and adopt any measure not approved of by the majority of the people they would at once violate their own consciences and commit a breach of trust against their constituents , . If such convention should send an address to congress , containiog argumentative matter to induce congress to come into their views , it would be equally impertinent and improperly directed . Such addresses ought to be made to the people .

Is not the government democratic enough already ? But must its deliberations be annoyed by addresses or lucubrations from conventions , originating in any thing but what they profess to originate in ; perhaps the disappointed ambition of an unsuccessful candidate for office , who has no other way to attract nodce , or to gain political influence and importance ; perhaps in sordid interest acting through the medium of patriotism and under uretence of a disinterested regard for the welfare and prosperi- /z/ k 194 General Rights . ty of the country . Certainly such abilities might be more profitably employed in flashing imaginary powder in the daily journals , or garnishing the dull prosings of a periodical re* view . It is true , there is no reason to apprehend , that men of respectability , will personally do any thing wrong . But they seem not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing how far men of character are willing to venture , and havmg a desire to attract observation by proceeding to extreme ities , will not hesitate to attempt measures , that never would have been contemplated by men of sense and principle , and which these rash men would never have thought of themselves , but for the encouragement which they had received from the previous countenance and co-operation of their betters . For ; it is a common ' misfortune , to which intelligent , influential , and wUe men are exposed , who associate in any enterprise , with the rash , ignorant , or profligate , if wisdom were not excluded by the very fact , that they are always held responisble for , and usually considered the authors of every act and measure adopted by such attendants , followers or companions , however outrageous and absurd in its intentions and consequences , and al-* though such acts or measures may have been adopted not only without the concurrence , but against the express will of such men of intelligence . Why do not these latter ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , and declare to ( hem , that the execution of unconstitutional measures may be resisted by force ; and then express to them an opinion , that sonae particular public measure is unconstitutional , when the constitution has provided a regular and unexceptionable tribunal for the final decision of all such questions , and the jurisdiction of that tribunal has been formally and expressly acknowledged by all the states , by the act of adopting the constitution ? For , what can naturally be expected to follow next , but the raising of armies , the secession of one or more of the states from the union , and the other consequences which usually attend insurrections* and revolutions ; viz. civil war and foreign alliances , and the subjugation of purt of the country , either to the rest , or to strangers ? Is it possible , that men of discernment and fair intentions , can be willing to bass- General Rights . 196 ard such consequences on matters of speculation , or where the question of right and expediency is uncertain at best , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which opinion is therefore so far to be presumed correct ? What judgment must then be formed of those men of influence in society , who under whatever pretext of patriotism , *  - -  under whatever show of disinterestedness , have caused an ex  - -  asperation and excitement in the minds of the people , which possibly may only terminate in the dissolution of the union , and the deluging of their country with the blood of its citizens ? In some cases , however , the exercise of the right of assembling to discuss public measures , is of advantage to the people , if there are no extensive combinations formed among them for the purpose of effecting some particular object , regardless whether the measures are right or wrong . Because they have an opportunity , which is sometimes improved , of receiving useful information , from the oral communications of men of learning and experience . But , for the most part when such assemblies are called on the most unexceptionable business , they serve chiefly as occasions for haranguing the people , and exciting their passions by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise gesture of the academy , and with all the generous and glowing ardor of holiday patriotism . This however is a great improvement on the aflirays , tumults , riots and public disturbances , which in many countries invariably attend numerous and irregular assemblies of the people . For , in this country , it is generally found , that on such occasions , the people who are assembled , instead of disgracing themselves by tearing down gaols , or other public buildings , and forming turbulent mobs , having been gratified by prolix and complimentary addresses , on their patriotism , intelligence , morality . Sec. &lc.; become comparatively mild and good humored , and vent their spleen or independence , in patriotic , spirited and vain-glorious resolves . The meeting is then dissolved ; the citizens retire filled with self-applause , and glory , and deafened and wearied ; the orators are complimented in the next newspaper , in which the respectability and number of those who attended the meeting , are greatly exaggerated , and the whole subsides in an unruffled calm . 106 Oenerai Rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiss to make a few observations upon the restrictions , which theconstitution of the United States imposes upon the powers of the statei9 . These restrictions may be found in Article I , Sec. 10 . It baa been mentioned already , ante p. 158 , that no state , un* der the constitution , has any right to enter intouany treaty , alliance or confederation , ' fcc . This prohibition extends as well to an alliance , &; c. with another of the United States , as to one with a foreign state . If alliances were formed between two or more states to which the rest were not parties , it would not only lead to jealousies and animosities between the confederate and preferred states , but would be wholly inconsistent with that clause in the constitution , which declares , ' that the citizens of each state , shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . ' On the other hand , if the several states were at liberty to form alliances , fcc. with foreign powers , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the predominant interest which each state is supposed to take in the general welfare of the United States , by a greater interest in the affairs of some ally , by which it might be protected at any time , if it saw fit to oppose itself to the measures of the United States . . By the same section , no state shall grant letters of marque and reprisal . ' The reason of this prohibition is , that this grant is an exercise of sovereign power , which the states do not possess . Congress alone has the power of declaring war . But if any state might grant letters of marque and reprisal , it would have the power of involving the country in a foreign war at any moment . The States are ijso prohibited from coining money . This also is a sovereign power , and confided to congress alone , by the constitution of the United States . If each state had the power of coining money , it would be impossible to keep the specie currency of the Union , of the same standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a sourcQ of various frauds . It is , without doubt , a great disadvantage to all fair dealers , in domestic manufactures , that there is not a national standard for gold and silver plate , established by law in this country , as it is in others . Qenerd Bights. 197 No state can conadtutionally emit bills of credit , or make any thing but gold and silver a lawful tender in payment of ddbts . There is no legal process by which a state can be compelled to redeem its bills ; there is great danger , therefore , if any were issued , that they would soon depreciate ; thb , as is usual in such cases , would give rise to many frauds and inconveniencies upon the unfortunate holders . i No state can constitutionally pass any bill of attainder . No country can be considered free , and consequently no citizen can ever be safe , where the legislature ' is permitted to exercise the iniquitous power of declaring a man guilty'of a Crime , and putting him to death without a lawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree to the enactment of expost facto laws generally , which the states are prohibited from passing by the constitution . This prohibition , however , extends to penal statutes only . See 3 Dal . 386 . And therefore every law which makes an action done before the framing of the law , and which was innocent when done , criminal , and punishes such action , is an expost facto law , and consequently unconstitutional . So , if it aggravates a crime , or makes it greater than it was when committed . So , if it changes the punishment , and inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when It was committed . So , if it alters the legal rules of evidence , and receives any testimony less than , or different from , what the law required when the offence was committed . See ibid . No state can constitutionally pass a law , which iippairs the obligation of contracts . Any law will we considered as impairing the obligation of a contract , which substitutes a mode of performance different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties . As , if it authorized the discharge of the contract by a smaller sum than the contract contains ; or , if it substitutes a different time when it is to be paid , or , introduces any new conditions , or dispenses with any . It is apparent , that any such substitution is virtually a cancelling of the original contract which the parties have made , and making another for them . This can never be done without their consent . See 8 Wheat . 1 . 3 Wash . 313 . See 1 Gal . 388. 12 Wheat . 370 . See 4 Wheat . 518 , 123 . See also the case of the Yazoo lands 6 Cranch. 87. /z/ 198 Qeneral RighU . The statbs are also forbidden to keep on foot any armed force m time of peace , without the consent of congress . This also is a sovereign power , which expediency requires should be exercised by the United States alone . For , if one state keeps a standing army of disciplined troops , the other state will sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate tendency of which , it is not difficult to perceive . The intention of the framers of the constitution , without doubt , was to avoid all occasions , not only of actual collision between the states , but also of jealousies and distrusts . Nor did it escape their observation , that a state prepared with a standing army , would be much less likely to yield a ready obedience to the laws of the United States , than one having nothing to rely upon , in case of resistance , but the transient and undisciplined ardor of citizen soldiers . /z/ Of the right of suffrage and of elections . In governments , where the power is retained in the hands of the people , and is exercised in their name by such delegates as they see fit to appoint from time to time for that purpose , the right to take a part in such appointment or delegation , belongs to every constituent member of the social compact , upon which the government is grounded . This right , in whatever manner it may be exercised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the right wlich each member has of voting upon all subjects , in relation to which the people see fit to exercise their political power personally , and not through the medium of representatives or delegates . The simplest form of a popular government , is that of a pure democracy , where the people meet together in primary assemblies and make suciv laws hnd regulations for the conduct of the members of the society , as they see fit . In the formation of any such government , a difficulty would meiSt tlienai at the outset . For , as soon as any measure was proposed , it would immediately be found that some would be in favor of it , while others would be equally opposed to it . In this case , one party or the other must recede , or the society would be dissolved . Because each individual would think himself justified in saying that he did not intend , by joining the society , to have his feelings or interests made a sacrifice to those of others ; that /z/ Pm /z/ 202 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurrence , or he would secede . This , it is obvious , he would have a perfect right to do , until some regulation on this subject had been unanimously agreed upon by all the members . It would soon appear , therefore , since perfect unanimity could seldom be found among them , that the society would gradually melt away by the withdrawing of discontented individuals , unless some substitute for it were agreed upon by the society . They would therefore very naturally adopt the principle of mutual concession , and agree that the will of the greater number should bind the whole society , in the same manner as if they had all been unanimous . Not that this is always to be considered as conclusive proof , that the measure approved of by the majority , is really the most wise and expedient ; for , perfect unanimity itself would afford no such proof . But as , according to the democratic theory , all the associates or members of society are equal in wisdom and virtue , as weQ as in their rights , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in direct proportion to the numbers who vote in favor of it , and vice versa . It is true , only a few out of the whole number , really possess wisdom , but those few are perhaps more likely tp be found in the majority of the whole , than in the minority . But , however this may be , experience teaches us , that evelry inan supposes himself to have his share , and whether he have or have not , at all events he has a will , and this he will never yield to the control of another spontaneously , unless he iSnds it for his interest to do so . It is very clear , therefore , that though it may be perfecdy natural in the familiar use of the term , that the members of a society should agree , at the first formation of it , that the expre will or vote of the greater number , should always have the effect of perpetual unanimity , yet this effect has no other foundation whatever , in natural right . For , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where , independently of a previous agreement , that the vote of the majority shall prevail , the greater number have any such right to control the whole society , that the smaller number , or minority , are under a moral obligation to submit to their decision . On the contrary , the right of selfpreservation , as well in the smaller number as in the larger .

The man at the.faelmL bfis as much right to steer a ship on Scylla , if he thinks slfpreservation demands it , as all the rest of the crew bave to coimpel him , if they can , to turn tpwards Charybdis . If therefore necessity itself acknowledges no such paramount right , in the majority , it is clear that it can have no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The prevalence of the democratic notion , that the majority bve a natural right to decide and govern the whole , has probably prevented an examination of the question , whether a better rule might not be adopted in public assemblies than the usual one , that the vote of a mere majority shall decide in all ces . That there are many inconveniences resulting fron the adoption of it , is very clear ; and that these inconvenences may not be obviated by a modification or qualification f this rule , is not easily demonstrable . The inconveniences which result from the adoption of the rule , that a majority , however small , and though consisting of a single individual , more than the number of the minority , shall be sufficient to determme the rejeetion or adoption of all public measures , however important , are the following , viz. 1 . The casual absence of one or two members , may enable the minority to pass laws or adopt other public measures , entirely contrary to the will of the majority . 2 . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority and the minority , any single individual has it in his power to control the whole legislative body of which he is a member , and may turn the scale in all cases when the whole number is thus divided , at his caprice or discretion . Here the individual , having the least reputation to preserve , the least regard for principle ; and who is most susceptible of corrupt influences , will be most apt to gain the ascendancy . For , men of character and principle will stand firm , out of a regard to duty and consistency . But unprincipled men will sell them- 304 Some Particular ESgfis. selves as well as their country , and so favorable a conjuncture will enable them to command the highest price . 3 . But upon the improbable supposition , that there is not a single unprincipled individual in the legislative assembly , it follows , that the person possessing the most feeble intellect , and who consequently is the most wavering and unsettled , will immediately become of the greatest influence and importance . All the rest may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their views of the subject . But , this individual having less knowledge and discernment , will act from motives of ostentation and vain glory . 4 . But , if they are all men of sense and integrity , still it is found by experience , that a public measure of any considerable importance , which is adopted by the vote of a small majority , is of doubtful expediency , and seldom attended with a good result . The reason is , not only because the minority is so numerous , that it may be considered an equal question , whether in reality the adoption of the measure is wise or not ; but , because the people immediately become divided into factions in relation to the subject . The question , though settled for that time , will be brought up again and again . The public mind is kept in a state of excitement and exasperation in respect to it . Intrigue and corruption are resorted to . The public policy in relation to the great interests of the country , continue uncertain and wavering , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then re-enacted with qualifications , he . &^.; The parties prevail alternately , but never without great heat , strife and animosity , and if the question is ever finally settled , it is through the influence of any considerations , rather than those of justice , wisdom or public expediency . Many of these inconveniences would be avoided by require ing the sanction of a larger proportion , than a mere majority of a quorum . Let a decisive majority consisting of two thirds of a quorum , always be necessary to authorize a change in the existing state of public afifairs , by the adoption of new measures , and there would be an end to most of the evils just refer* red to . For , unless the expediency of a law or other public measure , were very apparetit , there would be no probability , Right iff Suffrage and of EUdians. 205 that two thirds of the legislature would be in favor of its enactment or adoption ; and , if so , the opposition would have but little prospect of success in any attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus public policy would be less subject to change . For , as it would require the concurrence of two thirds to enact a law , it would also require the concurrence of two thirds to repeal it . This would produce a proper caution in the enactment of laws ; for , though a fractipn over one third of the quorum , would be sufficient to prevent the enactment of a law , a majority of twice that number would be necessary to procure any modification of it . This rule is wisely adopted in relation to amendments of the constitution , where frequent changes would be absolutely intolerable ; and it is believed , great advantages would immediately be perceived , if it were extended to the acts of the federal and state legislatures. - In the election of rulers and other public ofcers , different codsideratbns will necessarily vary the jonclusion . Here , a mere majority of voices ought to be allowed to prevail ; because if two thirds were required it would always be in the power of a numerou s minority to prevent the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of votes , where there are more candidates than two , ought not to be sufficient to constitute a choice ; because , in this way , there is a possibility that the individual most odious to a majority of the voters , may prevail in the election . In a republic , or any form of government more complicated than a simple democracy , of which a town ipeeting for the making of by-laws may be considered a fair example , all the voice or influence , which the people have in the regulation of public affairs , is exercised through the medium of senators , delegates , or representatives , whom they choose to act for them in the various capacities established by their constitution , or frame of government . If they would make the most advantage of their right in this respect , it is obvious that they should take care to select men of integrity , and well qualified to discharge the duties of the offices which they are expected to fill . For , since the people have a right to vote for any candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the right of sufiTrage , depends upon the op- 206 Some Particular Bkii. portunities , which it affirds the citizensi of excluding all who are incapable or unworthy , from stations of responsibility , and placing in them those only whom they esteem most deserving of their respect and confidence . Yet , in practice , it is found , that these two great objects of a democratic form of government , are but partially obtained , owing to the manner in which the people usually exercise their rights in this respect . The reason , why the people so frequently fail of obtaining full success in relation to these objects , will be best exhibited in answers to ' the two questions , Why are not the best men always chosen ? and . Why are not unsuitable men always excluded ? In answer to these questions , it might be thought captious , to remark , that the people are not qualified to determine who are the most suitable candidates for public offices for , though popular applause , or censure , is no decisive proof either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there usually some foundation for popular opinions . But , supposing the people to possess an unerring judgment of the merits of candidates , they must necessarily be deprived of the benefit of their superior discernment , by a certain course of measures which frequently is adopted by influential persons , previous to the elections , and by which they attempt to secure the choice of the candidates whom they support . Under a government of laws , it is true , that it is a matter of no great consequence , by whom the laws are executed , the sole object of government being to provide that they tshall be properly enforced . Among these laws , however , must of course , be included every rule or regulation , adopted for the general defence and protection . Now to the great body of the people , being neither office seekers , nor office holders , and consequently having no other personal interest in the government , than what concerns their own safety , and the regular administration ' of the laws , it is a matter of no jreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. , provided only that the public peaceas well as private tranquillity , is preserved , and the lawi are enacted with wisdom , and executed with prudence . But , in choosing persons for public offices , the people , according to the true theory of a republican form of government , should be guided by the characters of the re- Bight ( ' iStff e and of J &ettions.; 307 spective candidati ; atid should elect those whom they consider to possess the best labilities , and the most industry , fidel- ity , and integrity . ' For , in the beau ideal of a republic , there are no parties or factioifs . Each individual aims at the gen* eral good , though not to the total exclusion or neglect of bis own private interests . And therefore , though he will not be disinterested enough to sacrifice his private property to the public good ; yet , if he is an office seeker or office holder , he will be so triie a patriot , as immediately to relinquish his office in favor of some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be looked for in vain , in the present generation , any where but in eulogiums , theatrical exhibitibns , obituary notices , or anniversary orations ; and such as is here described , it is to be feared , will seldom be found , except in Utopia , or the Island of Formosa . Experience shows , that there are always two or more parties or factions in a community , the well disposed part of each of which , equally seek the best interests of the whole . But , in all such parties or factions , those who make a pretence of the public good to bring about their own private views and selfish purposes , are far more zealous and forward , than those who aim only at the general good . By a show of greater 2eal , they expect to be regarded as having a more ardent patriotism ; and among superficial observers , the single-hearted , nd the inexperienced , they commonly obtain their aim . And thbugh true patriotism , such as existed among noble and disr interested men of former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience , and the applause of such as are able to distinguish and justly value true merit , is a stronger motive than the sordid considerations of profit , office , or - station ; yet this quality is so infrequent , and office seekers so often assume the mask of it , while laying their parts before the public , that some hypocondriacs and misanthropes deny that there is any such thing as political integrity in any of those , who hold themselves up as candidates for public office .
