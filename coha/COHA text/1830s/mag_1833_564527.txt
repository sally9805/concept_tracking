txt " Wny do n't you , my hoy , write something solid , and let alone this light and trivial stuff ? Why do n't you give them a real sober , sub stantial , argumentative piece ? " " Father , what you call a real solid article would not be read , and ten to one my publisher would not accept of it for his Magazine . He understands what sort of wares sell well in the reading market , and consults his own interest by consulting the popular taste . " " No , no , boy , I ca n't believe all that . Your publisher , as you call him , is a man of sense , and would appreciate a sound essay ; - he is a man of independence , and would publish what he himself likes ; he is a man of good principles , and wishes to elevate instead of servilely obeying the popular taste . You will lose his respect by writing such trash as your school-boy anecdotes of grammars and dictionaries . I insist on your sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair specimen of what you can do . There is your article on Dr. Channing 's Review of the Character of Napoleon , if you would let Mr. B. have that , it would do tolerably well . " " Why , Father , I am a little afraid that your democratic* partiality for Bonaparte makes you like that article rather more than the good aristocratic Bostonians would . Besides , sir , the article was written two years ago , when my opinions differed somewhat from their present character , and contains some severe reflections on the excellent divine whose production it reviews ; - it might possibly give offence to his friends . " " Pshaw ! a difference of opinion , boldly and decidedly expressed , can not offend any man of sense . At all events , on a stibject so important as the character of Napoleon , you should not fear to let your sentiments be known , although the declaration of them may offend some . I should like to see that article in print , particularly since the // Doctor 's own article is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book . " " Well , sir , I will send it to Mr. B. ; but I shall tell him that it was written for a debating club in a rather stormy style , and that , so far as its reflections on Dr. Channing are concerned , it meets my present disapprobation , although I still retain my former opinion of Bonaparte , and rank him among the first three ' giants of greatness that have towered up above the generality of their race . But there are few of Mr. B 's readers , I apprehend , who will thank me for granting your request . " And now for the DEFENCE OF NAPOLEON . The actions and character of Napoleon Bonaparte are now matter of history . He is dead-he , who , for twenty years , was the master of Europe ; - he , who , born in an unknown corner of an insignificant island , to neither wealth nor distinction , in less than thirty years , spread his name a broad and living glory over the world ; in less than forty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the C*usars ; in less than fifty , changed the political face of Christendom ; and , in less than sixty , effected revolutions and begun operations that all coming time shall continue to wonder at , and admire . He is dead ; and the sepulchre , that covers his dust , should stand unpolluted alike by the sacrilege of enemies , or the sacrifices of mistaking frieiids . We would approach it in the spirit of candor ; with our hearts free from the passions of partizans ; anxious to learn for ourselves , and for our children , the lessons of wisdom which his life may afford . We believe ourselves moved by this honesty of purpose , when we lift up our voices against that intolerant and unjust spirit , which , as we think , characterises the work now under consideration . We lament that we are called on to censure , in any manner , the ' sentiments of a writer whose literary and private character are so highly exalted as are those of Dr. Channing ; but , considering his opinions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attain , by means of his name , undue prevalence , we can not forbear our censure . The calumny of the Holy Alliance should not , even under the sanction of so great a name , be allowed to gain credence in American hearts . We have the privilege of impartial and unbiassed thought . L*t us apply it to the case in hand . Dr. Channing 's remarks on the character of Bonaparte are prefaced by an encomium on the impartiality and fairness of Walter Scott 's Life of that great man . Had we never read a sentence beyond this , know .. ing , as we now know , the genuine character of Scott 's work , we should have pronounced the opinion of the critic , with regard to Napoleon himself , utterly wrong . Scott 's impartiality is justly called , by Mr. Walsh , an equivocal candor ; " it is all cant . He was inspired throughout by the genuine sentiments of an Englishman and a Tory ; and his unfairness has been exposed with equal indignation by the fraternal defence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) candid Secretary Bourrienne . It was our lot to read aloud the work of Scott on its first appearance , to two several individuals , whose memories ran back as far as the Italian campaigns , and who both cried out against // the illiberality and misrepresentation of the author . The haste with which the " Life " was prepared for the press ; the anonymous character of the compiler ; the unauthentic sources of his information , and his own national prejudice , forbade the possibility of either accuracy or fairness ; and the numerous blunders , misstatements , and misrepresentations , with which a careful reader will find it crowded , and still more , the attacks made on it by all succeeding French writers , prove , most fully , that it can not be considered worthy of confidence . When , therefore , the above sentence in our reviewer met our eye , we were prepared to meet all the peculiarities of opinion ,  --  we will not say unfairness of argument-that follows . Let us run our eyes over his pages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this make our remarks desultory , it will not , perhaps , lessen their interest . " The service which secured his command in Italy , " says Channing , " was the turning of his artillery on the people , who , however dangerous when acting as a mob , happened , in the present case , to understand their right , and were directing their violence against manifest usurpation . " This is both unfair and untrue . Unfair , because it throws a shade of blame on Napoleon for an obedience to both the Legislature and his superior officer , Barras , which he was obliged to render ; and untrue , because the mob on the " day of the Sections , " as it is called , were directing their efforts against that legislative body whom the people had elected , and whom none but the people , and they only by vote , could displace . It was a mob stirred up by the royalist party , as Scott himself allows ; * and its purpose was nothing less than another Revolution , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " What rights have a Parisian mob in opposition to the will of the French nation ? " Manifest usurpation ! " Where is the usurpation of a legislature elected by popular suifrages , and submitting their incasures to the votes of the people ? Speaking of his Italian campaigns ,  --  those campaigns in which a mere boy defeated the oldest and ablest generals in Europe ; overturned the whole former system of military science , and drew the eyes of the world in wonder on the brilliancy of his exploits ,  --  the critic allows that his courage , " howmuchsoever doubted afterwards , never faltered then . " When was his courage suspected ? The utmost malice of his worst enemies , never impeached his personal bravery , except on two occasions ; and as every one , who undertakes learned comment on his character , ought to know , the impeachment was , in both cases , entirely false . The occasions alluded to , were his retreat from Russia , and the affair of Waterloo ; and even his bitterest foes have recanted their accusations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , by persuasion and entreaty , to hasten his flight from Russia to Paris ; and that , during the day of Waterloo , his courage and coolness never wavered , lie was seen plunging , at times , into the thick battle , and adding his shout to the war-cry of his brave soldiers ; and , at times , calmly surveying the conflict ; directing its movements , and ordering up his reserves . But the testimony , which Bernard and Foy so richly bear to his gallantry on that day , is unnecessary . That // the French army should have been able , with inferior numerical force , to sustain , during a whole day , their position against the English ; - that they should have been the constant assailants ; and that , until twenty thousand Prussians came up to the aid of Wellington , he dared not advance a single foot , is enough to vindicate every Frenchman from the imputation of cowardice . We are next , notwithstanding our high regard for a truly great and good man , almost impelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of the closet peeps out through the rents in his tattered robe of argument ; at the absurd comparison between the greatness of him who moulds mankind to his will and purpose , and of him who conquers the rules of grammar and the flowers of rhetoric . The Doctor could not deny " that a mind that takes in a wide country at a glance ; which disposes small forces so as to counteract greater ones ; which supplies by skill , science , and genius , the want of numbers ; which dives into the councils of its enemy , and which gives unity , energy , and success to a vast sphere of operations , in the midst of casualties and obstructions which no wisdom could foresee , " must indeed be gigantic . But still he would depre*iate it . And so he tells us that the chief work of a general is to apply physical force ; to remove physical obstructions ; to avail himself of physical aids and advantages ; to act on matter ; to overcome rivers , ramparts , mountains , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were affected or demonstrated , not by its results , but by its means of operation , and the objects on which it operates ; as though the thunderbolt which blazes in mid-heaven , and is gazed on with emotions of sublimity while leaping from cloud to cloud , is no longer the object of awe and admiration when it buries itself in the earth ; as though omnipotence were no longer glorious , when stooping to the creation of the material universe ; as though the redemption of man from political slavery , were not desirable if it must be accomplished by the toil of body as well as mind ; - if it must have relation to physical obstructions ! Genius is to be recognized by the greatness of its results ; not by the means it uses , any further than this ,  --  that the smaller they are , its results remaining the same , the more splendid is the genius . But this author considers the greatness of the warrior , the statesman , the man of practical science , as infinitely below that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , who , in his closet , may find a fault in the conduct or purposes of earth 's master spirit , as far higher than the genius of that master spirit by which the destiny of half a world may be shaped ; the talents of him who solves a problem as more godlike than his who makes that solution tell for centuries upon the condition of nations . Were this reasoning correct , the data are false , and , accordingly , the writer soon involves himself in contradiction , by what he says respecting the grand passage of St. Bernard , by Bonaparte , in the Italian campaign which followed his return from Egypt . He says , " it showed a power over the MINDS of his soldiers , the effects of which were not to be calculated ; the capacity to inspire the army with that inte se force , confidence , resolution , and patience , by which , alone , the work could be accomplished . " Is this overcoming physical obstruction ? Or was it by operating on " mere matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sovereign of the hearts ,  --  the fears , hates , and affections ,  --  of all Europe ? Napoleon is next charged with professing lahometan sm , * claiming inspiration , and ii suiting God , during his Egyptian campaigns . We are happy , from the memoirs of Bourrienne , his private secretary , whose object never is to praise Bonaparte , as well as from Las Casas , to deny these charges , and reduce them to their real elements ; - the simple facts , that Napoleon availed himself of the belief in fatalism , common to the Mahommetans , to make them submit to his power ; - that he wisely allowed them freedom of conscience ; that he once , in his own tent , and to amuse his table companions , put on the dress of a Turk ; that he never made a profession of Islamism , and never entered a mosque ,  --  which is always done in such cases . But we are almost constrained to suspect that our author did not investigate the perfect accuracy of the vulgar reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not , it would seem , on the succeeding page , have heaped upon his shoulders such stern reproach and bitter revilings for the military execution , or , as he calls it , " slaughter , " at Jaffa . The Turks , who were there shot , were shot , according to Bonaparte 's account , in conformity with the laws of warfare , as having violated their own solemn compact , by which , when they had been previously captured at the taking of the fort of El Arish , they had bound themselves to return peaceably to their homes , and never again bear arms against him . Bourrienne gives rather a different account ; but there could not be found an abler exposition of the circumstances , by which this act was produced , nor a better vindication of Napoleon . We commend it to the perusal of our readers . The laws of war are bloody ; - they are awfully wicked ;  --  and we hope that their barbarity will not remain proof against the spirit of mercy which prevail every where else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thrown on the law , - not on the French General . But setting entirely aside the laws of war , and looking only at the circumstances , under the force of which Bonaparte acted , we find nothing in him of cruelty or injustice ; nothing to censure or detest ; but much to admire and praise , as well as much to pity . And , if the account of Bourrienne be true , and there is no reason to doubt it , Bonaparte could not have done otherwise than as he did , thoubh he obeyed the stern dictate of necessity with reluctance and regret . * The manner in which Bonaparte , on his return from Egypt , assumed the executive power , is next made the topic of animadversion . He is stigmatized as " an Usurper . " According to our humble opinion this is an unjust judgement , and the conduct of Napoleon , when measured by the circumstances under the pressure of which he acted , was just what it should have been . The populace and their legislature were at open enmity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided that the bloodiest civil strifes seemed to be inevitable ; there was no individual , save Napoleon Bonaparte , sufficiently prominent to attract the eyes , and attach the heads of all he was universally popular ; and the deep and awful tones of state necessity , seconded by the oceanroar // of the people 's voice , called on him to assume the power ,  --  scatter the hated senate ,  --  and become the Ruler of France . Before such facts , all reasonings on propriety and etiquette fade into nothing ; - it is childish to think of giving law to revolutions ; and it is vain to deny that , when Bonaparte assumed the reins of government , the great elements of society were broken up , and in commotion ; the heavens lowered , and the earth rocked , and the ocean trembled ; - he came forward as the rider of the whirlwind ,  --  the director of the storm ,  --  and the elemental war was hushed ; - France subsided into calm ,  - -  union and strength grew up at once , and a whole nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a common slander against Bonaparte , and one adopted in this article , that Napoleon depended on a faithful army for his elevation . Let us look at facts . The soldiers , over whom he had acquired that influence which able and successful military leaders always exert over their troops ,  --  his " Italians , " as he styled them ,  --  were in the midst of the burning sands of Egypt , where he had just left them . To the armies in France he was almost a stranger . An absence of years had of course driven the recollection of his victories somewhat into the back ground . tf he troops in Paris had never known him . It is evident , therefore , that something besides military aid sustained him . And if we look at the universal joy of the people , manifested on his return through hundreds of leagues over which he traveled from Frejus to Paris ; the acclamations of all France ; the flocking to him of all the various parties of that weak directorial government , against which universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as the one who alone possessed sufficient popularity , caution , confidence , and talent , to meet the demands of that great crisis ; if we look at all this , we may see on what he depended for his rise ;  --  the firm foundations of his power ; - the grand basis of his " usurpation . " And yet he is called " an usurper . " He , who , on the day of the Sections , incurred the Doctor 's reproaches for turning his cannon against the mob of Paris , in obedience to the Legislature , is now branded as an usurper , for obeying the commands of the whole people , and dispersing the Senate . But Bonaparte did not prove a Washington ; - he did not establish a Republic ; and Dr. Channing calls him " usurper : " - he , too , who , thirty pages further on , tells us that France was not " ripe for liberty ; " that " her character forbade her to be free ; " that it was " insanity to expect them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their touch , and polluted by their breath , "  --  the same author yet brands him " usurper , " who assumed his power by force of circumstances , and , to a most unexpected degree , made it a blessing to his country . Is not this inconsistency ? Our author next proceeds to a consideration of the means employed by Bonaparte to strengthen his power , and make it popular . He passes by unnoticed those wonderful Austrian and Prussian campaigns , in which the , eagles of France flew from victory to victory with a rapidity and certainty of flight never before known in warfare . He avoids noticing these campaigns ; - they are too brilliant for censure and he turns to the civil policy of Napoleon with the hope of there finding something less illustrative of mental greatness . Of the whole // system the Doctor makes the general complaints that it does not bear the marks of a lofty intellect : - that it is " a repetition of old means , when the state of the world was new ; " or in other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means whose 1ower u'as known , to effect his purposes , when he might have struck out a new path , and chosen means of unknown efficacy . The incorrectness of this idea will be fully shown , 1st . By inquiring what were the ends which he desired to accomplish , and the means which he used * and , 2dly , by the contradiction in the writer 's arguments . But , before taking up these two points , we would make the general remark that , much praise is due to the writer 's uncommon modesty and diffidence of his own powers , displayed in the freely-chalked outline of what Bonaparte should have done , and the following comment , that " it was impossible for such a man as Napoleon to adopt , perhaps to conceive , a system such as has now been traced . " Behold a greater than Bonaparte is here ! We say then that the inconsistency of the complaint will be clearly shown , by inquiring what were the ends which Bonaparte desired to accomplish , and the means which he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished were the safety of his government , and the prosperity and glory of France . The safety of his government was the safety of the people ; and it depended on their unanimity , and his power and popularity . 2d . The means he used , so far as we can judge , were wisely chosen and most ably employed . On assuming the government he gathered around him , for counsellors , the wisest and best of every party ; thus uniting , without reference to personal dislike , the talents of France , and reducing to order and quiet the chaos and tumult that had before reigned . Even this the author converts into reproach ,  --  or at best equivocal praise . Bonaparte found the people of France destitute of religion : - the face of that fair land was defiled with infidelity and scepticism : but he knew that its abominations would be followed by a reaction of sentiment : that religion was essential to government : that it would and must return . He therefore resolved that it should no longer be a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependence on , the Pope , as its head : that France , like England , should be independent of all foreign influence : and that while full freedom of conscience was tolerated , the national religion should produce only national good . Hence the Concordat , **or compact with the Pope , that France should be no longer a part of the Roman S e , but contain in itself a full religious system . And in searching for a reply to cavilings on the policy of this measure , let us remember what Bonaparte said to the philosopher Wieland- " the people must have a religion  --  and this religion is for the people , not for philosophers . " He saw in England the happiest * By the concordat the Pope agreed to the soppression of sixty Bisboprics , and several Arcbblshoprics-and to the confiscation of nearly $100,000,000 , the property of the clergy , which bad been taken from them early in the cevohition . See Boncrienne t. 392 . Napoleon said jost before the Coneordat , " in reviving a religion which has always prevailed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , and in giving the liberty of worship to the minority , I shall satisfy every one . " Some of his Generals and others who had lived so lon without religion that they could isot endnre it , opposed this re-elablisbinetit of it in France . we are as to ished to find an American associated with them in opinion . // results from the renunciation of Papal supremacy , and he hoped that France might share in their benefit . The great public works of Napoleon may be regarded as part of that system , by which he made himself the monarch of the hearts of the people ; the emperor , not of France but , of Frenchmen . While time shall spare these magnificent results of his genius , or preserve their recollection , they will be a sufficient answer to the sneering approbation given them by our author . They speak , in a language like that of the visible wonders of the universe , on which is written the power of God ,  --  of mind ; - mind before which all obstacles vanished away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect whose grasp was universal . Till the day of Bonaparte , France was cut up into provinces , each one of which was governed by its own peculiar and imperfect laws and customs there was no great system of jurisprudence ; no coincidence of laws : all was confusion and insecurity . His wisdom collected the materials of a revolution whose benefits can never be forgotten . Under his patronage , and by the aid of his counsels , a system of laws was formed , of such perfect and universal application , that the rights of persons and property were every where fixed , security was felt , public confidence established , and the whole nation made ready to call him truly their father . The gift of this code to the people of France , was as far superior to those forms of free government , for not establishing which , he has been so unjustly blamed , as substance is to shadow . Good laws , and their impartial administration , are the essence of liberty ;  --  the people that have them are free , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compilers of this code himself , instead of leaving it to be formed by a legislature chosen by the people , is shown by the multitude of constitutions and systems , passed and promulgated , with theatrical rapidity , by the short-lived legislatures , which , one after another , arose , lived their ephemeral life , and then perished with all their labors . The nation was not prepared for self.government . But this is probably one of those " old means " of which the reviewer complains ; old ,  --  though France had never before known the blessings of law : - old ,  --  though never before was boon so rich given by monarch to his people : - old ,  - -  though it sprang at once into existence , with all those features of wisdom and perfection , which the English code owes to the gradual improvement of centuries ! For the glory of France , as well as for the security of its domestic goverment , conquest ,  --  military distinction ,  --  supremacy in the scale of European kingdoms , was to be sought . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perfectly adapted to this object , as that system of national education Which Napoleon introduced and made popular . We are not the advocates of war . But we have candor enough honestly to admire and praise that exalted talent , which striking out for itself some grand object , devises a correspondingly grand and efficient plan , by which the object may be accomplished . Granting that the object of Bonaparte was the elevation of France to the head of Europe by the force of war , never was a system of education so perfectly adapted to its end , as that-which included in its operation the whole youth of France , and made the empire one vast military school , while at the same time the arts of peace never declined // or drooped , but continued to flourish as before . Was this overcoming " physical obstructions , " or " making use of old means But 2dly . The incorrectness of the writer 's ideas may be read in the inconsistency of his arguments . Bonaparte is blamed and depreciated on one page for that spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect the " gilding of the chain " with which he fettered sovereigns ; to neg- ' lect those courtesies and flatteries which might have gained their favor : and on the next page he is condemned for retaining the pomp of royalty , for desiring to connect himself with royal families : for prefering the good will of sovereigns to that of the people . At one moment , he is reproached for the selection of counsellors , and at another , for acting against the advice of those very men who were so badly chosen . Now , his impiety and want of religion are condemned :  --  and now his establishment of the ancient religion . He who can not preserve consistency and clearness of argument through the brief limits of fifty pages , in one train of thought , should not thus censure him whose thoughts and cares were spread over a broad empire ; - who was the soul ,  --  the moving principle , of every thing military , political , scientific , in France . But the unkindest cut of all , and what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the attack on his personal character : the impeachment of his heart . Our author asserts that " he ( Bonaparte ) wanted the sentiment of a common nature with his fellow beings : " that " he had no sympathies with his race : " that " his heart , amidst all its wild beatings , never had one thought of disinterested love : " that " no domestic attachment , no private friendship , no love of pleasure , no relish for letters or the arts , no human sympathy , no human weakness , divided his mind with the passion for dominion , and for dazzling man Westations of his power . " And of whom is this affirmed ? of what monster are these things said ? Is it of some infernal spirit , who , from the black and yawning abyss , has risen in all the horrors of his diabolic form and nature , to blast our eyes , and turn our souls to detestation and loathing ? No ! - it is of him who melted at the tears of a boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded up his heart to the grace and beauty of a fortuneless widow , when he had the path of glory before him ; whose letters to her literally burn with passionate love ; who granted the prayer of the wife , and spared the traitor ; who was ready to sacrifice , as he himself declared , rank , hopes , every thing , rather than find his Josephine unfaithful ; who visited the hospital , and breathed the thick air of contagion , to comfort the wounded and dying ; who , after battle , was first and last in the care of the wounded , and in the reward of the brave ; who , in the day of power and prosperity , never forgot the friends of his youth , and his poverty ; whose marshalls were once his fellow privates ; whose house-keeper in boyhood was the keeper of his palace in mid-life ; whose school-chum was the private secretary of the Emperor ; who parted , with embraces and tears , from his officers on the confines of Russia ; who loved his son with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , whether in his palace , in die camp , on board the ship that bore him to his island prison , or in that desolate spot to which he was banished ; whose grave is now knelt upon wit h tears by // every Frenchman that visits it ; whose memory is a heart-quake to all who came within the sphere of his power , and whose name is associated with more of undying recollection than ever yet embalmed the name of man . Such is the monster of this writer 's detestation , and we thank God that we are so fully able to refute the black charges that are brought against him . We have now finished our reply to the individual attack made on Bonaparte . We turn to that essay on greatness with which the reviewer closes his attack , and by which he reduces his victim far down in the scale of human character . That the principles developed in this essay are unsound and unphilosophical we think can be demonstrated . He divides greatness into three classes or orders : viz : - lst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3d . The greatness of action . We think that this division is unphilosophical , and that under each portion of it the author has erred . Let us look at the general division of greatness . The mind of man consists of moral powers , and intellectual faculties ; both of which are exerted in every voluntary action . Man has also physical powers ; the power of sinew and muscle , which may be exerted without the deliberate operation of mind ,  --  as in the case of instinctive movements . But deliberative action involves both intellectual and moral operations , and is an index , or bodying forth , of the mind . What in this treatise the author calls " greatness of action , " then , ought to be referred either to intellectual or moral greatness , and so we reduce his three divisions to two . This will be seen , more clearly , on examining his definition of " active greatness . " " It is the sublime power , " says he , " of conceiving bold and extensive plans ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation ? and if it be sublimely great , does it not manifest intellectual greatness ? " It is , " to continue the quotation , " the power of constructing , and bringing to bear on a mighty object , a complicated machinery of means , energies , and arrangements ; " and is not this the triumph of mind ? is it not the exercise of strong judgement , far seeing discrimination , profound intellectual analysis ? is it not intellectual greatness ? We must , then , embody his third division with the other two , as unnecessary . But , 2dly . Let us look at the other two portions of his division , and inquire whether here be not some error , or inaccuracy . And 1st . Moral greatness , in his own splendid diction , " is that sublime energy by which the soul , smitten with the love of virtue , binds itself indissolubly for life and for death to truth and duty ; espouses as its own the interest of human nature ; scorns all meanness and defies all peril ; hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunders : withstands all the powers of the universe which would sever it from the cause offreedom and religion ; reposes an unfaltering trust in God in the darkest hour , and is ever ready to be offered up on the altar of its country or of mankind . " That this view of moral greatness , though powerfully set forth , is much too limited , may be made manifest by an examination of what // are called our moral powers and the modes of their operation . Moral greatness is not , in our opinion , what the above definition makes it , mere goodness : it is not identical with elevation of moral character it is the greatness of any of these mental powers , which , in contradistinction to intellectual , are called moral ; it embraces energy of purpose , without reference to the nature of the thing to be done ; courage , without regard to the cause in which it is displayed ; inflexibility of determination ; fortitude in suffering ; loftiness of aim and effort , whether good or bad : in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of our nature . Moral greatness is not the opposite of moral depravity ; - tliat is moral excellence ; - it is not connected with truth , virtue , and correct moral principle alone ; but may be , and often is , associated with vice , and is displayed in purposes of evil , in the execution of which , man tasks to their uttermost , all the powers of his mind-intellectual and moral . To illustrate my meaning , I will take an instance or two of moral greatness in its several forms of sublimity , grandeur , and beauty , wherein there appears no moral excellence . Who , that has read the poetry of Milton , has not felt his bosom glow with strong emotions , called forth by the stern pride , the unconquerable will , and unflinching courage , of that bad angel who led astray one third part of heaven 's myriads , and who , when hurled down to the flaming gulg-still dared to say , in undiminished hate , confronting the Almighty punisher , " Better to reign ix hell-than serve in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proud endurance of the captive savage , who , in the midst of tortures and trials , suffers no muscle to quiver , no moisture to gather in his eye , no tell-tale sign of agony to prove the traitor of his heart ; but , with the smile of indifference and the sneer of scorn , submits himself silently to the ingenious malice of his enemies , or in the firm tones of his pride calls out to them " Proceed , ye tormentors , your threats are in vain ; The son of lilnomach voiil never compla Again , with what powerful emotions do we read of the all-conquering , all-defying , love of that Roman Matron , who , when her husband was commanded by the edict of a savage Emperor to choose between suicide and execution , took , with untrembling hand the dagger , and , slowly burying it in her bosom , exclaimed to him whom she would accompany even in death- " T is easy , Pretus . " Now we inquire whether each of these illustrations be not an exhibition of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said must make it manifest , we think , that the author 's view of this subject is imperfect . That his definition of intellectual greatness is also too narrow has been shown by the fact that most of what he calls the " greatness of action , " should be included under this head . Intellectual greatness is manifested by every high and grand conception ; by every action ? which is the result of premeditation , and which is beyond the common sphere of performance ; by the institution of wise laws , no less than by the composition of a splendid poem ; by the conception and execution of // grand and useful works , no less than by the power of criticising those works ; by the management of a vast empire , with all its countless cares , in times of tempest and peril , no less , certainly , than by that keenness of mental vision , which , from the calmness of the closet , looks out upon the toil and tumult of the world , and discovers much to censure and condemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retains the sway over the destiny and purposes of half the world , as by him , who utters shrewd comments on the weight and power of that influence and on the mind that possesses it . We have now concluded our notice of Dr. Channing 's opinion of Napoleon Bonaparte . We are happy to concur with him in that love of peace and dread of warfare which induced him to strip of false glory , and undeserved reputation , the greatest warrior of modern times ; but we can not allow ourselves to doubt that this great military leader was moved by an intellect more powerful than has for ages been called into action , and that a vast amount of the civil commotion and of the bloodshed which surrounded his path , was not owing to the depravity of his heart , and the blackness of his designs , but to the spirit of liberty , roused from its slumber of ages into fierce conflict with the powers of oppression , and the intolerable abuses of long-established tyranny . B.@@183068540.txt Mr. Dana belongs to that class of poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever may be said of the uniform and eternal principles of taste , running through all hearts and binding all ages and nations in a consenting attraction to similar forms of the sublime and beautiful , we must believe , that , excepting in a few general principles , mankind can never agree as to what they relish and admire . They are divided into sections ; they have parted the field of the imagination into different inclosures ; and often what is a precious flower in one man 's garden , beautiful for its color , medicinal in its fragrance , is , in another 's , a worthless weed , to be rooted from the soil , and thrown , in detestation , away . In plain English , we are very inadequate judges of each other 's mental pleasures ; there is certainly great meaning in the proverb , that there is no disputing about tastes ; and we have often thought , that when a reviewer or critic has been laying down general rules , as he supposed , he has only been giving us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted that the elements of taste are the same in all minds , yet they are modified so much in each individual by accidental causes-grieg joy , prosperity , adversity , education , morals-that it is impossible to reason on them as if they were alike . We have heard some modest musicians say , that they could sing well enough to do their own singing ; and perhaps it would be well if every critic would say that he can criticise enough to do his own criticism . rfhere is something of presumption in imputing our own impressions to all mankind . Dr. Johnson was a great critic ; and the Lives of the Poets is one of the most attractive books that we ever read . But there are some decisions in that book , laid down with all the oracular importance of general rules , which , we suspect , never had a wider circle of influence than the very singular mind , that produ*zed them . Thus , blank verse must always be inflated prose ; a pastoral must always be a poor vulgar thing ; religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an epitaph , with whatever pathos and discrimination written , is good for nothing unless it contains all the vowels and consonants of the dead man 's name . But pray , from what ocean of universal feeling and experience did this profound adventurer fish up these important principles ? Why , from the pool and puddle of his own mind ? Happening to be a tory , he hated Milton ; and , hating Milton , he hated blank verse ; and , hating blank verse , he hated all who wrote in blank verse ; and hence comes the great critical law . He was near-sighted ; and hence rural descriptions were all hollow , and of course Pastorals . As lie was an enormous eater , he had the crapula ; and hence was gloomy ; and hence irritable ; hence could not bear to think of religion ; and hence he disliked all religious poetry . Why an epitaph , without // a name , must be worthless to all readers , it may be difficult to conjecture ; it doubtless arises from some capricious feeling ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no one has recorded , and he himself could never trace. * But it is easy to see how the most fickle passions of the individual pass from the fancy to the judgement , and become general laws . Such are the depths of human wisdom ! Such are the foundations of the authorities we adore ! Mr. Dana belongs to a peculiar school of poets ; and to that school we belong not ; and hence we say that , in reviewing his poetry , we wish to speak with profound humility . In the departments of genius there is a kind of intellectual freemasonry , which none but the entered craftsmen can understand , and which we fully believe no literary Capt . Morgan will ever reveal . For example , will any apostate brother ever be buried at low water mark , for putting the secrets of the following lines into intelligible prose ? The light Shed in by God , shall open to thy sight Vast powers of being ; regions long untrod Shall stretch before thee filled with life and God ; And faculties come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonings . Whence they came Thou shalt not ask ; for they shall breathe an air From upper worlds , around , that shall declare Them sons of God , immortal ones ; and thou , Self-awed , in their mysterious presence bow ; And while thou listenest , with thy inward ear The ocean of eternity shalt hear Along its coming waves ; and thou shalt see Its spiritual waters , as they roll through thee . Factitious Life , p. 81 . The lines are not quoted for the purpose of vituperation ; we freely accord to them the praise of being as good as many of Byron 's and half of Coleridge 's . But they never can be relished by mankind , for they are spoken to the initiated few .

XVe begin with his faults as they strike us ; to point out which , for a reviewer , is both occupation and joy . First , then , we begin with a fault which lies on the surface . Mr. Dana 's poetry , as it strikes us , is like a great green water-melon , brought in from the gardens of Roxbury or Brookline , with a pumpkinvine twisted around it ; you must clear away the incumbrance , and cut through the cold hard skin , before you can find the red slices and black seeds , which make your very mouth water to see them .

Ou : author dislikes the school of Pope so much , that he avoids the structure of making the sense close with the couplet , with almost the same uniformity , that Pope 's imitators have copied it . Hence we have continually central closes and broken lines , which may be introduced , with advantage , for variety 's sake ; but , when constantly used , make the lines roll like truck-wheels over the pavements . Besides , there is some little affectation in this constant structure ; it is not only error but labored error . This repulsive harshness is a misfortune ; for a poet wishes to strike at once . He must reach the heart through the ear . Mr. Dana 's poetry is a garden , surrounded by a thorny fence , and there is no graveled walk or gate to enter it ; you must hazard some scratches to enjoy its shady walks and recondite streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has a right to say that his pupil " will be disappointed if he looks for entertainment without the expense of attention ; " but it would be hazardous for a poet to say this . His readers are willing to be put to very little expense . In short , the difference between poetry and the more lucrative walks of learning is like the difference , with which we pursue the more precious ores and a flower ; we are willing to go down into the mine for the one , in defiance of aH its damps and dangers ; but the other must bloom on the surface . Connected with this fault is another , not less embarrassing to the lackadaisical reader , who loves to run over the pages of a new poet , in a few hours , reclining on a sofa ; we allude to the very rapid manner in which the stream of the narrative generally flows . If the reader takes a nap or a nod in any of Mr. Dana 's tales , in prose or verse , it is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths , and have reached new scenes before you awake . He claims an agonizing attention from all his readers , for every moment of the time . He is certainly one of the worst authors to amplify and develop an idea that we have ever perused . This , perhaps , it will be said , is a part of his power . It is so . But it is rather provoking to be called to watch , with minute attention , the little links of his slender chain , as if you were studying Euclid ; and to find the whole thread of the story broken , because you have slumbered over half a line . It was not until the second perusal of the Buccaneer , that We discovered what the SpectreHorse had to do with the horrid visions of Matthew Lee ; nor should we have ever discovered that the Spanish lady , who was murdered , fled from Spain in the time of Wellington 's wars , by the following lines A sound is in the Pyrenees ! Whirling and dark , comes roaring down A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowl and crown . On field and vineyard , thick and red it stood . Spain 's streets and palaces are wet with blood . And wrath and terror shake the land ; The peaks shine clear in watchflre lights ; Soon comes the tread of that *tcut bandBold Arthur and his knights . Awake ye , Merlin ! Hear the shout from Spain ! The spell is broke ! Arthur is come again // So in the story of Tom Thornton , we have some important incidents despatched in a few words , which Richardson would have spread out over as many chapters . " The morning came and he thought of taking an eternal farewell , and the like . He lingered , and Mrs. Henley 's carriage drove by . There was a familiar nod , and a smile , and his resolutions were again gone with the wind . That night he played , and lost , and grew angry almost to madness . Then came a duel . He was wounded , and called a man of honor . " We must say that Mr. Dana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast for us . His speed is worse than that of the cars on the Liverpool rail-way . But his greatest fault arises from his always writing to his own ideal ; he seems to impute his own musings and meditations to all mankind ; and writes not only from his own genius but to his own taste . Shakspeare dipped his pen in the hearts of all the characters , which the world ever exhibited ; but Dana dips his pen always in his own ; and his mind moves not in unison with our whole species , but with a section of our race . It is the misfortune of a peculiar man that he is never conscious of his own idiosyncrasies ; but he thinks all mankind are , or ought to be , just like himself . Now , we can assure this author , that , in the octave of notes , through which his heart and imagination move , half of them , at least , the majority of men will not respond to ; and his semi-tones very few will understand . His mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystical ; fond of the deeper tones and terrible graces ; and loving the ideal images of its own creation with a rapture , in which the sons of labor and business can not and ought not to join . His imagination delights to prowl in wildernesses ; descend into tombs ; ride on the waves , when lashed into foam ; hear unearthly sounds , and see unearthly objects ; and to sup full of those banquets of horror , from which unexercised minds turn away in fear , or behold with a shuddering at least equal to the delight . For such scenes , and the deep dark passions that befit them , he has such a fond partiality that he copies them too much . He has but one model , and that not a very healthful one . Mr. Dana is not the man after Shakspeare 's own heart . It is remarkable of Shakspeare , that though he can rouse us with all the horrors of troubled description , yet he reserves these terrible graces for great occasions . Lady Macbeth walks in her sleep ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obdurate mind . But Dana 's characters are of that quickened sensibility that every joy is rapture ; every trouble , agony ; every house , a paradise ; and every cavern , a tomb . The morality which he teaches ,  --  the secret lesson which runs through every page of his verse and prose , is , that men ought to have a keener sensibility than what now belongs to common mortals . We doubt , however , whether peopling the world with these delicate souls , these men of feeling , would promote the substantial felicity of this world beneath the moon . Though there may be truth in what he has said , To flee from sorrow and alone to keep The eye on happiness leaves nothing deep E'en in our joys . To put aside in haste The cup of g ief , makes vapid to the taste The cup of pleasure . Think not , then , to spare Thyself all sorrow , yet in joy to share . Factitious Life , p. 71. // Yet there are so many evils in an over-cultivated imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious , whose profession and whose duty should alike prompt them to lead our sensibilities from fiction to truth , and from earth to heaven . His figures and descriptions , too , like the tenor of his tales , have the defect of being selected from too narrow a circle , and formed on one pattern . He is amazingly fond of the apostrophe ; indeed , this figure seems to be to Dana what personification is to Collins ; and both of them use the figure well , but they push it beyond all endurable bounds . For example , what poet but Collins would ever have thought of personifying Danger ( not Fear , a quality of the heart , but a remoter quality , which produces Fear ) as we find in the following lines ? Danger , whose limbs of giant mould , What mortal eye can fixed behold ? Who stalks his round , a hideous form ! Howling amidst the midnight storm , Or throws him on the ridgy steep Of some loose hanging rock to sleep . Though , by the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danger , have always to us seemed more suitable for Courage ; *nd what poet but Dana would think of apostrophizing the mooa when describing an outlaw in his moody hours of sadness and reflection ? Thou mild , sad mother-waning moon , Thy last , low , melancholy ray Shines towards him . Quit him not so soon ! Mother , in mercy , stay Despair and death are with him ; and canst thou , With that kind , earthward look , go leave him now. ? It was once our lot to enter a clergyman 's study , and pick up a loose paper of broken sentences , on which were written these wordsBeware of the sea ! and , on asking him what it could mean , he laughed heartily , and said- " I found myself too often going to the ocean for illustrations ; it had become a kind of chorus to my sermons : my hearers had remarked it ; and I put down this hint among others as a memento of the fault ; Beware of the sea ! ' " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown this paper into the study of our poet . Yet , after all , Dana has the soul of a poet ; and his verse and prose are both written with great power . He is an original ; and this , in an age of imitation , and when there are so many patterns that one can scarcely write without resembling some of them , is saying a great deal . Though he has a cast of thought somewhat like Coleridge and Wordsworth , he is not an imitator of either of them ; he has none of Wordsworth 's puerilities , nor is he so deep in the fogs of mystification as Coleridge ; he writes from a pattern , found in his own mind . He particularly excels in description . What can be more excellent than the description of a night-scene in Tom Thornton ? it is true poetry every word of it . He passed along the race-way . The water had left it ; and the grass was growing here and there in little clumps in its gravely bottom . Its planks and timbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the huge wheel , which had parted from its axle , lay broken and aslant the chasm . He looked towards the building . The moon , which was just rising behind it , and shining through its windows , made it appear like some monster with a thousand eyes . Its door-pat'h had grown // up , and nothing was heard but the wind passing through its empty length , and here and there the flapping of a window , lie went round it , and saw at a little distance , four or five long , low buildings standing , without order , upon little hillocks , without fence or tree , or any thing near them but short withered grass . The following , too , is very fine , though taken from our author 's favorite source , the sea And where the far-off sand-bars lift Their backs in long and narrow line , The breakers shout , and leap , and shift , And send the sparkling brine Into the air ; then rush to mimic strife Glad creatures of the sea , and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object which most poets could make nothing og is very graphic . We reached a shop . No lettered sign displayed The owner 's name , or told the world his trade . But on its door cracked , rusty hinges swung ; And there a hook or well worn horseshoe hung . The trough was dry ; the bellows gave no blast ; The hearth was cold ; no sparks flew red and fast . Poetry often obtains its power by bringing up some simple incident , which all can recognise , and which touches , with a flash , all hearts . Every one remembers the touching incident , which Thomson has brought up , in his affecting lines on Mrs. Stanley With tender art , to save a mother 's groan , No more thy bosom presses down its own . The incident in the last line , which all must recognize and none but Dana would have thought of : , perhaps , is equally pleasing . To pass the doors where I had welcomed been , And none but unknown voices hearwithin ; Strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then a nod for me Of the several poems , The Changes of Home pleases us best . It contains sentiments which must find an echo in every heart ; and has less of that strain of sentimental exaggeration , which , in the other pieces , prevails . Factitious Lfe , in our opimon , contains some false philosophy , though it shows that the author 's theories accord with his practice . The whole book will always be powerful and pleasing to congenial souls . As he speaks from peculiar feelings , and sings to a peculiar section of the human race , he must be content without general applause . He is a hierophant , who speaks , and means to speak , only to the initiated few.
