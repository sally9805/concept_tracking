txt WE noticed Dr. Bird 's romance of " Calavar " at the time of its appearance , at some length , and in terms of strong commendation. * Since then , we must needs take shame to ourselves for not having made our due contribution to his rising fame . He has been one of the most prolific of our writers , and we take him to he one of the most popular . " Calavar " has , we believe , gone to a third edition , while it has been followed hy at least four other puhlications of equal size and pretension , previous to that which is now before us . If we were to undertake to discuss the merits of " Robin Day " as a work of art , nobody probably would be more amused by our simplicity than the author . Its plot embraces love , delay , and trouble , misunderstanding , mystery , murder , and at last marriage ; and so far it is a novel . But the writer seems to have set himself about it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero into a succession of serious and at the same time ridiculous scrapes , each a little worse than the last , and then getting him out of them with as little violation of probability as the limited machinery he has allowed himself admits . There is a competent provision // of mutes and make-weights ; but the business of the piece is transacted by three characters , or rather by two characters and a hero . The scene , opening in New Jersey , is shifted through Pennsylvania , Maryland , Virginia , and Tennessee , to Florida , the Creek nation , the Gulf , and Cuba . " Mod6 me Trhebis , mod6 ponit Athenis . " But whithersoever the fated Robin Day betakes himself , to wild or city , camp or blue sea , there is already the haunting demon , Captain Brown , to help him into trouble , and the tutelary demon , Dickey Dare , to help him out of it . With such scant resources as the capacities of these two contraries afford , it can not be supposed that every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be brought about in such a manner as to seem to the reader entirely natural . But we must do the author the justice to say , that he has moved his few pieces admirably well . The reader sees , from the beginning , that he has undertaken to accompany a very unlucky person ; but the details of the plot are so well managed , that each new perplexity ( at least we can speak for ourselves ) takes him by surprise . They come in the proper time and place , but without casting their shadows before . This is a great charm of the work . Other things in it are excellently well done . The dialogue , with occasional exaggerations in parts designed to be particularly characteristic of the speakers , is on the whole sustained with ease , spirit , and effect . Here and there we find a strain of good-natured satire upon besetting follies of the country and time . As far as we know , the two characters , upon whom alone the writer seems to have bestowed any pains ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be considered another of his favorites ) are , in some respects , originals . We do not happen to remember , within the range of this department of writing , any other example of a bullying , tyrannical schoolboy , grown up into an adventurer , hot-headed , vain , " jealous in honor , " with intelligence enough for the common purposes of a soldier 's life , and with no pretensions to any more , like the militia-captain Dare ; nor of a scoundrel as unredeemed as any of Lord Byron 's worthies , but at the same time lighthearted , taking the world comfortably as he finds it , and ready to do a neighbour a service when nothing is to be got by robbing or murdering him , like the pirate-captain Brown . Some of the descriptions are full of life , and several scenes . // particularly towards the close , very effectively wrought up . And , what is extremely pleasant to observe , there appears none of that straining after something better than is to be easily had , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment . On the contrary , the writer seems everywhere conscious of possessing plenty of such materials as he wants , and bounds joyously through his work . Robin Day , who lives to tell his own story , is a human waif , who , after a shipwreck on the coast of New Jersey , falls to the share of Mother Moll , a distinguished matron of a neighbourhood of wreckers , he being then an infant about a year old . As soon as he attained to an age to be useful , he was sent out , in stormy nights , to regulate the performance of a decayed horse , who , with his legs tied together , was driven up and down a beach , that , for the benefit of mariners on a lee-shore , his stumbling motion might give to the lantern , hung to his side , the appearance of a light in ' a vessel in the offing . Such honest employments , together with the retribution which waited upon any remissness in them occasioned by fatigue , cold , or hunger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at seven years of age , he was glad to be first stolen , and then bought , from his adopted mother , by a hard character of the name of Day , whose name he consequently took . Day , otherwise called Duck , was the skipper and owner of a shallop , called the Jumping Jenny , a wrecker and smuggler , and how much worse , few people knew but himself . His ship 's company consisted , already , of himself and another ; and Robin , advanced to be their cook , to his great joy , ( for he had that notion of food , which is expressed in the proverb , " Omne ignotum pro magnifico , " ) found , before long , that he had no great reason to congratulate himself on the promotion . Five years did he endure all sorts of brutality , till he became , in mind and body , a sort of boy Orson ; " a wretched little stunted thing , to appearance not more than nine years old ; . a picture of raggedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more knowledge , intelligence , or spirit , than a ferryman 's horse , or a sick ape . " The account of the incident , which brought about his release from this thraldom , is a striking thing in its way . As he sat , one day , upon the bowsprit of the little craft , which lay at anchor , and in which he // had been left alone , to make preparation for his patron 's dinner , a party of youth , in a boat near by , with the amiable instinct of boyhood , employed themselves in pelting him with stones and oyster-shells . One of the missiles inflicted a severe wound , and , at the same time , the graceless urchin , who had launched it , lost his balance and fell into the water , which was deep , with a strong current running . " The hero of the scene , whose disaster I regarded with sentiments of complacency and approbation , as being nothing more than he deserved for the unprovoked injury he had done me , sunk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasping to the surface , and was swept by the tide against the sloop 's cable , which he attempted to seize , but without success ; for , though he had hold of it for an instant , he was not able to maintain his grasp . In this state of the adventure , the little fellow was immediately under me , where I sat on the bowsprit ; and as the tide swept him from the cable , he looked up to me with a countenance of such terror , and agony , and despair , mingled with imploring entreaty , - though being on the point of strangling , he was neither able to speak nor to cry out , - that I was suddenly struck with feelings of compassion . They were the first human emotions , I believe , that had entered my bosom for years . And such was the strength of them , that , before I knew what I was doing , I dropped into the river , - gander and all , this he had been busy picking , - to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feat did not appear to me either very difficult or dangerous , for I could swim like a duck , and had had extraordinary experience in the art of saving life in the water ; not , indeed , that I had ever performed such service for anybody but myself ; but , in my own case , I had almost daily occasion ; for nothing was more common than for Skipper Duck to take me by the nape of the neck and toss me overboard , even when on the open sea ; though the mate always threw me a rope to help me on board again , except when we were becalmed , or at anchor ; in which cases , he left me to take care of myself . In the present instance , however , as it proved , the exploit was not destined to be performed without difficulty for , dropping down with more hurry than forecast , right before the stem , and with a force that carried me pretty deep into the water , I was swept under the shallop 's bottom , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I managed to strike with my head , with a violence that would undoubtedly have finished me , had not that noble excrescence been , in those days , of unusual thickness . The shock was , however , sufficient to stun and // confound the small quantity of wits I possessed , and to such a degree that I lost my hold of the gander , which , up to this moment , I had clutched with instinctive care ; besides which , I was swept , before I had time to recover myself , along the whole of the sloop 's bottom ; and this being pretty well studded with barnacles , young oysters , and the heads of old nails , I had the satisfaction of enjoying as complete and thorough a keelbauling as was ever administered to any vagabond whatever , my jacket , shirt , and back being scratched all to pieces . Of this , however , as well as of the loss of the gander , I was for a time quite unconscious , being confused by the shock my head had suffered ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching the surface , I had all my thoughts engaged in rescuing the boy , who had now sunk two or three times , and was , I doubted not , sinking for the last time ; for he was quite insensible , when it was my good fortune to reach and seize him by the collar . " The batteau had , by this time , been borne by the tide against a projecting wharf , whither I easily swam with my charge ; and then giving him up to his companions , who had now , by dint of yelling , brought several men to their assistance , I took to my heels , hoping to regain the sloop before Captain 1 ) uck , who had gone ashore , should return and discover my absence . My only way of getting on board was that in which I had departed , namely , by s*vimnming ; and to this I betook me , by running a little up the stream , and then leaping again into the river . " My haste , however , was vain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when , having clambered up by the hawser and bobstay , I succeeded in jumping on deck , I , - who was in such a pickle , what with my clothes torn to shreds , and dripping with water , and the blood trickling down my face , as the reader can not conceive , - found myself confronted with my tyrant face to face . He gave me a horrible stare of surprise , took one step forward , so as to bring me within reach of his arm , and exclaimed , You draggle-tailed tadpole where have you been ? - which question he accompanied with a cuff on the right cheek that tossed me a full fathom to the larboard . Please , Sir , ' said I , in as much terror as my stupidity was capable of , - overboard , sir* Overboard , you son of a tinker 's cowbell ! cried my master , giving me a cuff with the other hand , that sent me just as far starboard ; what have you been doing overboard ? Please , Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , beginning to be conscious of the enormity of my offence . // Saving a boy 's life , blast my flshhooks ! ejaculated Skipper Duck , knocking me again to larboard ; and here J may as well observe , that this was his usual way of conversing with me , or rather of pointing his conversation ; his stops being usually but three , a cuff to the right and a cuff to the left , which he alternated with extreme regularity , at every other speech ; and a full period , used at the close , by which I was laid as flat as a flagstone . Saving a boy 's life ! cried the Skipper , boxing me as aforesaid : I wish all the boys were in Old Nick 's side-pocket , roasting !  - -  Where s the gander " The gander ? ay , where was the gander ? The question froze my blood . I remembered the loss ; by this time the gander was a mile down stream , if not already lodged , in divided morsels , in the capacious jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion , and his face of a sudden became small , being puckered by a universal frown , that began at forehead and chin and the two ears , and tended to the centre , carrying these several parts before it , till all were blended in a knot of wrinkles scarce bigger than his nose . He stretched forth his hand and took me by the hair , of which I had a mop half as big as my whole body ; and giving his arm a slow motion to and from him , like the crank-rod , or whatever they call it , of a locomotive , just as it is getting under way , and making my head , of course , follow in the same line of traverse , thundered in my ears , - The gander ! you twin-born ofa horse-mackerel ! where s the gander ? ' Please , Sir , ' I spluttered out , in a confusion of intellects that was with me extremely customary , - boy was overboard , - jumped overboard to save him - D - n the boy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , Sir , jumped overboard , ' I repeated ; got under the keel ; knocked head , - senses out , and - and - And the gander ? blast my fishhooks ! the gander Please , Sir ; could't help , - most drowned , - lost it ! ' " - Vol.i. pp. 25-29 . The chastisement , which he received for this mishap , was the last to which he was destined from the same quarter . The father of the child whom he had rescued , a worthy and opulent physician , receives him into his family , and undertakes to provide for , and , if possible , humanize him ; Captain Duck , meanwhile , having been subjected , by the intelligent indignation of the town 's people , to an infliction of keel-haul // ing , sbaving , tarring , feathering , and banishment , all in pursuance of a sentence of Lynch Law . Dr. Howard , Robin 's patron , places him at school , with the intention of introducing him honorably into life . All things might now seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which follows all men to the fleet , follows our hero from it , and be has a dismal story to tell , - though no worse , we suppose , than most others , who were brought up at the same time , - of the treatment he received at the hands of the ingenuous youth , his school-fellows . We have great compassion for brutes , and hold in high respect the principles of Mr. Martin 's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . But of all animals , we take the most pitiable , and the most worthy of the attention of the humane , to be the human animal at school in the fighting age ; say , from six to fourteen , or later . A friend of ours , who summed up the enjoyments of boyhood in the three particulars of being " washed , and whipped , and sent to school , " we think , omitted the chief pleasure of that interesting season . It is that of being whipped at school , and this not by the master , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon , - but successively by all the boys a little larger , or , worse , a little smaller than one 's self . if to be beaten black and blue , when one is not only entirely innocent of any intention of offence , hut has been most punctiliously careful not to give it , from a lively sense of the consequences , - if to be thus beaten , day after day , ( except at intervals , when a hollow peace may be bought by showing some two-fisted dunce his lessons , or promptly meeting his demands for toys and gingerbread , ) were a less evil than it really is , still " little things are great to little men , " and to them a drubbing , that does not amount to murder or mayhem , is felt to be a sore discomfort . Nor is that reality , when it comes , any worse , if so bad , as the bitter mortification endured in shrinking from the arbitrament of battle , when it is offered by another youngster , by pushing a chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of challenge in the circle where we bought our experience , - or by scratching a button , which was the method in that of Robin Day . With a profound sensibility , we commend the matter to the attention of some society of our philanthropic age . There is many an association , already making no small figure in its own reports , which would be // much more usefully employed , if it would transfer its attention to this abuse , from what it actually has in hand . The scheme would offer the great advantage of giving the confederates plenty to do , which some of them seem now chiefly perplexed to find . And , the more such a society should enlarge its list of juvenile members , the better ; a statement , which possibly does not hold equally true of all societies which enlist such support . Robin Day 's school-fellows were not only very pugnacious , but , as not uncommonly happens ( for there is no sublirnated philosopher like your dare-devil ) , very speculative withal , and ready to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soldier of the RevolLition , and leader of one of the parties in the school , - Rohin having fought himself , in due time , to the head of the other , - introduces to his mates , in a good stump harangue , the doctrine of school-boys ' rights , and illustrates it so happily by analogies drawn from the movements of 1776 , as to carry all before him . No sooner said than done . Mr. Burley , bear-keeper to these young hopefuls , having occasion , before long , to chastise their leader , finds , to his cost , that the revolutionary train has been but too well laid . I wo n't he trounced , ' said Dickey Dare , except by a vote of the boys ; for I goes on the popular principle , and - But Dickey had not time to finish his sentence ; for Burley immediately rushed forward to seize him , which Dickey was fain to avoid by leaping over his desk to the floor ; where , being closely followed , he let fly his inkstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of his schoolmates , without , however , hurting the master , and then dropping like a log on the floor , whereby the autocrat , whose legs he dexterously seized upon , was suddenly overturned , with a shock that left him for a moment quite helpless . Now , fellers - them that ai n't cowards , fall on ! cried the hero to his fellow conspirators ; who , having been somewhat horrified by the sudden rally of the enemy , now recovered courage , and rushed upon him pell-mell ; so that , when he recovered from the shock of his fall , not Gulhiver himself , waking from his first nap in Lilliput , was more multitudinously overrun by the bodies , or more hopelessly secured in the toils , of his pigmy foes . Bang away , ' roared General Dare , the patriot ; down goes all tyrants ! Freedom and equality for ever ! All them that s got sore bones , pay him up old scores . '             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
