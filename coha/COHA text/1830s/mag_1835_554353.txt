txt A BITTER satire upon the age and country . Robert Mat .. thews , an ordinary , illiterate creature , without natural talent , without attainments , without any extraordinary sagacity , or much low cunning , without fervid enthusiasm or even the show of it , without coura0e , without a prepossessing exterior , appears in the first city of the United States , three or four years ago , and announces himself to be the SUPREME BEING . No very great publicity is given to his pretensions , but there is no affectation of mystery or concealment about them ; and he finds persons who receive and reverence him , in the character which he thus impiously assumes . These his disciples are not exclusively the needy and dependant , flattered by a little worthless notoriety ; nor the stupidly ignorant , easily overwhelmed by a parade of scripture ar*umentation ; nor the mere fanatic , hovering on the verge of insanity , and easily driven over the line , which separates an overwrought imagination from a diseased understandin* , . His dupes are indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common education , of fortune , and of the most respectable standing in society . One of them , victim as well as dupe of the vulgar and impious knave , is thus described by Mr. Stone " Mr. Pierson was a native of Morristown in New Jersey . He passed through the several grades of apprentice and clerk , in the city of New York , much to the satisfaction of his employers , and was a highly respected merchant for many years , enjoying the confidence and esteem of a large circle of acquaintance among business men . Amiable , intelligent , and pious , he was the devoted friend of religion and humanity ; and few men spent more time and money in these objects , and in the cause of philanthropy , than he . He was originally a member of the Brick Presbyterian Church in Beekman-street , and subsequently an elder in the Mission Church in Bancker ( now Madison ) street . In 1SSS* , he detached himself from the Presbyterian connection , and became a member of the South Baptist Church , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deportment . // Indeed , he would have been an honor to any church , where meekness , charity , and an unostentatious devotion to the service of his Master were regarded as cardinal virtues . There was not a symptom of undue enthusiasm , - not a particle of fanaticism , - about him ; on the contrary , he was uniformly regarded as an unusually *judicious , discriminating , and consistent Christian , full of charity and good works ; and the same characteristics distinguished him in all the ordinary concerns of life . He was a favorite among Christians of all denominations ; and it may be said , without exaggeration , that no layman in New York , exerted a more salutary and holy influence . " Such was the character of Mr. Pierson , with whom the systematic impostures of Matthias may be said to have had their commencement , as they also had their calamitous close . Mrs. Pierson was , if possible , a person still less likely than her husband , to fall a prey to such an atrocious delusion . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York , " long known , " says Mr. Stone , " as the pious , benevolent , and , despite of his great age , zealous and active chaplain to the penitentiary , alrnshouse , and other public institutions . Mr. Pierson was her second husband ; - her first marriage had been unfortunate , and her second took place after an irreproachable widowhood of several years . She is thus described in the volume before us ; " In person , Miss Stanford was small , but graceful ; and her features , though not , strictly speaking , beautiful , were of a most intellectual cast , - full of expression , and eminently pleasing . Her mind was one of a high order , and it had been exceedingly well cultivated . Her conversation was remarkably interesting , not only from the intelligence , information , and good sense by which it was characterized , but also , and still more , from the pure spirit of benevolence and piety which it invariably displayed . The kindness of her disposition was indeed remarkable ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly four years , in the habit of seeing her almost every day ; and , during all that time , he can truly say , that he never heard her utter a single word , or knew her to do a single act , indicative of peevishness , envy , ill-humor , or any other unaniiable quality . She was mistress of several accomplishments , but that in which she most delighted was music . Of this she was a proficient ; and it may be mentioned , as an evidence of her fondness for it , that she had acquired great skill , not only on the piano and in singing , but also on the flute and flageolet . She had originally belonged to the // Episcopal church ; but , with her last husband , ultimately joined the Baptists . " Such is a brief sketch of the remarkable and unfortunate couple , whose names are closely interwoven with the residue of this history . United and happy in each other , - possessing an abundance of this world 's goods , - with every social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful , - the hands of both ever open to the calls of the needy , and the equally pressing demands of those whom they supposed to be hungering for the bread of life , - to all human probability they had a long career of usefulness , virtue and honor before them . Least of all could it have been anticipated , that their suns should set so soon , and go down , as they did , in gloom and sorrow . " Nothing but positive judicial evidence of the facts could have made us believe that individuals like these could have become the dupes of a fraud , as monstrous and abominable as that of Matthias . It ought in charity , and for the credit of human nature , to be stated , that they did not fall at once and without preparation into the pit . They were , it seems , members of a fanatical community , which had subsisted for five or six years , before the appearance of Matthias , and which appears to have been originally gathered and mainly upheld by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom the unenviable credit seems to belong of having been the original mover of these delusions . The meetings and exercises of thuis community , the members of which gathered themselves into what they profanely called a church , to the number of twelve , in the city of iNew York , though marked with the characters of arrogant fanaticism , runninb into various excesses , such as preposterous abstinence from food , and wild notions of supernatural communications , do not appear to have gone beyond the limits of absurdity and extravagance . There is , however , one scene described by Mr. Stone , dated from a period prior to the disastrous appearance of Matthias , which our readers may think in contradiction to this remark . It would have formed a high wrought chapter , in a work of fiction , and is all but incredible as a passage of real life , in the world around us . Mrs. Pierson became sick , and her husband , now wrought into a stmtte of mind ready for any extravagance , relying on time literal applicability of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 and 15 , assembled his church and solemnly performed // the ceremony of anointing the unhappy patient , in the confident expectation , although her life was despaired of hy the physician , of her miraculous recovery . The rest of the extraordinary narrative we must give in Mr. Stone 's words . " It is not known or believed by the friends of Mrs. Pierson that she altogether approved of this fanatical procedure , notwithstanding what it will soon be perceived her husband said upon the subject ; or , if she did , her mind and body had become so much debilitated by disease , that her own views at this time need scarcely be taken into the account . Either way , however , it is now of but little consequence . In a very few days after the anointing she was no more of this world , - her purified spirit having ascended to the bosom of her Saviour. # Preparations were made for the funeral , as usual , and a large number of special invitations were issued , Mr. Pierson himself declaring , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resurrection . Indeed , he seemed to be fully persuaded that she would that day be restored to life again by the prayer of faith . The universal respect which the deceased had enjoyed while living , as a lady of eminent piety and unbounded benevolence , would of course have produced a large attendance at her funeral , to say nothing of the peculiarity of the case . About two hundred persons attended , a majority of whom were females . There were also several clergymen of different denominations present . From the lips of one of these , the writer has noted down a full account of the whole of the solemn and awful procedure which followed , and by a physician who was also present he has likewise been favored with a written account . The latter remarks , - The hall and rooms being filled , I stood upon the piazza , which opened by a large raised window into the parlor where the corpse lay in a coffin , clad in grave-clothes . Soon after I took this position , where I could see and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons whether I believed that she would be raised . As I saw they were followers of Mr. Pierson , and addressed the same question to others who looked sceptical , I evaded a direct answer. * " Meantime Mr. Pierson was sitting in an adjoining room , open * In relation to the disoider of which Mrs. Pierson died , a medical gentleman . acquailite ( l with the whole proceedings at the l3owery Hill , remarks in a letter to the writer : - I always attributed Mrs Pierson 's sickness and death to her excessive fasting , being so frequently repeated and long continued . Indeed , it is very probable that Mr. Pierson Lirnself lost both health and reason from the same cause . I had frequent occasion to speak to patients whose health was so rapidly declining , in relation to the mischief of this delusion , and received for answer that they belonged to the Retrenchment Society and must fast . // ing into the parlor where the corpse was laid , with the utmost tranquillity and composure . One of his clerical friends sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be delayed , he at length suggested that they had better proceed , and inquired whether there was any particular oider of service which he wished to be observed . His reply was , - wait a minute ; ' and he sat with the same unmoved composure a time longer . Taking an open bible in his hand , lie then rose , and entered the room of the asseinbly , where the body lay , and a scene ensued which almost baffles description . He approached the coffin with a measured and solemn tread , and with deep solemnity , and a hollow sepulchral voice , read the following passage from the Epistle of James , v. 14 , 15 . " Is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil , in the name of the Lord . And the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and THE LORD SHALL RAISE HIM UP. * " Having read the passage , and looking round upon the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ' This dear woman has been anointed in the name of Israel 's God , and in obedience to this divine command ; and I believe that God will fulfil his promise . ' He then repeated the last six words of the quotation several times , emphasizing the word shall , ' with great force and feeling , and proceeded to argue that the whole passage was to be understood literally , which he affirmed to be its certain infallible meaning , as revealed to him and to that dear woman ( pointing to the corpse ) , and in this faith , he said , she died . He then related a remarkable revelation made to him in a carriage as he was coming out from the city a short time previous , and declared , that the same revelation was simultaneously made to his wife , then nigh unto death . He stated that the word of the Lord came to him and commanded him to have faith iii that promise , and in that faith to conform to the conditions , and the promise should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife anxious for his return , and she told him , without hearing anything from him touching the extraordinary communication from heaven which he had received on the way , that the Holy Ghost had directed her to instruct her husband in the faith of St. James 's tes* timony , and assured her that she should be raised . " Mr. Pierson farther proceeded to say , that finding that the moment she had received the revelation was the identical time when his manifestation was communicated , he felt it his duty , and so did that dear woman , ( again pointing to the corpse ) , to do as the Lord had commanded them . He accordingly collected together a number of pious friends who were in the faith , and they proceeded literally to anoint her body with oil , and pray over her , // 312 Oct. trusting in this promise , The Lord shalt raise him up . ' And though her physicians had told them that she must die , for the consumption had destroyed her lungs , they kiiew the Lord , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the dead ; and they had strong faith in His word , that if they anointed her , and prayed , the promise would be fulfilled , for the Lord shall raise him up . ' In that faith , he repeated , that dear woman died . And after exhorting all present to exercise similar faith , and affirming in the language of the Saviour , she is not dead but sleepeth , ' he commented on the wickedness of unbelief , and the sin of doubting the word of God . He then unequivocally declared , that whereas the elders of the church had anointed her with oil and prayed over her , if she were not raised up to-day , now , on the spot , the word of God falls to the ground . But , expressing his full confidence that the miracle would be performed , for the strengthening of the faith of His disciples , and that the mouths of gainsayers might be stopped , by her instant resurrection , he invited all present to unite with him in prayer . He then spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began a solemn and impressive prayer . The following sentences he repeatedly used with most impassioned feeling , and with very little variation of language . 0 Lord God of Israel ! thy own word declares that if the elders of the church anoint the sick and pray over him , the Lord shall raise him up . We have taken thee at thy word ; we have anointed her with oil , and prayed the prayer of faith , and thou knowest in this faith the dear woman died , and in this faith we thy children live . Now , Lord , we claim thy promise ! God is not man that he should lie , and if this dear woman is not raised up this day , thy word will fall to the ground ; thy promise is null and void ; and these gainsaying infidels will rejoice , and go away triumphing in their unbelief . Lord God ! thou canst not deny thyself . Thou knowest we have performed the conditions to the very letter . 0 Lord , now fulfil thy promise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies blaspheme , - show that thou hast Almighty power , - thou canst raise the dead , - we believe it , Lord . Come now , and make good thy word , and let this assembly see that there is a God in Israel ! ' Thus he continued to pray with a loud voice and great effort for nearly an hour , when he closed and sank down into a chair , apparently much exhausted but yet with the calmness and serenity of perfect and entire conviction . The manner and matter of the prayer had evidently a wonderful effect upon the audience . The attention of every one was riveted upon the preacher , and all eyes , save those of the afflicted and weeping relatives , were fixed upon the e*offin , as anxiously as though they themselves had yielded to the // delusion , and were expecting to see the lifeless body rise up in full health and vigor before them . in the course of the enthusiastic effusion , a number of ladies who were in the faith , and one of whom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood around the coffin , looking intently for the miracle , and occasionally touching the face and hands of the corpse , expecting to discover signs of returning life . This they continued to do , during the solemn pause which followed the prayer , and a drop of blood , oozing at the moment from one of the nostrils , inspired strong hopes that she would indeed be raised up ; and two of the ladies stepped up to one of the physicians present , and inquired whether that cir. - cumstance was not a token of returning life . Upon this point he himself says , I could suppress the emotions produced by this scene no longer , and after telling them it was an infallible evidence of death rather than life , and a token of incipient putrefaction , I followed them into the room and questioned the Rev. Mr. - , who stood by and saw and heard this solemn mockery , to address the people , and if possible to remove the erroneous impressions which would otherwise result from our afflicted brother 's delusion . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been paralyzing . A breathless silence prevailed . They looked at each other , and even the clergymen present seemed to know not what to say . The appeal to one of them , however , made by the physician , as just noted , was responded to in a very judicious and appropriate manner . He rose and remarked with emphasis , - Yes , this beloved and lamented Christian SHALL rise again , - AT THE RESURRECTION OF THE JUST ! for it is the promise of God , that all those who are Christ 's , he *ill bring with him at his corning . ' This remark was followed by a series of timely observations , which had the effect of tranquillizing the feelings of the audience . He proceeded to explain the passage in St. James , and rejoiced in the certainty of its fulfilment . The Lord will raise her up , but not to-day , nor to-morrow ; yet , dying in the Lord , she shall have part in the first resurrection , ' &amp;c . Several friends then united in requesting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a few of the disciples , who insisted that they must wait till 1* o'clock , ( it was a morning funeral , and had been appointed at 10 o'clock ) , when the miracle would certainly be performed . In the sequel , when they found it did not take place , the failure was ascribed , by Mrs. * * * , Mrs. - , and other votaries of Mr. Pierson , to the unbelief of some of the persons present , and they upbraided them upon the subject . " Mr. Pierson said nothing himself , but seemed to be lost in devout contemplation , and sat with perfect confidence , awaiting the moment when his prediction would be verified by the restoration of his wife . He was viewed by those not laboring under the de // lusion , as an afflicted brother , who was entitled to all their sympathies , in his melancholy bereavement , and his yet more melancholy state of mind ; it was at first apprehended that he might interpose objections to the interment of the body ; but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the church-yard in Amitystreet . Some of Mr. Pierson 's particular friends accompanied him back to his now desolate home , for the purpose of endeavoring to converse with him , and if possible , restore him to a sound state of thinking , - re-adjusting the balance of his mind . But all was in vain . He now believed as firmly that she would be raised at 1*2 o'clock at midnight , as he had done that she would arise at the close of the prayer at noon . Under this impression , he directed her sleeping apartment to be set in order , the bed made up , night-clothes prepared for her accommodation , and all the little affairs arranged , as for the reception of a bride . He also sent down to the city , and procured such delicacies as he supposed would gratify her taste . " On the following day , in conversations with his friends , who continued their attentions to his singular case , he still insisted that she would rise again : God , he said , had promised it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now believed her resurrection would take place at sun-rise on the following Sabbath morning ; and such was the strength of his faith , that he actually repaired to the grave early on that morning , taking his little daughter with him , to receive her embrace . And yet down to this period , upon every other subject than that of religion , and his religious duties , his mind was as regular , and apparently as sound , as it had ever been . In all business matters , moreover , he was as accurate and acute as ever. ** It is easy to perceive , that such an individual as Pierson here appears , was at the mercy of any one , who should take the trouble to delude him . Matthias had probably heard of the extravagances here described , and of the existence of the community , in which they were practised . He was accordingly received without scruple , when he presented himself among its members . Mr. Pierson had already received , while *n an omnibus , on the way to his place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Pierson to be Elijah the Tishbite and John the Baptist ; and Matthias with a shrewdness , of which we perceive few other examples in the narrative , recognised him in that character and as his own forerunner . Matthias , or Robert Matthews , for that , to use his own style , is his Gentile name , is a native of Washington county , New // York , about forty-five years of age , of respectable parentage . It is stated that several members of his family have exhibited marks of mental eccentricity , and some of them of insanity . He was left an orphan , at a tender age , and carefully educated by his friends , in the communion of anti-burehers . He came to New York , at the age of twenty , as a journeyman carpenter and joiner , and was a first rate workman . In a few years , he saved money enough to return into the country and establish himself in trade . He became a professing member of the church , and though deemed somewhat vain of his parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , his conduct was unexceptionable , and his standing in the community fair . He married suitably in 1813 , and continued in his business as a country trader till 1817 . He then failed and returned to New York , to resume his former handicraft . This he pursued with some unsteadiness , but without any thing in his conduct to be noticed . In 1827 or 1828 , he established himself in Albany , and sometime after this became , according to Mr. Stone , highly excited on religious subjects , by attendance on the preaching of two clergymen at Albany . He applied for admission as a member of a church formed by one of them , which appears to have been refused him , in consequence of a want of regular standing , in the church to which he belonged in Washington county . He exhibited thus far , no traces of a disorganized mind . He soon plunged with excessive zeal into the temperance reform , enjoining on his family abstinence not merely from intoxicating liquors , but from animal food . In 1829 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in exhorting his fellow-journeymen . As this conduct caused him to be discharged from his employment , he took to street-preaching , principally on the subject of temperance . Having made a convert of one of his fellow-workmen , they procured a large white flag , on which was inscribed , " rally round the standard of truth . " This they raised on a pole , and bore through the streets every morning , haranguing the multitude whom their strange appearance and demeanor attracted . His conduct , however , was not such as to cause him to be excluded from the public religious conventions , at which he occasionally appeared and took a reputable part . In // unheeded , he denounced the impending destruction of that city . Thus far he appears to have felt his way , with some caution . He now began to let his heard grow , and intruded himself into religious meetings , announcing himself as a divine teacher , commissioned to convert and rule the world . At this period occurred an incident , which , as it looks more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct , we are inclined to quote , as going farther than any thing else to give him the benefit of that plea : - " Like the Jewish prophet of evil to the city of Jerusalem , during the siege by Vespasian , Matthews continued his denunciations of wo against the city for several days , - frequently urging his wife to fly with him from the approaching destruction . Finally , about the middle of June , soon after midnight , he aroused his wife and her five children from their slumbers , and told them they must fly with him to the hills , as the city would be destroyed the next day . Not being able to persuade the former into his belieg he then declared his purpose of escaping himself with his children , leaving the mother to destruction . The eldest daughter , however , being of age sufficient to discover the wildness and absurdity of her father 's conduct , refused to accompany him ; the mother clung to the infant ; while the semi-lunatic or impostor took with him his three little boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years of age , - and departed in the dead of night . " The mother at first thought but little of the occurrence , having seen his vagaries so frequently of late , and presuming that by morning light they would all be safely at home again . But morning came , and the day passed , and they did not return . He seemed indeed to have left the city , nor could any trace of him be discovered . Her anxiety now became intense , as also was that of the citizens to whom she communicated the circumstances . An alarm was given , and the people turned out in great numbers to search for the wanderers . It was seriously apprehended that the father might have put them to death and destroyed himself . The unhappy mother 's distress increased with every succeeding hour ; the press sounded the alarm ; and the mayor issued a proclamation , announcing the facts , and offering a reward for the return of the children . " But a few days elapsed , however , before tidings were received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Argyle , Washington county . Matthews had a sister living in Argyle , a distance of forty miles from Albany ; and it subsequently appeared that the cruel parent had travelled the whole distance , regardless // of the tender years of his children , without stopping , - going the whole way on foot , - and arriving at the house of his sister shortly after midnight , and in twenty-four hours from the time of his departure from Albany . Under any other circumstances , the children would have sunk midway from fatigue ; but the terror in which they were kept by their father seemed to invest them with supernatural strength . " Arousing his sister and her family from their sleep , he greatly terrified them by his conduct . They had heard nothing of his strange proceedings ; and his incoherent ravings , coming thus suddenly upon them , and at such a gloomy hour , were appalling . He declared that he had fled with his children from Albany , which was to be destroyed on the day of his flight , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the sons and daughters of Lot , had refused to escape , were destroyed also . His sister admitted them with fear and trembling , not doubting that he was raving mad . Having partaken of some refreshments , notwithstanding his fatigue , and the still greater weariness of his children , - sinking from exhaustion , - he would not allow them to be taken to bed , or to leave his side , until after the performance of his evening devotions . He then pulled a Bible from his bosom , and after reading a chapter , and singing a hymn , in which his children were compelled to join , thus closed this first day of his wanderings as a prophet . " That a father not insane should compel three children , the oldest not over six and the youngest but two years of age , to travel forty miles , in twenty-four hours , is all but impossible . It resembles nothing we ever read of , but the barbarities of the savages in their incursions into the frontier settlements of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad hegira , it being Sunday , Matthias appeared in the village church , denouncing the impending destruction of all kingdoms , nations , and institutions not founded on the word of God . He was removed from the church as a disturber of the public worship , and sent back to Albany . Here he pursued the same course of extravagant conduct . He was frequently arrested and examined as a lunatic , but as often discharged . He sold his tools , and announced to his family , that they must live on faith , and the roots and herbs which they could obtain in the woods . It was at this time , that he assumed the name of 1*1atthias , and gave himself out as a Jew . And here we can not but remark , on the aptness of the parallel instituted between the impostures of Matthews and those of John of Leyden , in the // fifteenth century . Mr. Stone remarks that " the similarity of the cases is so remarkable , as almost to lead to the conclusion , although heretofore repudiated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creed designedly on the model of his ancient prototype . " Although our author here seems disposed to reject the idea of such a designed imitation , we do not consider it improbable . Matthews , though grossly ignorant , may , in some popular historical work , have seen an account of the Munster delusions , and the points of resemblance are certainly striking . There is one , which Mr. Stone has not noticed , superficial in itself , but very likely for that reason to catch the fancy of a sorry knave like Matthews ; - we mean the identity of name . The prime mover of the fanatical insurrection at Munster was Matthias , a baker of Leyden . As our IVlatthias had his Pierson and Folger , respectable citizens , his namesake of the sixteenth century made converts of Rothman , the first preacher of protestantism at Munster , and Knipperdoling , a burgess of good birth and considerable eminence . Having succeeded in driving out the magistracy , and erecting a kind of political bedlam of their own , Rothman and Knipperdoling were invested with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Sing Sing Mount Zion ; but , says Robertson , " this was nothing more than form ; for all their proceedings were directed by Matthias , who , in the style and with the authority of a prophet , uttered his commands , which it was instant death to disobey . " He commanded " every man to bring forth his gold , silver , and other precious effects , and lay them at his feet ; " he obliged his followers to eat at public tables , on a footing of equality , and prescribed the dishes , which were to be served up every day ; - he gave the name of Mount Zion to Munster . in one thing the comparison fails . Robert Matthews appears to be a poor spirited creature , and has invariably flinched in the hour of trial ; the Matthias of the sixteenth century had the bravery of true fanaticism , and marching out with thirty chosen men , of like temperament , attacked the army of the Bishop of Munster , and was killed . What the modern Matthias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the Anabaptists , and placed him at the head of an ignorant and maddened rabble , such as was to be found in a large European city , in the middle ages , it is impossible to say . Nor are we sure , that we do not do him injustice in calling his courage in question . The man who had the nerve , at the present day // and in the city of New York , to advance from one step to another , till he openly claimed to be the Supreme Being , - and to undertake to personate that character for a year or two , - before numerous witnesses , - in the face of the world ; - and yet not insane ; - if not entitled to the credit of moral courage ; must possess some new kind of mental energy . some diabolical sixth sense of hardihood , not merely equalling but far transcending the ordinary manifestations of bravery . The electric eel is but a poor mud-bred wriggler , unarmed with fang , claw , hoop horn , or trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have seen it stated , that even the respectable judicial tribunal , before which Matthews was arraigned , seemed , for a moment , non-plussed at the frantic vociferation , with which he denied their jurisdiction . The commencement of his itinerant career is related by Mr. Stone , in the following terms ; - " It was now that he assumed the name of Matthias , and gave out that he was a Jew . He then departed upon his mission for the conversion of the world , taking a western course , for the purpose of visiting his brother in Rochester , and everywhere attracting attention , from the length of his beard and the novelty of his behavior . This brother , as has already been remarked , was a rare mechanic , - inventive and curious . Before his death , he had obtained between thirty and forty patents for as many different mechanical discoveries . The itinerant preacher soon quarrelled with his brother , however , and his stay in Rochester was but for a fortnight ; and it was then , and from thence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While in the anti-masonic region of New York , he declaimed against free-masonry , as against what he considered other abominations of the land . Directing his face towards the setting sun , he traversed the Western States , through the deep forests , and over the prairies , until he had proclaimed his mission amid the wilds of the Arkansas . From thence he turned his steps to the south-east , - recrossed the Father of Rivers , traversed the States of Mississippi and Tennessee , and penetrated the Cherokee country , in Georgia , and commenced preaching to the Indians . Here he was seized by the authorities of Georgia , and imprisoned ; - but he was an overmatch for them . They knew not what to make of his conduct , nor what to do with him . His appearance was eccentric ; his kindling eye flashed with fury as he poured forth his maledictions upon them ; and they were at length constrained to unbar the prison-doors , and bid him depart . From thence he bent his footsteps to the North , and passing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He immediately visited the brother-in-law heretofore mentioned , and was at first very mild and agreeable in his manners and conversation , though of course forbidding in his aspect , since his temporal affairs did not then enable him to array himself in broadcloth and gold , and fine linen , and his beard presented a most unchristian appearance . On being asked why he had assumed such a disguise , - why he had abandoned his family , and conducted himself so strangely , he soon became greatly excited , grew furious , and uttered a shower of bitter cursesFoaming with rage , his eyes kindled with passion , and he denounced his relative as a devil with great violence , - declaring that he had burnt his fingers by coming into the devil 's house . He thereupon departed in a towering passion . " Little is known with certainty either of his proceedings or his tenets and pretensions at this period , He remained for some time in the city of New York , exhibiting himself frequently in various parts of the city , grotesquely but meanly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starved horse , - wandering from place to place , - preaching whenever he could find listeners , - and attracting little attention , except from the younger members of the population , who used to gather round him with wondering eyes , and an evident disposition to make themselves merry at his expense , which was kept within bounds by his fierce looks , and his apparent activity and strength of body . As yet his proceedings were seldom , if ever , mentioned in the public prints ; and although some curiosity existed respecting him , it was confined to a narrow circle of observers . " Mr. Stone gives a detailed , and a very interesting account of the rise and progress of a fanatical community in New York , previous to the appearance of Matthews , and forming an apt preparation for him . We have already alluded to this circumstance ; and for farther detail , we must refer to the work itself . Nor will our limits *illow us to recapitulate the gradual steps , by which he obtained a mastery over the small circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them to convey to him , " according to the forms of the Gentile law , " the title to a beautiful country seat at Mount Pleasant , on the North River , to which be gave the name of Mount Zion , and where he established " the Father 's House . " Here he collected his own children , one or two domestics of both colors , and these , with the families of Pierson and Folger , appeared to have formed his kingdom . A very curious narrative , drawn up by Mr. and Mrs. Folger , and containing such details as tbey deemed it cxpedient // to communicate , forms a part of Mr. Stone 's work . The facts set forth in it seem to be principally those , which appeared in evidence on the trial for the murder of Pierson . The newspapers have teemed with these and other details of a character still more monstrous and disgusting . Mr. Stone makes a strong appeal to the charity of the public to withhold their belief from these latter statements , and we are willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the force of that appeal unimpaired . The audacious career of Matthews was finally arrested by the death of Mr. Pierson , under very suspicious circumstances . The little community at Mount Zion was already beginning to grow weary of the intolerable and senseless seventies of Matthias . He was a perfect barbarian ; and if he had not lost his wits , had lost , if he ever possessed them , all the good feelings of the human heart . Privation of the comforts of life , hard labor , interminable vociferation which he called preaching , the cowskin , and fi*antic curses were the cheerless delights of his paradise . At last Mr. Pierson , who appears to have been afflicted with some kind of fits , became rapidly worse . The remorseless wretch allowed him to receive no medical assistance ; not even the ordinary aids of nursing and diet . If he fell from 1 ) is bed in his convulsions , he was allowed to lie on the floor ; and when the common sense of Mrs. Folger revolted against the ghastly fanaticism that ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a draught of cold water , the inhuman knave poured it down , from a height of four or five feet , into his throat , as he lay gasping . " This operation , " says Mrs. Folger , " caused a shocking noise or gurgling in the throat , which she could not remain to hear . " The rest we give in Mrs. Folger 's words . " When she returned , this noise had ceased , and Matthias had ceased to give him drink . Mr. Pierson had fits now in rapid succession , and the peculiar noise he made could be heard in everpart of the house . The colored woman inquired if she should remain with Mr. Pierson , but Matthias said , no , and directed her to go to bed , and retired himself . Mrs. Folger and the colored woman sat up with him , however , until 12 o'clock , when Mrs. Folger laid herself down , only to rest , feeling that her health required it ; but she did not sleep , - constantly hearing Mr. Pierson until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Pierson ceased , she heard Matthias go to his room . // Following thither herself , she met him coming from it . The moment Matthias saw Mrs. Folger , he said Mr. Pierson was dead . Mrs. Folger was struck with surprise ) and asked him how he felt , or what he thought , - she does not know which ; - he replied , do n't ask me now , and retired to his room . " Matthews was indicted for murdering Mr. Pierson , and the case seems to have turned on the decision of the question , whether he was poisoned . The testimony of Dr. Condict , given after a post mortem examination , was pretty strong in the affirmative ; - but a chemical examination disclosed no poisonous substance in the contents of the stomach . We have no doubt that , on this evidence , he was rightly acquitted , although we are strongly inclined to the opinion , that arsenic was administered by Matthews to Pierson . It seems to us a stronger case could have been made out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mode in which , by pouring water from the height of four or five feet into the mouth of a dying man , his death was evidently hastened by suffocation . Matthews was acquitted on the capital charge ; but sentenced to three months ' imprisonment for scourging his daughter , and one for contempt of court . Among the highly curious materials of this work are copious extracts from the diary and private papers of Mr. Pierson . They disclose plainly enough the melancholy secret of his own easy infatuation . At the bottom of all the ascetic humility of enthusiasts of this stamp lies a fund of egregious vanity and righteous self-conceit . One of the earliest entries in his diary is to this effect . " Monday , 3d Jan. 1830 . Lord Jesus , thou has committed to my care great and precious talents , some of which I see , and others I may not perceive . 0 , Lord , I wish to improve to the utmost all those talents thou hast given me . I would not bury one of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Jesus , I do humbly entreat thee to unfold to me in a clear manner these various talents . Show me their excellency , their value , and how to improve them in the best manner . Leave me not in ignorance concerning any one , nor suffer me to neglect or misimprove any one . " 0 , Lord Jesus ! help me , for I need help in these things . Lord , make thy grace sufficient for me , that I may improve thy gifts ; and so that having , more may be given me . " Answer . I will undertake for thee ; thou seekest to glorify // me , and I will help thee : thou shalt prosper abundantly ; and to him that hath , more shall be given . " Mr. Stone considers this passage as clear proof of decided monomanw . Charity would gladly admit the explanation . Insane he may well be called , who , weak and stupid enough to mistake a miserable strolling driveller , as the Maker of heaven and of earth , - as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lands and goods , - talks about his " great and precious talents . " But let as spare this unhappy victim of a delusion , to which he paid the forfeit of his life , amidst the torments of neglected suffering . We must pardon even the arrogance , which could accept , from the miserable hands of Matthews , the prophetic commission of John the Baptist , when we see him , by a severe retribution , handed over to that merciless impostor in his dying hours ; - deprived of decent atthndance ; - of the comforts of a kindly tended dying bed ; - left to writhe in his agonies on the floor , within the sight and hearing of the monster , who had probably hastened his end by still more active and diabolical appliances ; and who mocked even his thirst for a cup of water . We must refer to Mr. Stone 's work for several highly judicious remarks , on the faults of character in the individuals most nearly concerned , which favored the growth of these delusions , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they escape the like condemnation , are of scarcely less flagrant enormity . He deserves the thanks of the community for the pains which he has taken , to present an intelligible and instructive account of this extraordinary imposture ; particularly in laying it , in a readable form , before all classes of the community . It furnishes much matter for deep and anxious reflection . No one can perceive , without acute distress of mind , the living proog confirmed by evidence in a court of justice , and of undoubted notoriety , that the fence which separates sanity and insanity is so slight and so easily broken down . Had any rational man , six years ago , been asked his opinion , whether it were possible , that a creature like Matthias , ( or any other creature , not possessed of faculties more or less than human ) , could appear in our streets , our churches , our houses ,  --  arrayed in a tawdry and nonsensical parade of fine dress , - a green frock-coat with plaid silk lining , - and announcing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visions , and frantic curses , as the Supreme Being , the answer would have been , that it was impossible , unless under circumstances , carrying with them proof positive of insanity . But such a phantom has appeared , and often as his insanity has been alleged and examined , it has been disproved . But if , supposing his appearance had been granted possible , the further question had been asked , would he find any persons weak , deluded , lost enough to believe on him , the answer would have been an indignant negative . But they are found : - the intelligent merchant , - the shrewd man of business , the pious church officer , the exemplary father of a family , the affectionate and irreproachable wife ; - these are his victims ; and when we say they were insane , it is merely because nothing but insanity accounts for the hideous delusion . They did not believe , because they were insane ; - but we say they were insane , because they believed . If men who keep about their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give no other proof of an impaired intellect , can fall into the belief of so revolting , so amazing a fraud and lie , who is safe ? What lesser fraud and imposition may not be proposed , with the certainty of finding ready acceptance ; - and who can have the heart to undertake the propagation of truth and the exposure of error , with such woful demonstration of the imbecility of the human mind ? This , however , is happily not the view of the subject in which we feel obliged to rest . It is too true , that history gives us abundant proof , that there have , in all ages and countries , been more persons than , but for such proof , could have been believed , who are prepared to fall easy victims , to any and every imposture . We rather think the more absurd it is , the readier access it finds to weak intellects . They are dazzled with the very magnificence of the pretension. if Matthews had come along , pretending merely to be a wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the imaginations of any class of the community , and would have continued , as he began , a ragged , sordid cheat . But the audacious loftiness of his claims was calculated , at once , either to revolt or stupify . The mass who heard of him , no doubt set him down , without ceremony , as a madman ; but of those who did not so regard him , while the greater part considered him as a blasphemous imposter , some few of weak intellects , - ( on which the seed of delusion might fall , as on a soil prepared by being long and deeply // harrowed and wrought over , till fanatical credulity was'ground into their very souls , ) would be caught and overborne , by the very monstrosity of the imposition . But with all the imbecility of the human judgment , the aptitude to be deceived , the relish for high-seasoned and stimulating impostures , - the pas4on for being not merely deluded , but mocked , insulted , outraged by the hideous enormity of the fraud ; - with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His kingdom , we believe , did not exceed a baker 's dozen of all ages , sexes , and colors . He took the first step and with success ; but contrary to the maxim , the first step did not cost . A rich harvest of fanaticism had been sown and had sprung up . It was*already ripe , yellow , full-eared , thick-kernelled , nodding to the sickle . He found no difficulty in enlisting his Rothman and his Knipperdoling . His John the Baptist was ready trained to his band . His town-house and his country-house , his carriage and his wardrobe , - and a well-stored purse , - these he bad for the asking . But beyond the narrow circle of his firrt dupes , the delusion did not spread . The common sense of the community erected a wall around him , which he could not pass . His fanaticism seemed destitute of the quality , which makes fanaticism dangerous ; it was not contagious . This was owing , no doubt , in some degree , to the extreme poverty of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as were thrown into his hand ; an establishment ; a fortune ; a matured jargon ; the nucleus of a community ; - his pretensions admitted , by some decent and intelligent persons ; - the ice broken ; the frightful and heaven-defying boldness of his pretensions worn off by familiarity ; the first shock met and borne by the public ; it is fearful to think what he might have accomplished , with some discretion and skill . Had he made his Mount Zion the abode of purity and of benevolence ; of an attractive and inoffensive pageantry ,  --  had his asceticisnr been as humane , as it was merciless ; - had he imitated the good husbandry of the Shakers , or rested in the irreproachable austerities of self-denying enthusiasts of ancient or modern times , he might have founded a sect ; - and had he lived in barbarous ages , and added to his other qualities , a military fanaticism , he might have played the part of the prophet of Mecca . But " Who can be wise , amazed , temperate , and furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Matthews 's head was turned by being able to wear laced ruffles at his wrist and ride in Mr. Folger 's carriage . His kingdom had come , because he had bread and butter for his children , and the undisputed authority to rave , from morning till night , at a half a dozen moon-struck men and women , in disjointed texts of Scripture and fanatical maledictions . He would not have had the audacity to project the imposture , but in the absence of the judgment and common sense necessary to carry it on . As the moral of the whole book , we would deduce the importance of fortifying that bulwark against delusion , which consists in the intelligence of the people It will not be practicable , perbaps , by the most diffusive system of education , entirely to obviate the possibility of renewed attempts like this ; but they never can gain head , in a well informed community . Here and there , a bold and unprincipled impostor will arise , and find dupes even among those seemingly too enlightened to become his victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed public . In order to any considerable success among intelligent men , in any plan of fanaticism , there must be a considerable mixture of social thrift , nay of redeeming virtue . We have alluded to the Shakers . Anne Lee was no better than Matthews ; but her disciples , at the present day , have settled down into a score of communities of hard-working husbandmen , who plague themselves with their austerities , do no hurt to the community , and have been driven from the blasphemous pretensions of their founder , by the mere force of deference to the good sense of the age . Such probably will be the fate of the Mormonites , who ( as the patriotic clergy before the revolution use to phrase it , in their prayers for the British ministry , ) will no doubt " be brought to reason or to ruin . " The fanatical excesses of their leaders will prosper in proportion to the ignorance and barbarity of the secluded corners of the frontier settlements , where they may fix their abode , and will be modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks in upon their uncouth and heathenish midnight.
