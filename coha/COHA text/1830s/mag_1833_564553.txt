txt This work is an attempt to improve the character of teachers , by giving them more correct views of the character of children , by inspiring them with an interest and a love for those under their charge , and by leading them to feel more deeply the responsibility of their situation . It is an attempt to prove that it is more easy to govern and instruct by means of religion , reason , and love , than by authority and force . In all the author 's remarks there appears a great love of purity and truth , and a kindness and generosity of disposition . There is no apparent wish to use religion , because he might abuse its sacred sanctions , to frighten the disobedient , and make the task of teaching more easy ; but , on the other hand , a desire to make scholars and teachers religious beings , because it is their duty to be so . There is no spiritual pride , because he has accomplished what few teachers have attempted ; and no conceited desire to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be found to be true . His instructions to teachers are full of sound judgement . He is enthusiastic , but not d*stitute of caution . He has not advanced crude ideas , with the notion that he has discovered a new plan , by which he is about to convert the world ; but he freely allows that his plans may not be the best-only that he has found them successful , and he recommends them to be adopted or copied by other teachers . Indiscriminate praise , however , is of little value . Let those who have not had an opportunity to read Mr. Abbott 's volume , judre of its value from the analysis and extracts which follow . The first chapter is devoted to a consideration of the means to be used to excite the teacher 's interest in his occupation . rI*he second chapter , to a consideration of the general arrangements of a school . Instruction is the subject of the third . In this he says " There are three kinds of knowledge , the means by which all other knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child who is studying geography , or history , or natural science , is learning facts ; he who is learning to read write , and calculate , is acquiring skill , by which his knowledge may be indefiniteiy increased . To teach these three kinds of knowledge , then , is the great object of the teacher of a common school . It may he questioned whether all other studies should not be excluded ; certainly , that teacher is unjust , who takes a greater interest in teaching a few scholars the higher branches of education , than in teaching a whole population these fundamental subjects . " * * * * * * * * " Never get out of patience with dullness ; perhaps I ought to say , never get out of patience with any thing . But , above all things , remember that dullness and stupidity ,  --  and you will find them in every school-are the . very last things to get out of patience with . if the Creator has so formed the mind of a boy , that he must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which others do not feel , and depressed by discouragements which others never know ,  --  his lot is surely hard enough , without having you to // Literary Notices . add to it the trials and suffering , which sarcasm and reproach from you can heap upon him . Look over your school-room , therefore , and wherever you find one , whom you perceive the Creator to have endued with less intellectual power than others , fix your eye upon him , with an expression of kindness and sympathy . Such a boy will have sufferin , , enough from the selfish tyranny of his companions ; he ought to find in you a protector and a friend . One of the greatest pleasures which a teacher 's life affords , is the interest of seeking out such an one , bowed down with burdens of depression and discouragement ,  --  unaccustomed to sympathy and kindness , and expecting nothing for the future , but a weary continuation of the cheerless toils , which have embittered the past ; and the pleasure of taking off the burden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering looks , and of seeing in his countenance the expression of ease , and even of happiness , gradually returning . " " The teacher should be interested in all his scholars , and aim equally to secure the progress of all . Let there be no neglected ones in the school-room . We should always remember that , however unpleasant in countenance and manners that bashful boy , in the corner , may be , or however repulsive in appearance , or unhappy in disposition , that girl , seeming to he interested in nobody , and nobody appearing interested in her ,  --  they still have , each of them , a mother , who loves her own child , and takes a deep and constant interest in its history . " " Do not hope or attempt to make all your pupils alike . Let it be the teacher 's aim to co-operate with , not vainly attempt to thwart the designs of Providence . " " Assume no false appearances , in your school , either as to knowledge or character . All efforts to conceal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as unwise as they are dishonest . The fact , that the teacher does not know every thing , can not long be concealed , if he tries to conceal it ; and in this , as in every other case , honesty is the best policy . " Chapter IV . is upon " Moral Disciplin&amp; ' " Be careful when you first see your pupils , that you meet them with a smile . I do not mean a pretended cordiality , which has no existence in the heart , but think of the relation , which you are to sustain to them , and of the very interesting circumstances , under which , for some months at least , your destinies are to be united to theirs , until you can not help feeling a strong interest in them . Shut your eyes , for a day or two , to their faults , if possible , and take an interest in all their pleasures and pursuits , that the first attitude , in which you exhibit yourself before them , may he one which shall allure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done , as a preparation for reforming individual character , in school , is , to secure the personal attachment of the individuals to be reformed . This must not be attempted by professions and affected susiles ; and still less by that sort of obsequiousness , common in such cases , which produces no effect , but to make the bad hoy suppose that his teacher is afraid of him ; which , by the way , is , in fact , in such cases , usually true . Approach the pupil in a bold and manly , but frank and pleasant manner . Approach him as his superior , but still as his friend ; desirous to make him happy-not merely to obtain his good will . And the best way to secure these appearances is , just to secure the relity . Actually be the boy 's friend . Really desire to make him happy ; - happy too in his own way , not in yours . " " in endeavoring to correct the faults of your pupils , do not , as many teachers do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may happen to come under your notice . These are few , compared with the whole number of faults , against which you ought to exert an influence . The observing and punishing such cases , is a small part of your duty . " To illustrate the value of this precept , he gives a very interesting relation of the manner in which a teacher , who accidentally heard a boy use profane language , in a great measure cured his whole school of the vice of profaueuess. 114-116 . In the same chapter , after having shown the means to be used , in order to make boys fond of system and regularity , he says " Perhaps some experienced teacher , who knows , from his own repeated difficulties with bad boys , what sort of spirits the teacher of district schools has // 433 sometimes to deal with , may ask , as he reads this , Do you expect that such a method as this will succeed in keeping your school in order ? Why , there are boys , in almost every school , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way , than you would persuade the north-west wind to change its course , by reasoning . " I know there are ; ( says Mr. A. ) all I should expect or hope for , by such measures as these , is , to interest e d gain over to our side the maJority . " " There should be a great difference made between the measures you take to prevent wrong , and the feelings of displeasure against wrong when it is done . The former should be strict , authoritative , unbending ; the latter should be mild and gentle . * * * It is the morose look , the harsh expression , the tone of irritation and fretfulness , which is so unpopular in school . The sins of childhood are , by nine-tenths of mankind , enormously overrated ; and perhaps none overrate them more extravagantly than teachers . " " Lead your pupils to see that they must share with you the credit or the disgrace , hich success or failure may bring . * * * Repeat , with judicious caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and against it , and thus endeavor to interest the scholars in its public reputation . * * * If the scholars are led to understand that the school is , to a great extent , their institution ,  --  that they must assist to sustain its character , and that they share the honor , if any honor is acquired ,  --  a feeling will prevail in the school , which may be turned to a most useful account . " " Feel that , in the management of the school , you are under obligation , as well as the scholars ; and let this feeling appear in all that you do . * * * It will assist very much , too , in securing cheerful , good-humored obedience to the regu* lations of the school , if you extend their authority over yourself . " In cases of difficult management , Mr. Abbott advises teachers to go . directly and frankly to the individual , who causes the difficulty , and come at once to a full understandinn with him , as to what his intentions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of ten , this course will he effectual. * * * To make it successful , however , it must be done properly . * * * It must be deliberate , generally better after a little delay . It must he indulgent , so far as the view , which the teacher takes of the guilt of the pupil , is concerned. ; every pahliating consideration roust he felt . It must he firm and decided , in regard to the necessity of a change , and the determination of the teacher to effect it . It must also be open and frank ; no insinuations , no hints , no surmises ; but plain , honest , open dealing . In many cases , the communication may be made most delicately and most successfully , in writing . The more delicately you touch the feelings of your pupils , the more tender these feelings will become . Many a teacher stupifies and hardens the moral sense of his pupils by the harsh and rough exposures , to which he drags the private feelings of the heart . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his school-room , that to address even the gentlest reproof to any individual , in the hearing of the next , would be a most severe punishment ; and , on the other hand , he may so destroy that sensitiveness , that his vociferated reproaches will be as unheeded as the idle wind . ' Chapter V. is upon " Religious Influence . " The subject is introduced by a consideration of the right , which a man has to disseminate his peculiar opinions ; because many teachers have failed to satisfy their employers , and have been the cause of much unhappiness to themselves and others , by attempting to teach sectarian opinions , instead of " reading , writing , and calculation . " " lie is employed for a specific purpose , and he has no right to wander from that purpose , except as far as he can go , with the common consent of his employers . " Mr. Abbott then goes on to consider whether a teacher can do good by religious influence without introducing the peculiar doctrines of any sect of Christians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onreligious subjects , in this country , is very broad , " and that if teachers // do universally confine themselves to the limits , which he defines , they may accomplish within them a " vast amount of good . " Religion , he says , is not *o be appealed to in order to make it assist in the government of the school ; it is not to be brought before the mind of a disobedient pupil , " in a vain effort , to make an impression upon the conscience of one , who has done wrong , and who can not , by other means , be brought to submission . The pupil , in such cases , understands that the teacher appeals to religious truth , only to eke out his own authority , and , of course , it produces no effect . " " Many teachers make great mistakes in this respect . A bad boy , who has done something openly and directly subversive of the good order of the school , or the rights of his companions , is called before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wield against him is the Bible . So while the*trembling culprit stands before him , he administers to him a reproof , which consists of an almost ludicrous mixture of scolding , entreaty , religious instruction , and threatening of punishment . But such an occasion as this is no time to touch a bad boy 's heart . He is steeled , at such a moment , against any thing but mortification . " " Finally ( says he , at the conclusion of this chajter ) let me insert as the keystone of all I have been saying in this chapter , he sincere and ardent , and consist ent in your own piety . Be constantly watchful and careful , not only to maintain intimate communion with God , and to renew it daily in your seasons of retirement , but guard your conduct . Let piety control and regulate it . Show your pupils that it makes you amiable , patient , forbearing , benevolent in little things , as well as in great things , and your example will co-operate with your instructions , and allure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Chapter VI . contains a description of the Mount Vernon School . Of the plan of its government and instruction , he says , that he has no idea that it is superior to those adopted in many other schools . In his management there seems to have been no government ; the scholars and teachers appear to have lived in that happy and enviable state , in which , as in Israel of old , when there was no king , every one did what was right in his own eyes . In the general arrangements of his school , there was much that was peculiar ,  --  much that could not be introduced into the common district schools of the country ; still , every teacher may derive advantage from a perusal of that part of the chapter , which relates to this subject . The most important peculiarity of Mr. Abbott 's school is the means of religious instruction ; and yet they were so simple , and would so naturally be suggested to the mind of any teacher , who wished his scholars to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God , that , they need not be more particularly noticed . The next , and last chapter , is occupied by remarks and cautions upon the new schemes , and new books , which teachers are continually publishing at the present day . If his remarks were read , many a disappointed teacher would perceive why it is that his hopes have been blasted ; and were his cautions regarded , many more would be saved the mortification and misfortunes to which the publishers of new school-books are exposed . Such is Mr. Abbott 's " Teacher ; "  --  a book to which too much praise can scarcely be given . Were its precepts followed by all , and its spirit imbibed by all , who take upon themselves the highly responsible office of a public teacher , there could scarcely be a happier place than a school-room . Instead of the fretfulness , and vexation , and tears , so often to be seen there , happy and contented faces would // appear on all sides ; children would dread to become men , and men would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teachers alone ; the narratives , by which his precepts are illustrated , give the volume an interest on their account ; and every one , who wishes well to the improvement of our common schools , will rejoice to see that the young may be educated by religion , reason , and love.
