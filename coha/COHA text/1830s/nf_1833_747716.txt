txt /q/ o'clock , why an attachment should not issue against him for a contempt of this court in publishing the said false statement , tending to bring odium on the court , and to impair the confidence of the public in the purity of its decisions . " In obedience to this rule , Mr. Foreman appeared , and by your petitioner , who acted as his counsel , showed against the rule , and urged that , First . He , Judge Peck , had no jurisdiction of the matter as a contempt of court . Secondly . That the article , in point of merits , was a correct statement of the positions and doctrines therein attributed to the Judge . Thirdly . That the language and tone of the article signed " A Citizen , " were perfectly decorous . Your petitioner further showeth , that , in the argument and observations which he felt it his duty to submit , as counsel for the editor , he endeavored to demonstrate the truth of the article by a comparison of it with the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unequivocal manner , any contemptuous intention or feeling towards said Judge Peck , either in his judicial or his private character . Your petitioner showeth , that the arguments and authorities submitted on behalf of the editor , produced no effect on the opinion of Judge Peck , as to the character of the article signed " A Citizen , " which he persisted in considering as a contempt of court , and punishable as such . That your petitioner , being desirous of protecting the editor from the consequences /q/ of the actual issuing of an attachment against him , and being convinced , from the very virulent language and manner of the said Judge towards your petitioner , that his main object was to get hold of him as the author of the " Citizen , " your petitioner consented that the editor should give up his name as author of that article . That the editor having accordingly declared that your petitioner was the author , the conditional rule against him was discharged , and the following rule made by said Judge , and served on your petitioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stephen W. Foreman , made in open court , that Luke E. Lawless , an attorney and counsellor of this court , is the author of a certain publication over the signature of ' A Citizen , ' in a public paper , printed in this city , by the name of the ' Missouri Advocate and St. Louis Enquirer , ' issued on the 8th of April , of this instant , it is ordered , that the said Luke E. Lawless show cause forthwith , why an attachment should not be issued against him for the false and malicious statements in the said publication contained , in relation to a judicial decision of this court in the case of Julia Soulard , widow , James G. Soulard , Henry G. Soulard , Eliza Soulard , and Benjamin A. Soulard , children and heirs of Antoine Soulard , deceased , against the United States , lately pending and determined therein , with intent to impair the public confidence in the upright intentions of the said court , and to bring odium upon the court , and especially with intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this court , that they are not to expect justice in the causes now pending therein , and with intent further to awaken hostile and angry feelings on the part of the said litigants against the said court ; and that he also show cause why he should not be suspended from practising in this court as an attorney and counsellor therein , for the said contempt and evil intent . " In obedience to this rule , your petitioner appeared , and , inasmuch as the Judge forbade any further discussion of the truth or merits of the article signed " A Citizen , " instructed his counsel to oppose the rule on the following grounds , to wit : 1st . That , supposing the matter of the article to be false and malicious , the Judge had no jurisdiction or legal power to punish the author of it in a summary way as for a contempt . 2d . That , supposing the matter to be within the jurisdiction of the Judge as a contempt , suspension from practice as an attorney , and still less aa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not such a punishment as could be legally inflicted . Your petitioner showeth , that these two objections were disregarded by said Judge , and the rule for the attachment made absolute against your petitioner . Your petitioner further showeth , that said Judge Peck , upon making the above rule absolute , thought proper to pronounce a long speech in justification of his proceedings , in the course of which , he indulged in the most coarse and violent abuse of your petitioner , to whom , in all the various forms of language which he seemed capable of using , the said Judge imputed the crimes of falsehood , slander , calumny , and malice , and based said foul accusations exclusively upon the matter contained in the article signed " A Citizen , "  --  in this way making his speech a mere amplification of the abuse and scurrility contained in the rule above set forth . That your petitioner , having listened for some time with astonishment and indignation to this malignant and most unjust attack upon his conduct and character , left the court , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , however honorable and natural , it was matter of prudence to repress . That , so fraught was the language and manner of the said Judge with personal insult , that your petitioner became convinced that the object in view was , to/ irritate your petitioner into some expression or act , in the presence of the court , which would have constituted a new and legitimate contempt , and , in that way , /z/ to enable him , the Judge , to exercise his vengeance within the legal limits of his jurisdiction . Your petitioner further showeth , that , whilst Judge Peck poured forth this torrent of abuse and invective , the court was crowded with people , among whom were several of the most respectable inhabitants of St. Louis . That , by those persons , your petitioner has been informed , that , after your petitioner had retired from the court , the aforesaid Judge Peck continued for a considerable length of time to hold forth in the same insulting and acrimonious manner , and appeared to treat the subject before him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits of it , as to vent his personal rage and malice on your petitioner , without alleging or insinuating that any other cause existed , or could be shown for such abuse , than the article in question . That your petitioner , at the moment he was taken by the Deputy Marshal under the attachment , was occupied in the Circuit Court of the county of St. Louis , as counsel in a cause of very great importance to his client , and which your petitioner was compelled , at great risk to his client 's interest , to abandon . That your petitioner , when brought into the United States ' District Court on the attachment , was asked by said Judge , 1st . Whether your petitioner wished that interrogatories should be filed ? 2d . Whether he would answer interrogatories if tiled ? 3d . Whether he would purge himself of the contempt alleged against him in the rule . That your petitioner , to these questions , replied as follows : 1st . That he did not require interrogatories to be filed . 2d . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer them . 3d . That , as he had committed no contempt , he could purge himself of none . That said Judge thereupon declared , that the refusal to answer any interrogatories that might be filed , was a great aggravation of the contempt already committed by your petitioner , and deserved a severer punishment than that which he would , possibly , have otherwise inflicted ; and , accordingly , that he , the said Judge Peck , having found your petitioner guilty of the original contempt in publishing the article signed " A Citizen , " and of the aggravation of that contempt by declining to require interrogatories to be filed , and by declaring , that , if filed , he would not answer them , sentenced your petitioner to be imprisoned , for twenty-four hours , and suspended from practice as attorney and counsellor at law in the District Court of the United States , for eighteen calendar months ; which decision and sentence is entered on the records of said court in the following terms , to wit : United States , vs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The defendant in this case having been brought into court by attachment , and the court having demanded of him whether he would answer interrogatories , or would purge himself of the contempt charged upon him , and the said defendant having refused to answer interrogatories , and having persisted in the contempt , the court doth find that the said defendant is guilty of the contempt to this court as charged in the said rule . United States , vs . Luke E. Lawless . ) The defendant in this case having refused to answer interrogatories , and having persisted in the contempt , it is ordered , adjudged , and considered , that the said defendant be committed to prison for twenty-four hours , and that he be suspended from practising as an attorney or counsellor at law in this court , for eighteen calendar months from this day . Your petitioner further showeth , that , under said sentence , your petitioner was forthwith lodged in the common jail of the county of St. Louis , and remained /q/ locked up there from four in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock at night , when he was brought before Judge Stuart , one of the Circuit Judges of the State of Missouri , on a writ of habeas corpus , and by said Judge discharged from imprisonment , on the ground that the order of commitment was a nullity , having no judicial seal or signature by which it could be authenticated . Your petitioner showeth that , inasmuch as your petitioner was discharged from imprisonment in consequence of a mere formal defect in the order of commitment , he is still liable to be re-committed by said Judge Peck , whenever it shall please him so to do , by a warrant in proper form . Your petitioner further showeth , that said Judge Peck , by that part of his sentence which suspends your petitioner from practice as attorney and counsellor , has not only injured your petitioner , but has violated the rights and endangered the interests of those persons ( and they are numerous ) who have entrusted their claims and causes in said court to your petitioner . That your petitioner is prepared to prove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all that he has above alleged , and , for this purpose , begs leave to refer ( amongst other matter ) to , 1st . The opinion of Judge Peck in the cause of the widow and heirs of Soulard vs . United States , as published by said Judge in the Republican newspaper of the 30th March , 1826 . ( Marked No. 1. ) 2d .

The said article signed " A Citizen , " and so much of the text of the published opinion , placed in juxtaposition thereto , as will demonstrate the truth of the article , and the total absence of malice in the writer of it .

The testimony of other respectable citizens , who , if summoned , can prove , on their oaths , the manner and language made use of , as above alleged , by said Judge Peck , towards your petitioner . Having thus submitted to your honorable body the facts of his case , and the evidence in support thereof , your petitioner begs leave to observe , that it appears from those facts  --  1st . That the said James H. Peck has , in his capacity of Judge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of usurping a power which the laws of the land did not give him . 2d . That said James II . Peck has exercised his power , be the same usurped or legitimate , in the case of your petitioner , in a manner cruel , vindictive , and unjust . Wherefore , and inasmuch as the said James H. Peck has not only outraged and oppressed your petitioner as an individual citizen , but , in your petitioner 's person , has violated the most sacred and undoubted rights of the inhabitants of these United States , namely , the liberty of speech and of the press , and the right of trial by jury , your petitioner prays that the conduct and proceedings in this behalf , of said Judge Peck , may be inquired into by your honorable body , and such decision made thereon as to your wisdom and justice shall seem proper . And your petitioner , as in duty bound , Avill pray . /z/ St. Louis , Missouri , 22cZ Sejjtember , 1826. /z/ This memorial was referred to the Standing Committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that session , of Messrs . Webster , Wright , Rives , Letcher , Humphrey , Owen , and Kerr . It was accompanied by various documents , which were referred to by the memorialist in illustration and proof of his cause of complaint . Nothing was heard from the committee upon the subject referred to them until the 15th of February following , when they prayed that the petitioner have leave to withdraw his petition and documents . Here the matter rested till the session of 1828 , when , on the 29th of December , the Hon. Mr Mc Duffie , of South Carolina , again presented the same memorial , and moved its reference to the Judiciary Committee , consisting , this year , of Messrs . P. P. Barbour , Buchanan , Rives , WicklifFe , Kerr , Storrs , and Bell . But the session passed , and no report was made on the memorial . The following session , Mr. Mc Duffie , on the 15th December , 1829 , repeated the motion he had made at the last Congress , and the petition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of Messrs . Buchanan , WicklifTe , Storrs of JV . York , Davis of S. Carolina , Bouldin , Ellsworth , and White of Louisiana . These gentlemen took up the subject with earnestness , and on the 7th of January ensuing , their chairman , Mr. Buchanan , moved that they be authorized to send for persons and papers . The motion was agreed to : witnesses were sent for and examined , and on the 23d of March following , Mr. Buchanan made a full report of the proceedings of the committee , exhibiting an abstract of the Soulard cause , ( which had given rise to the the proceedings , ) together with the depositions of Luke Edward Lawless , the memorialist ; Henry S Geyer , Arthur L. Magenis , and Charles S. Hempstead , practising lawyers at the Missouri bar ; the Rev. Thomas Horrall , an Episcopal minister residing at St. Louis ; John Mullanphy ; and Edward Charless , the editor of the paper in which Mr. Lawless had published his strictures on the opinion delivered by Judge Peck in the Soulard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Judiciary Committee and of Judge Peck , by whom they had been cross examined ; but as all of them , save one , were afterwards examined on the trial , it is deemed unnecessary to present their examination before the committee . The report concluded with the following clause : " That , in consequence of the evidence collected by them , in virtue of the powers with which they have been invested by the House , and which is hereunto subjoined , they are of opinion that James H. Peck , Judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Missouri , be impeached of high misdemeanors in office . " The report was ordered to be printed ; an ineffectual attempt by Mr. Clay of Alabama to include in the order for printing the memorial of Mr. Lawless , and a letter addressed by Judge Peck to the committee , having failed . On the 5th of April following , the Judge addressed to the House , through the speaker , the following memorial : To the Honorable the Speaker and Members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The memorial of James H. Peck , Judge of the District Court of the United Stales , for the District of Missouri , Respectfully represents : ' That , by a report of the Committee on the Judiciary , made to your honorable body on the 23d March , 1830 , on the petition of Luke E. Lawless , it is proposed that your memorialist be impeached of high misdemeanors in office . As the report consists only of that simple proposition , without any specification of charges , or of the grounds on which the measure is recommended , your memorialist is left to collect those charges and grounds from the petition of Mr. Lawless , and the evidence accompanying the report of the committee . By that petition and evidence , it appears that the proposed impeachment has /q/ relation to one single charge against your memorialist , and one only , to wit : your memorialist having , in his character of Judge , in April , 1826 , punished a contempt of* court , committed hy the said Luke E. Lawless , a practising attorney and counsellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a sentence of imprisonment for twenty-four hours , and hy a suspension from practice as such attorney and counsellor in that court for eighteen months . As the proceeding by impeachment is one of grave character , and is not less interesting to the public than to the individual who may be the subject of it , your memorialist presumes that it will not be displeasing to your honorable body to have a full view of the whole ground of this accusation , before you proceed to decide finally on the report of the committee . In England , from which we borrow the process of impeachment , the House of Commons has been willing to receive such information from the party accused , before they will vote the impeachment . Thus , in the case of Warren Hastings , accused of high crimes and misdemeanors in his office of Governor General of Bengal , Mr. Burke presented the motion for impeachment to the House , with several articles of charge , on the 4th April , 1786 . On the 26th April , the House received a petition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar of the House , against the matter of the charges exhibited against him , and praying , also , for a copy of the charges ; both of which were granted . On the first of May , that gentleman was accordingly admitted to the bar of the House , where he was heard in his defence for two days : his written defence was then received , with the documents to which it referred , and a number of gentlemen were then examined as witnesses at the bar of the House , which was continued , at intervals , throughout the month . Li consequence of the opportunity of defence thus allowed to Mr. Hastings , the first article in the impeachment , and that on which the accusers seemed mainly to rely , was struck from the list ; and it was not until after the severest scrutiny , and discussion which continued to the close of the session , which was resumed in the following year , and was protracted until the 10th May , 1787 , that an impeachment was finally resolved on by the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the preparatory movements , that impeachment , after a trial which hung over the nation for seven years , proved abortive , by the triumphant acquittal of MrHastings on every charge . Your memorialist has referred to this precedent simply for the purpose of showing , that the request which he is about to prefer is consonant with the practice of the British House of Commons in like cases . Even without a precedent , and on the original grounds of reason and justice , your memorialist presumes that it would not be Ihe disposition of the House , either to burthen the nation or to harass him with a prosecution , which can be shown to be without any solid foundation either in law or right . In saying this , he intends no disrespect to the committee which has recommended the impeachment . They had before them , as your memorialist presumes , the witnesses , only , who had been selected and summoned at the request of Luke E. Lawless himself ; nor can they , as your memorialist hopes he may add , without the imputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an opportunity of examining , deliberately , the adjudged cases on which he grounds his principal proceedings against Mr. Lawless . Against the prima facie impression to his disadvantage , arising from the fact that this committee have recommended an impeachment he hopes , also , that he may be permitted to adduce the opposing facts , that this same petition of Luke E. Lawless was presented to this honorable House at the session of 1826-7 , when the Judiciary Committee , to which it had been referred , and the chairman of which was , and is , among the most distinguished legal characters in the United States , after examining the subject , prayed to be discharged from the further consideration of it , and that the petitioner have leave to withdraw his papers . The same petition was again presented at the session of /z/ 1828  --  9 , when the committee , ( two of whom had been on the first committee ) seemed to have considered it not of sufficient consequence to engage their attention , since they made no report whatever on the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present report of the committee , connected with its accompanying evidence , ( which is the effect of the witnesses called against him on the suggestion , as he presumes , of Mr. Lawless himself , ) even although the case should go no further , is calculated to throw a shade on his official as well as his personal character , which a full knowledge of the case would entirely remove ; and , with this view , as well as to prevent a needless consumption of the time of this House and of the honorable Senate , your memorialist humbly prays that you will permit him to lay before you a full exposition of all the facts as well as the law of this case , and that you will receive the testimony of some of the most respectable gentlemen , who witnessed the whole transaction , and who have no connexion either with your memorialist or the petitioner , to influence the statements which they will lay before the House . Your memorialist feels the most entire confidence that , if this request shall be granted , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the petitioner , so far from meeting the censure of this honorable House , deserves its approbation , and that , if he had failed to adopt the measure which he did adopt , he would have been unworthy of the place which he holds in the Judiciary of the United States . In what form you will be pleased to receive this exposition and testimony , whether by a direct address to the House , or by re-committing the subject to the Judiciary Committee , with instructions to receive and report them to the House , or , with an instruction to the committee to reconsider the subject and report anew to the House , or in whatever other form , is a matter of entire indifference to your petitioner , since he feels no other solicitude on the occasion , than that the subject itself shall be thoroughly and fully understood by the House and by the nation , on all the evidence and the law which belongs to it ; and that a public discussion shall not take place on that evidence only which is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imperfect view of the subject . Your memorialist begs leave to suggest , that , having been all along conscious of the entire rectitude of his own motives and conduct , and having been aware , also , of the former presentation of this same petition of Mr. Lawless to this honorable House , and of the failure of these efforts to satisfy the former committees , that there was anything in the transaction to call forth the censure of this House , he had felt no solicitude on the subject , until he was informed , by a private letter from Washington , that the Judiciary Committee had moved for , and obtained , leave to send to Missouri for persons and papers , with a view to the investigation of the charge ; when he thought it proper to proceed in person to Washington : he did so , and on his way , on the 28th of February , at Louisville , in Kentucky , he received a letter from the honorable chairman of the committee , dated at Washington , on the 2 1st of January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of Mr. Lawless ' complaint ; that they had obtained leave from the House to send for persons and papers ; and that they would receive any explanation which this memorialist might think proper to make , in relation to the charge . The place and time at which your memorialist received this letter , the uncertainty of the duration of the session of Congress , the want of power to compel the attendance of witnesses from the State of Missouri , and his conviction that the permission to examine counter testimony would not be considered as coming within the scope of that explanation which the committee had declared themselves willing to receive , left to your memorialist no course but to proceed to Washington with as little delay as possible , and with no other means of explanation than such as he bore about him . He reached this city on the 9th of March , /q/ and on the 10th , addressed a letter to the honorable chairman , simply requesting that he might he present at the examination oi'the witnesses summoned in support of Mr Lawless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the evening of Sunday , the 14th of March , your memorialist received the answer of the honorable chairman , ( dated on the 13th ) by which he was informed that the committee would , on Monday , ( the day after the receipt of the letter ) receive any explanation in writing relative to the charge preferred by Mr Lawless , which your memorialist might think proper to communicate ; and that , after having made such communication in answer to the charge , your memorialist would be permitted to cross-examine such witnesses as might be examined for the purpose of sustaining it . Your memorialist begs leave to observe , that , being afflicted with an inflammation and weakness of the eyes , which compelled him to have recourse to an amanuensis ; being now in a place in which he is a stranger ; and the explanation which he was expected to make , calling , in his opinion , for an v extended statement of facts , and for a minute reference to law authorities in support of his judicial decision , which authorities he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for making this explanation , rendered the task a perfectly hopeless one . The committee , no doubt , thought the time amply sufficient . As the charge was a single one , they naturally enough supposed that the explanation must be brief . But if this honorable House shall be pleased to receive that exposition which your memorialist has prayed leave to offer , you will be satisfied , that , though the charge be single , yet the facts out of which it has grown , and the principles of law involved in it , are multifarious , and that the case can not be fairly understood without a full developement of all those facts and principles . It is proper , also , to add , that the committee themselves extended the time for making this explanation for several days . Yet such was still the haste , and such the disadvantages under which your memorialist , was compelled to prepare the statement , that he was constrained to submit , as part of it , crude memoranda , not designed for such a purpose , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative could been have read , or , it ' read , could have been clearly intelligible to the committee . Your memorialist was desirous that his explanation of the case should have been fully read and understood by the committee before the examination of the witnesses was taken up , in order that the committee might have a distinct view of the points in issue between the petitioner and your memorialist , and be thus the better able to direct their own examination , as well as to take the points and appreciate the force of the cross interrogatories which your memorialist intended to propound ; but to his great regret , on the very morning on which he handed in his statement , which was on Friday , 19th March , ( and which was as early as it was possible , in the nature of things , for him to prepare the statement , even in that crude form , ) the honorable committee , without reading the statement , proceeded immediately to examine the witnesses . It is true , also , that your memorialist was permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been summoned and examined in support of the charge , but this cross-examination was much restricted by frequent objections , and by the strong desire evinced by the committee to get through the examination at least within the two remaining days of the week . And your memorialist having been more than once admonished that he was there , ex gratia , felt himself checked and restrained from extending the cross-examination to points which seemed to him to belong to the inquiry ; so that his having been permitted to be present , under such circumstances , is rather a disadvantage to him than a benefit , because it gives to the transaction all the semblance of a free and full investigation of the whole case , without the reality . Your memorialist does not make this remark in censure of the honorable committee ; on the contrary , considering the proceeding , as they manifestly seemed to do , as being analogous to an inquiry by a grand jury , and to be governed by the same rules , your memo-/z/ rialist is sincerely satisfied that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view ofthe subject , they did , in fact , treat him , with great liberality and indulgence . But your memorialist submits , with great respect , that the proceeding of the House of Representatives , in inquiring whether they will , or will not , institute an impeachment , is not to be governed by those strict rules which confine a grand jury to ex parte evidence . It was not the course pursued by the House of Commons of Great Britain , in the case of Warren Hastings , to which he has referred , and in which the House , before they voted the impeachment , heard not . only the defence , but the testimony of his witnesses . In the digested report ofthe committee ofthe House of Commons , which fo 1 - lows the report ofthe arguments of the managers who conducted that impeachment , it will be seen , too , that , in the estimation of that committee , the proceedings of courts of law furnish no rule whatever for the proceedings in an im ' peachment ; the latter being governed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consuetudo parliammti , which left the House at perfect liberty to pursue the great ends of justice untrammelled by any other rules than those which reason and public utility prescribe , and of which they have left us a practical commentary in the privilege of defence and counter testimony accorded to Mr. Hastings , preliminary to the vote of impeachment. * Your memorialist submits , with great deference , to the consideration of this honorable House , that the great purposes proposed to be attained by the process of impeachment , can be secured in no other way than by resorting to this measure in those cases only which demand a public example , in the punishment ofthe offender . A resort to it in cases in which there is no probability that the impeachment can be ultimately maintained , though its effects on the individual who is the subject of it would be to harass him with wanton cruelty , and to break down his spirit of independence , by encouraging the assaults of private and personal malignity ; yet its effects on the public would be to destroy all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrors , and to render it so common and unproductive of any great result , as rather to throw ridicule on this great feature of the constitution , than to surround it with that awe which properly belongs to it . In the present instance , although the petitioner , Mr. Lawless , has attempted to give solemnity to his complaint , by representing the freedom ofthe press , the right of trial by jury , and the liberty ofthe American citizen , to have been violated in his person , in the summary punishment for a contempt of court , inflicted on him , yet your memorialist has no fear of satisfying this honorable House , if an opportunity shall be afforded him , that these are the trite topics continually resorted to , and resorted to in vain , in Great Britain , whenever the courts of that country have found it necessary to punish summarily , a contempt  --  the rights secured to the subject by the Magna Ckarta of that kingdom being no less dear to them , nor less strongly guarantied , than those in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred principles to apply them to such a case as this ; that the court has done no more , in this case , than has been continually done , without censure , in contempts of an inferior character , in the courts both of England and of this country , and ofthe very State where this was done ; and that , if the power exercised by your memorialist , be denied to the courts of the United States , they are deprived of that salutary power of selfprotection , which , we are told on the highest authority , that all courts have possessed , from time immemorial , which it is indispensable to their existence that they should possess ; and , deprived of which , courts must lose all their value , and sink into inevitable contempt and insignificance . Your memorialist , therefore , respectfully prays , that your honorable body will receive from him a written exposition of the whole case , embracing both /z/ the facts and the law , and give him , also , process to call his witnesses from Missouri in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be taken on the evidence as it is now presented with the report of the committee . In the hope that the case may be permitted to take this course , he is now proceeding , with all possible despatch , to prepare the statement in a form which may fit it for the reception of this honorable House , and he hopes to have it ready in a few da vs . If this prayer can not be granted , his hope and prayer is , that your honorable body will , if it meet your own approbation , vote the impeachment at once , without any discussion on that partial evidence which presents a garbled view of the subject , greatly to the prejudice of your memorialist , and that he may have as speedy an opportunity as the nature of the case will allow , to exhibit , before the tribunal of the Senate and before his country , the entire transaction , in all its parts , as it really occurred ; being conscious and confident that , to ensure his acquittal from all censure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this kind , the case requires only to be fully understood . And in the strong hope that the one or the other of these prayers will be granted , your memorialist , as in duty bound , will ever pray . /z/ This memorial was followed , on the 14th of the same month , by the following Letter and Explanations . Sir : Permit me , through you , to avail myself of the permission of the Hon. House of Representatives , by their resolution of Wednesday last , to present to that body my explanation in answer to the charges preferred against me by Luke E. Lawless , Esq . with the documents referred to in that explanation . " N ith great respect , , Your obedient servant , /z/ To the Hon. Andrew Stevexsox , Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Congress United States . To the Honorable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the United States : James H. Peck , Judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Missouri , availing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday last , to present any argument on the law and matters of fact now in evidence before the House , which he may think proper , in answer to the charges preferred against him by Luke E. Lawless , Esq . begs leave to represent , that the complaint of the petitioner grows out of the notice which the court felt , itself constrained to take of certain strictures published by the petitioner in a Missouri newspaper , on an opinion delivered by the court in 1826 , in the case of Soulard 's heirs against the United States  --  a Spanish land claim presented for judicial decision , under the act of Congress of the 26th May , 1 824 . To enable the House to understand these charges , and the answers which it is proposed to give them , it becomes necessary to take a cursory glance at the character of these claims , and the general legislation of Congress with regard to them , and then to present a distinct view of the opinion of the court in Soulard 's case , and the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the court considered and punished as . a contempt . It is known to the House , that the province of Louisiana belonged originally to France ; was ceded to Spain in 1762 , though possession was not taken by Spain under that treaty , until 1769 . That in 1800 , the province was re-ceded by Spain to France , by the treaty- of St. lldefonso ; the Spanish authorities , /z/ nevertheless , retaining ' possession until and after the cession by France to the United States , by the treaty of Paris , of 30th April , 1803 . By the third article of this latter treaty , the United States stipulate that the inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty , property , and the religion which they profess ; and in execution of this article , so far as it respected real property , Congress immediately proceeded to establish , in various parts of the province , Boards of Commissioners , to examine and report upon all claims for lands made by the inhabitants under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present their claims to these Boards within a limited time , under the penalty of having them perpetually barred ; but the time was opened and extended by successive acts , and the most liberal provisions were made for the protection of all bona fide titles . Amidst all this liberality , however , Congress showed , by their laws , that they were perfectly aware of the temptation thus held up to the cupidity of adventurers inhabiting a frontier country , far removed from the restraints of their former European sovereigns , and , as is usual in such situations , not under the constant dominion of those moral restraints which prevail in ancient , and long established settlements . This people , too , it was natural to believe , had had that salutary pride of character , which is the best pledge and preservative of moral purity , greatly weakened , if not destroyed , by the manner in which they had seen themselves transferred , and re-transferred , from master to master , like cattle bought and sold in the market ; and Congress gave warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , recently disclosed , prove that they had good reason to apprehend , by requiring the Boards of Commissioners to note especially , in every case , all false , fraudulent and antedated claims . These laws are now collected in the volume compiled under the direction of this House , on the subject of public lands , and they carry their own commentary on their lace . The Boards of Commissioners were continued in operation for many years ; but , notwithstanding the warning continually given , and repeated by the acts of Congress to all claimants , to present their claims , under the penalty of having them forever barred , it was still found , after the Boards had closed , that there were yet other claimants , who , under various excuses , had omitted to present their claims to the Commissioners , and who now presented them to Congfess , and importuned that body for relief . These petitions finally produced the act of the 26th May , 1824 , entitled " An act enabling the claimants to lands within the limits of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings to try the validity of their claims . " Bv the first section of this act , all persons claiming lands in Missouri , by virtue of any French or Spanish grant , &c.; legally made , Sfc. before the 10th March , 1804 , by the proper authorities , to any person resident , &c.; and which might have been perfected into a complete title , under and in conformity to the laws , usages , and customs of the Government under which the same originated , were authorized to present a petition to the District Court of Missouri , setting forth the nature of their claims , &c; ; and by the second section of the act , the court were required , in all cases , to refer , in their decree , to the treat ) / , law , or ordinance , under which the claim was confirmed or decreed against . These provisions clearly indicated an apprehension , on the part of Congress , that claims might be presented on titles not legally made by the proper authorities , and that their confirmation might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treaty , law , or ordinance , which alone Congress authorized the Judge to regard as grounds of confirmation . The duties thus thrown upon the Judge , to investigate , in every case , the authority of the officer from whom the alleged title proceeded , and to examine the treaties , laws , and ordinances , under which alone the confirmation could be claimed , called him into a field of inquiry entirely new to the profession of law in the United States ; and it was indispensably necessary to a just discharge of /q/ these duties , that he should be put in possession of all the French and Spanish laws and regulations which bore upon the subject of the grant of lands in that province . As his judicial conduct is in question in this proceeding , it may not be deemed irrelevant to state , that , in order to fit himself for a conscientious and correct discharge of these important duties , and to enable him to do right to the suitors , as well as to the United States , as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26th May , 1824 , and had time to look around him , to see what materials of information were within his own reach , he addressed several letters to the Secretary of State of the United States , ( of which he begs leave to annex copies , marked A , ) requesting to be furnished with all the laws , royal orders , and regulations , of France and Spain , which affected the grant of royal domain in Louisiana , and specifying such of them as his researches had led him to believe did exist . In consequence of these applications , one royal order only , that of the 24th August , 1770 , which may be more particularly noticed by-and-by , was ultimately procured ; but even that came too late to assist him in the decision of the case of Soulard 's heirs : had it arrived before that time , it would have furnished a new ground in confirmation of his decision in that cause . For the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the act of 1824 , the Judge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at three different places in that State ; and it was with good reason anticipated that very numerous claims would be presented before the court for consideration and decision . It is deemed important , as having an immediate bearing on the inquiry before the House , to present , more distinctly , a view of the number , as well as character , of the claims  --  all of which involved the very question decided in the case of Soulard 's heirs , and which was forced upon the consideration of the court , by the act of Congress , to wit : the authority of the respective officers to issue the several documents on which these claims rested . In order to give the House this view in the best mode which is now in the power of the Judge , he begs leave , in the first place , to refer them to the schedule C , hereto annexed , which is an authenticated abstract of claims , taken from the Registry of Surveys for the several districts of Upper Louisiana , exclusive of that of New Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed by the several Boards of Commissioners and the Recorder of Land Titles : the precise number so confirmed , the Judge has not the means of ascertaining at this time , but the whole residue which remained unconfirmed , were authorized , by the act of Congress , to be brought before the court , and might , be reasonably presumed to be so intended to be brought before it , and many of them did , in fact , afterwards compose the docket . This schedule , numerous as it is , it will be observed , is confined to claims which purported to have been surveyed under the French and Spanish Governments , and by the same officer , continued under the American Government . In addition to these , there were other surveys , which had been subsequently made , under the orders of the several Boards of Commissioners , of which there were , also , unconfirmed claims , within the jurisdiction of the court . And , in further addition , were all the unsurveyed claims , which had been rejected by the Commissioners ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed by the list contained in the record of the case of the heirs of Macky Wherry , which accompanies this statement , and is marked B ; and it is material to remark , that it relates to the unsurveyed claims in one district only , out of four . The Judge considers himself as speaking within the limits of moral certainty , when he expresses the belief , that , at the time of the decision of Soulard 's case , the claims of various kinds , under Spanish concessions , or orders of survey , either surveyed , or unsurveyed , which existed in the State , and which were properly within the jurisdiction of the court , under the act of 1824 , amounted , in numbers to thousands . That many of these claims were , and are good , and /z/ worthy of confirmation , the Judge is ready to hclieve ; and , of the sincerity of this belief , he has given proof , by the fact of his having decreed in favor of some of them . Bi:t that there were others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the reports of the Boards of Commissioners , had authorized him to believe ; and discoveries , which have been recently brought before Congress , and the nation , from a part of the territory embraced by the act of 1824 , concurring with the evidence in the case just alluded to , of the heirs of Mac key Wherry against the United States , which has been lately decided in the District Court of Missouri , the opinion delivered in which case accompanies the record thereof , Document B , rendered it impossible for charity herself to doubt , that , among those claimants , there were some who were disposed to take an unfair advantage of the good faith with which Congress were carrying into effect the third article of the treaty of 1803 . These claimants , so formidable in numbers , and some of them , at least , it is to be feared , still more formidable by the absence of moral restraint , and by their frontier habits of life , took care to interest in their success many of the gentlemen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Judiciary Committee , it is presumable was contingent , and who , having , therefore , large interests at stake on the result , felt , very naturally , a degree of solicitude for the event not less keen than that of their clients . What kind of Judge would have best suited the views of some of the claimants it is needless to remark . But it is proper to remark that it called for no common degree of constitutional firmness , as well as calmness , for a Judge to keep his balance against such an array of power ; and that it was not in such a situation , nor in such circumstances , that the court was to relax any of those means of self-protection , with which they are clothed by the law of the land ; but that , on the contrary , the occasion pre-eminently demanded the firm and fearless exercise of judicial independence , and the rigorous application of all necessary and proper measures to preserve the authority of the court against those rude assaults , which there was too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitors , emboldened by their numbers , embarked in a common cause , and by that propensity to the summary process of self redress , which is known to characterize those new and distant settlements . The House will perceive that the situation of the Judge was new and peculiarly trying , and that it would be unfair to compare it with that of a Judge administering the law in a single case , and in a long settled country , where the people are accustomed to the curb of the law , and where the respect for courts is habitual . He does not make this remark with the view of excusing or extenuating any breach of judicial propriety : for it will be seen in the sequel , that his course of action has been governed by the same rules which govern all courts in like cases ; but simply with the view of showing the House that the situation was one which forbade the exercise of that forbearance and indulgence , which , he may venture to say , ( because it is partly in proof ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits , than that course which he felt himself constrained , by a sense of duty , to adopt in this instance . It was not anticipated , that the whole of the claims which existed in the State , and which properly belonged to the jurisdiction of the court , under the act of 1824 , would be brought at once before that tribunal , because the presentation of unsettled claims for millions of acres , after the Boards of Commissioners had been so long in operation , would have been , of itself , calculated to startle the nation , and to awaken suspicions , and beget prejudices extremely unpropitious to the claims ; and those which were good would have been endangered by their association with those which were of an opposite character . Ordinary skill dictated the policy , therefore , of bringing these claims gradually and cautiously before the court , and of putting forward only so many as were necessary to test and settle the principles on which the decision of the main body , held in reserve , /q/ depended . This course is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marked E , a list of the cases brought before the Court of St. Louis , being one of the three places in that State at which the Judge was required to hold his sessions for the trial of these claims . Of the one hundred and ninety-eight cases which compose this docket , it will be observed that the petitioner , Mr. Lawless , is concerned as attorney and counsel in more than one-third of them . Soulard 's case is among these , and is considered , and , as the Judge is informed and believes , was admitted in the argument of it before the Supreme Court , to stand at the head of a list ( not before the court ) which amounts to millions of acres . This case of Soulard was the first on the docket which was called for trial . It was elaborately argUed at the March term of 1825 , by Mr. Lawless and his associate , for the petitioner , and by the District Attorney and Mr. John B. C. Lucas , for the United States . Mr. Lucas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , and having been all along a member of the Board of Commissioners for the examination of these claims , was supposed to be well qualified to aid the court in the investigation of a subject so entirely new to it ; and the court was willing to receive light from any quarter within its reach . He was , moreover , interested in the principles involved in the case , having been cited before the court in another case , to defend rights adverse to some of the claimants . The court having been thus placed in possession of all the arguments of the counsel , pro et con , held the case under advisement until the term previous to December , 1825 , when it found itself constrained to come to the conclusion that the claim was invalid , for want of authority in the officer to make the concession . The opinion was not in writing ; it was delivered viva voce , but in eztenso , and substantially with the same train of reasoning , and under the same arrangement in which it now appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion was then pronounced , the decree was not then enrolled , owing to the absence of the leading counsel , who was Mr. Lawless ; but , at the request of his associate , was postponed till December , in order that he might be present to prepare the case for an appeal to the Supreme Court . At the request of several members of the bar , and , among others , of Mr. Geyer , as he admits in his evidence , this opinion was published . It had been a common thing in every part of the United States , as well as in England , to publish the decisions of courts on new questions of law ; the court , therefore , perceived nothing unusual or unreasonable in the request of the bar , that this opinion might be published ; on the contrary , there seemed to be a peculiar propriety in the publication irf this instance , because the opinion had been placed on grounds which had not been fully discussed at the bar , and the court was , therefore , desirous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those grounds would still be considered as open to discussion in any future claim which might come before the court : for the court was willing to correct , with candor , any error into which it might have fallen , to the prejudice of the land claimants ; and if error had been committed in Soulard ; s case , the mischief was not irreparable , because an appeal had carried that case to a tribunal where all errors were sure of correction . The decision of the court was published in the " Missouri Republican " of the 30th March , 1826 ; on the 8th of April following , appeared the article signed " A Citizen , " in the " Missouri Advocate and St. Louis Enquirer . " These two newspapers proceeded from rival presses in the same town , had taken opposite sides in the political discussions of the day , and , it is to be presumed , therefore , were supported , in general , by different subscribers ; so that the two publications would fall into the hands of different readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would take the trouble to look up the opposite paper and read the opinion . Besides , the " Citizen " is a shorter article ; had the poignancy of ridicule on a Judge to give it zest , and recommend it to the general /z/ reader ; and , with regard to the great body of the land claimants  --  formidable both by their numbers and influence in society  --  it addressed itself to their prejudices , and was sure to find that ready welcome , and to command that entire faith and confidence , which men are always ready to yield to what flatters their interests . The Judge was willing to make every*Yeasonable allowance for that disappointment and chagrin which he knew that his decision must have inflicted on the land claimants and their counsel ; and , had the publication been a decent and respectful discussion of the soundness of the opinion , and the subject-matter had not been still sub judiee in the same tribunal , though in different names , and in a different tribunal between the same parties , the liberty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is no such discussion . It is no discussion at all . The author do.es not profess to reason on the subject . The publication consists entirely of a tissue of assumptions , which it imputes to the Judge , not one of which is true in point of fact , in the light in which it is presented ; several of which are directly the reverse of what the Judge did decide ; and several others the pure coinage of the author 's own brain , having no foundation whatever , either in the opinion or the case . To a person acquainted with the subject-matter of the opinion , ( as it is the purpose of this address that this honorable House shall be , and without which it will be impossible that they can decide intelligently on the subject before them , ) it will be seen that the assumptions thus imputed to the Judge , rise in a sort of ascending climax from the beginning to the end , increasing in absurdity as they advance , and some of them so glaringly and ridiculously absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement , that the Judge was totally destitute either of common sense or common honesty . Indeed , the author has taken care to spice the publication with divers covert insinuations to this effect , as if afraid that the mere charge of these preposterous assumptions on the Judge would not be enough to awaken the contempt of the reader , without the aid of this further quickening . It is true there is nothing gross in the language of the publication ; for vulgar ribaldry is not the language of a satirist who understands his art . It was not the form but the substance which the court considered and treated as a contempt . It was the string of legal absurdities imputed to the court , calculated to excite the contempt and indignation of the public at large against the tribunal ; to prejudice the public mind with regard to the claims of the same character yet remaining for decision before the same court ; to impair the confidence of the suitors in the purity and intelligence of the tribunal before which the claims were depending ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court , and thus to restrain the court in the free , and fearless , and independent exercise of its judgment in the remaining cases :  --  It is this which teas considered , and which is still considered , as a contempt of the court , punishable by the summary process of attachment ; and this the more especially , when the contempt is considered as having been committed by an officer of the court , pursuing his practice therein under its protection , and bound , therefore , to treat it and its decisions with respect . As the question here is , whether the court was correct in regarding the publication signed " A Citizen , " as a contempt , it becomes important , and , indeed , indispensable , to understand the opinion of which that stricture professes to be a fair analysis , with the view of comparing the analysis with the opinion , and thus arriving at the object and character of the publication ; after which , the objections will be considered of its having been a publication out of term time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally disposed of by the court . To understand the opinion , it is necessary that the House should know something of the case in which the opinion was pronounced , and of the peculiar law which was to govern the decision . With regard to the case . Antoine Soulard claimed ten thousand arpents of /q/ land , under a concession made to him in 1796 by Don Zenon Trudeau , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana , then called Illinois , and now Missouri . The Lieutenant Governor resided at St. Louis , and held his appointment under a commission from the Governor of Louisiana , residing at New Orleans The form of the commission was before the court , and does not specify the powers of the Lieutenant Governor . The concession made by Trudeau to Soulard was for public services , and the kind of public services in consideration of which the concession was made , as they are to be collected from the evidence , ( for the concession and the petition on which it was founded were not produced , being stated by Soulard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various characters of surveyor of Upper Louisiana , for which , it was said , he had received only the fees of office , of deputy adjutant for a time , and of assistant , or , as one of the witnesses stated it , the right arm of the Lieutenant Governor . The questions pressed upon the consideration of the court by the act of Congress , were , whether this concession was legally made by a person duly authorized to make it , and whether there was any treaty , law , or ordinance , to which the court could refer , in its decree , as the basis of a confirmation of the claim . There was no treaty affecting the case , except the treaty of 1803 , which has been mentioned , and which left these questions entirely open . The next , and the main question was , whether there was any Spanish law or ordinance which authorized the concession ? With regard to Spanish law , it was known that , long before the acquisition of Louisiana , Spain had held extensive possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those possessions , the King of Spain had published a code of laws , under the title of " Laws of the Indies , " of which the royal ordinance of 1754 , which regulated the grants of the royal domain , constituted a part . One question in the case was , whether , on the acquisition of Louisiana by Spain , in 1762 , the previous laws of Spain , with regard to the possessions in the Indies , attached at once upon the newly acquired province by their own proper force , or whether the laws of the former sovereign remained , until they should be displaced by a positive edict introducing those of Spain . In considering this question , it appeared further , that , in 1769 , Spain , for the first time , took possession of the province , under General O'Reilly , who was also , by special commission , invested with extraordinary powers as Governor and Captain General of the Province , and that , on the 18th February , 1770 , this officer had promulgated at New Orleans , the regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively directed to the regulations of grants of the royal domain . These regulations differed fundamentally from the laws of the Indies . By the latter , lands were granted only on sale , and with a view to revenue ; by those of O'Reilly , which looked to the speedy settlement of the province , lands were given to settlers in proportion to their force , or means of cultivation , or to graziers in proportion to the number of their stock ; no one regulation , however , contemplated a gift of land as a reward for services of any kind . The process in granting the lands , too , was entirely different under the regulations of O'Reilly from that which had prevailed either under the antecedent government of France , or that which prevailed by the laws of the Indies . O'Reilly simplified the process greatly , and placed the granting power immediately and exclusively in the hands of the Governor General . In the year 1797 , Governor Gayoso published additional regulations , preserving the features and policy of O'Reilly 's , and certainly not authorizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an order of the King of Spain , the granting power was taken out of the hands of the Governor , and placed in those of an Intendant , and Morales was the person first appointed to that office . In the year 1799 , he published his regulations , in the preamble to which he recites , that he had examined with the greatest attention the regulations of /z/ O'Reilly and Gayoso , as preparatory to those which he was ahout to publish , giving no intimation of the existence of regulations by any other Governor . But in this same preamble he conveys the first and only intelligence which the Judge , or , he believes , any member of the profession had received of the existence of a royal order , affecting , in any manner , the grant of lands , posterior in date to the regulations of O'Reilly ; and he refers to it in this way : After reciting that the " King had been pleased to declare and order , that the Intendant be put in possession of the privilege to divide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he adds , " which right , after his order of the 24th August , 1770 , belonged to the civil and military government . " The use which has been made of this order in the publication of " A Citizen , " and the necessity of giving the House full information with regard to the character of that stricture , renders it proper that they should be further informed with regard to the royal order of the 24th August , 1770 . Morales had given notice that such an order existed , but of what nature or what was its extent , was entirely unknown at the time of the decision of Soulard 's case . Morales had said nothing of it but that , under it , the right of grantin lands belonged to the Governor , which was precisely the effect of O'Reilly 's regulations in the preceding February ; and Morales had referred to these regulations , without any intimation that they had been altered by the royal order of the August following , so as to countenance the inference that the sole object of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of changing them in any particular . Since the decision of Soulard 's case , a copy of the order itself has been obtained from Madrid , on the request of Judge Peck , before noticed , and it is discovered that his conjecture in relation to the order was not incorrect . The order , as procured from Spain , is now in the Department of State , and a translation of it , witli some inaccuracies , is among the archives of this House , being " Document 121 , Private Land Claims in Florida , 20th Congress , 2d Session , " and more generally known by the name of Col. White 's Collection ofthe Spanish Land Laws . On reference to this document , it will be seen that this royal order of24th August , 1770 , so far from altering or enlarging the regulations of O'Reilly , is a simple confirmation of them , and it directs that Louis do Unzaga , the Governor , to whom it is addressed , and his successors in the said government , shall have the sole power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as long as his Majesty shall not make any other provisions , to thr said instructions dated from that city , New Orleans , erroneously translated this ftj/ , on the %th February , of this year ; " this being the date of the promulgation of O'Reilly 's regulations at New Orleans . An abstract of all the claims continued by the Governor of Louisiana has been furnished to the Treasury Department , by which it appears that the first grant was made by Unzaga , in 177 ! , and on the margin of that abstract , it is stated , from that time down to a period just preceding the regulations of Gayoso , that the grants are made on the conditions set forth in thr royal order of the %th Ft binary , 1770 ; by which it is manifest , that Unzaga considered O'Reilly 's regulations , as thus ratified , with relation back to their date , and as taking , from that date , the dignity of a royal , order . The House is now prepared for an examination ofthe opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation made in the article signed " A Citizen . " That article commences with a misrepresentation , which is a fair specimen of the ingenuousness to be expected in the sequel . The Judge , in the close of hs opinion , in explanation of the extensive range which he had taken in this discussion , finishes with this sentence : " The decision of most of the points , therefore , having proceeded chiefly upon grounds which had been little , or not at all , examined in the argument in the cause , it is deemed proper to remark that counsel will not be excluded from again stirring any ofthe points which have been here decided , when they may hereafter arise in any other r cause . " No man of ordinary intelligence could possibly have been mistaken in the meaning of /q/ this sentence ; much less could a professional man , acquainted in the slightest degree with the practice of his profession , have mistaken it . Now mark how the " Citizen " takes it up , in allusion to tiiis sentence : for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an allusion . He says , " I observe that , although the Judge has thought proper to decide against the claim , he leaves the rounds of his decree open for further discussion . Availing myself , therefore , of this permission " &c.; Now , what reader of this piece , who had not read the opinion , could doubt that Judge Peck had invited and challenged a discussion of the soundness of his opinion in the public prints ; an act , of itself , so utterly inconsistent with the gravity and dignity of the judicial character , that , if Judge Peck had , in truth , been guilty of it , ( more especially in the circumstances in which the undecided claims of the same character then stood ) he would have proved himself unworthy of the office which he holds ; yet such is the imputation on him in the introduction of the article signed " A Citizen . " The author , as if conscious of this perversion of the obvious meaning of the Jud , ee , and that the act which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts a bofd face on the . matter , and adds , " And considering the opinion so published to be a fair subject of examination to every citizen who feels himself interested in , or aggrieved by , its operation , I beg leave to point the public attention to some of the principal errors which I think that I have discovered in it . " It was not , then , for the candid purpose of convincing the Judge of his error , and inducing him respectfully to reconsider his opinion in reference to any future claim involving the same principles ; it was not for the purpose of obtaining redress in the particular case , because that had been sought by appeal to the Supreme Court , where all errors committed by the Judge below could be legally and regularly , and without any breach of respect , pointed out and redressed ; but for the purpose of disburdening the griefs of an injured party ( whose griefs had , at that very time , been carried by appeal to the court of last resort , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the errors committed by the Judge , that this article was published . But why point the attention of the public to these errors at this time , and in this form ? Not with reference to the case of Soulard , because that had been decided , and the errors of that decision , if any had been committed , were in the proper course for redress . If it was with reference to Soulard 's case , therefore , the motive could have been no other than one of personal vengeance against the court , or the Judge of the court , and this perfectly wanton and unnecessary , so far as the ultimate fate of the claim is concerned ; because , if the decision had been the other way , there can be no doubt but that the United States would have appealed to the Supreme Court . But we are relieved from the necessity of all scrutiny into motives , because Mr. Lawless , in his evidence before the Judiciary Committee , has stated that the object of the publication was to produce an effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he was counsel , and which were still depending before the Court . His evidence on this subject is of so singular a character , as to call for particular notice . In his direct evidence ( page 29 of the report of the committee ) he says : " In that case , Soulard 's 1 had been employed as counsel for the petitioner in that court . I had also been employed in several other causes of a similar character . " Here , appearing to recollect that the similarity of the causes still depending , with the cause of Soulard , which had been decided , might subject his publication to the censure of being intended to have an influence upon causes still pending in court , he adds , " When I say a similar character , I mean , founded upon unconfirmed French or Spanish titles . The similarity of character consisted only in being founded in an , incomplete title ; because I consider the case of the heirs of Soulard aspeculiar and original in its leading characteristics . " In a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion appear to me to have a fatal effect , if they should be established into law , upon that particular claim , and upon almost every other claim that was presented , or could be presented , to the court , under the /z/ law of 1824 , which authorized Judge Peck to adjudicate . ' ' ' ' But if the claim of Soulard was peculiar and original in its characteristic* , how could the decision of that claim have a. fatal effect , even if it should be established into law , ( which by the way it could only be by the affirmance of the decision by the Supreme Court ) " upon almost every other claim that was presented or could be presented before that court , " such other claims being of a character cliff/rent from that of Soulard ? The errors of Judge Peck , even if they should be established into law by the Supreme Court , could not possibly have a fatal effect on other claims of a different character , and , consequently , turning on different principles ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are assured , were peculiar and original . Even although these other claims of a different character were , in the first instance , to be adjudicated by Judge Peck , after his errors in Soulard 's case should have been established into law , by the Supreme Court , still , if , in these new cases , turning on different principles , his perverse and habitual propensity to error ( which seems to be the insinuation ) should plunge him into new errors , still those errors could not have a fatal effect while there was a court of revision above , until these new errors should , in their turn , be also established into law . The witness could scarcely have intended to pay Judge Peck so high a compliment , as to imply that the Supreme Court of the United States would follow his track through all these causes , and establish his errors into law as fast as he should commit them . It is manifest that the witness was embarrassed by his consciousness , on the one hand , that the point decided in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , and that the nominal attack on that decision , not only had an immediate bearing on cases still sub judire , but that its public effect was intended for these cases alone , and not for that which had been decided ; while , on the other hand , he was desirous of screening himself under a supposed principle of law , that , as the case which was the subject of his publication , had been finally decided , and had passed out of the court , having left no kindred cases behind it , he was no longer subject to the process of attachment for a contempt in having made a publication with regard to a case still pending before the court . We have a further elucidation of this subject in his cross examination , at page 35 of the report . He is there asked whether he had not an interest in Soulard 's case , and in other unconfirmed claims brought or to be brought before the court ? He answers , that he had . He is asked again , " Were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the publication , depending upon the principles of that determined , and involving other principles not decided in that case ? " He answers , " I believe their were . " And yet he had before said , that the leading characteristics of Soulard 's case were peculiar and original , and that it had no similarity with any ot her cases , except the being an incomplete claim . He is asked , again , " Were there not other causes depending , involving other principles than those decided , the merits of which were attempted to be impressed upon the public in the publication ? " This pinching question he answers in the following words : " My object in the publication was to show that Judge Peck had taken several positions , in doctrine and in fact , which , should they be sustained , would , in my opinion , be fatal to the great majority of the claims , and which , in my opinion , were erroneous . I was counsel in a great number of the claims depending at the date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , under the pressure of this question , a readmission of the fact that the positions taken by Judge Peck in Soulard 's case were fated to the great majority of the claims , which they could be upon no other principle than their identity ; and that the object of the publication was to show that such would be the effect of the decision on the pending chums , some of which had been previously admitted to depend on the very principles settled in Soulard 's case . We have here the avowed object of the publication , and a key to that sentence in the exordium to the " Citizen , " which has led to this commentary . /q/ The writer proposes to point the attention of the public to some of the principal errors in the opinion of the Judge , with a view to affect the opinion of that public with relation to the claims which were still pending . More of this hereafter . The author proceeds : " In doing - so , I shall confine myself to little more than an enumeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning on the subject . This would require more space than a newspaper allows , and , besides , is not ( as regards most of the points ) absolutely necessary . " In this , at least , the author is correct ; and he has stated his proposition in a tone so subdued as to give it all the effect of the keenest irony : for , if the Judge had really made the assumptions which the author has imputed to him , not only was demonstration wholly unnecessary , but their absurdity is so glaring as to have rendered all reasoning to prove it , folly and insult to the understanding of the reader . The author 's fault consists , not in failing to demonstrate that what he has alleged would have been error , but in stating , in the confident tone which he has assumed , and which is so well calculated to impose on the reader , that the errors which he specifies were , in fact , committed by the Judge , when , in truth , the opinion warrants no such statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  1 . Whether the opinion of the court was misrepresented in the article signed " A Citizen ; " and 2 . Whether this misrepresentation was a contempt , for which the offender was liable to an attachment , and to be put to answer interrogatories . The Judge maintains the affirmative of both these propositions : and now to the proof . The charging part of the article proceeds in these words : " Judge Peck , int this opinion , seems to me to have erred in the following assumptions , as welt of fact as of doctrine : " 1 . That , by the ordinance of 1754 , a sub-delegate was prohibited from making a grant in consideration of services rendered or to be rendered ? ' ' The Judge affirms that he made no such assumption , and took no such position . In his examination before the Judiciary Committee , the accusing witness produced the newspapers in which the opinion of the Judge , and his strictures , respectively , were published , having marked , as he says , the passages in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its correspondent proof ; and , in support of his first charge , he is thus discovered to rely on the following sentence in the Judge 's opinion : " He , the sub-delegate , is not made the judge of the value of services of the nature of those upon which the concession in question is alleged to have been issued . " Now , it is manifest that the single sentence in the opinion on which the accuser relies to support his first charge , disproves it . The charge accuses the Judge of assuming , " that , by the ordinance of 1754 , a sub-delegate was prohibited from making a grant in consideration of services rendered or to be rendered . " What reader would not understand from this statement that the Judge had declared that ordinance to contain a. positive prohibition on the sub-delegate from making a grant in conersidation of services of any kind , rendered or to be rendered ? The charge is direct and express , as to the prohibition ; general and universal , as to the services : whereas the sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that ordinance , the sub-delegate was not made the judge of the value of services of the nature of those on which SoularcVs concession is alleged to have been issued ; which implies that there were services of which the subdelegate was , by that ordinance , made the judge ; and thus disproves the sweeping charge in the article . But is this a proper mode of representing the opinion of a Judge ? tearing a single sentence from the context , and then misrepresenting even that single sentence ? No court would suffer evidence to be thus garbled , nor an authority to be thus mangled ; and the counsel who should attempt it would do it at the peril of his character . The sentence quoted belongs to an important discussion , of /z/ a higher character , the whole of which must be taken together , in order to ascertain the meaning of* the Judge . The counsel for the claimant had maintained that the royal order was in force in Louisiana , and that this concession authorized the reward for services which had been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first question was examined by the Judge at much length , and by all the lights within his reach . The discussion extends from page 5 to 12 of the report of the committee . His conclusion is , that the order was net in force in that province until partially introduced by Morales . In the course of the discussion , he takes up the powers of the sub-delegate under that order . He shows that the order professed to detail the whole duties and powers of that officer , and did detail them with minute specification ; giving all his duties and powers to sell and compound for land , in every supposable case ; and , with regard to granting land in reward of services , recognizing that power only in the seventh and eighth sections of the order , by which the Judge admitted that the sub-delegate was authorized to grant land as a reward for the services therein mentioned . But , inasmuch as the order professed to give the whole powers of the sub-delegates , and gave no power to give lands as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those sections , his conclusion was , that the ordinance contained no authority to a sub-delegate to grant lands in reward of any other services , of which description were those rendered by Soulard . The question was not whether the order prohibited such a grant as this , but whether it authorized it . The claimant , relying on that order , was bound to show that it authorized it , so as to enable the court to refer , in its decree , to that order , as the basis of confirmation . He did not show it : for there was no such authority there ; and this was all that the court said on this point . The whole paragraph from which the complainant has taken his sentence is found in page 12 . And this conclusion , thus reached by a process of reasoning on the order , which seems irrefragable , is gravely perverted by the accuser into an assumption , on the part of the Judge , that , " by the ordinance of 1754 , a sub-delegate was prohibited from making a grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If it should be suggested that " A Citizen , " although his language is general as to all services , must be considered as meaning the kind of services , on which the concession in Soulard 's case was founded , the answer is obvious , that he must be considered as meaning whatever a reader of that article must have understood him to mean . If he had stated in the article the kind of services on which Soulard 's concession was founded , and limited his charge to those services , there would have been no complaint . If the Judge 's opinion had been contained in the same number of the same paper , or had ever appeared in a previous number of that paper , there might be some color for the excuse . But it had never appeared in that paper at all ; in all probability had never been seen nor read by a subscriber to that paper ; the apology , therefore , must be deemed inadmissible , and the misrepresentation inexcusable . But there is something still more serious in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri many other grants depending on the same principles with Soulard 's : that is , grants by the Lieutenant Governor , in reward of services . At the time of the decision in Soulard 's case , it was the universal impression that we were not in possession of all the orders , decrees , and commissions , from Spain , which bore on the land titles in that State ; and hopes were entertained by every liberal man , that although as yet nothing had come to light in support of those claims , discoveries might thereafter be made which would support them . The idea that any known order contained a. positive prohibition on those grants , never had been suggested , nor entered any mind . Yet this first charge presents Judge Peck to the whole . body of those claimants , as the extinguisher of their last hope , by representing him as having assumed that the order of 1754 did contain a prohibition on all those grants for services . Had /q/ the author even qualified this unjust and incorrect charge , by stating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ' not in force in Louisiana , he would have relieved , in some degree , the pressure of this charge . But this opinion of the Judge he keeps out of view ; thus leaving the public , whom he professed it to be his intention to inform , under the impression that the order was in force in Louisiana , and that it contained a prohibition , which abolished these claims . To make the misrepresentation still more injurious to the court , the order of 1754 was then public , and any man who could read was able to see that it contained no such prohibition , and consequently , that the Judge who , according to the author , had assumed that it did , must be either a dolt or a knave : for no man whom " A Citizen " should lead to the perusal of that order , would look for more than the author 's charge had put him to inquire into , to wit , whether it contained the prohibition in question ; and , finding no such prohibition there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were one of the numerous holders of concessions for services ) to unite in the cry of impeachment against Judge Peck . The next assumption imputed to the Judge by the article is , " 2 . That a subdelegate in Louisiana was not a sub-delegate as contemplated by the above ordinance . " Judge Peck requests the House to consider for a moment , how a reader of this article , who had never seen the opinion of Judge Peck , and who knew no more of the case than " A Citizen " had chosen to communicate , would probably understand this charge ? How else could such an one understand it , but that a sub-delegate was not a sub-delegate ; since the additional words " as contemplated by that ordinance , " being unintelligible to a reader no otherwise informed than by that article , could have , conveyed no explanatory or qualifying idea . Even to a more acute and reflecting reader , who had only that article before him , the charge could convey no other meaning . For the previous charge was calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted the ordinance of 1754 to be in force in Louisiana ; and it would appear by that article that the power of a sub-delegate under that order , then in force in Louisiana , was in question . Combining the two charges , therefore , the impression to such a reader , not otherwise informed , must have been , that , although that order was in force in Louisiana , and the order thus in force recognized the powers of the officer called a sub-delegate , yet that such a subdelegate , although he might be a sub-delegate anywhere else in the Spanish dominions , was not a sub-delegate in Louisiana . Now , let this charge be compared even with the single sentence , which the accuser ( according to his habit ) has quoted from the opinion in support of it . That sentence is : " According to this evidence , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana was not a sub-delegate within the intention of the ordinance . " The House can not but perceive that the sense is entirely varied . But when you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the position is found connected , you will find that it is not possible to controvert the truth of the proposition , and that it is equally impossible to believe that any man who had intended to represent the opinion of the court with candor , could have so perverted his sense , or made an error out of his position . The decision of the Judge on this subject will be found in pages 9 , 10 , and 1 1 , of the report of the committee . By a reference to these pages it will be seen , that the question under discussion , was the great question whether the order of 1754 was in force in Louisiana . Among other arguments to prove that it was not in force in that province , the Judge relies on the different organizations and powers of the officers employed in giants of the royal domain . It is in this connexion , anduvith reference to this question , that he is inquiring into the different modes of appointing sub-delegates under the order of 1754 , /z/ and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the arrangements which prevailed in this province . He quotes the first section of the ordinance of 1754 , to show that , from the date of that order , the power of appointing sub-delegate Judges to sell and compromise for the lands , . belonged exclusively to the Viceroys and Presidents of the royal Audiencias , who were required to send them their appointment or commission , with an authentic copy of the regulation . He also notices the provision of that ordinance , that the Viceroys and Presidents should be obliged to give immediate notice to the Secretary of State and universal despatch of the Indies for their approbation , and that the sub-delegates so appointed , might sub-delegate their commissions to others . He then proceeds thus : " - This section prescribes the authority by which alone a sub-delegate can be appointed . It gives to the Viceroys and Presidents of the Audiencias the exclusive power of making those appointments ; makes them the exclusive judges of the places and districts where such appointments may be necessary , and vests the sub-delegates with power to sub-delegate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stations . " Had the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana his appointment , as subdelegate from the Viceroys or Presidents of the Audiencias ? or had he a subdelegation from one so appointed ? It has been proved , on behalf of the petitioners , that he had not . The evidence of the late Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana to this point , is , that he and his predecessors acted as sub-delegates , without any commission as such ; that he and they performed the functions of that office in virtue of their commission as Lieutenant Governor , which issued from the Governor General of Louisiana ; that the practice in other parts of the province , in this respect , was the same as in Upper Louisiana ; in all , the Lieutenant Governors were ex officio , sub-delegates . An appointment from the Viceroys or Presidents of the Audiencias of the Lieutenant Governors to be sub-delegates , is not permitted to be inferred from the performance of the duties of that office ; the absence of such appointment , as well as the authority in virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been proved . " According to this evidence , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana was not a sub-delegate within the intention of the ordinance . Nothing can be more clear , than that a concession of lands by a Lieutenant Governor , who had not been appointed a sub-delegate by the authority prescribed in the recited section of the ordinance , can be allowed to possess any validity , if that ordinance be considered as having been in force . The House will perceive that the proposition which the Judge was maintaining , was , that the royal order of 1754 was not in force in Louisiana . This first argument is , that the great and almost sole purpose of that order was to make stiles of lands for revenue , and not gifts . Whereas , in Louisiana , lands were given to encourage settlement and cultivation . The second argument is , that , if that order had been there in force , the subdelegate must have been appointed in conformity with it , that is , by the Viceroys and Presidents of Audiencias , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that order ; and that the sub-delegate , so appointed , would also have had the important power communicated by that order , of sub-delegating his powers to others : whereas , it appeared by the evidence in the case of Soulard , that the Lieutenant Governor was not appointed by those authorities ; that his appointment was accompanied by no such sanctions ; and that he had no power of sub-delegation . The conclusion of the Judge , therefore , was , that the Lieutenant Governor was not a sub-delegate , deriving his potccrs from the order of 175 4 , and that the powers of a sub-delegate could not be asserted for him , under the authority of that order . It is submitted to the House , that this train of reasoning is entirely fair , and the conclusion safely and candidly drawn , and that nothing can be more unlike /q/ than the impression which would have been made by a fair representation of the Judge 's opinion , and that which must have been made by the second charge in the article of " A Citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which he presents an absurdity to the mind of a reader , not otherwise informed , and which absurdity he imputes as an assumption , to the Judge . The third assumption imputed to the Judge , is , " that O'Reilly 's regulations , made in February , 1770 , can be considered as demonstrative of the extent of the granting power of either the Governor General , or the sub-delegates under the Royal order of August , 1770 . The House will be pleased to observe , that , in the " Missouri Advocate and St Louis Enquirer , " in which this article first appeared , the dates of February and August were printed in italics , though this is not noticed in the printing of the report of the committee . The fact is important , because it slibws the manifest design of the writer to call the attention of the reader to the absurdity imputed to the Judge , of considering the precious regulations of O'Reilly as demonstrative of the extent of the subsequent order of the king . Now , although the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered it manifest that this order has made no addition to the regulations of O'Reilly , and that , in point of fact , there would have been no mistake even if the Judge had taken the ground imputed to him : yet , as the extent of the order of August , 1770 , was not known at the time of the decision , the assumption imputed to the Judge would have been an absurdity , and was obviously intended by the publication to be held up to the community e , r s an absurdity . But the imputation is unjust ; the ground taken by the Judge , and the reasoning in support of it . are to be found in pages 12 and 13 of the report of the committee . The effect of that reasoning is this : that , although it was unknown what power or discretion that order vested in the Governor General , yet , as grants continued to be made in conformity with the regulations of O'Reilly , the fair inference was , that those regulations were not in conflict with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , in page 13 , is this : " that the regulations of O'Reilly are of a date anterior to the order of the king , of 1770 , does not appear to affect their authority . There would not , necessarily , be such a repugnancy between this order and those regulations , as to annul the latter . The subsequent sanction of these , and the presumption of their being authorized , thence arising , must be considered sufficient to give them the authority of law , whether the power to make them was comprised in the general and extraordinary powers given to the Governor General O'Reilly , previous to the order of 1770 , or not . " This consonance between the regulations of O'Reilly of February , and the royal order of August following , which was , at the time , a mere inference of the Judge , by reasoning , has since proved , by the production of the order , to have been the fact . But , apart from this consideration , the Judge submits it to the candor of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his opinion , is fairly and respectfully , or even decently , presented by the third charge in the article of " A Citizen . " The next assumption imputed to the Judge , is in these words : 4th . " That the royal order of August , 1770 , ( as recited or referred to in the preamble to the regulations of Morales , of July , 1799 , ) related exclusively to the Governor General . " The court did not assume or decide , that the order of 1770 related ezrlusiuely to the Governor General ; nor did it exclude the idea that the order might have related to others . The words of the opinion , are : " We have the testimony of Morales , the intendant , in the preamble to his regulations , that the power to grant lands belonged to the civil and military government , after the order of the 24th of August , 1770 . The powers of the civil and military government both centered in /z/ the Governor General . To him belonged the power to divide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted , that , to this extent , the inference is fairly drawn from the preamble of Morales . Had the Judge carried his inference to the extent imputed by the charge , it would have been absurd ; and it does not mitigate the contempt intended by the charge , that the order , since received , would have justified the inference to its whole extent ; because , at the time of the decision , the precise character of this order was unknown , and was generally believed to have been more comprehensive than it has since been found to be . The next assumption imputed to the Judge , is in these words : 5th . " That the word ' mercedes J in the ordinance of 1754 , which , in the Spanish language , means ' gifts , ' ' can be narrowed by anything in that ordinance or in any other law , to the idea of a grant to an Indian , or a reward to an informer , and much less to a mere sale for money . " The court made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the terms in which it was expressed , can leave no doubt of the contempt intended to be thrown upon the court by the charge . The only light in which this charge could have struck the mind of the reader of the article , is this : Mercedes , va the Spanish language , means gifts , and nothing more ; the ordinance authorizes the officer to make gifts without any reservation ; and yet this sapient Judge has decided that this unlimited power to make gifts , authorizes and means only gifts to Indians or rewards to informers ; and moreover , that gifts means a sale , for money . That such must have been the understanding , and was intended by the writer to be the understanding of every reader of his article , must be obvious to every candid mind ; and yet there is not one word of the charge thus imputed to the Judge , which is founded in truth . To enable the House to appreciate justly the character of this misrepresentation , it is proper to remark , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1754 , of which there is a translation in the appendix to the land laws , compiled under the resolution of this House , page 973 , and where it will be observed that this word mercedes is translated , not gifts , but grants . It is the closino- sentence of the preamble , and is in these words : " I have therefore resolved , that in the ( mercedes ) grants , sales and compromises of royal cultivated and uncultivated lands , now made , or which shall hereafter be made , the provisions of the regulation this regulation ) shall be faithfully observed and executed . " This translation was made by a person chosen by the government , who , of course , had no interest in perverting the sense . In Col. White 's collection , the word mercedes is rendered by the same English word grants . In the government translation before the court at the time of the decision in Soulard 's case , it was rendered grants . The sense of the word , it is to be presumed , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , depends on the subject to which it is applied , and the connexion in which it is found . In the present case , we see that the translator of the government considered it , when applied to the disposition of the royal lands , to mean grants ; and his view of the subject is strongly countenanced by the general character of the ordinance , and especially by the first sentence of the section which immediately follows the sentence just quoted , where , in the general definition of the powers of the sub-delegate , the word mercedes is dropped . The sentence is this : " That , from the date of this , my royal order , the power of appointing sub-delegates Judges to sill and compromise for the lands , " &c.; The Judge has not the command of any law dictionary of the Spanish language , to ascertain the technical sense of that word . In the general dictionaries the sense is various . Baretti , ( octavo edition , London , 1809 , ) defines merccd to mean courtesy , favor , kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition , as explanatory of the last sense , he has this : " Servira un senor a merccd , to serve a great man without any salary , and /q/ to be rewarded at his pleasure . " Cubi , ( Baltimore , 1823 , duodecimo , ) defines men cd to mean wages , gift , pleasure . Gallit , in his Spanish , French , and Latin Dictionary , ( Lyons , 1790 , quarto , ) defines it first salaire , prix , dv travail . Latin mcrces ; i. e. salary , price of labor , wages , and next Grace , biev.fait accorda par le roi . Latin Gratia , i. e. favor , benefit accorded by the king  --  kindness . Now it is of a word whose significations are thus various , and which , in the very instance before the court , had been rendered , by the translator of the government , grants , that the author informs his readers the meaning is gifts ; thus presenting the idea that this was the only and undisputed meaning of the word : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caricaturing the opinion of the court into a revolting absurdity . It will be found , on reference to the opinion itself , that the argument of the Judge is this : The royal order of 1754 , was , according to my judgment , not in force in Louisiana , but if you insist that it was , and that it must govern this case , you must bring the case within the ordinance . Your argument is , that the word mer cedes , in the preamble , brings the case within it . To which I answer . 1st . That the preamble , in which this word is found , neither gives nor grants anything , itself , nor directs any to be given or granted by others ; it is mere recital , leading to the regulations which follow : 2d . That the word mercedes does not inevitably mean gijts ; it has been translated by the officers of the government , grants ; it is capable , also , of being translated rewards . It is a word , therefore , at best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or gifts , the preamble declares , that all such as shall thereafter be made , shall be made in conformity with that ordinance ; but in looking through the ordinance , you show the court no article which authorizes such a gift as litis . There is enough in the ordinance to satisfy the word mer redes in either of the significations which has been given of it : if it mean grants , it is satisfied by those articles which regulate the grant of lands on sale and composition : if it mean reiocn-ds , it is satisfied by those rewards presented by the 7th and 8th articles , which offer rewards to those who give information of intruders on the public lands : if it mean gifts , it is satisfied by the second seel ion of the ordinance and the laws 14 and 15 cited therein , which authorize gifts to the inhabitants of towns for pasturage and commons , according to their wants , and to the Indians ; but in neither sense do you show any part of the ordinance which authorizes &; gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to pages 11 and 12 of the report , for the opinion of the court on this subject ; and it is worthy of observation , that the author has entirely omitted in this charge , " the gifts to inhabitants of towns for pasturage and commons , according to their wants , ' ' ' 1 which the court admitted might be made under the ordinance . Why it was omitted , is obvious enough ; the insertion of such an exception might have put the reader on further inquiry , and would , moreover , have destroyed the piquancy of the ridicule which arises from grouping together , in one short pithy sentence , Indians and informers as the favored objects selected by the court for the display of the royal bounty of Spain . The court is next charged with erroneously making the assumptions  --  6 . " That O'Reilly 's regulations were in their terms applicable , or ever were , in fact , applied to or published in Upper Louisiana . " 7 . " That the regulations of O'Reilly , have any bearing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant was contemplated by them . " 8 . " That the limitation to a square league of giants to new settlers in Opelousas , Attacapas , and Natchitoches , ( in the 8th art . of O'Reilly 's regulations , ) prohibits a larger grant in Upper Louisiana . " In the argument of the cause , no question was raised , relating to tht - publication of O'Reilly 's regulations in Upper Louisiana ; nor docs the opinion contain anything relating thereto ; nor does it convey an idea that Soulard ' s grant was contemplated by these regulations . Before reference is had to that part of the opinion to which these statements relate , it should be observed , that the object /z/ of the reasoning of the court was to remove all presumption of the legality of the concession , then in question , by showing that an authority to make such a concession , cither in the form of law , or otherwise , was necessary to its validity : and that the provisions of the regulations of O'Reilly , and also the general policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the regulations of Gayoso and Morales , collectively , did not permit a belief in the existence of any such authority . That , admitting that the concession then before the court , considered alone , would raise a presumption of its own legality ; yet such a presumption would continue only so long as it should be unopposed by a presumption of a higher nature ; and that the regulations mentioned , being the acts of the supreme authority in the province , the presumption arising in favor of ' their legality , was a presumption paramount to that arising in favor of the legality of the single act of the Lieutenant Governor , in making the concession : that two incompatible presumptions could not both be true : that the weaker could not prevail against the stronger ; and that the stronger must prevail against the weaker . It was in the application of this course of reasoning that the court , in its opinion , adverted to several of the provisions contained in the regulations of O'Reilly , of Gayoso , and Morales , to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Spanish Government , in relation to the disposition of the soil in Louisiana , not to be reconciled with the idea that any law existed , authorizing the ( riant or confirmation of the claim , then under consideration , even though O'Reilly 's regulations were not intended to apply to Upper Louisiana , then known by the name of Illinois . But certainly it is not insinuated in the opinion , that a limitation of a grant to a league square in Opelousas , &c.; prohibits a large grant in Upper Louisiana . The doctrine of the opinion is , that a prohibition was not necessary to prevent such larger grant , but that a positive authority to make it must be shown . Whereas , the charge of error implies the admission of the court , that the right would exist , but for the prohibition . If , indeed , the power had primarily existed , or been previously conferred , a prohibition might have been necessary to prevent its exercise , but that it had not been conferred was an inference which the court could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an assumption of the court , not controverted at the bar . With regard to the 8th charge , the court did not assume that the limitation of grants to a square league to new settlers in Opelousas , Attacapas , and Natchitoches , ( in the 8th article of O'Reilly 's regulations ) prohibits a larger grant in Upper Louisiana . The question was not at all what those regulations prohibited , but what they authorized . The court held the position that O'Reilly 's regulations , by their terms , extended to the whole of Louisiana : that the powers of the inferior officers were to be sought for in those regulations , and that when a power was claimed for them beyond those regulations , ( which covered the period of the alleged grant to Soulard ) that power must be shown in the form of law or otherwise . On the hypothesis that O'Reilly 's regulations constituted the only law on the subject at that period , the court held that they did not contain the power in question ; nor was it pretended that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tacit power to make the large grant in question of 10,000 arpens , the court say , ( pages 13 , 14 , of the report ) " upon what reason is it to be believed that the Governor General intended to authorize grants of land in Upper Louisiana , upon principles different from those upon which grants were to be made in every other part of the province ? Upon what reason were grants of land to be limited in quantity , in Natchitoches , Attacapas , and Opelousas , and unlimited in Upper Louisiana ? And what policy dictated the limitation of grants in the latter place , to 800 arpents , which we find in the 9th and 10th sections of Gayoso 's regulations , and the first section of the regulations of Morales , if , before these regulations , there was no reason for a limitation ? Was not the extension of settlement and the cultivation of the soil , as much to be encouraged by the distribution of land in Upper Louisiana , /q/ as elsewhere in the province ? Why , in Upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of the cultivator , when those particulars were to be attended to with strictness in every other part of the province ? The regulations of O'Reilly were made for every pait of the province , &c.; ' 1 his is the passage cited to support the 8th charge . Is there any error in the reasoning ? But , above all , is there anything to countenance the assumption imputed to the Judge that the limitation to a league square in one part of the province prohibited a larger grant in another ? The whole of the opinion to which these three charges are supposed to allude , is to be found in the pages referred to , and further comment is unnecessary to show how grossly they misrepresent the opinion of the Judge . The next assumption imputed is this : 9 . That the regulations of the Governor General , Gayoso , dated the 9th September , 1797 , entitled " Instructions to be observed for the Admission of New Settlers , " prohibit , in future , a grant for services , or have the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1796 , and not located or surveyed until February , 1804 . A This again must be met by a flat denial  --  neither of these assumptions is contained in the opinion . With regard to the first branch of the charge , the author , in order to keep up the color of absurdity which he is seeking to fasten on* the Judge , continues to confound the absence of authority with positive prohibition . Thus , in every instance in which the Judge has said that these regulations contain no authority to make the grant in question , the author has made him say that thev positively prohibit it ; to prove the falsity of which , and thus to convict the Judge of error , the reader of " A Citizen " had only to inspect the regulations themselves . The author 's position seems to be , that the authority to make these large grants is to be presumed , without proof , and must be presumed to continue until positively prohibited . The Judge , on the contrary , held that the authority must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed before him do not prove the authority , the author represents him as saying that these laws prohibit it . But the prohibition does not arise from those regulations , and is not to be sought for on their face , where the author represents the Judge as saying it was to be found . The prohibition arises from considerations extrinsic to the regulations , and antecedent to them . The king of Spain being the owner of those lands , no one could grant them except that sovereign , or some one authorized by him . The question was , who was authorized ? The court said , that the only laws which had been brought to its view , did not show the authority ; and hereupon the author represents the court as saying , that those laws shoiv a prohibition . Is this a true statement of the court 's position ? Let candor , or even charity , answer the question with reference to such a statement made by a counsel in the cause . The second branch of the charge is still more gross : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gayoso , in 1797 , annulled the prior grant to Soulard , which was made in 1796 . The court made no such assumption . While the author was using the liberty of the press to parody , according to his own taste , not only the language , but the meaning of the court , he would have made a much nearer approach to the truth of the case , by representing the court as assuming that Soulard had voluntarily abandoned his claim by failing to comply with one of the regulations of Gayoso 's , as well as Morales ' regulations . To expose the misrepresentations of the charge , it is proper to observe , that the king of Spain , by one of the laws in the Recopilacion , ( law 11 , page 969 , Land Laws , ) required all persons to whom lands had been distributed , to take possession within three months , on pain of forfeiture . Gayoso and Morales , pursuing the example of their Sovereign , made successively similar regulations in Louisiana . The 14th of Gayoso required all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within one year , and to make a specified progress in cultivation in three years . /z/ The 4th of Morales is of the same character . Soulard had disobeyed this command . Morales , also , pursuing the policy of his master in another respect , ( see law 14 , p 969-70 , Land Laws , ) had required all holders of incomplete titles to come in and complete them within six months , under pain of forfeiture . Soulard also disobeyed this call , and the reasoning and conclusion of the court on this subject was , that , if he had ever had title , he had forfeited it by his refusal to obey those calls . The House must perceive that , under this explanation , the position of the court , if not impregnable , is not , at least , absurd upon its face . But , " A Citizen " gave no such explanation to his readers ; on the contrary , the result , as he presents it , places the court in the predicament of giving a retro-active effect to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the court admitted to be prospective , and exhibits the court as directing the annulling power of the regulation backwards in direct action on the grant , instead of forwards on the omission to obey the command of the regulation . That passage on the court 's opinion to which this objection of the " Citizen " points , is found in pages 18 , 19 , of the report of the committee , and Judge Peck invites a comparison of the whole passage with this charge , that the House may test the ingenuousness of the representation . The next assumption imputed to the Judge , is this : " 10 . That the complete titles made by Gayoso , are not to be referred to as affording the construction made by Gayoso himself , of his own regulations . " 13 . " That the complete titles ( produced to the court , ) made by the Governor General or the Intendant General , though based on incomplete titles , not conformable to the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , or Morales , afford no inference in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these incomplete titles emanated , and must be considered as anomalous exercises of power in favor of individual grantees " 14 . " That the language of Morales himself , in the complete titles issued by him , on concessions made by the Lieutenant Governor ofUpper Louisiana , anterior to the date of his regulations , ought not to be referred to as furnishing the construction which he , Morales , put on his own regulations . " 15 . " That the uniform practice of the sub-delegates or Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana , from the first establishment of that province , to the 10th March , 1804 , is to be disregarded as proof of law , usage , or custom , therein . " These charges are all presented together , because they are of kindred character , involve the same principle , and require the same answer . They are not true . So far from it , they are diametrically opposed , in point both of fact and doctrine , to the grounds really assumed and maintained by the court . The representation becomes the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known to the author , that the evidence to which he alludes , in the 15th charge , was objected to by the District Attorney of the United States , as inadmissible ; that the court did admit it on the very ground that it raised a presumption in favor of the power of the Lieutenant Governor to make the grant in question ; that the District Attorney excepted to the opinion of the court , and that the bill of exceptions now constitutes a part of the record in the case of Soulard , before the Supreme Court . The court not only admitted all the evidence alluded to in these several charges , but also admitted , in the most distinct terms , that they did afford an inference ; that they did raise a presumption ; and were to be regarded as proof of the existence of a power , in the Lieutenant Governor , to make the concession on which Soulard relied : and yet precisely the reverse of this is that which is imputed to the Judge in these charges , for which there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted this evidence in the only light , and to the fullest extent , to which it was offered : for it was offered , and could be offered , only as presumptive proof , and in that character it was admitted . Having received it as presumptive proof  --  having admitted that it did raise /q/ the presumption that was claimed for it  --  it became the duty of the Judge to weigh this presumption against the other evidence in the cause . That process was - performed ; and the conclusion of the Judge was , that the presumption admitted to have been raised by this evidence , was overborne by the opposing proof : and because the Judge was constrained , in the conscientious discharge of his duty , to come to this conclusion , he is accused , by this author , of having assumed that the testimony in question afforded no inference , raised no presumption , in favor of the power claimed for the Lieutenant Governor . There is a statement in the close of the 13th charge , which demands a separate answer . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge of having assumed that the complete titles made by the Governor or Intendant General , though based on incomplete titles not conformable to the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , or Morales , afford no inference in favor of the power of the Lieutenant Governor , from whom these incomplete titles emanated , adds , " and must be considered as anomalous exercises of power in favor of the individual grantees . " This feature , thrown into the charge by way of aggravating the absurdity of the Judge , required only the exercise of a little candor in explanation , to have proved , that , if not impregnably correct , the conclusion was , at least , not marked with the absurdity which the author would inculcate on the reader . The question was , whether the confirmation by the Governor or Intendant General of these inchoate titles , afforded satisfactory proof of the powers of those inferior officers to originate those titles . It was admitted by the court , as alreadv stated , that , instead of affording no inference , they did afford an inference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the subsequent confirmation was satisfactory proof of such power ? As the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , and Morales , which had marked out the whole power of the inferior officers , gave no authority to originate such titles , the court conceived that , although the act of confirmation might prove the power of the confirming officer , it did not prove the power of the officer who had originated the claim ; because the confirming officer might have the power to establish any claim , however irregular in its inception . An instance of this kind is presented in the loth law of the Recopilacion : ( Appendix to Land LaWs , 970 ) the concluding sentence of which is this , " And because some lands have been granted by public officers who had not the power thereto , and which have been confirmed by us , in our Council , we , therefore , order , that all those to whom warrants of confirmation have been issued , may be at liberty to retain them , and shall be maintained in the possession of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted , in regard to the excess , to the benefit of this law . " That which had happened in this case might have happened in the case at bar ; for usurpations by inferior officers , far removed from the control of their superiors , are not uncommon occurrences ; and the power of the inferior officer , from the very few confirmations of his acts brought to the notice of the court in Soulard 's case , afforded no stronger inference of the powtr of the originating officer , than the sweeping confirmation made by the king , of grants which , he avows at the same time , have proceeded from officers who had no power to make them . In the case at bar , the presumption of power in subordinate officers was confronted by the published regulations of their superiors , which professed to chalk out the whole of their powers , and yet had not given the power in question . The court , therefore , thought it more rational to refer the confirmation to the sovereign power of the confirming officers , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not found in the charters from which all his powers appeared to have been derived . Such was the ground taken by the Judge , in which he conceives , that , if there was inaccuracy there was no absurdity ; and that it presents a very different case from the absurd anomaly exhibited by the charge . The entire reasoning of the Judge upon this subject , is to be found in pages 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , and 20 , of the report of the committee . And Judge /z/ Peck desires nothing more than a comparison of this opinion with these charges , to establish that the positions of the assumption here imputed to him are precisely the reverse of the doctrines which he maintains . The 1 1th assumption imputed to him is in these words : " 11 . That although the regulations of Morales were not promulgated as law in Upper - Louisiana , the grantee in the principal case was bound by them , inasmuch as he had notice , or must be presumed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had notice of their terms . " This is another entire misrepresentation . The error charged to the Judge is based on the assumption , that the regulations of Morales had not been promulgated as law in Upper Louisiana ; and yet , says the author , the grantee , Soulard , ( who resided in Upper Louisiana ) was held to be bound by them , inasmuch as he had notice , or must have presumed , " from the official station which he held , " to have had notice of their terms ; whereas the fact is , that these regulations had hern promulgated as law in that part of the province , and , by the complete titles which the claimant himself produced , it appeared that Soulard , who was the Surveyor , referred , in his official reports , to those very regulations ; and , therefore , was proved to have had notice . The truth is , that the publication of these regulations in Upper Louisiana was not questioned at the bar , at the trial , but was tacitly conceded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sufficient ; but , independent of the presumption of their regular publication throughout the province , after they had been so long in operation , it was expressly proved by the late Lieutenant Governor himself , that he , as Lieutenant Governor , had officially received several copies , not less than six , at the port of St. Louis ; and it was further proved that his private secretary had another fair copy , which he posted up in front of the government house . The court did not , therefore , in the opinion , consider the question which this statement represents it to have decided , which is , Whether , in case of proof ' , that the regulations had not been promulgated , the claimant , Soulard , would have been presumed , from his official station , to have had notice of their terms . That was not the case in proof ; and , therefore , did not call for consideration . The opinion of the court took the ground that there had , in fact , been a sufficient promulgation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shows that this statement of the author is a misrepresentation of the opinion . The 1 2th assumption of the Judge , is in these words : " 12 . That the regulations of Morales exclude all belief that any law existed under which a confirmation of the title in question could have been claimed . " It is only by the unfair process of taking a single detached sentence from the opinion , that the author can gain a color for this charge . Standing alone , as it does , and unexplained , it presents the Judge in the light of having affirmed , that , the regulations of Morales , unconnected with its preamble , exclude the possible existence of any law under which a confirmation of the title in question could have been claimed from the Government of Spain . The House will observe , that the . question in Soulard 's case , was , whether there might not have been some law or ordinance of intermediate date , between those of O'Reilly 's regulations in 1770 , and Soulard 's grant in 1796 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter grant . It was alleged by the counsel for the claimant , that there was such an intermediate law . In that part of the opinion to which this charge points , the court was considering the probability of the existence of any such intermediate law , and the language of the opinion in page 19 of the report , is this : " The regulations which we have , do not permit us to believe that there existed others . Morales , in the preamble to those made by him , mentions those of O'Reilly and of Gayoso , in a manner which implies that these were all of which he had any knowledge , and shows that he was making regulations which were to offer the only means by which lands were to be obtained . His language is : " That all persons who wish to obtain lands , may know in what manner they ought to ask for them , /q/ and on what conditions lands can be granted or sold ; that those who are in possession , without the necessary titles , may know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment ; that the commandants , as sub-delegates of the intendancy , may be informed of what they ought to observe , " &c.; This preamble excludes the presumption that other laws existed , by which titles could be obtained ; and the regulations themselves exclude all belief that any law existed , under which a confirmation of the title in question could have been claimed . The House will perceive that , if . the whole passage , or even its substance , had been stated by the author , it would have been impossible for him to have made anything of it , which his readers could have been induced to believe was error . It is only by separating the last sentence from its context , that a case can be presented which any man could be persuaded to regard as error . The Judge is next accused of having decided , 16 . " That the historical fact , that nineteen-twentieths of the titles to lands in Upper Louisiana , were not only incomplete , but not conformable to the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , affords no inference in favor of the general legality of those titles . " The House will look in vain , throughout the opinion , for any such assumption as this : for it contains no such assumption . The fact itself was not in proof , and even if it were true , the court could not have noticed it without such proof . Had it been proved , the evidence would , unquestionably , have appeared in the record which was sent up to the Supreme Court on appeal . Rut it was not there . Judge Peck has procured a printed brief of that record , which was used at the argument of the case of Soulard , at the last term of the Supreme Court , and which he understands was admitted by the counsel of the claimant to have given a full and fair view of the evidence in that case . The fact , if historically true , was not a fact about which any written history would have been received in evidence , because it is too recent , and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good the fact , if true , and afforded the best , and , therefore , the only evidence of which a court could judicially take notice . A judge could not receive the assertion of counsel , or that of a written book , in proof of a fact like this ; and to accuse a court of disregarding evidence , which was not before it , and which , therefore , it could not notice , is a misrepresentation calculated to bring a court into unmerited contempt . The next assumption charged upon the Judge , is this : 17 . " That the fact that incomplete concessions , whether floating or located , were , previous to the cession , treated and considered by the government and population of Louisiana , as property saleable , transferable , and the subject of inheritance and distribution , ab intestaio , furnishes no inference in favor of those titles , or to their claim to the protection of the treaty of cession , or of the law of nations . " There is nothing in the opinion which can afford the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were never offered in evidence , and , therefore , the court neither did , nor could , decide anything relating to them . Nothing in relation to these facts is to be found either in the opinion , or in the record of the case which contains the evidence . Had those facts been in proof , they would have afforded an inference in favor of the claim , and the presumption arising from them would have been fairly weighed with the other evidence in the cause , and settled according to the best judgment of the court . The last assumption enumerated in the article , is as follows : 18 . " That the laws of Congress heretofore passed in favor of incomplete titles , furnish no argument or protecting principle in favor of those titles of a precisely similar character , which remain unconfirmed . " There is nothing like this decided in the opinion . All that is said by the court , to which this statement can be supposed to relate , is in these words : " That part of the act which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the title , according to the several acts of Congress , &c."; has been adverted to on behalf of the claimants , but not seriously relied upon , as furnishing the ground of a claim to confirmation in the /z/ present case . Upon this point , it is only necessary to remark , that there is certainly no act of Congress which would authorize the confirmation of the present claim , or any part thereof . Now , the statement presents the case , as if the acts of Congress had been shown to the court , confirming incomplete claims of precisely a similar character , and that the court , with these laws before their eyes , assumed that they furnished no argument or protecting principle in favor of the claim at bar : whereas , in truth , no such law was shown , nor , as the Judge believes , can be shown . But how does this statement agree with Mr. Lawless ' evidence , " that he considered the case of the heirs of Soulard as peculiar and original in its leading characteristics ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misrepresentations , proceeds , in his concluding paragraph , in these words : " In addition to the above , a number of other errors , consequential upon those indicated , might be stated . " This is true : for as the author was not governed by the opinion of the court in the enumeration of his charges , their number depended entirely on the fertility of his own invention He proceeds : " The Judge 's doctrine as to the forfeiture , which , he contends , was inflicted by Morales ' regulations , seems to me to be particularly pregnant with grievous consequences . " To whom was this sentence addressed ? To the public of Missouri ! What rights were menaced by those disastrous consequences r The rights of those land claimants whose suits were yet depending in court , and rested upon the same principles with those which had decided the case of Soulard . It was not the case of Soulard which was to be benefited by this publication , for that was gone , having been sent , for correction of errors , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be derived from the publication , with regard to the claims still remaining in court ? To array against the Judge , a power which might overawe and control him , in the decision of the pending cases ; or , to render him , in his character of a court , an object of contempt and indignation , if he should dare to follow up , in future cases , the principles which he had laid down in Soulard 's ; or , to render the decisions of the court so despicable in the public estimation , as to destroy all the weight and authority of the court , by holding up to the public , the Judge who composed it , as among the most stupid and absurd , or unprincipled of mankind ; to beget , in the public mind , a sympathy and respect for these claims , which would unfit that public to perform the office of jurors in the trial of those issues of fact which the court was authorized to direct with regard to these claims , and if a jury should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring them to the jury-box with such a load of pre-conceived prejudice against the court , as to indispose them to receive , with respect , any instruction , even on a point of law , which might be given from the bench : in short , to erect atrophy for these land claimants , and their claims , on the ruins of the court itself . The petitioner says , that his whole object in this publication , was to save his clients from speculation , under the despondency which the decision of Soulard 's case had inspired . He does not say this in the article signed " A Citizen ; " nor did he say it when he was brought before the court to answer for this contempt . It seems to be an after thought ; but does it furnish any justification of his conduct ? The purpose was commendable , but were the means employed to effect it equally so ? There are those , who hold that the end justifies the means , and assassination has been defended on this ground : but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object had really been that which he avows , to wit : to restore the confidence of his clients against the despondency which the decision of the Judge had inspired , and thus to protect them against the rapacity of speculators , there was no occasion for him to have gone into the public prints to produce this effect . His personal assurance that the decision was erroneous , and would be certainly reversed by the Supreme Court , would have been far more likely to have produced this effect on clients who knew him , and confided in him , than an anonymous article in a public newspaper . The publication , PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS . So therefore , must have looked beyond his clients ; it must have looked to the whole public , to whom he addressed himself : and what effect could it have been his purpose to produce upon them ? In law , as well as in common sense , every man is supposed to intend the natural consequences of his own actions ; and what were the natural consequences which must have been expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdities , to the opinion of the court ? To bring the court into public contempt , and , with the public contempt , to arouse the public indignation against the court ; to restrain the Judge from the free exercise of his opinion , by the fear of the public resentment ; and , by these means , to operate , indirectly , on the causes which yet remained for decision . Was not this publication a libel on the court ? " A libel , " says Blackstone , " is a writing of an illegal tendency , as a malicious defamation of any person , and especially a magistrate , when it tends to provoke him to wrath 1 or expose him to public hatred , contempt , or ridicule . The falsehood of a libel aggravates it , and enhances its punishment . " 4 Bl . Com . 150 . Chitty says , " To constitute a libel , it is not necessary that anything criminal should be imputed to the party injured . It is sufficient if the writer has exhibited him in a ludicrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of ridicule or disgust ; has , in short , done that which has a natural tendency to excite him to revenge . And , therefore , words , in themselves not scandalous , become criminal if put in writing , so that they tend , in any degree , to a man 's discredit . This applies still more strongly to persons in public capacities , so thai , to publish anything which tends , in any degree , to the discredit of public functionaries , whether I ' ue or false , is libellous : and this seems to be the true boundary of the freedom of discussion . ' " 3 Chitty , Cr . Law , 636. 868 . Be it granted , that , in the United States , and especially under the Constitution of Missouri , a different boundary is contemplated , to wit : that boundary which shall discriminate between truth and falsehood . Still this boundary will not protect this publication against the imputation of being a libel , since it has been shown to be destitute of truth , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt of court , punishable by attachment ? Was it necessary , to make it such a contempt , that it should have been committed in the face of the court ? Blackstone says , that " Contempts which are thus punished , are either direct or consequential  --  direct , as open insults : consequential , which plainly tend to create an universal disregard of the court 's authority . " 4 Bl . Com . 283 , 284 . Again he says , in page ' 285 , " Some of these contempts may arise in the face of the court , as by rude and contumelious behaviour , by obstinacy , perverseness , or prevarication ; by breach of the peace , or any wilful disturbance whatever ; others in the absence of the party , as by disobeying or treating with disrespect the king 's writ , or the rules or process of the court ; by perverting such writ or process to the purposes of private malice , extortion , or injustice ; by speaking or ivriting contemptuously of the court or judges , acting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even true ones , without proper permission , ) of causes then ( lepra ling in judgment ; and by anything , in short , that demonstrates a gross want of that regard and respect , which , when once courts of justice are deprived of their authority , ( so necessary for the good order of the kingdom ) is entirely lost among the p-cplc " Hawkins says , " that , for contemptuous words or writings concerning the court , the party is punishable by attachment for contempt . " And with regard to the last class of contempts , he adds , " it seems needless to put instances of this kind , so generally obvious to common under standing . ' " It would be easy to multiply cases , decided both in England and in this country , in which contempts by publications reflecting on the proceedings of a court , have been held punishable by the summary process of attachment . Judge Peck begs leave to refer the House to the following :  --  2d Atkins , 469 . Proceedings against the printers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13th /z/ Vessey , Jun. ex parte Jones . The King against Almons . Opinions and judgment of Lord Chief Justice Wilmot , page 243. 1st . New York Term Reports , 485 . The people against Freer ; and the same case , 518 . The people against Feu. 2d Johnson 's Rep. 290 . Oswald 's case , 1st Dallas , 319 . The case of P. H. Darby , in Tennessee . Knoxville Register , 27th August , 1824 , in the Department of State . The petitioner alleges , that at the time of his publication , the case to which it related had been finally decided by the court , and seems to infer , from this circumstance , that it was not a contempt of the court in the sense of the law , and that he was , therefore , not within the power of the court . The first answer to be given to this remark , is , that the petitioner confounds by it , contempts of a distinct character . In 2d Atkins , 471 , Lord Hardwicke says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt is scandalizing the court itself . There may be , likewise , a contempt of this court , in abusing parties who are concerned in causes here . There may be . also a contempt of this court , in prejudicing mankind against persons before the cause is heard . " There can not be anything of greater consequence than to keep the streams of justice clear and pure , that parties may proceed with safety , both to themselves and their characters . Now each of these contempts is separately punishable , and the publication in question is punishable as a contempt of the first description mentioned by Lord Hardwicke , because it tended to the scandal of the court itself , by misrepresenting its proceedings . The reason for punishing this contempt , is entirely different from that which furnishes a contempt with regard to a pending cause . With relation to the first , it is because the publication degrades and vilifies the tribunal , and tends to destroy its authority and utility , as a public tribunal ; while , with regard to the second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tends to obstruct the course of justice in the particular case , by prejudicing the minds of the court or the public with regard to the parties or their cause . Hence , it is manifest , that , to constitute the first kind of contempt , it is not at all necessary that the proceeding regard to which the court is defamed , is still pending before the tribunal . The case of the King against Almon , which has been cited from Wilmot , page 243 , is a case of the first description . It was an application for an attachment against Mr. Almon for a publication containing many libellous passages upon the Court of King 's Bench , and upon the Chief Justice of that court , for his conduct both in court and out of it ; and it charges the court , and particularly the Chief Justice , with having introduced a method of proceeding to deprive the subject of the benefit of the Habeas Corpus act . The charge against the Chief Justice was , that he had amended , at his chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this act as the Chief Justice of the court , and not as the court itself ; the act charged was one done by Lord Mansfield , at his chambers , and consummated there ; and yet , Lord Chief Justice Wilmot held it to be a contempt of court . It does not appear that the cause was pending in court ; no notice whatever is taken of this circumstance in the opinion of Lord Chief Justice Wilmot ; and in an opinion so minute and dilated , had that circumstance been considered as essential to the offence , it would not have escaped the notice of the Judge . In the same case , the court had been reflected upon for rules which they had established in relation to the proceeding by Habeas Corpus , and also for the delay to afford a remedy upon the writ of Habeas Corpus in a particular case . Justice Wilmot decides the reflections upon the court , in relation to each of these subjects , to be a contempt . It is certain , therefore , that , with respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that reflections upon the court to constitute a contempt , need not relate to a cause depending , much less the misrepresentations of the decision of the court in relation to a cause which , in fact , supposes its determination . /q/ The opinion , in this case , is replete with all the learning upon the subject , and meets every objection which has been urged against the proceeding byJudge Peck . The case of P. H. Darby , in Tennessee , was a case in which , at the time of the publication , punished as a contempt , the particular cause had been decided by the Supreme Court , against which the contempt was committed , and had been sent back to the Inferior Court , for further proceedings . The person who had been guilty of the contempt was an attorney , who had been engaged in the cause ; his offence was that of a publication tending to excite the public indignation against the Judges of the Supreme Court , for having given that opinion , and to bring the same into contempt ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll of attorneys in that court . The cause , it is true , was pending in another tribunal , and might , perhaps , be again brought up before the Supreme Court ; and so the case of Soulard was depending before another court , and might , perhaps , be remanded to the court of Missouri for further proceedings . In both cases , therefore , the particular cause had , at the time of the contempt , been finally decided by the court , and had passed out of that tribunal into another ; and in both , there was a possibility that it might come back again for further proceedings before the libelled tribunal . Yet , in Darby 's case , the fact that the cause had , at the time of publication , passed away from the tribunal whose opinion was defamed by him , did not protect him from punishment for the contempt . A copy of the opinion of the court of Tennessee in Darby 's case , is herewith respectfully represented to the House , and is marked D. But again : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punish for a contempt , that the publication should relate to a cause still pending before the court , the evidence in this cause has proved that the publication in question is of this description . The accuser has admitted that , although Soulard 's case was his text , his publication was intended to have a bearing on claims of a similar character , and depending on the same principles , which were still before the court , and upon a multitude of cases , which , in presumption of law , were to be brought before it . It was , then , by his own admission , a publication with relation , not to one cause , but to many , which were still depending before the court and was intended to produce an effect on the public mind , with relation to the merits of those cases , and , as he himself states , did produce such effect . It meets , therefore , the third description of contempt , given by Lord Hardwicke , as well as the first , inasmuch as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those causes , before they had been heard by the court . It has been intimated that this publication was made in the recess of the court , and that , to constitute it a contempt , it is necessary that it should have appeared in term time . There is nothing in the authorities which countenances this suggestion ; and it seems to proceed again , from losing sight of the distinction between the several classes of contempts . With regard to a contempt in open court , it is necessary that the court should be in session : but , with regard to a publication , tending to bring the tribunal into contempt , or tending to bias and prejudice the public mind with regard to causes depending before that tribunal , there is no such necessity ; for , whether in session or not , the tribunal is still , in legal contemplation , in constant existence , and the causes which have been there instituted , are as much pending causes in the recess as in the session of the court ; and the mischief is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the court be in session or not . It does not appear , in the cases cited , that the court was in session when the publication took place ; and had this been an essential ingredient in the composition of the offence , it would certainly have been noticed . But no definition and no decided case adverts to it as entering at all into the offence of contempt by publication ; and , in reason , it is precisely the same whether the offence be committed in the recess or in the session of the court ; because the offence consists in producing , or seeking to /z/ produce , the effect of drawing contempt on the tribunal , or exciting prejudice for or against one side of a pending cause . And it is manifest that the effect is just as certainly produced , and as pernicious , and the mischief just the same , whether done during the session of the court , or after its adjournment ; the tribunal being still in existence , and the cause yet pending ; and the maxim is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hew is the same . To support the objection , some authority must be produced , directed to these two kinds of contempt , and this , it is confidently believed , can not be done : the authorities , on the contrary , are the other way . Was it any excuse for the complainant , that his publication spoke of Judge Peck as Judge Peck , and not as the court ? The very same thing occurred , and the same excuse was made , in Almon 's case : for there , too , the publication spoke of the Lord Chief Justice , by his title of Lord Chief Justice ; and the defamation was with regard to an act done by him singly , and out of court . Yet , says Lord Chief Justice Wilmot , this is no excuse ; because the act was done by him in his judicial character ; and the contempt , therefore , was offered to him in his judicial character , and as a member of the court . In the case before the House , Judge Peck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , with regard to which he is defamed , was an act done by him in his character of a court . It is said , that , if this publication was a libel , the author was subject to punishment by an indictment ; and it seems to be supposed , that , because he was so punishable , he was not subject to punishment by an attachment for a contempt of the court . But the same objection was urged in the case of Almon , in the same form , and was supported by the same popular topics  --  that the party had a right to a trial by a jury of his peers ; and that in the form of the proceeding adopted by the court , they were making themselves at once parties and judges in their own causes . But the objection was open to these obvious answers , and received them , to wit , that the offence was double . First , it was a libel , ( and was , moreover , scandalum magnatum , ) because it tended to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was punishable by indictment . Secondly , That it was a contempt of the court , in which aspect it was not punishable by an indictment , and could be punished only by the summary process of an attachment for contempt . That the latter power belonged to all courts from time immemorial , and was indispensable to their existence as courts . It is , indeed , a strange defence for a party to make against a punishment for one offence , to allege , that , by the same act , he has also made himself liable to punishment for another . According to this mode of reasoning , the more a party multiplies and complicates his offences , the more he increases the probability of his escape from punishment for either . In the case Yates against Lansing , ( 9 Johnston 's Rep. 416 , ) Piatt , Senator , says , " contempt is an offence against the court as an organ of public justice , and the court can rightfully punish it on summary conviction , whether the same act be punishable as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge a senator or a judge , may , under circumstances , be a contempt , but is certainly indictable : a conviction on indictment will not purge the contempt ; nor will a conviction for a contempt be a bar to an indictment . The offence may be double , and so are the remedy and the punishment . For instance , assaults in the presence of the court , rescues , extortion , libels upon the court or its suitors , relating to suits pending , forging a writ , &c.; are indictable offences , and certainly they are also contempts . " Such , also , is the principle maintained by the Court of Tennessee , in the case of P. H. Darby . The passage in the latter opinion is so peculiarly apposite to the case under consideration , that Judge Peck begs leave to make it more accessible to the House , by a quotation : " The power to punish for a contempt is no part of the criminal law ; if it were , courts which had no criminal jurisdiction could not punish for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Chancery , /q/ and this court . Where the contempt amounts to an indictable offence as well as contempt of the court , punishment inflicted by the latter is no bar to a prosecution for the former , and vice rasa . And neither the contemned court , nor the court of criminal jurisdiction , is obliged to suspend proceedings till the other has acted  --  9 Johns . 41.3 , - 417 . Cowp. 829 . This power itself , from its very nature , must , necessarily , be independent of all other tribunals : for , if it depends upon another , whether a punishment can be inflicted or not , that very dependence defeats and overturns it . The insulted Judge must go to law before some other tribunal , with every one whom his decision offends . Pie must quit his business in court , and leave the bench , and travel to inferior courts , and give his attendance upon them , neglecting , in the mean time , the official duties which belong to his office . The inferior judge may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regular , or legal ; they may be , in the end , set aside and quashed , by arresting or reversing the judgment , and must be commenced again , and the same difficulties again encountered . No one would be afraid to offend ; the delay of punishment , and the numerous chances of escaping it , would disarm the expected punishment of all its terrors ; nor would the insulted court ever think of the attempt to cause the infliction of punishment under so many discouragements . No sooner does he get through one set of controversies than some other dissatisfied suitor assails him with equal outrage , and involves him in others . He must go again , and forever , through the same routine of vexation and trouble . With such embarrassments to contend with , will he remain upon the bench ? He must either quit it , or submit to be directed by men who resort to such means for the attainment of their ends , and become an instrument in their hands for the sake of rest , abandoning his duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repress the efforts of designing men that shall be directed against him , because of an unyielding temper . How will the Judge be able to uphold his integrity , when interests of the highest magnitude are to be settled by his decisions ? When it shall be observed that the most submissive pass unmolested , will not submission at least plead in recommendation of itself ? Will it not set before him the perpetual conflicts which he has to maintain in vindication of opinions in which he has no individual interests , and the unceasing calumnies to which he is exposed for the protection of others , who hardly know the cause why he is so worried ? If , in so many difficulties , the Judge is not furnished with the means of immediate defence and repression , his authority must fall , and the rights of the people with it . For Avhat rights have they but those which the law gives , by means of the courts it has instituted ? and if these can not support them , " the rights themselves are nominal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication as a contempt , " the Judge has invaded the liberty of the press . " What is the " liberty of the press ? " and in what does it consist ? Does it consist in a right , to vilify the tribunals of the country , and to bring them into , contempt , by gross and wanton misrepresentations of their proceedings ? Does it consist in a right to obstruct and corrupt the streams of justice , by poisoning the public mind with regard to causes in these tribunals , before they are heard ? Is this a correct idea of " the liberty of the press ? " If so , the defamer has a charter as free as the winds , provided he resort to the press for the propagation of his slander ; and , under the prostituted sanction of " the liberty of the press , " hoary age and virgin innocence lie at his mercy . This is not the idea of " the liberty of the press " which prevails in courts of justice , or which exists in any sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press " is among the greatest of blessings , civil and political , so long as it is directed to its proper object  --  that of disseminating correct and useful information among the people . But this greatest of blessings may become the greatest of curses , if it shall be permitted to burst its proper barriers . /z/ The river Mississippi is a blessing to the country through which it flows , so lond as it keeps within its banks ; but it becomes a scourge and a destroyer when it breaks them . What earthly blessing is so great as civil liberty ? What curse so terrible as licentiousness and anarchy ? It is to check the last that laws are made ; and it would be just as rational to complain of all laws as a restraint on natural liberty , as to complain of that portion of them which restrains the licentiousness of the press . The liberty of the press has always been the favorite watchword of those who live by its licentiousness . It has been from time immemorial , is still , and ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all libellers . Oswald attempted ( o screen himself under its &gis,; in the case which has been cited from the first Dallas . But the attempt was in vain . The court taught him the difference between the liberty of the press and the licentiousness of the press ; and , in his further attempt to raise an impeachment against the Judges for that sentence , the House of Delegates confirmed the wholesome lesson . Judge Peck prays a reference to the note in the case of Oswald . If , indeed , the liberty of the press was a panoply broad enough to cover everything that is done in its name , nothing in the form of a publication could ever have been punished as a contempt of court : for the Plouse will observe , that , in all the reported cases in which these publishers have been called to answer for a contempt , whenever the defence has appeared in the report , it is the liberty of the press which is the perpetual theme . It is uniformly claimed to be the right of the citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes are continually rung on that great palladium of human rights and human happiness  --  the liberty of the press ; as if human rights and human happiness could be promoted by the prostration and destruction of courts of justice , or by poisoning their streams in the fountain head . It is unnecessary to pursue this subject . The Judge has never pretended that his opinions are not to be questioned : he insists , however , that they are to be questioned only according to the laws of the land . One mode of questioning them under these laws , is by appeal to a superior court ; and , after the subject-matter shall have been finally decided , another mode of questioning them is by respectful discussion , either in the public prints or elsewhere . In the present case , the first mode of questioning the opinion , that by appeal , had been resorted to : for the second mode , that of respectful discussion , the case was not ready , because the subject-matter had not been disposed of finally ; and , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no semblance of investigation in this article  --  no pretence of discussion of any kind . It was sheer misrepresentation ; and it does not follow , that , because an opinion of a court may be respectfully discussed , it may , therefore , be misrepresented : much less that it may be so misrepresented as not only to impair the confidence of the public in the dignity , intelligence , and purity , of the tribunal , but to render both the Judge and the court objects of universal contempt , scorn , and ridicule ; and least of all , that , in doing this , a strong prejudice shall also be infused into the public mind with regard to causes still pending in the court . The Judge has shown , that , in proceeding against this contempt by an attachment , he was justified by the example not only of the courts of England , from time immemorial , but the example also of other courts in the different States of the Union , where the liberty of the press and the trial by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their constitutions as they are in the State of Missouri ; and he will now add , that , even in Missouri , the courts had led the way by the exercise of the same power in cases of contempt by publication . One of these cases occurred a very short time before the State Government went into operation . The proceeding was against the editor of the " Missouri Gazette , " for a publication , giving an account of an assault and battery which had been committed on him by another editor , after the latter had been recognized to answer for the offence . /q/ The rule for the attachment was made absolute , and although there were mitigating circumstances in this case , the party was both fined and imprisoned . The other case occurred in the Supreme Court of the State , only two or three years before that under consideration , and it is the case alluded to in the evidence before the committee . In the suit of Bellisime vs . M'Coy , Mr. Lawless had prosecuted a writ of error in that court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A petition for a re-hearing was filed , and a re-hearing was granted . After the re-hearing had been granted , a publication appeared containing strictures on the opinion which had been pronounced by the court : the court , considering it to be a misrepresentation of their opinion , made a rule on the printer to show cause why he should not be attached for a contempt . Mr. Lawless showed cause against the rule , which being deemed insufficient by the court , it was made absolute . The name of the author was then given up , and that author was the same Luke E. Lawless . A rule was then made on him . Mr. Lawless appeared , and attempted to show cause ; but the court held it insufficient , made the rule absolute , and ordered interrogatories to be filed . They were filed , and Mr. Lawless answered and purged himself of the contempt . An hone able member of this House , who was an eye witness of the case , can correct any error in this report . In that case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the freedom of the press and the right of trial by jury , as the proceeding before Judge Peck . It is true that the cause was still pending in court ; but it has already been shown that this makes no difference in the law of the case , when the scandal is directly on the court ; and it has been also shown , that , in this instance also , there were cases pending , on which the publication was admitted to have been intended to bear . And , with these remarks , the Judge dismisses this branch of the subject . It is next said , the Judge 's manner and language , in pronouncing sentence on the attachment , were rude and harsh towards Mr. Lawless . On this subject the Judge understands the resolution of the House to confine him to the evidence reported by the Judiciary Committee ; and he will , therefore , make no statement of the case as it occurred , and as he believes it to have been capable of proof , if the opportunity had been afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House to the admissions made by the two principal witnesses , themselves , of the relation , in point of feeling , which they hold towards Mr. Lawless and the Judge , and to ask that their statements may be received with a reasonable allowance . But , let it be conceded that their statements are strictly correct , to what do they amount ? The House will remark , that Judge Peck was delivering an opinion in a case of contempt , arising from a publication which had misrepresented an opinion of the court ; the tendency of which was , to destroy all the respectability of the court , and to render it universally ridiculous and contemptible , as well as to destroy the equipoise of the public mind with regard to all the land claims depending before the court . The court was delivering an opinion , too , in reply to an argument which had continued for several days , in which the most inflammatory appeals had been made to the passions of a crowded audience , representing the proceeding as beinr an invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more especially an invasion of the sacred right of trial by jury , and of the liberty of the press , which were protected by the most solemn guaranties of the constitution : for such is , in effect , the evidence before the Judiciary Committee , and such were the facts . Against all these topics and arguments , the Judge was replying at considerable length , vindicating a proceeding which he held vital to the existence of the court , and marking his conception of the character of the contempt . And it is said that the Judge , in the course of delivering this opinion , appeared at times to be a good deal excited . Was it strange that a Judge thus circumstanced should have been excited ? Or was it even improper , or indecent , or inconsistent with the character of a /z/ Judo-e to express with warmth his sense of the indignity which had been offered to the court and , through the court , to the United States , which that court represented /z/ With regard to the language of the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; but both he and the other witnesses agree in the specification of the words imputed to the Judge . What were those words ? In speaking of that publication , the Judge pronounced it to be false : has he not proved it to be so ? He pronounced it to be calumnious : lias he not proved it to be so ? He pronounced it malignant : has he not proved it to be so ? Has it not been shown to have been done malo animo , towards the court , and towards the causes still remaining in court ? And in having been done malo anint o , was it not malicious ? In what other terms was the court to speak of such a publication than those which the law itself has annexed to it ? Is not every libel pronounced , both in the bonks and by the courts , to be false , scandalous , malicious , and defamatory ? Is a man to reconcile it to himself to do an improper act , and yet take fire at the terms which describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common language of the law in cases of this sort , through respect to the feelings of a man , who , so far from showing respect to that tribunal , stood before it charged and convicted of a flagrant contempt ? But it is said that the court , inter alia , in the course of its opinion , referred to a practice , in China , of painting the houses of calumniators black ; and , as the witnesses inferred , the court seemed to think Mr. Lawless a proper subject for such treatment . The last was an inference of the witnesses : for none of them say that the court expressed what they inferred , and none of them recollect the connexion in which the court referred to this Chinese custom . It was natural that they should have been struck with what was new to them , and not surprising that they should not have observed , or should have forgotten , the precise connexion in which it was introduced ; nor is it very surprising , that , as the conduct ot Mr. Lawless was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would take the allusion . That the Judge , in the course of his opinion , made an allusion to this custom , is the only fact which is clearly in proof . And what impropriety was there in his doing so ? Was it improper , on such an occasion , and before such an audience , to show the light in which all civilized nations regarded a calumniator ? Hid it not fairly and properly belong to the discussion ? Was it not proper in a moral point of view ? Was it not calculated to have a salutary effeel , both upon the bar and the bystanders , to show , that , throughout the world , wherever civilization has dawned , there was but one feeling and one voice with regard to an offence of this sort , and that a voice of unmingled reprobation ? MS ith regard to the case itself , and the party concerned in h , what was there that called upon the court to measure its terms with regard to such an unmeasured contempt ? The witnesses themselves prove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there are occasions in which warmth and emotion become a Judge , and in which coldness and indifference would be unseemly even on the bench . Whenever vice is to be repressed , or the dignity and authority of the court are to be vindicated against aspersion and contempt , the Judge must be either less or more than human who could uniformly play the stoic . But he is unwilling that it should be believed either that his manner or phrase was exceptionable , as he conscientiously believes neither to have been so ; and to establish the manner and the phrase in its connexion , was one among his strongest reasons for desiring that his witnesses should be heard by the House . Believing it probable that a member of the House , who witnessed the proceeding , has it in his power to do justice to the Judge in this respect , he hopes he may be permitted to claim that justice from him . There is one point of view in which this case still remains to be considered . Hitherto it has been treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . But Mr. Lawless was attorney and counsel at its bar , and was , therefore , under /q/ an increased obligation to treat it with respect , and also under an increased responsibility to the court . He seems to suppose that this relation implies no responsibility on him , except while he was in court , or engaged in some professional duty in relation to a cause in court . But he is mistaken . The relation between the court and the attorneys who stand upon its roll. , is a permanent and continuing one , so long as the name is permi ; ted there to stand ; and courts have a supervising power over the conduct of attorneys out of court , and may attach them for acts having no connexion whatever with can/ cause in court . Thus the court will order an attorney to pay over money received by him as steward of a manor . Ex parte Corp . Christ . College , 2 Petersdorff , 615 , case 13 . So they will compel him to pay over money received by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So when he had received money as a Bill Broker , unconnected with his professional character . Id . 616 , case 18 , Ex parte Hall . For extortion , the king will order him to be struck off the rolls , &c.; Id . 605 . So for assigning for error that which he knows to be false . Id . 609 , case 6 . For gross misbehavior , the court will do it . Id . ih. case 8 . It is needless to multiply citations to this effect . They will be found collected by this author under the head of " Attorneys . " The court considers its character so far associated and implicated with that of the attorneys who stand upon its rolls , that they will suffer no man to stand there who has disgraced himself by his misconduct , although that misconduct have no connexion with the court . Cowper , 829 , Ex parte Broionsall . Attorneys , as officers of the court , are also under its protection ; and from this relation , it is their natural duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , and to discourage and repress disrespect in others , instead of exciting that disrespect by their own conduct , speeches , and publications . By the 35th section of the judiciary act , the courts of the United States are authorized to prescribe the rules by which they will permit attorneys to be admitted , to practice at their bar ; and , with relation to contempts committed by such attorneys , the Supreme Court of the United States has decided , with obvious propriety , that the court towards which the contempt has been committed , must , of necessity , be the best judge of the character of the contempt : they doubt their own power to revise such a sentence , and say that the case must be a flagrant one , indeed , in which they would interfere with such a sentence . Ex parte Burr . 9 Whcaton , 529 . If the step taken by the court in this case would have been right towards a stranger , it was , therefore , a fortiori , right with regard to an attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . Let us now see the conduct of this attorney , when brought before the court to answer for the contempt . He is told that the court has decided the publication to be a contempt . It was his privilege to purge himself of this contempt , as he had done in the case just mentioned before the State Court . The opportunity of doing so is afforded him . He is asked whether he wishes to have interrogatories propounded to him , or whether he will answer them if propounded by the court ? He answers , that he does not wish them , and that , if propounded , he will not answer them . This declaration that he would not answer interrogatories if they should be propounded , was not only an aggravation of the first contempt , but was a new and substantive contempt , which would , of itself , have justified the sentence that was passed , and in this light it is considered by the books . 4 Black . Com . 287. 1 Dall 329. 2 Hawk . P. C. 231 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do . 219 , do . note to sec. 10 . Strange 's Rep. 1197 , 1 Wils. 30. /z/ 2 Bar . K. B. 219. 4 Burr , 2105 , Rex vs . Edwards . 5 T. R. 362 , King vs . Horsley . In Mr. Lawless ' memoiial , he states , that , in reply to the question of the court , " 1st . That he did not require interrogatories to be filed ; " 2d . That if interrogatories were filed , he would not answer them ; " 3d . That , as he had committed no contempt , he would purge himself of none . " " That the said Judge thereupon declared , that the refusal to answer any interrogatories that might be filed , was a great aggravation of the contempt already committed by your petitioner , and deserved a severer punishment than that which he would possibly have otherwise inflicted . " But there was not a mere refusal to answer interrogatories . A paper was read by Mr. Lawless , or , as the evidence states , by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article signed " A Citizen , " is , in a spirit of contradiction , re-asserted in the face of the decision of the court then made . See report of committee , pp. 46 and 47 . Why , if no disrespect , no contempt , was intended , did not Mr. Lawless avail himself of the opportunity to declare this in the form which the law prescribes ? The opportunity was fairly opened to him by the tender of interrogatories , but his refusal to answer them was flat and peremptory . Among the questions propounded to Mr. Lawless , while before the committee , there is the following one : " Were you required by the court to make any apology or other atonement for the publication of the article signed ' A Citizen , ' before the order was made for your imprisonment , and for suspending you from the bar ? " Judge Peck has met with no elementary book , nor any adjudged case , which prescribes it to the court as a duty , to make any such overture to a party standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed by them was that which the court did pursue , of tendering interrogatories : and after Mr. Lawless had answered , in reply to this overture , that he did not wish to have them exhibited , and added , indignantly , that he would nut answer if they were exhibited , and read a written paper re-asserting the truth of the " Citizen , " and denying the jurisdiction of the court , any further overture , like that proposed in the question , would have been far more likely to produce a new insult to the court than to propitiate the offender . Had the contempt consisted of a hasty or unguarded expression , a recantation , in the presence of the court , might have been received as an atonement with propriety . But where the contempt consisted in the misrepresentation of the decisions of the court through the medium of the public prints , with intent to bring the court into contempt ; and consisted , also , in an attempt to influence the public in relation to causes depending before the court , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration of justice that there should be an example made . It would have been indefensible on the part of the court , if it had viewed the offence merely in the light of a personal affair , and capable of being atoned for by an acknowledgement of error without the solemnity of an oath . With respect to the imprisonment of Mr. Lawless in the criminal 's apartment of the gaol , the sentence of the court was general , that he should be imprisoned for the particular period . It did not occur to the court that there were different apartments in the gaol , nor was there any suggestion made in relation to that subject . The sentence would have been complied with by putting him in the debtors ' apartment . Had he requested to be put there , there is no question but that his request would have been complied with . He shows that , at his request , he was immediately taken into another room . In page 35 of the report , it is said , in the testimony of Mr. Lawless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , at the expiration of the term of his suspension , the Judge inquired particularly of the clerk , if the time had expired ? " /q/ The House will see how improbable this evidence is , when they reflect that the order of suspense was in the Special Court , held at St. Louis , under the act of 26th May , 1824 , for the trial of land causes ; the records of which court would remain at St. Louis , and had no connexion with the records of the District Court held at Jefferson City . Yet , in page 36 of the report , Mr. Lawless states , that , alter his suspension , he first re-appeared in court at Jefferson City . This is adverted to , because it appeared to be the object of the testimony to show a disposition on the part of the court to enforce , rigorously , against Mr. Lawless , its sentence . Upon the whole , Judge Peck declares that , in this proceeding , he was actuated by a sense of official duty . He considered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court over which he had been appointed to preside ; he considered it due to the government which he represented  --  due to the tribunal , and due to the suitors whose rights were committed to its protection , to punish this contempt as he did punish it . He did consider himself , and does still consider himself , as sustained , at every step , by the highest authority . He believed it , conscientiously , to be his solemn and imperious duty to make the example which he did make , more especially in relation to the " country in which he holds his courts , and the nature of the claims which he was called upon to adjudicate , and which had produced this agitation . If , in so doing , he has erred , he has erred in company with judicial characters with whom any judge may be proud to associate ; and he has yet to learn that such an error would be a high misdemeanor in the sense of the Constitution of the United States . Judge Peck is perfectly aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , not at all surprised at the pertinacity with which it has been sought for the last four years . Whether these purposes are such as the interests of the United States call upon them to countenance by ordering further proceedings in this case , is a question for others , not for Judge Peck . Confident he is , that , if he had been made of more pliant materials , and could have reconciled it to himself to consult his repose rather than his sense of duty , the House would not have been troubled with this inquiry . /z/ Washington , April 13 , 1830 . The case having thus been fully brought before the House of Representatives , that body , on the 21st of April , went into a Committee of the whole House on the State of the Union , Mr. Martin of South Carolina in the chair , and took up the memorial of Mr. Lawless , the report of the Judiciary Committee , and the foregoing explanation by the Judge . An animated debate arose . Mr. Buchanan , chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than an hour , in explanation and support of the committee 's report . Mr. Clay of Alabama spoke in reply , strenuously opposing the resolution to impeach , and defending the conduct of the Judge . Mr. Spencer of New York rejoined , and advocated the propriety of an impeachment . The committee then rose ; the debate was resumed on the following day ; when a motion to postpone all the other orders of the day , in order to give an opportunity for the discussion , occasioned a warm contest , in which Messrs . Whittlesey , Burges , WicklifFe , Spencer , Wayne , Storrs and Ellsworth took part . The motion prevailed ; the orders were postponed : and the House again went into Committee of the Whole , Mr. Wilde of Georgia in the chair . Mr. Pettis of Missouri now took the floor , and continued to occupy it in a speech of more than three hours , warmly defending the conduct of Judge Peck , and earnestly opposing the proposal to impeach him . Mr. Everett of Massachusetts , though not holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed so far as to impeach , and he concluded a short speech in remonstrance , by offering a resolution , declaring , that the House /z/ disapproved the conduct of Judge Peck , but that there was not sufficient evidence before it to justify his impeachment for a high misdemeanor in office . Mr. Storrs of New York opposed the adoption of the resolution , because it went to recommend a final action by the House upon the subject ; when , in his opinion , it ought to be fully investigated before the competent tribunal . He was replied to by Mr. Bulges of Rhode Island , who proposed a modification of Mr. Everett 's resolution , which somewhat softened its terms ; declaring , that " although the House might not , if called upon , altogether approve the conduct of Jud " -e Peck , yet , that perceiving no evidence of ill intent on his part , it would not sanction the impeachment . " He afterwards , however , withdrew this , and Mr. Everett slightly changed the form of his resolution , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellsworth of Connecticut then addressed the committee at length in support of the resolution for impeachment reported by the Judiciary Committee ( of which he was a member ) ; and was followed by his colleague , Mr. Huntington of Connecticut , who spoke with warmth on the opposite side of the question . The debate was continued till seven o'clock in the evening , when a motion to rise was carried by a majority of two votes only . On the following day , Mr. Bulges spoke at length , in defence of the Judge , and against the motion to impeach . Having concluded an animated speech of more than two hours , he was replied to by Mr. Wickliffe , another member of the Judicial Committee ; whereupon the question was put on Mr. Everett 's amendment , which was rejected , and the resolution for the impeachment was carried , ayes 113 .

So the Home risolved thai the Impeachment should be preferred . Ordered , that Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Storrs of New York be a commitee to go to the Senate , and , at the bar thereof , in the name of the House of Representatives , and of all the people of the United States , to impeach James H. Peck , Judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Missouri , of high misdemeanors in office ; and acquaint the Senate , that the House of Representatives will , in due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make good the same . Ordered , that the committee do demand that the Senate take order for the appearance of the said James H. Peck , to answer to said impeachment . On motion of Mr. Storrs , a committee was appointed to prepare and report articles of impeachment . It , consisted of Mr. Buchanan , Mr. Storrs , Mr. McDuffie , Mr. Spencer of New York , and Mr. WicklifTe . On the 26th of April , Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Storrs appeared at the bar of the Senate , and complied with the order of their appointment , when , on motion of Mr. Tazewell , their message was referred to a committee of three members of the Senate : Messrs . Tazewell , Webster and Bell were appointed the committee : but before the ballot for their appointment was taken , Mr. Benton of Missouri was , at his own request , excused from voting . On the 27th , Mr. Tazewell , from the select committee , made the following report : Whereas , the House of Representatives , on the 26th of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buchanan and Storrs of New York , at the bar of the Senate impeached James H.

Peck to answer the said impeachment ; therefore , Resolved , that the Senate will take proper order thereon ; of which due notice shall be given to the House of Representatives . And the committee further recommend to the Senate that the secretary of the Senate be directed to notify the House of Representatives of the foregoing resolution . The Senate concurred , and the notice was given accordingly . On the day following , the Vice President communicated to the Senate two letters from Judge Peck , notifying that body of his intention of going to Baltimore , where he should remain some days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senate Chamber preparatory to his impeachment , a seat might be assigned him by which he might avoid facing the windows , on account of the weak state of his eyes . The letters were read , and laid on the table . On the 29th , Mr. Buchanan reported the form of the article of impeachment : which was considered on the 1st of May in Committee of the Whole , and reported with amendments , which were agreed to by the House , and the article in its amended form was then adopted . See it hereafter . On motion of Mr. Buchanan , it was Resolved , that five managers be appointed by ballot , to conduct the impeachment on the part of the House . The House accordingly proceeded to ballot , when the following gentlemen were chosen , viz : James Buchanan , of Pennsylvania ; Henry R. Storrs , of New York ; George McDuffie , of S. Carolina ; Ambrose Spencer , of New York ; and , at a subsequent ballot , Charles A. Wickliffe , of Kentucky . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Senate by the managers : and that a message be sent to the Senate informing them that managers had been appointed and directed to cany the article of impeachment to the Senate . The message having been delivered in that body by the clerk of the House , On motion of Mr Tazewell , it was Resolved , that , at twelve o'clock tomorrow , the Senate will resolve itself into a court of impeachment : at which time the following oath or affirmation shall be administered by the Secretary to the President of the Senate , and by him to each member of the Senate , viz : " I solemnly swear ( or affirm , as the case may be ) that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of James H.

Peck , Judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Missouri , pursuant to notice given to the Senate this day by the House of Representatives that they had appointed managers for the purpose aforesaid . Ordered , that the secretary lay this resolution before the House of Representatives . On motion of Mr. Tazewell , Resolved , that after the managers of the impeachment shall be introduced to the bar of the Senate , and shall have signified that they are ready to exhibit articles of impeachment against James H. Peck , the President of the Senate shall direct the serjeant at arms to make proclamation ; who shall , after making proclamation , repeat the following words : " All persons are commanded to keep silence , on pain of imprisonment , while the Grand Inquest of the nation is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States Articles of Impeachment against James H. Peck , Judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Missouri : " after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the Senate will take proper order on the subject of the impeachment , of which due notice shall be given to the House of Representatives . /z/ The United States vs James H. Peck . Tuesday , May 4 , 1830 . On motion of Mr Tazewell , The Senate resolved itself into a High Court of Impeachment : and the Secretary admiministered the oath prescribed by the resolution of yesterday to the Vice President ; who then administered the same oath to the following /q/ Senators , viz. Messrs . Adams , Barnard , Barton , Bell , Bibb , Brown , Burnet ' Chase , Clayton , Dickerson , Dudley , Ellis , Foot , Forsyth , FreJinghuvsen ' Grundy , Havne , Hendricks , Holmes , Iredell , Johnston , Kane , Kinov Knight ' Livingston , McKinley , McLean , Marks , Naudain , Noble , R ibbins , Rowan Buggies , Sanford , Seymour , Silsbee , Smith of S. C , Sprague , Tazewell , Troup , Tyler , Webster , White , Willey , Woodbury . The managers on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storrs of New York , McDuffie , Spencer and Wickliffe , appeared and were admitted : and VI r Buchanan their chairman having announced that they were the managers instructed by the House of Representatives to exhibit a certain article of impeachment against James H. Peck , Judge of the District Court of the United States l'orthe District of Missouri , They were requested by the Vice President to take seats assigned them within the bar ; and the Serjeant at arms was directed to make proclamation , which he did in the words heretofore prescribed . After which the managers rose , and Mr. Buchanan , their chairman , read the article of impeachment , as follows : /z/ Exhibited by the House of Representatives of the United States , in the name of themselves , and of all the People of the United States , against James H. Peck Judge of the District Court of the United Stales for the District of Missouri , in maintenance and support of their impeachment against him for high misdemeanors in office . /z/ That the said James II . Peck , Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District of Missouri , at a term of the said court , holden at St. Louis , ih the State of Missouri , on the fourth Monday in December , one thousand eight hundred and twentyfive , did , under and by virtue of the power and authority vested in the said court , by the act of the Congress of the United States , entilled " An act enabling the claimants to lands within the limits of the State of Missouri and Territory of Arkansas to institute proceedings to try the validity of their claims , " approved on the twenty-sixth day of May , one thousand eight hundred and twentyfour , render a final decree of the said court in favor of the United States , and against the validity of the claim of the petitioners , in a certain matter or cause depending in the said court , under the said act , and before that time prosecuted in the said court , before the said Judge , by Julie Soulard , widow of Antoine Soulard , and James G. Soulard , Henry G. Soulard , Eliza Soulard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of the said Antoine Soulard , petitioners , against the United States , praying for the confirmation of their claim , under the said act , to certain lands situated in the said State of Missouri ; and the said court did thereafter , on the thirtieth day of December , in the said year , adjourn to sit again on the third Monday in April , one thousand eight hundred and twentysix . And the said petitioners did , at the same December term of the said court , holden by and before the said James H. Peck , Judge as aforesaid , in due form of law , under the said act , appeal against the United States , from the judgment and decree so made and entered in the said matter , to the Supreme Court of the United States ; of which appeal so made and taken in the said District Court , the said James H. Peck , Judge of the said court , had then and there full notice . And the said James H. Peck , after the said matter or cause had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , and on or about the thirtieth day of March , one thousand eight hundred and twentysix , did cause to be published in a certain public newspaper , printed at the city of St. Louis , called " The Missouri Republican , " a certain communication prepared by the said James H. Peck , purporting to be the opinion of the said James H. /z/ Peck as Jude of the said court , in the matter or cause aforesaid , and purportin " - to set forth the reasons of the said James H. Peck , as such judge , for the said decree and that Luke Edward Lawless , a citizen of the United States , and an attorney and counsellor at law in the said District Court , and who had been of counsel for the petitioners in the said court in the matter aforesaid , did , thereafter , and on or about the eighth day of April , one thousand eight hundred and twentvsix , cause to be published in a certain other newspaper , printed at the city of St. Louis , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain article signed kl A Citizen , " and purporting to contain an exposition of certain errors of doctrine and fact alleged to be contained in the opinion of the said James H. Peck , as before that time so published ; which publication by the said Luke Edward Lawless , was to the effect following , viz : " To the Editor : Sir : 1 have read , with the attention which the subject deserves , the opinion of Judge Peck on the claim of the widow and heirs of Antoine Soulard , published in the Republican of the 30th ultimo . I observe that , although the Judge has thought proper to decide against the claim , he leaves the ground of his decree open for further discussion . Availing myself , therefore , of this permission , and considering the opinion so published , to be a fair subject of examination to every citizen who feels himself interested in , or aggrieved by its operation , I beg leave to point the attention of the public to some of the principal errors , which I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall confine myself to little more than an enumeration of those errors , without entering - into any demonstration or developed reasoning on the subject . This would require more space than a newspaper allows , and besides , is not ( as regards most of the points ) absolutely necessary . Judge Peck , in this opinion , seems to me to have erred in the following assumptions , as well of fact as of doctrine : 1st . That , by the ordinance 1754 , a sub-delegate was prohibited from making a grant in consideration of services rendered or to be rendered . 2d . That a sub-delegate in Louisiana was not a sub-delegate as contemplated by the above ordinance. 3d . That O'Reilly 's regulations , made in February , 1770 , can be considered as demonstrative of the extent of the granting power of either the Governor General or the sub-delegates under the royal order of August , /z/ 4th . That the royal order of August , 1770 , ( as recited or referred to in the preamble to the regulations of Morales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor General . 5th . ' I hat the word ' mercedes , ' in the ordinance of 1754 , which in the Spanish language means ' gifts , ' can be narrowed by anything in that ordinance or in any other law , to the idea of a grant to an Indian , or a reward to an informer , and much less to a mere sale for money . 6th. ' 1 hat O'Reilly 's regulations were in their terms applicable , or ever were , in fact , applied to , or published in , Upper Louisiana . 7th . That the regulations of O'Reilly have any bearing on the grant to Antoine Soulard , or that such a grant was contemplated by them . 8th . That the limitation , to a square league of grants to new settlers in Opelousas , Attakapas and Natchitoches , ( in 8th article of O'Reilly 's regulations ) prohibits a larger grant in Upper Louisiana . 9th . That the regulations of the Governor General , Gayoso , dated 9th September , 1797 , entitled ' Instructions to be observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in future , a grant for services , or have the effect of annulling that to Antoine Soulard , which was made in 1796 , and not located or surveyed until February , 1804. /q/ 10th . That the complete titles made by Gayoso are not to be referred to ag affording the construction made by Gayoso himself of his own regulations . 1 1th . That , although the regulations of Morales were not promulgated as law in Upper Louisiana , the grantee in the principal case was bound by them , inasmuch as he had notice , or must be presumed , ' from the official station which he held , ' to have had notice , of their terms . 1-th . That the regulations of Morales ' exclude all belief that any law existed under which a confirmation of the title in question could have been claimed . ' 13th . That the complete titles , ( produced to the court ) made by the Governor General or the Intendant General , though based on incomplete titles not conformable to the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the Lieutenant Governor , from whom these incomplete titles emanated , and must be considered as anomalous exercises of power in favor of individual grantees. 14th . That the language of Morales himself , in the complete titles issued by him , on concessions made by the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana , anterior to the date of his regulations , ought not to be referred to as furnishing the construction which he , Morales , put on his own regulations . 15th . That the uniform practice of the sub-delegates or Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana , from the first establishment of that province to the 10th March , 1804 , is to be disregarded as proof of law , usage , or custom , therein . 16th . That the historical fact , that nineteen twentieths of the titles to lands in Upper Louisiana were not only incomplete , but not conformable to the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , or Morales , at the date of the cession to the United States , affords no inference in favor of the general legality of those titles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether floating or located , were , previous to the cession , treated and considered by the government and population of Louisiana as property , saleable , transferable , and the subject of inheritance and distribution ab intestato , furnishes no inference in favor of those titles , or to their claim to the protection of the treaty of cession or of the law of nations . 18th . That the laws of Congress heretofore passed in favor of incomplete titles , furnish no argument or protecting principle in favor of those titles of a precisely similar character which remain unconfirmed . In addition to the above , a number of other errors , consequential on those indicated , might be stated . The Judge 's doctrine as to the forfeiture , which he contends is inflicted by Morales ' regulations , seems to me to be peculiarly pregnant with grievous consequences . I shall , however , not tire the reader with any further enumeration , and shall detain him , only to observe , by way of conclusion , that the Judge 's recollection of the argument of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , differs materially from what I can remember , who also heard it . Injustice to the counsel , I beg to observe , that all that I have now submitted to the public , has been suggested by that argument as spoken , and by the printed report of it , which is even now before me. /z/ And the said James H. Peck , Judge as aforesaid , unmindful of the solemn duties of his station , and that he held the same , by the Constitution of the United States , during good behavior only , with intention wrongfully and unjustly to oppress , imprison , and otherwise injure the said Luke Edward Lawless , under color of law , did , thereafter , at a term of the said District Court of the United States for the District of Missouri , begun and held at the city of St. Louis , in the State of Missouri , on the third Monday in April , one thousand eight hundred and tvventysix , arbitrarily , oppressively , and unjustly , and under color and pretence that the said Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said publication , signed " A Citizen , " as for a contempt there- /z/ of , institute , in the said court , before him , the said James H.

Peck , Judge as aforesaid , thereupon suspended from practising as such attorney or counsellor in the said court , for the period aforesaid , and immediately committed to the common prison in the said city of St. Louis , to the great disparagement of public justice , the abuse of judicial authority , and to the subversion of the liberties of the people of the United States .

The Vice President then informed the managers that the Senate would take proper order on the subject of the impeachment ; of which due notice should be given to the House of Representatives .

On motion of Mr. Tazewell , the court then adjourned to 12 o'clock on Tuesday next . /q/ /z/ The United States vs . James H. Peck . Tuesday , May 11 , 1830 . The Vice President administered the oath prescribed to Mr. Smith , of Maryland , and Mr. Chambers . The court was then opened by proclamation . The return of the serjeant at arms of the summons issued to James H.

The Secretary then administered the following oath to the serjeant at arms : " You , Mountjoy Bayly , Serjeant at Arms of the Senate of the United States , do swear that the return made and subscribed by you upon the process issued on the 4th day of May instant by the Senate of the United States against James H. Peck , Judge , &c.; is truly made , and that you have performed said services as therein described  --  So help you God . " Proclamation was then made as follows : " O yes ! O yes ! O yes ! James H. Peck , Judge of the District Court of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article of impeachment exhibited against you by the House of Representatives of the United States . " Whereupon James H. Peck appeared at the bar , attended by William Wirt as his counsel , and by whom he submitted the following application : Mr. President , I appear in obedience to a summons from this honorable Court , to answer an article of impeachment exhibited against me by the honorable the House of Representatives of the United States . The summons , in which the article of impeachment was embodied , was served on me in the city of Baltimore on Thursday last . Three juridical days only have elapsed since that period , one of which has been partly employed in travelling to this city ; and owing to my own ill health and the professional engagements of the counsel selected for my defence , the time has been wholly inadequate to the preparation of such an answer and plea , as the nature of the case requires . Although the article of impeachment against me be a single one , yet the legal justification of my conduct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular answer explanatory of the transaction on which I am accused , and of the principles of law on which I acted , should be placed on the files of this honorable Court . The publication which was adjudged and punished as a contempt became such by the manner in which it misrepresented , distorted and discolored the opinion which it professed to censure : to the public scandal and contempt of the court which had pronounced that opinion , and to the prejudice of other causes of the same character and resting on the . same principles , which were still pending in court and waiting for decision . To show that such was the character and such the tendency of the publication , ' that it was , therefore , in law , a contempt of court , that in proceeding to punish it as such , the court was supported and /z/ justified by the highest authority , and did not act unjustly , arbitrarily and oppressively toward the party who stood convicted of the publication , but was influenced solely by a concientious sense of public duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In desiring to present the whole case fully and intelligibly to this honorable Court , in the form of an answer , instead of resting on the general plea of Not Guiltv , I am sustained by the precedent set by this honorable Court on a former occasion . Indeed , it seems due to this honorable Court , and to the honorable House of Representatives , as well as to myself , that the facts and principles which constitute my defence should be fully , clearly and distinctly set forth in my answer , in order that both my accusers and judges may be in full possession of the grounds on which I respectfully but confidently believe that my conduct will find its entire vindication . I ask only time to prepare this answer with that care and consideration which are due to this high and honorable Court , to the solemnity of the occasion , and to the deep interest , in point of reputation rather than of office , which I have in the result . In preparing this answer , it will be indispensably necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be employed in drawing it , with a view to the correct exhibition of the facts which are to enter into that answer ; and I submit it with great respect to this honorable Court , that to the accurate and just accomplishment of an object , on which I have so much at stake , I ask nothing unreasonable , when I request that I may be allowed until the 2oth day of the present month for the purpose of filing my answer and plea . It is equally indispensable to my defence that I should have witnesses from the State of Missouri , which was the scene of the transaction in question , and that I should have certified copies of records from the courts for the trial of land claims in that State . Some of these witnesses are named in the affidavit , hereto annexed : but I confidently believe that there are others in that State who will be found equally material , if an opportunity shall be allowed me to go out and collect them . This honorable Court will be pleased to observe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years ago . The efforts which had been made from the year 1826 , down to the present time , to raise an impeachment on that ground , were known to have failed ; and not expecting that the effort could ever succeed , I have not been careful to inquire or to reflect who might or might not be important to me as witnesses , in the apparently improbable event of an impeachment . I therefore deem it indispensable to the justice of the case , that after I shall have filed my answer and plea , an opportunity should be allowed me to go to Missouri , and collect my witnesses , and to select from the records of land claims in that State , the cases which bear immediately upon the question before this honorable Court , with the view of obtaining authenticated transcripts to be exhibited on the trial . I am aware that some time will be required to accomplish these objects ; but justice requires that they should be accomplished . I ask only a fair trial and that I may not be condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearing should be forced , and a condemnation should follow , before a reasonable opportunity shall be allowed me to collect the proofs essential to my defence . I have no desire to delay or to avoid this trial . On the contrary , since it has assumed so serious a form , my sincere desire is to meet it with as little delay as possible . The distance from this place to Missouri , and the time which will probably be necessary to collect the proofs which have been indicated and to bring them to this city , can be as well estimated by the honorable Court as by myself . I will barely observe that the marshal of the State to whom it is understood that subpoenas for the witnesses are to be addressed , is believed to reside at the distance of seventy miles from St. Louis ; that there is not an entire certainty of finding all the witnesses at home ; that if found , they will probably require some days to arrange their business and domestic concerns , before they can safely set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six or eight weeks from home ; that they are liable to detention by casualties /q/ on the way ; and that some time will be necessary to procure the transcripts of records which will be essential to my defence . It is believed that between fifty and sixty days , from the dates of the subpoenas , were found , in practice , to be necessary to convene before the Judiciary Committee of the honorable House of Representatives , witnesses from the same State in support of the charge which forms the ground of the impeachment . With these data before the honorable Court , it is submitted that from fifty to sixty days from the time of filing my answer and plea , and the award of process which I am to carry and cause to be served in Missouri , will not be an unreasonable allowance of time to place me in a condition to meet a full and fair trial of the impeachment on its merits . I ask only the time which this honorable Court shall deem reasonable for the accomplishment of these purposes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as to afford a fair probability , a reasonable certainty of commanding at this city , the use of that testimony which the purposes of justice require ; and that I may be saved from the humiliation of moving a farther continuance on the ground of the unavoidable absence of material testimony . The motions which I respectfully submit are , First , That a reasonable time may be allowed me to prepare my answer and plea ; and for this purpose I ask until the 25th day t ) f the present month . Second , That after my answer and plea shall be filed , process for witnesses may be awarded to me , and a reasonable time may be allowed to collect my witnesses and proofs from the State of Missouri .

James II . Peck . Tuesday , May 25 , 1 830 . The court having been opened by proclamation , on motion of Mr. Webster , Ordered , that the Secretary give notice to the House of Representatives that the Senate are now in their chamber , and are ready to proceed on the trial of the impeachment of James H. Peck , Judge , &c.; ; and that seats are provided for the accommodation of the members of the House of Representatives . The message being sent to the House , that body resolved itself into a Committee of the whole House , Mr. Martin in the chair , and proceeded to the Senate chamber , where they occupied the seats which had been prepared forthem . The managers of the impeachment having taken the places assigned them , James H. Peck , being called to make answer to the article of impeachment exhibited against him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wirt , and Jonathan Meredith , as his counsel ; and having been asked by the Vice President whether he was prepared to answer the said article ? he replied in the affirmative , and requested that his answer might be read by his counsel . The Vice President then asked him whether the answer he desired to be read by his counsel was his final answer on which he intended to rely ? He replied in the affirmative . The Vice President then directed the counsel to read the answer , and it was accordingly read by Mr. Meredith , in the words following : /z/ To the Article of Impeachment exhibited against him by the Honorable House of Representatives of the United States . The said James H. Peck , saving to himself all exceptions whatsoever to the said article , and the charges therein contained , answers and says : That it is true that this respondent did , in his character of Judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Missouri , at the December term of 1825 , render a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the representatives of Antoine Soulard , for 10,000 arpents of land . It is true , also , that an appeal was then and there taken , by the petitioners , from that decree , to the Supreme Court of the United States . This respondent further states , that the decree rested on the ground that the inchoate title on which the petitioners relied had not proceeded from an officer who was authorized to originate the same , so as to bind the Spanish Government to confirmation ; and hence , that whatever the United States , in their sovereign capacity , might be authorized to do with such a claim , it was not such a one as a mere judiciary , acting on the principles of established law , was authorized to confirm , under the act of Congress which had given the court jurisdiction over the subject . The reasons for the opinion had been assigned in cxtenso at the time of its delivery , though they were not then reduced to writing . But , as the case of Soulard was the first argued and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to be brought before the court , the bar was naturally desirous of being put in possession of the grounds of the opinion in a form more precise and permanent than their recollection of it as it had been delivered , ore tcnus , from the bench ; and , with this view , several of them requested /z/ that it might be published at length . And it is true , that , after the appeal had been taken , and after the adjournment of the court at which the final decree had been rendered , to wit , on or about the 30th day of March , the respondent , in compliance with that request , did cause his opinion to be published in a certain public newspaper , printed at the city of St. Louis , called the Missouri Republican ; the opinion so published being in substance and effect the same which had been delivered on the bench . The respondent had observed that such publications had been usual in the United States as well as in England ; and he saw no impropriety in yielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there seemed to be a peculiar propriety in this case in yielding to it  --  1 . Because , as the opinion had proceeded exclusively on grounds which had not been fuily argued at the bar , and as the branch of law on which these claims necessarily rested was new both to the bench and the bar , the court was disposed to permit those grounds to be re-argued in the next case which might be presented for decision , and which rested on the same grounds ; and , with this view , it was proper that these grounds should be opened to the deliberate consideration of the counsel who might be disposed to re-argue them . If the counsel and their clients should become convinced , by the reasoning of the court , that the grounds of the decision could not be shaken , it might save to the parties , as well as to their counsel , much expense and trouble in the presentation of other claims , resting solely on those grounds ; and , with this view , also , the respondent deemed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration both of the claimants and their counsel . 3 . It might happen that there might be other cases , with relation to which facts might exist , that would enable the parties to take them out of the operation of these principles ; and the publication of the opinion would apprize them of the necessity of that measure , and give them the opportunity of so shaping thencases as to avoid the operation of those principles . 4 . The respondent was justly desirous that the claimants themselves , as well as their counsel , should see and know that these principles , which were understood to involve the fate of many other claims , had not been hastily and inconsiderately assumed by the court ; but that they had been carefully and laboriously examined , weighed , and considered , and that the court had been constrained to come to its conclusion , by the force of evidence and of arguments which it could not conscientiously resist . While all these considerations conspired so strongly to recommend the publication of the opinion , and the measure was justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and in England , the court perceived no inconvenience which could possibly How from it . No damage to the land claimants could result from the publication of the opinion , which might not result in an equal , and , perhaps , superior degree , from the publication of the mere fact that the court had decided against the claim . On the contrary , the statement in the papers , of the general fact that the court had decided against the claim , was susceptible of being misconstrued as a decision against the whole mass of the Spanish claims at large ; whereas the published opinion would show that the decision affected no other claims than those which rested on the precise and single ground on which Soulard 's claim had been decided . With regard to prejudicing the public mind against the claims by the publication of the opinion , it would be a new thing to apply this principle to the publication of a judicial decision ; and , again , what greater prejudice could be thus excited than by the publication of the single fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It can not be supposed that the decision of the Supreme Court on the appeal could be affected by the publication of the Judge 's reasoning , except so Jar as that reasoning was solid , and thus far it would be a proper effect ; and there /q/ could be no doubt that the Attorney General of the United States would urge in support of a judgment of affirmance in that case , all ! he topics , and probably more and stronger ones , than those which had been urged by the Judge of the District Court . This respondent has been thus particular in setting forth the reasons by which he was induced to yield to the request to publish his opinion ; because the article of impeachment exhibited against him seems to imply that the honorable House of Representatives deemed that publication unlawful or improper ; or that i t considered that publication as inviting or justifying the publication signed " A Citizen , " which is set forth in the article of impeachment . It is true also that , alter the opinion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Missouri Republican , " to wit : on or about the eighth day of April , 18JG , the said Luke E. Lawless did cause to be published , in a certain other public newspaper printed at the city of St. Louis , called " The Missouri Advocate and St. Louis Enquirer , " a certain article signed " A Citizen , " which is set forth at large in the article of impeachment . It is true , also , that this respondent , considering this last publication as a contempt of the court , did , in his judicial character , in the honest and conscientious discharge of what he deemed his official duty , proceed to punish it as such in the manner which will be hereafter set forth . He did consider that publication as a contempt , for the following reasons : 1 . Because it misrepresented the opinion of the court which it professed to censure , in a manner calculated to destroy the public confidence in the integrity or intelligence of the tribunal , and to bring the court into disrepute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made by a person who was attorney and counsel in the cause , and who must therefore be presumed to have known and understood the opinion of the court , the respondent did believe , and was justified in believing , that those misrepresentations were wilfully , wantonly , and maliciously made . 2 . Because , before , and at the time of the said publication , there were other claims for lands still pending and undecided , in which the said Luke E. Lawless , and others , were of counsel for the petitioners , which other claims were of the same character , and rested for their decision on the same general principles on which the case of Antoine Soulard 's representatives had been decided by the court ; and the immediate tendency and object of the publication were to prejudice the public mind with regard to these claims ; to excite the resentment and hostility of the numerous and influential body of land claimants in Missouri , and their connexions , against the Judge , who alone composed the court ; to destroy the public confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence and restrain the court , in the free and independent exercise of its judgment , with regard to these remaining claims , and thus to disturb and interrupt the due and regular administration of justice . For these reasons , the respondent did consider and adjudge the said publication to be a contempt of the court ; and did believe , and does still believe , that he was justified by the constitution and the laws of the land in so considering and adjudging it , and in punishing it as a contempt by the summary process of attachment , in the manner in which it was punished . In addition to which , it may be observed that the suit to which the publication related was still pending on appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States , and was liable to be remanded again to the District Court for farther proceedings . The respondent respectfully presumes that the questions presented by the impeachment for the consideration and decision of this honorable Court , are these : I. Was the publication , signed " A Citizen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a contempt , was it punishable by the summary process of attachment in the manner in which it was punished ? /z/ III . If the court erred in adjudging and punishing it as a contempt , was it an innocent error of judgment on the part of the c urt , or was it a high misdemeanor , because wilfully and knowingly done in violation of law , and with the intention imputed by the article of impeachment , to wit : wrongfully , arbitrarily , and unjustly , to oppress , imprison , and otherwise injure , the said Luke E. Lawless , under color of law ? This respondent presumes that it is only by making good the affirmative of the last proposition , that the impeachment against him can be sustained . He humblv , but confidently trusts that , at the proper time , he will be able to satisfy the honorable Court not only that this affirmative is untrue , but that all and singular the things which he has judicially done in the premises were dictated by the purest sense of official duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of the land ; and were free from all feelings , designs , and intention , on his part , wrongfully , arbitrarily , and unjustly , to oppress , imprison , or otherwise to injure the said Luke E. Lawless , under color of law . In the proper order of this answer , the first and great inquiry is , whether the publication signed " A Citizen , " was a contempt of court ? The grounds on which the court held it a contempt , have been already distinctly stated : and the principal purpose of this answer is to show that these grounds have been correctly taken , in point of fact . The publication was a misrepresentation of the opinion of the court , tending to destroy the respect and confidence of the community in the tribunal and to bring that tribunal into open and public-contempt and scandal . The only difficulty which this respondent experiences in establishing the truth of this proposition , arises from the novel character of the controversy in which the opinion was pronounced . It will be impossible to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself shall be thoroughly understood ; and the opinion can not be so understood without a familiar acquaintance with the peculiar character of the controversy out of which it grew . In the country in which the publication took place , and in which it was intended to operate , the controversy was understood ; and therefore the absurdities which that publication imputed to the court were immediately perceived and felt , and produced their intended effect on all who took their impressions only from that article . To enable the honorable Court to estimate the effects of the publication on the people of Missouri to whom it was addressed , it is necessary that they should possess the same familiarity with the nature of the controversy , the questions involved in it , and the peculiar character of the laws by which it was to be decided . For this respondent is convinced , that , without this familiar acquaintance with the subject , no person who now , for the first time , reads the opinion hastily and superficially , and as hastily and superficially compares it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a reader will , on the contrary , be apt to suppose that there is resemblance enough between the argumentative conclusions drawn by the Judge in his opinion , and the assumptions imputed to him by the publication , to authorize the belief that the Judge must have acted vindictively in treating it as a misrepresentation and punishing it as a contempt . It is in this that the art and mischief of the publication consist . This honorable Court must have observed , in the course of their experience , that the soundest conclusion which a logician can draw , may be rendered ridiculous by suppressing the reasoning which led to it , and under the pretence of giving the result , by giving it in terms which distort it , without entirely extinguishing the resemblance . It is this species of caricature which pervades the whole of the article signed " A Citizen , " and it was from this character that its mischievous tendency and operation arose . But to render this truth palpable to this honorable Court , it is indispensably necessary that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publication under those strong lights which can be /q/ furnished only by a familiar acquaintance with the subject-matter of the controversy . This will give trouble . But this honorable Court is sitting in the last resort on a case most deeply affecting this respondent ; and he feels the cheering confidence that the cause will now be mastered before it shall be decided . To produce this effect , this respondent finds it necessary to begin by apprising this honorable Court that Soulard 's case was one of those which srew out of the cession of Louisiana to the United States , in 1803 . Bv the third article of the treaty of cession , the United States stipulated that the inhabitants of the ceded territory should be protected in their property . Louisiana belonged originally to France , had been ceded to Spain in 1762 , though possession was not taken by this latter power until 1769 . In 1800 it had been re-ceded to France , though the possession was retained by Spain until , and even after the cessionof France to the United States , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the last cession , that there existed various private claims to land in that province , both by French and Spanish subjects , and that these claims were of various characters . Some of them were mere rights by settlement and occupancy without any title whatever derived from either of the preceding governments ; others , mere permissions to settle , which had never been surveyed ; others , floating concessions for a given quantity of arpents , without any description of place , which had also never been surveyed ; some of them were concessions by officers who had no right to make them ; others , concessions surveyed , but which had not been carried into grant ; and others complete and final grants . It became important to ascertain what portion of these claims were valid , and what spurious . This was necessary as well to enable the United States to keep its faith in protecting the inhabitants of the ceded territory in their property , as to ascertain what portion of the domain still belonged to the L nited States , and was subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these purposes , special officers were first appointed , and then Boards of Commissioners were organized to receive , adjudicate , and report upon these claims to Congress . The claimants were required to present their claims to these tribunals within a limited time , under pain of having them forever barred . The Commissioners were clothed with the most liberal powers of confirmation with regard to all fair claims of given descriptions ; but among these provisions there is one to which this respondent deems it important to call the attention of this honorable Court , as marking the sense of Congress with regard to the class of characters by whom it was anticipated that those claims might be presented . The Commissioners were required to note specially , and to report to Congress , all forged and antedated claims . Through indulgence to the land claimants , the time limited by the original law for the presentation of their claims was opened again and again . The Boards of Commissioners were kept in operation for many years ; but when at last they were finally closed , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now pressed on the consideration of Congress with great importunitv . Under this pressure , Congress passed the act of the 26th May , 1824 , entitled " An act enabling the claimants to lands within the limits of the State of Missouri and Territory of Arkansas to institute proceedings to try the validity of their claims . " To two of the provisions of this act , it is important to invite the attention of this honorable Court . By the first section of the law , the persons authorized to appeal to the jurisdiction of the court were the holders of grants , &c.; legally made , before the 10th March , 1804 , by the proper authorities . By the second section , the court were required , in all cases to refer , in their decree , to the treaty , law , or ordinance , under which the claim teas confirmed or decreed against . These provisfons clearly indicated an apprehension on the part of Congress , /z/ tha f ' laims might be presented on titles not legally made by the proper authorities ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those solid grounds of treaty , law , or ordinance , which alone Congress meant to authorize the courts to regard as grounds of confirmation . The judges of these courts were thus required , by this act of Congress , to inform themselves of the several and respective powers of the officers employed by the preceding governments in granting the royal domain in Louisiana , and of* the various treaties , laws , and ordinances , under which confirmation could be demanded of the courts as matter of right : for the respondent did not consider himself as authorized by the act of Congress to administer any portion of the power of the United States , in their sovereign capacity , and , therefore , to confirm every claim which that sovereign , in the exercise of their free grace , might confirm . He considered such a power as not being communicable to the judiciary under the constitution of the United States ; this instrument limiting the judiciary to the exercise of judicial power merely . From the constitution of the court , therefore , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered himself required in every case to call upon the claimant to show the authority of the officer from whom he had derived his title , and to show also the specific treaty , law , or ordinance , by which the court was authorized , as a matter of right , to confirm the claim . The case of Soulard was this : Antoine Soulard claimed 10,000 arpents of land , under a concession alleged to have been made to him in 1796 , by Don Zenon Trudeau , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana , then called Illinois , and now Missouri . The concession was alleged to have been made for public services . The concession itself , and the petition on which it was founded , were not produced , they being stated by Soulard tn have been destroyed through mistake . The court was therefore left to collect from the evidence the particular character of the public services , in consideration of which the alleged concession was made ; and by this evidence , which was quite vague , it appeared that they were services in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was said he had theretofore received only the usual fees of office ; of Deputy Adjutant of that part of the province for a time , and of Informal Adviser or Assistant , or , as one of the witnesses termed it , the right arm of ike Lieutenant Governor . The questions pressed upon the consideration of the court in this case , by the act of Congress , were ; 1 . Whether Don Zenon Trudeau , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana , was authorized by the laws of Spain to make a concession of 10,000 arpents if land , for such services as these ? 2 . Whether there was any treaty , law , or ordinance , to which the court could refer in its decree , for a confirmation of the claim ? With regard to the laws of Spain , all that was known at the time of the decision , was this : 1 . That , from the epoch of the discovery by Columbus , the several kings of Spain , in succession , had , from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal domain in the newly discovered countries , which , long before the acquisition of Louisiana by Spain , had been collected and published in a general code , under the name of " Laws of the Indies : " to this collection belonged the royal order of 1754 , with which it is unavoidably necessary that this honorable Court should become better acquainted in the course of this answer . 2 . That when , in 1769 , Spain for the first time took possession of Louisiana , under Count O'Reilly , that officer , who had been appointed by special commission Governor and Captain General of the province , had , on the 18th February , 1770 , published at New Orleans a set . of rules for the express purpose of directing the mode of granting out the lands in Louisiana ; at the close of which regulations /q/ he " ordered and commanded the Governor , Judges , Cabildo , and all the inhabitants of the province , to perform punctually all that was required by these regulations . ' ' ' ' That , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had also published at New Orleans additional regulations , addressed to the same specific purpose of granting out the royal domain in that province . And , finally , that , on the 17th July , 1799 , the lntendant , Morales , to whom , in lieu of the Governor , the power of granting lands had been recently transferred , had published at New Orleans another set of regulations , directed to the same purpose , the granting of the royal lands , in which he recited those of O'Reilly and Gayoso as having furnished the basis of his own . So that here were two codes of Spanish law presented for the consideration of the court . 1 . The code called " the Laws of the Indies , " made for the government of the Spanish possessions prior to the acquisition of Louisiana . 2 . The code composed of the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , and Morales , made and published for the express purpose of regulating the grants of the royal lands in Louisiana . These two codes were fundamentally different in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising of a revenue by a sale of the lands . The code of the Spanish Governors , on the contrary , looked to a gift of the lands for the encouragement of population and agriculture , and the raising of stock ; and under the latter code the quantity of lands given was always proportioned by a fixed standard to the means of the settler ; that is , to the number of his laborers or the quantity of his stock . The two codes were entirely different , also , in the organization of the officers employed in originating and completing the titles Under the former , by virtue more particularly of the royal order of 1754 , the officer who originated the title was a sub-delegate Judge , appointed by the Vice Roys and Presidents of the Royal Audieneias , whose appointment was expressly required to be notified to the Secretary of State and universal despatch of the Indies ; and the sub-delegate , so appointed , had also express power to sub-delegate his commission to others . But , in Louisiana , there were neither Vice Roys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and armed with such power of sub-delegation . Under the royal order of 1754 , the officers authorized to confirm an incipient title were the Royal Audieneias . Under the code of regulations in Louisiana , the whole arrangement was radically different , and is thus briefly delineated in the 15th regulation of O'Reilly ; which was the regulation in force at the date of the alleged concession to Soulard by Trudeau , to wit , in 1790 : " 12 . All grants shall be made in the name of the king , by the Governor General of the Province ; who will , at the same time , appoint a Surveyor to fix the bounds thereof , both in front and depth , in presence of the Judge Ordinary of the District , and of two adjoining settlers , who shall be present at the survey . The above mentioned four persons shall sign the verbal process which shall be made thereof , and the Surveyor shall make three copies of the same ; one of which shall be deposited in the office of the Scrivener of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor General , and the third to the proprietor , to be annexed to the titles of his grant . " With two codes thus strikingly different in their policy , arrangements , and details , the question was , to which of them the court was to refer , in order to test the power of Don Zenon Trudeau , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana , to make to Soulard the concession in question ; that is to say , a concession of 10,000 arpents of land , as a reward for services of the peculiar character of those alleged by Soulard as the basis of his title . /z/ As preparatory to that exposition of the opinion which relates to this inquiry , and which is indispensably necessary to the understanding of the impeachment , this respondent annexes hereto , as part of his answer , the printed brief prepared for the Supreme Court of the United States on the trial of the appeal in Soulard 's case , which he understands and believes was admitted by the counsel for the appellant to give a full view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which printed brief is also appended the opinion of this respondent , as it was published in the Missouri Republican . This exhibit is marked A. This respondent prays the honorable Court to have reference , also , to so much of the two codes , to which he has already referred , as is believed to affect this investigation , to wit : 1 . " Spanish Regulations of Grants , " extracted from the " Laws of the Indies , " of which a translation will be found in the edition of the laws relating to public lands , printed by order of the House of Representatives in 1828  --  Appendix , pp. 966 to 977 , inclusive . This reference includes the royal regulation or order of October loth , 1754 , which has been so often mentioned , and which belongs to the 3 1st article of the Laws of the Indies . 2 . To the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , and Morales , to be found in the same Appendix , from page 978 to 986 , inclusive . On the argument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted that the power of the Lieutenant Governor , Trud-au , to make the concession in question , was to be tested by the first mentioned code , and especially by the royal order of 1754 , referred to in the His/ article of the Spanish Recopilacion . The counsel insisted , that , although these laws had been made prior to the acquisition of Louisiana , yet , that , having been made for the government , of the Indies , generally , , as soon as Louisiana became incorporated with the Spanish dominions , these laws introduced themselves into the newly acquired territory , propria vigore , and governed the grants of lands therein , as they had before governed those grants in other parts of the Spanish dominions . They insisted farther , that , if the Laws of the Indies ( including of course the royal order of 1754 ) did not introduce themselves , proprio vigore , into the newly acquired territory , but required some special act of the King or his representative to introduce them , that act had been furnished by the proclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana , by which , it was alleged , he had expressly introduced the Laws of the Indies . To these propositions the court could not assent , but held and decided  --  1 . That the Laws of the Indies did not introduce themselves proprio vigore , into Louisiana , immediately on the acquisition thereof , but that it rested with the new sovereign to say by what laws the grants of the royal domain there should be regulated . 2 . That , although Governor O'Reilly had , by his proclamation , declared the Laws of the Indies to be in force , to some extent , yet it could not be believed that he had intended to introduce such parts of that code as regulated the grants of land ; because he had , himself , on the 18th February , 1770 , introduced a new code , directed to the express purpose of legulating the grants of land in Louisiana ; which new code was radically and fundamentally different from the " Laws of the Indies , " in the very policy on which the two systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revenue by the sale , and the last , to the encouragement of population and settlement by a gift of the lands . 3 . In the orgamzation of the officers employed in granting or distributing the royal lands ; and , 4 . In the details under which titles to lands were , under these different systems , carried into complete grant , from their inception to their consummation . But admitting , for the sake of the argument , that the 81st article of the " Laws of the Indies , " that is , the royal order of 1754 , was in force in Louisiana , it remained for the claimants to show that , by force of that order , Trudeau , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana , was authorized to make the concession /q/ of 10,000 arpenls to Soulard , in reward for the peculiar services on which that concession was alleged to have been made . This the counsel for the claimant attempted to prove by the following propositions /z/ 1 . That Trudeau was a sub-delegate Judge in Upper Louisiana . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the power of this officer , under the royal order of 1754. 3 That , by this order , sub-delegate Judges were authorised to make gifts of lands to any extent and for any cause , at pleasure ; and , consequently , that he had the power to make the gilt in question as a reward for those services . To these propositions , also , the court could not assent : I. Because , if the royal order of 1754 was in force in Louisiana , proceeding as it did from the authority of the King , it could not be changed at the will of a Governor ; and hence , that , to clothe the sub-delegate Judges with the powers conferred by that ordinance , it was essentially necessary , 1 . That they should have been appointed in strict conformity with its provisions ; that is to say , that they should hare been appointed , as that order had expressly enjoined , by the Viceroys and Presidents of the Royal . Audiencias : 2 . That the appointment should have been reported to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , 3 . That these sub-delegates should hare the power of sub-delegating their commissions to others in distant parts and provinces of their stations . But it was not pretended , 1 . That Don Zenon Trudeau had been thus appointed . It was proved , and admitted , that he held his commission as Lieutenant Governor merely from the Go.eruor General of the Province . The form of that commission ( to another Lieutenant Governor ) was before the court , and composes a part of the printed brief which has been exhibited with this answer , being the document distinguished by the letter R , ( page 51 of the brief . ) It will he observed that this commission appoints him merely as " Lieutenant Governor of the establishments of Illinois , ' ' ' ' gives him no power as a sub-delegate Judge , and no authority , in any other character , to meddle with the grants of public lands ; nor does it contain any specification of his powers , even as Lieutenant Governor : 2 . It was not shown , nor alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Slate and universal despatch of the Indies of the appointment of Trudeau as a sub-delegate Judge , according to the requisition of the . royal order of 1754 ; nor , 3. was it pretended that he had any power to sub-delegate his commission to others . It was not pretended that Trudeau himself had any written commission , as a sub-delegate Judge , even from the Governor General of the province ; the claimant relied on parol proof merely , that the Lieutenant Governor was , ex officio , a sub-delegate . This striking difference in the mode of appointment and of sub-delegation in the power of the sub-delegate Judge , under the order of 175 1 , and under the practical operation of the land system in Louisiana , was among the auxiliary arguments of the Judge , to show that the order of 1754 was not in force , and was not considered as in force in Louisiana . But his conclusion was , that , if it was in force , inasmuch as it was the voice of the King , it must be obeyed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dispense with any part of its requisitions ; that , under that order , no one could exercise the poivers of a sub-delegate but one who had been appointed and commissioned in compliance with those requisit ons ; and that , if that order was in force in Louisiana , ( which , however , the court had denied , ) the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana teas not a sid ) - delegale , within th p intention of that ordinance ; because he had not been appointed in compliance with its requisitions . But admitting again , for the sake of the argument , that the powers of the Lieutenant Governor were commensurate with those of the sub-delegate Judge , under the royal order of 1754 ; had the latter , under the powers conferred upon him by that order , the power to make such a concession as that on which Soulard relied ; a concession for 10,000 arpenls of land , in reward for services of that specific character 1 /z/ The counsel for the claimant insisted that he had this power , by force of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preamble of the ordinance ; which word , it was alleged , meant gifts , i.nd nothing else but gifts , and that , standing as it did , w ihout limit , it carried with it the broad power to make gifts at pleasure , and , consequently , the power to make the gift in question in reward of services . To render the opinion of the Judge on this point intelligible , it will be important for this honorable Court to observe that the preamble to the royal order of 1 754 , in which this word mercedes is found , is a mere recital of the mottoes which led the King to make that ordinance . After an enumeration of these motives , the preamble concludes with these words : " I have therefore resolved that , in the mercedes , rendered in the appendix already cited ) grants , sales , and compromises of royal cultivated and uncultivated lands , now made , or which shall hereafter be made , the provisions of the regulation , that is , this regulation , ) shall be faithfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under fouiteen distinct and separate heads or articles , to detail minutely , all the powers and duties of the several officers employed in making grants of the royal lands ; and , among others , all the powers and duties of the sub-delegate Judge . And it concludes with a solemn warning from the King , that all the provisions of t at regulation should be strictly and punctually observed by his Viceroys , Audiencias , Presidents , and Governors , of all his dominions of the Indies , and by the sub-delegates , and other persons whom its observance concerned , and that it be not violated for any cause or pretext . Hence it was manifestly necessary to look for the powers of the sub-delegate under that ordinance , not in the general reciting words of the preamble , but in the regulations themselves , in which those powers were specifically detailed and defined . In examining those regulations , with this view , it will be observed by this honorable Court , that their great and sole business is to regulate the sale and composition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , had been announced by the preamble to be the object . There is only one of those regulations in which a gift of any kind or for any cause , is contemplated ; and that is the second , which , in its close , refers , among others , to laws 14 and 15 of the Recopilarion , on turning to which , ( pp. 969 , 970 of the Appendix to the Land Laws , ) and reading them in connexion with this second regulation , it will be seen that gratuitous reservations are made for pasturage and commons to the towns , and for tillage and herding for the aborigines of the country . And the only regulations of the royal order , which contemplate rewards are the seventh and eighth , by which the sub-delegate Judges are authorized to reward those who shall give information of intruders without title , upon the public lands , with a moderate poi tion of those lands , with regard to ivhich they shall have given information . With these two specific exceptions , there is not a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contemplates a power in the sub-delegate Judges to make either gift or reioard . The conclusions of the court , therefore , on this question , were , that , even if the powers of the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana were to be measured by those of the sub-delegate Judge , under the royal order of 1754 , he possessed no power to make such a concession as this , because the latter officer possessed no such power : that the word mcrcedes , found in the preamble , did not necessarily mean gifts ; that it might be translated , as it had been translated , grants ; or that it might be rendered rewards ; that , whether it meant the one or the other , the extent to which the sub-delegate was authorized to make either grant , reward , or gift , was to be sought for , not in the preamble , which is mere recital , but in the regulations themselves ; that , by the regulations , sufficient effect was given to the word in either of those senses ; if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated the grant of lands for sale and composition ; if it meant reivards , it was satisfied by the 7th and 8th articles , which /q/ authorize rewards to those who give information of intruders on the public lands ; if it meant gifts , it was satisfied by the c 2d article in connexion with laws 14 and 15 of the Recopilarion therein referred to , which authorize gifts to the inhabitants of towns for pasturage and common , and to the Indians For tillage and herding , according to their wants ; but in neither of its senses was there any article of the ordinance which authorized a sub-delegate to make &; grant , gift , or reward , like that which was claimed for Soulard , to wit : a concession for 1 0,000 arpents of land , as a reward for services rendered as Surveyor , as Adjutant , and as privy Councillor and assistant to the Lieutenant Governor . Upon this whole head of argument , therefore , the conclusions of the court were  --  1 . That the royal ordinance of 1754 was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana had not the powers of a sub-delegate under that ordinance , because he had not been appointed in conformity with its provisions ; 3 . That , if he even had those powers , he had no power to make the concession in question ; because , a sub-delegate under that ordinance could not have made such a concession in reward for such services . Since , then , no authority could be derived to Don Zenon Trudeau from " the Laws of the Indies , " to make the concession in question , the remaining inquiry was , whether such authority was to be found in the only other remaining code of Spanish law which was before the court , the regulations of O'Reilly  --  and it was admitted on every hand , that these gave no such authority : on the contrary , although they did contemplate a gift of the lands , it was a gift studiously and exclusively directed to the accomplishment of certain political objects , to wit : the speedy settlement of the province , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds and stocks . Hence , it authorizes no gifts or grants , except with relation to the one or the other of these objects : if settlement and agriculture were the objects , the quantity of land to be granted was to be regulated by the number of the family and of the working hands of the settler ; and the settlement and culture are required to be made within a given time , as the conditions of the grant : if pasturage and herding were the objects , the quantity granted was to be regulated by the number and quantity of the stock : but , even in the last case , in which the larger range seems to have been taken by the regulations , the quantity was in no case to exceed a league square , which is 7,056 arpents , But in the case before the court , the concession was for 10,000 arpents , and it had no reference to either of the objects which tvere the exclusive objects of the regulations , settlement , agriculture , or stock ; but was a grant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place y nor even shadow of a type in any one of those regulations . The counsel for the claimants were so well satisfied that the concession could not be supported on the authority of O'Reilly 's regulations , that their effort was to get rid of them altogether . With this view , they contended that those regulations were not made for Upper Louisiana ; that , so far as they contemplated agriculture , they looked merely to small settlements in the lower districts of the province , fronting on the Mississippi , as was manifest from their language ; and that , so far as they contemplated pasturage and herding , and the raising of stock , they were limited to the grazing districts , which were specifically named in the regulations , to wit : the Opelousas , Attakapas , and Natchitoches . In answer to this , the court , admitting the force of the argument as far as it went , held the opinion , that , although that part of the province , then known by the name of Illinois , afterwards called Upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the regulations , yet these were avowedly made for the whole province , and the Governors , Judges , Cabildos , and all the inhabitants of the province of Louisiana were expressly required to conform punctually to those regulations ; which of course included Illinois as a part of the province : and farther , that the policy of the regulations manifestly extended equally to every /z/ part of the province ; nor could the court discern , nor was any reason assigned or attempted why settlement , agriculture , and the raising of stock , should be 30 studiously contemplated in every other part of the province , and wholly neglected in Illinois ; why actual settlement and culture should be made indispensable conditions of the grants everywhere else , and not be required at all in Illinois - nor why the maximum grant should be limited to a league square in Opelousas , Attakapas , and Natchitoches , and remain unlimited in Illinois . The court found this policy to be not only the predominant and exclusive object of O'Reilly 's regulations , which were in force at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the same policy reigned throughout the regulations of the Spanish Governor , Gayoso , which were passed in the following year , 1797 ; and in which , Illinois is expressly named , as well as in those of the Intendant Morales , in the year 1799 . Now the concession in question was directly at war with the whole of this p - 'lie y ; and even if those regulations were wholly set aside as inapplicable to Upper Louisiana , it would still have remained for the claimant to show the authority of Trudeau to issue that concession , and to point the court to the law or ordinance by which it could be confirmed . In the course of this investigation , it became necessary for the court to advert to the royal order of the 24th of August , 1770 , to which a reference is made by Morales , in the preamble to his regulations . This royal order of the c 24th August , 1770 , was not before the court , nor was anything then known of its character or contents , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it which had been made by Morales ; and all that he says of it is in these words : " The King , whom God preserve , having been pleased to declare and order by his decree , given at Sta . Lorenzo , the 22d October , of the last year 1798 , that the intendency of these provinces , to the exclusion of all other authority , be put in possession of the privilege to divide and grant all kind of land belonging to his crown ; which right , after his order of the 2Ath August , 1770 , belonged to the civil and military government " 8 ? c . Morales then proceeds to say : " After having examined , with the greatest attention , the regulation made by his Excellency Count OReilly , the 18th February , 1770 , as well as that circulated by his Excellency the present Governor Don Manuel Gayoso de Lemos , the 1st January , 1798 , and with the counsel which he has given me , See . &.C; I have resolved that the following regulations shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar knew anything more of this royal order of the 24th August , 1 770 , than that , after its date , the power to grant the crown lands in Louisiana , belonged to the civil and military government . But this was precisely the effect of the regulations of O'Reilly ; so that , so far as anything was then known of this royal order , there was no conflict between it and these regulations , and therefore no necessary or implicative repeal of the latter ; on the contrary , they were , so far as they were both known , perfectly concordant ; and as , after the date of that order , lands continued to be granted in conformity with O'Reilly 's regulations , the court inferred that there was nothing in that order which had repealed or superseded those regulations . This respondent will here observe , that , since the decision in Soulard 's case , a copy of the royal order of the 24th August , 1770 , has been procured , and it is found that the inference drawn by the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more nor less than a mere simple ratification by the King , of the antecedent regulations of O'Reilly , of which a copy had been forwarded to Madrid for the royal consideration . Of this order , as well as of the correspondence which produced it , a copy will be herewith exhibited , if it can be procured in time , and marked B. That which has been stated , was , in effect , all that was said by the court in relation to this then unknown order of the 24th August , 1770 , to wit : That nothing had been shown which presented that order as necessarily in conflict with O'Reilly 's regulations , and thereby producing either a positive or an im- /z/ plied repeal of them ; and that , as lands continued , after the date of the order to be granted in conformity with O'Reilly 's regulations , the court was justified in the conclusion that these regulations remain in force , notwithstanding that order . But if the counsel could have established the proposition that O'Reilly 's regulations had been , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claimant would have been as far as ever from establishing the authority of Trudeau to issue the concession in question ; because it was impossible for the court to adopt the wild conjecture that the unknown order of the 24th August , 1770 , contained such authority , and to refer to that in its decree as the basis of a confirmation . The counsel for the claimant , in farther support of the concession , placed before the court three or four cases of concession , made to others by the Lieutenant Governors of Upper Louisiana , not in conformity with the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , or Morales , but which had nevertheless been confirmed bv the Governor , and by the Intendant Morales , and relied upon these acts of confirmation by the Governor and Intendant , as furnishing presumptive proof of the power of the Lieutenant Governor to originate concessions , without regard to the limitation imposed by these regulations . These concessions now form a part of the exhibit A , annexed to this answer . It will be observed that they are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed by the regulations where pasturage and herding was the object but exceeding 800 arpents , the apparent maximum , where agriculture was the object . In all other respects they conform to the policy of the regulations the grants being confirmed expressly on the conditions of settlement and culture within the time therein limited . The question before the court was to what extent the irregular concessions thus confirmed , established a power in the Lieutenant Governor to originate a binding concession , without regard to the restrict ions and limitations imposed bii the regulations . The court admitted that they did raise such a presumption ; but that , no written law or authority being shown for such concessions it was but a presumption , which was to be weighed against the other evidence in the cause . In performing this duty , the court had before them , on the one hand , the published regulations , proceeding from the highest authority in the province which gave no power to issue such concessions ; on the other hand , there were three or four such irregular concessions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . The question was , whether it was most reasonable to referthose confirmations to the power of the sovereign authority within the province to dispense with their own regulations in those particular instances , or to refer them to an unlimited power in the Lieutenant Governor to issue concessions to any extent , and for any purpose , which the Governors and Intendants were bound to confirm ? The latter presumption at once abolished the whole of the published regulations , or reduced them to a dead letter : the former left them in full life , but with a dispensing power in the lawgiver to abate their rigor in particular cases . The court , therefore , thought this the most rational conclusion ; and , in illustration as well as in confirmation of it . the honorable Court will observe in the last sentence of the loth law of the recopilacion ( appendix to the land laws , page 970 , ) a striking instance of the same kind , in which the King of Spain , himself , confirmed concessions , which he declares , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no authority thereunto . While , therefore , the court admitted that a. presumption in favor of the power of the Lieutenant Governor , to a certain extent , did arise from those confirmations , that presumption was believed to be encountered by evidence of a higher nature , which overthrew it , and forbade the conclusion that the Lieutenant Governor possessed the unlimited power to bind his superiors to confirmation , which was attempted to be derived from it . In the course of the argument , it was suggested by the counsel of the claimants , as highly probable that we were not in possession of all the laws and ordinances /z/ which bore on the grant of lands in Louisiana , but that there were possibly others besides those of O'Reilly , Gayoso , and Morales , which , if they could be commanded , would show that the concession in question had been legally issued by the proper authority . To this the court answered , that , if there had been any others , they must be believed to have been known to the Intendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have found a place in the recital of the acts of his predecessors , contained in the preamble to his own regulations . But that , having recited only those of O'Reilly and Gayoso , the presumption was a fair one , that they were all which had existed : in addition to which , no witness had been able to speak of any such regulations . But again ; the court was required by the act of Congress to refer in its decree to the law or ordinance on which it founded its confirmation ; and to enable the court to satisfy this requirement of the act , the law or ordinance must be shown and not conjectiirally guessed at . If Congress had intended that the acts of the Lieutenant Governor should of themselves be the evidence of his authority , that enlightened body would never have thrown upon the court , in terms so clear , distinct , and repeated , the duty of inquiring whether the concession , &c.; was legally made by the proper authority , and have required the court , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinance under which the confirmation was made . It was further urged by the same counsel , that , although neither the royal order of 1754 , nor the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , or Morales , expressly authorized such a concession ; yet , that neither of them prohibited it , and that hence the authority must be believed to have been regularly exercised . To which the court answered , in effect , that the question was not what these laws or ordinances prohibited , but what they autliorized . That the claimant coming before the court for confirmation , was bound to show affirmatively , by some law or ordinance , that the concession on which he relied was legally made by a person dull/ authorized to make it ; that he was therefore bound to point the court to the law or ordinance which gave the authority in question ; that , to show that these laws did not expressly prohibit it , did not by any means prove that they authorized it ; that the opposite argument was founded on the erroneous postulate that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , no power existed but such as could be shown to have been granted . There was another view of this subject , which this respondent , in the discharge of his official duty , considered himself bound to take . In describing the claims which were to be submitted to the court for its decision , the act of Congress gives , among others , this feature : all such as " might have been perfected into a complete title , under and in conformity to the laws , usages , and customs , of the government under which the same originated . " The concession on which Soulard relied , was alleged to have been made by Trudeau , in April , 1796 . From that time until the cession of the province to the United States , he had not taken a single step towards the completion of his title . So far from having settled , planted , or cultivated the lands , he had not even located or surveyed them until February , 1804 . In the mean time , the Spanish Governor , Gayoso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morales , in 1799 , had required all persons to whom lands had been granted , to settle and improve them within a limited time , under pain of forfeiture  --  Gayoso giving one year for that purpose , and Morales three . This requisition Soulard had wholly neglected . His title , therefore , had been subjected to forfeiture , and was in that condition when the sun of the Spanish power had set in Louisiana . Under these circumstances , it was impossible for the court to affirm that this was a concession which might have been perfected into a complete title according to the laws , usages , and customs of the government under which it originated . It did not at all impugn the soundness of this conclusion , that the laws of Gayoso and Morales , which contained the requisition , were subsequent in point of date to the alleged concession of Trudeau , because they were regular /q/ calls on the holders of complete titles to comply with the conditions which were requisite to their completion , and had a precedent in point in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counsel for the claimant had argued that the regulations of Morales had never been duly promulgated in Upper Louisiana , and consequently , that Soulard could not be supposed to have notice of this requisition . To which the court answered , that such a publication had been proved as must have brought them to the notice of Soulard , who was the surveyor of the Upper province . The evidence of this promulgation is in the exhibit A , which is annexed to this answer , by which it appears that the Lieutenant Governor had officially received from Morales six copies of these regulations , at the post of St. Louis , his own place of residence and that of Soulard , who was in his intimacy ; that the private Secretary of the Governor had also posted up another copy in front of the Government House ; and , among the confirmed claims presented by the petitioner himself , as evidence of the Lieutenant Governor 's power to issue concessions without limit , there is a recital of the publication of those regulations , as well as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he makes express reference to the 16th article of the Instructions of the Intendant , thereby fixing the proof of knowledge on himself . There is only one other point in the opinion , to which this respondent will here slightly call the attention of this honorable Court . The counsel for the claimant adverted , in the course of their argument , to that part of the act of 26th May , 18*24 , which requires the court to determine the question of title according to the several acts of Congress , &c.; ; but no act of Congress was pointed out , which seemed to the court to authorize the confirmation of the claim then under consideration ; and the court accordingly expressed this opinion . With this outline of the principles established by the opinion , for the fidelity of which he appeals to the opinion itself , this respondent now begs leave to turn the attention of this honorable Court to the publication of Luke E. Lawless , signed " A Citizen , " barely requesting this honorable Court to bear in mind that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the opinion had been published  --  a paper of a different political complexion , supported for the most part by different subscribers , and , consequently , that few if any of the readers of the article signed " A Citizen , " could have any knowledge of " the opinion " which it professed to censure , other than that which they derived from the article itself . This honorable Court will also be pleased to observe , that this article does not profess to reason at all on the principles maintained by the opinion , but consists entirely of a series of assumptions ( as the writer styles them ) which it imputes to the Judge , and with regard to the most of which ( as the writer himself justly observes ) reasoning was not absolutely necessary : for , in the terms in which they are imputed , they are such revolting absurdities , that it was impossible to read and to believe them , without presuming the Judge to be either deficient in understanding , or destitute of integrity . The writer begins with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respondent had used the following expression : " The decision of most of the points having proceeded chiefly upon grounds which had been little or not at all examined in the argument , it is deemed proper to remark , that counsel will not be excluded from again stirring any of the points which have been decided , token they may hereafter arise in any other cause . ' ' ' ' No man , whether lawyer or not , could have sincerely mistaken the meaning of this permission . But the writer of this article affects to understand it thus : " I observe , that , although the Judge has thought proper to decide against the claim , he leaves the ground of his decree open for further discussion . Availing myself , therefore , of this permission , ' ' ' ' Sfc. thus leaving his readers to believe /z/ the judo-e was so profoundly ignorant of what belonged not only to the dignity , but even to the deccnry , of the judicial character , as to have invited the general discussion of his opinion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer was about to give of that opinion , was made by the Judge 's own permission . The sneer with which this wilful and wanton perversion is introduced  --  " Although the Judge has thought proper to decide against the claim "  --  and the palpable and gross nature of the perversion itself , can leave this honorable Court in no doubt of the spirit and intention with which the publication was made . " Judge Peck , " says the writer , " seems to me to have erred in the following assumptions , as well of fact as of doctrine . " The honorable Court will be pleased to observe , that , in the opinion , this respondent had assumed as a postulate , no one position , either of fact or doctrine , as the basis of his decision ; but that every conclusion on which the opinion rested , was bottomed on evidence , or deduced by argument . Yet , according to the common acceptation of the English language , the readers of this article were informed that the Judge had bottomed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be enumerated . " 1 . That , by the ordinance of 1754 , a sub-delegate was prohibited from making a grant in consideration of services rendered , or to be rendered . " The Court will be pleased to observe , that the writer here suppresses the important fact that the Judge had decided the ordinance of 1754 not to be in force in Louisiana ; and that , consequently , according to his opinion , it was immaterial to the land claimants in that province , what the construction of the ordinance might be . He also suppresses the reasoning by which the Judge had gained his conclusion , and then imputes to him a different conclusion which would have been manifestly false , and which every reader of the ordinance would see at once to be false : for the ordinance contains no such prohibition ; and the Judge had not assumed that it did . On the contrary , he had admitted that it did authorize the sub-delegate to make grants in reward of services of a certain description . But he said that that ordinance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which was in question before the court  --  a concession for 10,000 arpents of land , and for such services as those which were alleged to have been rendered hy Soulard ; whereas , the court is here charged with having assumed that the ordinance of 1754 contained a positive prohibition on the sub-delegates from making grants in rewards of any kind of services rendered or to be rendered . These last words , so entirely gratuitous , contribute essentially to mark the rjuo animo of this misrepresentation . To manifest its materiality , and the effect which it was calculated to produce , and , as the respondent believes , it was intended to produce , in Missouri , it is proper to state , that , besides Soulard 's case , it is well known that there were in Missouri many other unconfirmed concessions by the Lieutenant Governor , in reward of services rendered or to be rendered , which had still to abide the judgment of the court ; and although as yet no Spanish law or ordinance had been produced , under which they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there did exist , or had existed , some such law or ordinance , which would yet make its appearance in protection of those claims . The royal order of the 24th August , 1770 , had not yet been seen , and sanguine hopes were entertained that , upon its production , it would be found to be broad enough to cover all the claims ; and , although the recital of the regulations of O'Reilly and Gayoso , in the preamble to those of Morales , forbade the conclusion that there was anything farther in the form of regulations , from which light could be expected , still it was hoped and believed that , in some hitherto undiscovered commission or letter from the King to his Governors , an authority , or some color of authority , would be found for these concessions , even if the order of the 24th August should fail to shield them . One of the causes which contributed to keep alive the hope , was , that none of the laws or ordinances which had been /q/ produced , contained anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , having been strongly pressed in the argument of Soulard 's case , had been admitted as strongly as anything can be admitted by implication that there was no such positive prohibition . But here is this writer charging the court with having assumed the direct reverse . If he had informed his readers that the court had declared the ordinance of 17.54 not to be in force in Louisiana , this misrepresentation would have been comparatively harmless . This , however , he keeps out of view . He permits them to believe that the court considered that ordinance as in force in that province , and as containing a prohibition fatal to all these claims ; thus holding up the Judge to this numerous body of exasperated land claimants as attempting to apply an extinguisher to their last hope , by drawing from the ordinance of 1754 a prohibition which every boy that could read could see was not there . " 2 . That a sub-delegate in Louisiana was not a sub-delegate as contemplated by the above ordinance . " To the readers of this article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which was the case with a great mass of its readers ) this charge must have exhibited the Judge in the light of having assumed the ridiculous solecism " that a sub-delegate was not a sub-delegate , " since to such a reader the additional words " as contemplated by that ordinance , " could have presented no intelligible qualification of the absurdity . Here again the effect is produced of the suggestion of a falsehood , by the suppression of the truth . For the important truth that the court had held the ordinance of 1754 not to be in force in Louisiana , is suppressed . The important position , that , if that ordinance was then in force , it was necessary that the sub-delegate judge should be appointed in conformity with its provisions , was also suppressed . The admission that the Lieutenant Governor had not been thus appointed a sub-delegate , was also suppressed : and , finally , the conclusion of the Judge , that , if that ordinance was then in force , the Lieutenant Governor , notiiaving been appointed in conformity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is distorted into the naked and unexplained absurdity , that a sub-delegate in Louisiana was not a sub-delegate within the contemplation of that ordinance , although ( for aught that appears to the contrary in the charge ) he might have been appointed in strict conformity with its requisitions . " 3 . That O'Reilly 's regulations , made in February , 1770 , can be considered as demonstration of the extent of the granting power , either of the Governor General or the sub-delegates under the royal order of August , 1770 . " It will be shown to this honorable Court , on the trial , that , in the original printing of this article , the dates of February and August were italicised , for the manifest purpose of directing the attention of the reader more pointedly to the absurdity imputed to the Judge , of assuming that O'Reilly 's regulations of February , were to be considered as demonstrative of the extent of the granting power , either of the Governor Gem red or of the sub-delegates , under the subsequent order of the King , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this honorable Court can not but discern , is a gross and wanton perversion of the court 's conclusion , and manifestly intended to bring the court into public contempt and ridicule . The court never did commit nor insinuate the absurdity of referring to the prior regulations of O'Reilly , as being , in themselves , demonstrative of the granting power under the subsequent royal order of August , 1770 . The court did consider the fact that , after the date of the royal order , grants still continued to be made in conformity with the regulations of OReilly , as justifying the inference , that the royed order ( the extent of which was admitted to be unknown to all ) was not in conflict with these regulations , in this particular . This inference , it must be perceived , was drawn from matter of fact subsequent to the date of the royal order , to wit : that the regulations were still permitted to operate after the date of that order : whereas the writer , whose obvious and uniform purpose it is to misrepresent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu 's fair inference of reason , into an absurd assumption , on the part of the Judge , that the prior regulations of O'Reilly , of themselves , demonstrated the whole extent of the subsequent unknown order of the King , with regard to the ' granting power oj the Governor General and sub-delegates. " 4 . That the royal order of August , 1770 , ( as recited or referred to in the preamhle to the regulations of Morales of 1799 , ) related exclusively to the Governor General . " This is another wanton and wilful perversion of the reasoning and conclusion of the court . The court never pretended to indicate the whole extent of the royal order of August , 1770 . All that the court said on the subject was a mere paraphrase of what Morales himself had said . The Intendant had declared , in his preamble , that , " after the date of that order , the privilege of dividing and granting all kind of lands , belonging to the crown , belonged to the civ.l and military government . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is this : " We have the testimony of Morales , the Intendant , in the preamble to his regulations , that the power to grant lands belonged to the civil and military government , after the order of the 24th August , 1770 : the powers of the civil and military government both centered in the Governor General . To him belonged the power to divide and grant lands in virtue of this order . " Thus Morales had affirmed , not the whole extent , but one feature of the order of 1770 . The court did nothing more than to echo his language , with regard to this one feature : and this is perverted by this writer into an assumption , on the part of the court , that the order of 1770 related exclusively to the Governor General . The mischief of this misrepresentation , in Missouri , can not be estimated by this honorable Court , without a distinct knowledge of the fact , that , with but one or two exceptions , the unconfirmed claims had originated with the Lieutenant Governor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this order related exclusively to the Governor General , and contained no communication of power to the Lieutenant Governor , from whom the unconfirmed claims emanated , presented to the minds of the numerous body of land claimants a decision which went to the root of all their claims . Ignorant as the court , the bar , and the country , then were of the extent of this order , it would have been most unwarrantable , as well as most offensive , to have assumed that Unrelated exclusively to the Governor General . It was not necessary to the argument of the court to make this assumption . They did not make it . The counsel , with the opinion before him , must have known that the court did not make it ; and yet he charges it to the court in this publication . " .5 . That the woid ' merccdesf in the ordinance of 1754 , which , in the Spanish language , means i gifts , can be narrowed by anything in that ordinance , or in any other law , to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an informer , and much less to a mere sale for money . " If this charge had stood alone , it could have left no doubt of the contemptuous and malevolent purpose of the writer ; for it imputes to the court such a congeries of most ridiculous absurdities , as could not but have awakened the laughter of the light-hearted , the sorrow of the considerate , and the indignation of the land claimants . Now , if this honorable Court has accompanied this respondent through the foregone delineation of his opinion , they can not but perceive , that the whole of this sneering sarcasm at the Judge is the pure coinage of the author 's own brain . For , in the first place , it . is not true that the Judge either assumed or admitted that the word mercedes , in the Spanish language , means only gifts ; on the contrary , the Judge held that it was capable of being translated grants , and had , in fact , been so . rendered by the translator of the Government . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wit : that /q/ mercedes means only gifts , and was so assumed or admitted by the Judge , on the truth of which proposition the whole sarcasm depends , is false in fact . The farther implication of the charge is , that the ordinance of 1754 conveyed to the sub-delegates an unlimited power to make gifts of land , to any extent , or for any cause , at pleasure ; and that the Judge conceding this , had , by construction , narrowed down this unlimited power of making gifts to the idea of a grant to an Indian , or a reward to an informer , and even to a mere sale for money : in all which this honorable Court can not but perceive that there is not one word of truth . For , in the first place , the Judge did net concede , nor is it true , in point of fact , that the ordinance does contain any such unlimited power of making gifts ; and , consequently , there was no occasion to narrow down this power by construction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an unlimited power of making gifts could be narrowed down , by any process of reasoning , to the idea of a grant to an Indian , a reward loan informer , and much less to a mere sale for money . The Judge made no such absurd and ridiculous transformations of the word gifts . The whole argument of the court on the ordinance of 1754 was perfectly simple and consistent . The court held , 1 . That , for the reasons already stated , that ordinance was not in force in Louisiana . 2 . That , if it was in force , the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana was not a sub-delegate within the intentions of that ordinance , because he had not been appointed in conformity with its provisions . 3 . That , if the ordinance was in force , and Trudeau was a sub-delegate within its intention , still that , as a sub-delegate under that ordinance , he had no power to make the concession in question , because the whole powers of the sub-delegate were minutely and specifically detailed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following out these details , through the entire ordinance , it was seen that the duties of a sub-delegate were , not by construction , but by express terms of the ordinance itself , confined to the following heads : First , and chiejly , to making sales , and compositions of the royal land , with a view to revenue . Second . That there was no one article of the ordinance which contemplated a free gift in any case whatever , except the second article , which authorized gifts to the inhabitants of towns for pasturage and commons according to their wants , and gifts to the native Indians which might be necessary for tillage and herding . Thirdly . That there were no articles of the ordinance which contemplated grants of land as rewards for services , saving the 7th and 8th , which authorized the sub-delegates to reward those who might give information of intruders on the public lands with d moderate portion of the lands in relation to which such information might be given . But that there was no article of the ordinance which authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Soulard relied . These powers of the sub-delegate , thus deduced by the Judge from a careful examination of the several articles themselves , are alleged by this charge to have been drawn from the word mercedes , which is alleged to mean gifts ; and the court is accused of having arrived at their conclusion , by torturing the word gifts from its natural sense , and making a gift to mean , first , a grant to an Indian ; next , a reward to an informer ; and finally , by way of capping the climax of absurdity , to make gift to mean a mere sale for money . " The gifts to the inhabitants of towns for pasturage and commons , according to their wants , " was struck from the catalogue . Why ? Because it would weaken the energy of the period by lengthening it ; and destroy the poignancy of the ridicule intended to be thrown upon the court , by the motley group of Indians and informers ; whom it exhibits as selected by the court as the only proper objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 6th . That O'Reilly 's regulations were , in their terms , applicable , or were , in fact , applied to or published in Upper Louisiana . " /z/ No one part of this charge is true in the sense in which the writer manifestly intended it to be understood by his readers . The court never did assume or contend that these regulations were , by their terms , extended specifically to Upper Louisiana . With regard to their having even been in fact applied to , or actually published in Upper Louisiana , there was not a word of controversy at the bar , nor is there a word said upon either of these propositions by the court . The court did say that O'Reilly himself had declared these regulations to be published for the government of the grants of land in the Province of Louisiana ; that is to say , in the whole province , because he himself had made no exception of any part of it . And the court did farther say that the policy of the regulations applied as well to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stated as they were laid down by the court , the writer would have found something more necessary to convict the court of error , besides the mere statement . But having informed his readers that he should confine himself to an enumeration of the Judge 's errors , " without entering into any demonstration or developed reasoning on the subject , which he adds ( and truly ) was not , as regards most of the points , absolutely necessary , his only study seems to have been , so to shape his charges as that the absurdity imputed to the Judge should be self-evident , without any solicitude for the candor or truth of the imputation. " 7 . That the regulations of O'Reilly have any bearing on the grant to Antoine Soulard , or that such a grant was contemplated by them . " This is another misrepresentation of the same character with the last , intended to mislead the reader to the prejudice of the court . The Judge never did assume that the regulations of O'Reilly had any bearing on the spec fie grant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grant was contemplated by them , the court decided the exact reverse , to wit : that no such grant ever was contemplated by them . " 8 . That the limitation to a square league , of grants to new settlers in Opelousas , Attakapas , and Natchitoches , ( in 8th article of O'Reilly 's Regulations ) prohibits a larger grant in Upper Louisiana . " This is another gross perversion of the reasoning and conclusion of the court . The Judge made no such assumption , and maintained no such proposition . His reasoning and conclusion were these : O'Reilly himself declares his regulations to have been intended for the province of Louisiana at large . Their policy is the encouragement of population , settlement , agriculture , and stock in that province . This policy applies with equal force to the whole province . The court , therefore , can see no reason why giants should be made with a regard to the means of the settler , and on the express conditions of settlement and culture in one part of the province more than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league square in Opelousas , Attakapas , and Natchitoches , and be unlimited in Upper Louisiana . This conclusion , founded on the general policy of the regulations , as being equally applicable to every part of the province , is here converted into an isolated assumption on the part of the Judge , that the limitation to a league square in Opelousas , Attakapas , and Natchitoches did , per se , prohibit a larger grant in Upper Louisiana . " 9 . That the regulations of the Governor General , Gayoso , dated 9th September , 1797 , entitled ' Instructions to be observed for the admission of new settlers , ' prohibit in future a grant for services , or have the effect of annulling that to Antoine Soulard which was made in 1796 , and not located or surveyed , until February , 1804 . " The implication here is , that , prior to Gayoso 's regulations , there had been a law by which concessions of the character of that of Soulard had been authorized , that being a grant to an old settler in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact before him , the Judge had assumed that these regulations of Gayoso , entitled " Instructions for the admission of new settlers , " and consequently confined merely to the case of the admission of new settlers , had the effect of prohibifing /q/ a grant for services to an old settler . And by way of making ( he ridicule still more striking , the court is here represented as separating the regulations of Gayoso from its natural relation with those of O'Reilly and Morales , for the purpose of producing this absurd effect . Now , in answer to this branch of the charge , the Judge is constrained to say that not one word of it is true . There was no such previous Jaw ; nor did the Judge attribute any such prohibition to the regulations of Gayoso . All that the court said upon the subject was , that the three sets of regulations , those of O'Reilly , in 1770 , of Gayoso , in 1797 , and of Morales in 1799 , evinced a settled and c ntinuing policy , which was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant Governor of the province to make such concessions as those of Soulard . The second branch of the charge is still more gross . The Judge is represented as assuming that the regulations of Gayoso , in 1797 , annulled the prior grant to Soulard which was made in 1796 . But he made no such assumption . He assigned no retroactive effect to those regulations . The character he assigned to them was purely prospective . This honorable Court will be pleased to observe that the King of Spain , by one of the laws in the Rccopilacion , ( Law 11 , page 969 , Land Laws , ) had required all persons to whom land had been distributed , to take possession within three months , on pain of forfeiture . Gayoso and Morales , pursuing the example of their sovereign , made similar regulations in Louisiana . The 14th of Gayoso required all to whom lands had been granted , to take possession within one year , and to make a specified progress in cultivation in three years , on pain of forfeiture . The 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobeyed them both . The conclusion of the court , therefore , was , that his title v had been forfeited by this act of disobedience subsequent to the law . The court assigned no retrospeition whatever to these regulations ; but considered them as purely prospective . Whereas the assumption imputed to the court is , that these regulations struck backwards at the grant , and annulled it in its origin , although , according to the implication , it proceeded originally from a competent authority . " 10 . That the complete titles made by Gayoso are not to be referred to , as affording the construction made by Gayoso himself , of his own regulations . " " 13 . That the complete titles ( produced to the court ) made by the Governor General , or the Intendant General , though based on incomplete titles , not conformable to the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , or Morales , afford no inference in favor of the power of the Lieutenant Governor , from whom these incomplete titles emanated , and must be considered as anomalous exercises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the language of Morales himself , in the complete titles issued by him , on concessions made by the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana , anterior to the date of his regulations , ought not to referred to as furnishing the construction which he , Morales , put on his own regulations . " These charges are all presented together , because they are of kindred character , involve the same principle , and require the same answer . They are ' not true . So far from it , they are diametrically opposed , in point both of fact and doctrine to the grounds really assumed and maintained by the court . The representation becomes the more extraordinary , because it is a fact which must have been known to the author , that the evidence to which he alludes , in the loth charge , was objected to by the District Attorney of the United States as inadmissible ; that the court did admit it on the very ground that it raised a presumption in favor of the power of the Lieutenant Governor to make the grant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the court ; and that the bill of exceptions constitutes a part of the record in the case of Soulard before the Supreme Court , as may be seen by referring to the 47th , 48th , and 49th pages of exhibit A. /z/ The court not only admitted all the evidence alluded to in these several charges , but also admitted , in the most distinct terms , that they did afford an inference , that they did raise a presumption , and were to be regarded as proof of the existence of a power in the Lieutenant Governor to make the concession on which Soulard relied ; and yet precisely the reverse of this is that which is imputed to the Judge in these charges , for which there is not the slightest color in the opinion . The Judge admitted this evidence in the only light , and to the fullest extent to which it was offered ; for it was offered and could be offered only as presumptive proof , and in that character it was admitted . Having received it as presumptive proof ; having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it ; it became the duty of the Judge to weigh this presumption against the other evidence in the cause . That process was performed , and the conclusion of the Judge was , that the presumption admitted to have been raised by this evidence , was overborne by the opposing proof ; and , because the Judge was constrained , in the conscientious discharge of his duty , to come to this conclusion , he is accused by this author of having assumed , that the testimony in question afforded no inference , raised no presumption , and was not to be referred to , in favor of the power claimed for the Lieutenant Governor . The assumption imputed to the Judge in the close of the 13th charge , that the confirmation of these irregular concessions must be considered as anomalous exercises of power in favor of individual grantees , is not correct ; for the court considered that confirmation as the legitimate exercise of the sovereign power of the Governor General and the Intendant , and as demonstrative of this power , not of the originating power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the foregoing delineation of the opinion . " 11 . That , although the regulations of Morales were not promulgated as law , in Upper Louisiana , the grantee in the principal case was bound by these , inasmuch as he had notice , or must be presumed , from the official station which he held , to have had notice , of their terms . " Here is another gross and palpable misrepresentation : Soulard resided at St. Louis , the capital of Upper Louisiana , and was the official Surveyor of that part of the province ; and the court is charged with assuming that , although it teas in proof that the regulations of Morales had not been promulgated in Upper Louisiana , still that Soulard was bound by them , because he had notice , or must be presumed from his office , to have had notice . The court made no such assumption . The principal fact on which the charge is founded is false . The regulations of Morales had hern promulgated in Upper Louisiana . It was not questioned in the argument at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only question raised , was , whether the promulgation had been sufficient . The court was of opinion that it had been sufficient ; because the Governor had received at least six copies of them from Morales himself ; and because his Secretary proved that he had posted up another copy in front of the Government Mouse ; and because Soulard had proved notice on himself , by having referred , in one of his official returns , in 1802 , to the 16th article of these regulations , which he stated had been complied with in that particular case ; and further , because their publication was recited in the grant offered by the petitioner , as before mentioned ; and their recognition as law by the Lieutenant Governor in one of his official acts , formed a part of the evidence in the cause , as will be seen by the exhibit already made . " 12 . That the regulations of Morales exclude all belief that any law existed under which a confirmation of the title in question could have been claimed . " This is another instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth . It is only by the unfair process of detaching a single sentence of the opinion from its context , that even a color can be gained , to give countenance to this charge . This honorable Court will observe , that one question /q/ in Soulard 's case was , whether there might not have been some law or ordinance , of intermediate date , between the regulations of O'Reilly in 1770 , and Soulard 's grant in 1796 . On this subject , the language of the court is : " The regulations which we have , do not permit us to believe that there existed others . Morales , in the preamble to those made by him , mentions those of O'Reilly and of Gayoso , in a manner which implies that these were all of which he had any knowledge , and shows that he was making regulations , which were to offer the only means by which lands were to be obtained . His language is : ' That all persons who wish to obtain lands , may know in what manner they ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be granted or sold ; that those who are in possession , without the necessary titles , may know the steps they ought to take to come to an adjustment ; that the commandants , as sub-delegates of the Intendancy , may be informed of what they ought to observe , ' &c.; This preamble excludes the presumption that other laws existed by which titles could be obtained ; and the regulations themselves exclude all belief that any law existed , under which a confirmation of the title in question could have been claimed . " This last member of the sentence has immediate reference to the discussion which had just been closed in the preceding part of the opinion ; and by which it was shown that Soulard had forfeited his title , by refusing to comply with the condition of settlement and cultivation exacted by Morales and by Gayoso . This illustration is entirely suppressed by the writer . He seizes on the strict terms of the last member of the last sentence , and separating it from its explanatory matter , exhibits the court as assuming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forfeiture , which Soulard had incurred from a non-compliance with them , ) excluded all belief of the existence of any law under which a confirmation of this title could have been claimed from Spain . " 15 . That the uniform practice of the subrdelegates or Lieutenant Governors of Upper Louisiana , from the first establishment of that province to the 10th March , 1804 , is to be disregarded as a proof of law , usage , or custom therein . " " 6 . That the historical fact , that nineteen-fwentieths of the titles to lands in Upper Louisiana were not only incomplete , but not conformable to the regulations of O'Reilly , Gayoso , or Morales , at the date of the cession to the United States , affords no inference in favor of the general legality of those titles . " " 17 . That the fact , that incomplete concessions , whether floating or located , were , previous to the cession , treated and considered by the government and population of Louisiana as property , saleable , transferable , and the subject of inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those titles , or to their claim to the protection of the treaty of cession , or of the law of nations . " These three charges are thrown together , because they are of the same character , and must receive the same answer . They are charged as assumptions made by this respondent in his opinion . There arc no such assumptions there , nor one word in the opinion to countenance either imputation . The uniform practice alleged in the 15th charge was not in proof , and therefore that proof could not be disregarded . The historical fact alleged in the 16th charge was not in proof , and therefore the court could not and did not say what inference it would have afforded if it had been in proof . The fact alleged in the 17th charge was not in proof , and therefore the court did not and could not say what inference it would have afforded if it had been in proof . The cases severally made by these three charges , as well as the assumptions imputed by them to the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . Yet are they gravely published to the world as facts , and they are manifestly of a character to expose the court , not only to contempt , but to indignation . Whether the claimant and his counsel had it in their power to have made good these supposititious cases by propf ; and what would have been the legal /z/ effect if such proof had been offered to the court , it is needless here to inquire . It is enough to say that no such facts were proved ; for the truth of which assertion , this respondent refers to the exhibit A : and that no such assumptions were made bv the Judge ; for the truth of which , he refers to the opinion forming part of the same exhibit . " 13 . That the laws of Congress heretofore passed in favor of incomplete titles furnish no argument or protecting principle in favor of those titles of a preciselv similar character which remain unconfirmed . " The Judge made no such assumption . It would have been a gross violation of his dutv if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the contempt and indignation of his country . He appeals to the opinion itself for a refutation of this charge . All that he says upon the subject is , that there was certainlv no act of Congress which would authorize the confirmation of the claim , or of any part of it ; whereas the charge exhibits the Judge as assuming that , although acts of Congress had been placed before him , which , by their principles , called for a confirmation of the claim ; yet , that he would disregard them , and refuse the confirmation . The writer having thus finished his enumeration of what he is pleased to call the assumptions of the Judge , proceeds to say : " In addition to the above , a number of other errors , consequential upon those indicated , might be stated . " This is true ; for , as he had not been at all governed by the opinion of the court in the fabrication of these charges , their number depended entirelv on the fertility of his own invention . He proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he contends was inflicted by Morales ' regulations , seems to me to be peculiarly pregnant with grievous consequences . " And yet these grievous consequences were merely the same which had been announced by the King of Spain himself , in the 11th law of the Recopilacion , to which a reference has been already made , and by the parallel regulation of Gayoso , in 1797 . Such is the farrago of folly and absurdity which this writer has been able to extract from the case , and which , in his published article , he has imputed to the Judge , as assumptions made by him in the course of his opinion . That a man of sufficient discrimination to be placed as leading counsel in the management of cases of so much importance , could have accumulated such a mass of misrepresentation , through inDocent mistake , was , and still is , in the opinion of this respondent , utterly incredible . He did , and does still , consider it to have been wanton , wilful , and done malo animo . Why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational discussion of an important subject ? But there is no discussion , nor even the pretence of discussion ; there is nothing but naked , sheer misrepresentation from beginning to end . And although there is no discussion of the grounds of the d cision assumed bv the court in Soulard 's case , but , on the contrary , a total suppression of those grounds , the publication embodies the evidence and arguments upon which the validity of the claims were mainly to be supported , and represents the court to have disregarded that evidence , and to have overruled those arguments ; thus inculcating the merits of the claims , and leaving the inference necessarily and forcibly to be drawn by the public and the claimants , that those merits would be , as they had been in the case of Soulard , disregarded by the court , should the decision in that case be persevered in . The effect to be expected from such a publication was manifest , and , both in law and morals , every man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this honorable Court , that the direct and inevitable tendency of such a publication was to bring this court into open contempt and scandal , to inflame the resentment of the very uumerous and powerful body of land claimants in Missouri , together with that of their adherents and connexions ; and thus to array against the Judge , a power which might overawe and control him in the decision of the pending cases , or render him perfectly odious if he should dare to follow up in these cases the principles which he had laid down in Soulard 's ; to render the de /q/ cisions of the court so despicable among the people , as to destroy all the weight , authority , and even utility of the tribunal ; to beget in the public mind suclTan undue sympathy and prejudice in favor of these claimants and their claims , as to unfit that public for the performance of the office of jurors in the trial of issues of fact ; and , if a jury should be drawn for this purpose , to bring them into the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge . as to indispose them to receive with respect , any instruction , even on points " of law . which might be given from the bench ; in short , to erect atrophvfor these land claimants , their counsel , and their claims , on the ruins of the court itself . And this respondent , farther answering , says , that , considering the said publication to be a contempt of the court , and punishable by the summary process of attachment , it is true , that he did make a rule on the said Luke E. Lawless , who had been proved to be the author , to show cause why an attachment should not be awarded against him , and why he should not be suspended from practice as an attorney and counsellor in that court ? That he did appear on the return of the rule , and did attempt to show cause , by himself and his counsel , insisting that the publication was no contempt , but a correct representation of the opinion of the court ; that , in making that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen ; and that , to punish it by attachment , would be at once an invasion of the liberty of the press , and of the right of trial by jurv . The cause thus shown not being satisfactory to the court , but the court on the contrary holding and pronouncing the publication to be a gross misrepresentation and a contempt , and , according to the settled authority of the law , punishable by attachment , the attachment was accordingly issued , and the said Luke E. Lawless was brought before the court thereupon ; that , being thus before the court , the privilege was tendered to him of purging himself of the contempt , if he thought proper to do so : and with this view he was asked by this respondent whether he chose to have interrogatories exhibited , or whether , if exhibited , he would answer them ? In reply to which he said , that he did not wish interrogatories ; that he would not answer them if they should be filed , and that , as he had committed no contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , in open defiance and contempt of the opinion which had been solemnly pronounced by the court , and to the evil example of the bystanders , and of all others who should have business to do in the court , he read in open court a paper in which the truth of the publication signed u A Citizen n was re-asserted . And it is true that this respondent , considering this conduct of the said Luke E . Lawless . and his refusal to purge himself of the contempt as a contumacious persistence therein , and an aggravation of the first contempt , did proceed to pass sentence that the said Luke E. Lawless should be imprisoned for twentyfour hours , and that he should be suspended from practising s as an attorney and counsellor in that court for eighteen months . In all which actions and doings of this respondent in the premises , he avers that he was supported and justified by the constitution and laws of the land , and that he will be prepared to make good this ayerment at such time as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention charged to him by the article of impeachment , " wrongfully and unjustly to oppress , imprison , and otherwise injure , the said Lake E.

Jajies H. Peck . Monday , December 13 , 1830 . The court having been opened by proclamation , the President administered the oath to Mr. Baker and Mr. Poindexter . On motion of Mr. Woodbury , Ordered , that the secretary inform the House of Representatives that the Senate are in their public chamber , and are ready to proceed on the trial of the impeachment of James H. Peck , Judge of the District Court of the United States for the District of Missouri ; and that seats are provided for the accommodation of the members .

Four of the managers , viz. Mr. Buchanan , Mr. McDuffie , Mr. Spencer and Mr. Wickliffe , attended . James H. Peck , the Respondent , accompanied by his counsel , also attended . The replication of the House of Representatives was then read by Mr. Buchanan in the following words : /z/ By the House of Representatives of the United States , to the answer and plea of James H. Peck , Judge of the District Court of the United States for the district of Missouri , to the article of impeachment exhibited against him by the said House of Representatives .

The replication was handed to the secretary to be filed . The President then informed the managers that they were at liberty to proceed in support of the article of impeachment exhibited ; and on request of Mr. Buchanan the witnesses on behalf of the managers were called as follows : viz. Luke Edward Lawless , Henry S. Geyer , Charles S. Hempstead , Rev. Thomas Horrall , Edward Charless , Josiah Spalding , Arthur L. Magenis , Marie Philip Leduc , Wharton Rector , Hon. Thomas H.

Mr. Buchanan , on behalf of the managers , informed the court that in consequence of the unavoidable absence of a material witness , ( Gharles S. Hempstead , who had been overset on his way and had his collar-bone twice broken , but was likely to recover and to be able to attend the court , ) they could not proceed to make good their charge without further time . Whereupon , on motion of Mr. King , Ordered , that the secretary inform the House of Representatives that the Senate will , on Monday next , at 12 o'clock , be ready further to proceed on the trial . The court then adjourned to Monday next , at 12 o'clock . /z/ The United States vs . James H. Peck . Monday , Dec. 20 . The court having been opened by proclamation , the managers , accompanied by the House of Representatives attended . James H. Peck , the respondent , and his counsel , also attended . At the request of Mr. Meredith , the witnesses on behalf of the respondent were called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to substantiate their charge , Mr. McDuffie then rose , and addressed the court as follows : Mr. McDuffie said , that in discharging the high and responsible trust which had been confided to him by the House of Representatives , he should feel that he was acting with a proper regard to all the considerations of public duty , in reducing to the narrowest limits of practicable brevity , the preliminary exposition which it had devolved on him to make , of the facts and principles upon which he should invoke the judgment of this honorable Court against the respondent at the bar , on the article of impeachment presented by the high inquest of the nation . The great importance of this case , said Mr. McDuffie , both to the respondent himself and to the people of the United States , must be so extremely obvious to every member of the court , as to render it unnecessary for me to solicit their attention by any special invocation . Fully assured of that patient attention which will be indispensable to a proper understanding of the case , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propositions of law and of fact , upon which the managers of this impeachment will rely , for convicting the respondent of the high misdemeanor with which he stands charged . 1 . I shall , in the first place , attempt to show , that admitting the publication signed " A Citizen " to have been false and malicious , Mr. Lawless was only liable to be indicted and tried for a libel , and that the respondent was guilty of a dangerous usurpation of power , in proceeding by the summary process of attachment , as for a contempt , to pronounce sentence and inflict punishment . /z/ 2 . I shall attempt to show , in the second place , that the publication in question was neither false nor malicious , but a true statement of the assumptions made by the respondent in the case of Soulard ; and consequently , that the proceeding against Mr. Lawless was not only illegal , but unjust , tyrannical and oppressive . In support of my first proposition , I hold it to be incontrovertible , that the common law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the courts of the United States ; any more than the civil law of the Roman empire . A greater political solecism can not be imagined , than that the laws of a foreign country ,  --  or what is even more absurd ,  --  a particular branch of the laws of a foreign country , should be recognized by our courts as the law of the United States , without the sanction of the legislative authority . Were it not that the common law of England has been adopted in most of the States by legislative enactments , and had not most of us been educated in its principles , it never would have occurred to any human being , that it was of force , as a part of the law of the United States , any more than that the United States were still overshadowed by the prerogative of the king and the supremacy of parliament . I grant that many of the acts of Congress , particularly those relating to the organization and powers of the federal tribunals , are to be expounded with reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference may be necessary to ascertain the meaning of legal terms and technical phrases . But it must be obvious to this enlightened court , that this reference is made to the English common law , upon the same principle that a like reference would be made to an English dictionary , as the mere means of ascertaining the true construction of the acts of Congress , and the actual intentions of the lawgivers . I will also admit , that all courts , from the bare fact of their creation and organization , must of necessity have the power to make rules to regulate their proceedings ; and that the courts of the United States have very wisely adopted the rules of the common law , in these particulars . But as regards the punishment of criminal offences , I utterly deny that the common law of England can be referred to by the Judges of the federal courts , as a source of authority , whether those offences be tried upon an indictment and by a jury , or in the more summary mode of attachment , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am aware that it may be contended , with some show of plausibility , that to punish a contempt , by the process of attachment , is not the exercise of a criminal power , because it is exercised in England by the Courts of Common Pleas and Chancery , equally with the Court of King 's Bench . But I humbly conceive , may it please the court , that such an argument is sacrificing the substance of the thing to the mere form of proceeding . A man is called up before a Judo-e  --  a Chancellor , if you please  --  upon a charge of being guilty of publishing a libel against the court ; and without any of the forms of proceeding intended to secure a fair and impartial trial to every citizen ; without either the advantage of an indictment , to apprize him of the offence alleged against him , or a jury to secure him from the excited vengeance of the offended Chancellor , he is pronounced guilty of a false and malicious libel , and subjected to as high a punishment , nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a court of general criminal jurisdiction , after a solemn trial and conviction by any impartial jury of his peers . And yet according to the argument I am answering , though a citizen is thus pronounced guilty of an infamous offence , and punished with the utmost severity of the law , it is no assumption of criminal power by the court , for the very extraordinary reason , that the sentence has been pronounced , and the punishment inflicted , without the forms of atrial , and by a court , which is not invested with a general jurisdiction to try and punish offences ! Such an argument as this , addressed by a judge , to a citizen who should complain of the exercise of usurped power , would be the most outrageous mockery , by which judicial tyranny could add insult to the injury inflicted . /q/ If a contempt of court , such as we are considering , he not a crime , I should be gratified to be informed by the learned counsel for the respondent , to what legal category it belongs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human authority a Judge of the United States assumes to punish a citizen by fine , imprisonment and disfranchisement , not only without a trial , but also without a crime ? The power to punish libels , as for contempts , is not only a criminal power , but a criminal power more dangerous to public liberty than any that has ever been exercised by our courts of justice ; and is , therefore , the very last of the criminal powers , which the courts of the United States should assume to exercise on the authority of the common law of England . But it is very far from my intention to deny to the federal tribunals the protective power of punishing for contempts of their authority . Even if the judiciary act of 1789 had not expressly conferred this power , I readily " agree that these courts would have possessed it , as an inherent power , derived , not from the common law of England , but from the great law of self-preservation . It is indispensable to the due exercise of their high and important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves while engaged in the administration of justice ; to punish all direct outrages upon the court ; to prevent the Judge from being driven from the bench , and the jury from being driven from their box ; and in a word , to punish in the most summary manner everything that actually impedes or obstructs the administration of justice . It is highly important , however , that we should ascertain the source of this power , with a view to fix its extent and limitations . If it be derived from the common law of England , our courts would of course possess it in all the latitude in which it may have been exercised by English judges ; if it be derived from the act of 1789 , its limitations are clearly and distinctly defined in the act itself ; and if it be derived , as an inherent power , from the imperious law of necessity , its limitations are obviously indicated by the very law in which it originates . Necessity , to be sure , is the tyrant 's plea ; but it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which only they can justify the exercise of the power of punishing for contempts , in cases where the acts of Congress do not expressly authorize it . To what extent , then , can this plea avail them , and in what cases ? The answer is a very obvious one . The plea must he pleaded in good faith , and clearly made out . It must be a case of actual necessity , obvious to the common sense of every impartial person . The administration of justice must be actually obstructed . It will not do to rely upon a mere constructive interference , impeding the course of justice , by some far-fetched implication . I am aware , that certain notions of judicial prerogative , have been imperceptibly introduced into this country , from loose phrases , in the elementary books of English common law , and in the opinions of English judges ; and that our judges and lawyers have , in this manner , become imbued with principles which are utterly incompatible with every just conception of liberty . The case of the respondent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was not sitting in court , in the actual administration of justice , when the publication of Mr. Lawless was made . There is not the shadow of a pretence that this publication had the effect of interrupting the administration of justice , either in the case to which it refers or in any other case . The judgment of the court , in the case of Soulard , had been rendered some five or six months previous to the publication . The decree had been actually entered of record , and there was an end of the judicial functions of the Judge as to that case ; when , after the lapse of several months , the respondent , from some consideration , satisfactory , no doubt , to himself , thought proper to come out with an extra-judicial argument in the newspapers , which he calls the opinion of the court . And it was this newspaper opinion , thus promulgated , which he has sought to screen from public scrutiny , by ascribing to his own person , whether on the bench or off of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England ascribes to the person of the king . By that law , the /z/ king can do no wrong ; and it will be hereafter shown that some of the English judges have attempted to maintain the monstrous doctrine , that a judge , being the representative of the king , and selected to administer his justice , is entitled to the same immunity , and is equally exempt from scrutiny and responsibility . And such , may it please the court , is the extravagant and outrageous pretension by which Judge Peck attempts to justify his high-handed proceeding . Admitting the publication of Mr. Lawless to have been , what it certainly was not , a false , malicious and atrocious libel , was there anything in the case , which could render it necessary , in any legal sense of the term , to exercise the extraordinary and summary power of committing and suspending the publisher without anything more than the veriest mockery of a trial ? Will it be pretended that the course of justice , in its actual administration , was obstructed ? Was there the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify the assumption of this dangerous power ? Was there , indeed , any emergency in the case , which would defeat the purpose of punishment , unless that punishment were inflicted promptly ? Even if we concede to the judicial character , the irresponsible sanctity ascribed to it by Chief Justice Wilmot , and claimed by Judge Peck , on this apochryphal authority ; suppose it to be granted that it was libellous to publish anything , true or false , tending to bring his character into ridicule and contempt ; to what lawful end can punishment be inflicted , in such a case as this ? The only purpose which punishment could answer  --  except it be to gratify the vengeance of the offended Judge  --  was to deter this and other offenders from committing similar offences . And this purpose would be as effectually accomplished , without all this " unrighteous speed , " by the ordinary process of indictment and trial by jury , as by the most summary and instantaneous punishment that could be inflicted . Indeed , the greater solemnity and impartiality of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judgment and punishment , as a mere matter of example . I beg the court to attend to the obvious distinction between a contempt , which interrupts the administration of justice  --  such , for example , as a riot in court , or a glaring insult offered to the judge while actually sitting on the judgment seat ; and a constructive or consequential contempt , consisting of a mere criticism , however unfair and false , upon the opinion of the judge , or of a libel upon his character . In the former case there is an obvious necessity for instantaneous punishment , in order to remove the obstruction that impedes the course of public justice . In the latter case , there is not the slightest necessity for any extraordinary expedition , nor any plausible ground for distinguishing a judge from any other public functionary . We are told of the great importance of preserving the characters of our judges ; but it is certainly not a matter of less importance to preserve the characters of the President and Vice President , the heads of Departments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned counsel for the respondent will hardly contend that the President and all the members of his cabinet united , would dare to punish the author of the most infamous and defamatory libel , by the summary process of attachment . Nor will it be contended , I presume , that either house of Congress would have the power to punish a libel against any or all of its members , published when the house was not in session , in relation to a past transaction . When the judgment of the court has been finally pronounced in a case ; when its judicial functions have entirely ceased as to that case ; when , long after the adjournment of the session at which the case was tried , the opinion is promulgated in the newspapers ; it becomes a mere matter of judicial history , and is as unquestionably the subject of scrutiny and even of censure , as the opinions of judges delivered a half century ago . I will say nothing of the policy of that principle of the common law , which forbids any publication relative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing on this case . /q/ But I will say , that all the considerations which make it improper to publish anything relative to such a case , operate with double force against such a publication by the judge who is to try that case . Let us reflect for a moment upon the consequences which would result from conceding to the federal judges the power of punishing in this summary way , any publication censuring or condemning their judicial opinions , after those opinions have become a matter of history . Thejudges of the Supreme Court , form a very important part of our political system ; they have settled , so far as their decision can settle , some of the most doubtful and interesting questions of constitutional power ; questions which involve the jurisdiction of conflicting sovereignties . Their decision in the case of Cohens brought them into direct conflict with all the departments of sovereign power , in the State of Virginia . Their opinion , in that case , has been published to the world . And will it now be contended that a citizen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subversive of the essential rights of the States , would not have the undoubted right to denounce it in the most unmeasured terms of indignant reprobation ? Would he not have an unquestionable right to appeal to this decision , as a proof that the judges are the mere instruments of the power whose will they are called upon to expound ; and to assert , in the roundest terms , that the judges of the Supreme Court , like the judges of other countries , are the mere ministers of despotism ? And , admitting that there was no just foundation for these charges , will any man venture to assert , in the presence of this august tribunal , that the judges of the Supreme Court would have a right to dispatch the Marshal to the extremities of this Union  --  to South Carolina or Louisiana  --  with an attachment , to arrest a printer who had published them ; and that when the offender should be brought before the offended judges , they would have the right to pronounce him guilty of a false and malicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the constitutional guarantees , which secure to every citizen the right " to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the State and District wherein the crime shall have been committed ? " If these things may be , Mr. President , the liberty of the press , the right of public discussion , and the responsibility of public functionaries , are vain delusions ,  --  empty sounds ,  --  that do not " keep the word of promise even to the ear . " But , sir , from my knowledge of the members of that court , and particularly of the Chief Justice , I have not a doubt , that in such a case as I have just supposed , they would unanimously decide that they have no power to try the offender , even in the most solemn form , with the instrumentality of a jury ; and much less to punish him without trial , by the summary process of attachment . They would say with one accord , that such a power is not necessary to protect them from interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the preservation of their characters as judges is a matter of public concernment , that object , important as it undoubtedly is , carl never be promoted by the assumption of a power which would overthrow all the safeguards of liberty , and render the court itself a just object of public abhorrence and detestation . In confirmation of the views I have presented , I beg leave to call the attention of the court to the sedition law of former times  --  a law as notorious in the political history of the country , as it was odious and unpopular in its day . It is very far from my purpose to revive party feelings that have long slumbered , or excite any political prejudices by recurring to this law . My sole object is to deduce some analogies from it , which , in my judgment , have a very decided bearing upon the principal question involved in the present issue . No law of the United States has been more thoroughly investigated , none is better understood than that to which I have referred ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimous opinion of the country  --  without distinction of party  --  that it was palpably unconstitutional and extremely dangerous to public liberty . Public opinion has pronounced /z/ an irreversible judgment upon these points , and if that law has any advocates at this day , I am entirely unacquainted with them . And yet , sir , what were its provisions ? It greatly mitigated the severity and injustice of the common law of England , then of force in most of the States , by permitting the - truth to be given in evidence in cases of libel , and thus exploding the monstrous heresy , that the greater the truth , the greater the libel . It was condemned , not on account of its particular provisions on the subject to which it related , but because it was an unconstitutional assumption , by the federal legislature , of the power to legislate on a subject , which the constitution expressly excluded from its jurisdiction , and thus to transfer from the State , to the federal tribunals , the trial of cases involving " the liberty of speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievance , which awakened the indignation of the whole country . Congress was expressly prohibited by the constitution , from passing any law " abridging the freedom of speech or of the press . " It was only by usurping the power to pass a law directly in the face of this prohibition , that Congress could confer upon the federal courts any authority to assume jurisdiction in cases of libel ; inasmuch as those courts could not take jurisdiction of crimes created by the laws of the States , any more than of those created by the English common law . In pronouncing sentence of condemnation upon this sedition law , the people of the United States have solemnly decided , that . the federal legislature has no power to protect the public functionaries from even the most abusive and licentious exercise of the freedom of the press ; holding , that the State legislatures and State tribunals are more safe depositories of that power . And such is the plain language of the constitution . But what , may it please the court , has Judge Peck done on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is too obvious to be doubted , that he has arbitrarily and unconstitutionally assumed and exercised a power , which the whole legislative authority of the country  --  the President , the Senate and the House of Representatives united  --  could not confer upon him . His usurpation is so glaring an outrage upon the liberty of the press , as to throw the sedition law quite into the shade . Let us for a moment analyze that law , and see how Judge Peck 's usurpation would read as a concluding section . In the first place , it provides that any person who shall publish a false and malicious libel concerning any of the public functionaries of the United States , shall be arraigned and tried before the federal courts . But it is provided that the accused shall enjoy the great privilege of a trial by jury , and that he shall be permitted to prove against the public functionary the truth of the charge alleged to be false and libellous . Now let us suppose that the law in question had concluded with a section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and malicious libel against a federal judge , touching his judicial conduct , and calculated to diminish the public confidence in his capacity or impartiality , should be liable to be tried by the very judge against whom the libel was published , and punished at his arbitrary discretion , by the summary process of attachment , without even an indictment setting forth the imputed libel , or-an impartial jury to pronounce upon its truth or falsehood ! In what terms of indignant eloquence would the patriots of 1798 have denounced this most outrageous provision ? And yet , Mr. President , a power which even the Congress of that day , amidst all the violence of party excitement , would not have dared to confer even upon the judges of the Supreme Court , is boldly and audaciously usurped , without the authority of Congress , by a petty provincial judge , Avho comes here to justify the outrage , by claiming for his official character , the same exemption from scrutiny and responsibility , which the policy of other countries concedes to the character of their hereditary monarchs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his opinions inflexible , or the judiciary will be brought into contempt ! And this is the pressing emergency , which requires that punishment should be inflicted without delay , without trial , and /q/ without law ! Such are the miserable pretences to which tyranny has resorted , in all ages , to palliate its usurpation . They most assuredly will not meet with any countenance from this high tribunal . But the respondent has not only usurped a power which Congress could not confer , but which it has deliberately refused to confer , when legislating on this very subject of contempts . The 17th section of the judiciary act of 1789 , provides " that the judges of the said courts of the United States shall have power among other things to punish by fine or imprisonment , at the discretion of the said courts , all contempts of authority , in any case , or hearing before the It is quite apparent , that it was the design of Congress , to give us power on this subject , beyond the mere self-preserving power of punishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might be calculated to obstruct the current of public justice , in its actual administration . And although I will admit that this is an inherent power , which the courts might have exercised without the express authority of Congress ; and though I will not contend for a rigid application of the maxim , that the expression of one thing , in a grant of power , is the denial of all others ; yet it can not be denied that this act furnishes conclusive evidence of the opinion of Congress , as to the limits , which ought to be prescribed to this power , of punishing for contempts , and as to the cases in which it should be exercised . It would be very extraordinary , indeed , to suppose , that Congress deemed it necessary to confer expressly upon the courts the power of punishing for contempts , in cases of obvious necessity , and yet leave them to assume , by strained and artificial construction , the more dangerous , and less necessary power , of punishing contempts in no way obstructing the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public offences , than as they are calculated to call in question the character of the judges for capacity and integrity . But the act of 1789 not only prescribes the cases in which the courts may punish for a contempt , but the punishment which they may inflict . This is limited to fine and imprisonment . There is no power given , to disfranchise a citizen , by striking him from the roll of attornies , and thus cutting him off from the professional pursuits upon which he depends for the support of himself and his family . This is equivalent to depriving a man of his inheritance ; for a profession without the privilege of pursuing it , is no better than an inheritance without the privilege of enjoying the income . In no civilized country with which I am acquainted , has the power been assumed of striking an attorney from the rolls of the court , for publishing a libel . There is no appropriateness in such a punishment . If a lawyer has been guilty of malversation in his profession , by committing a fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an infamous offence  --  any offence coming within the denomination of criman falsi , he may be justly stricken from the roll . But upon what principle , and to what end is this done ? It is done , sir , upon the ground that the attorney is wholly unworthy of confidence , and to the end that the community no imputation upon Mr. Lawless of any malversation in office , nor is it pretended that he has been guilty of one of those infamous offences , which would prove him to be unworthy of public confidence . His offence is not against his clients , but against the judge . Too much zeal and fidelity , in the case of those clients , and too little respect for the published opinion of the judge , constitute the sole crime for which he has been made the victim of a punishment , which equally violates his rights and the rights of hundreds of his fellow-citizens who were entitled to his professional services . It must be apparent by this time , Mr. President , that the constitution and laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the respondent , but stand directly opposed to the exercise of the power he has assumed in the case of Mr. Lawless . Even the common law of England , if that could be referred to as a source of authority , does not authorize this monstrous doc /z/ trine of the right to punish a contempt against the infallibility of the judge and the sacred majesty of the court . It is true , sir , that in the case of the king against Ahnon  --  which by the by was no case at all , but a mere extrajudicial argument of Chief Justice Wilmot , found among his papers after his death  --  principles of the most unmitigated and unlimited judicial despotism are maintained by a very ingenious tissue of artful reasoning and strained inferences . What is the principle assumed in that argument ? Why , sir , that the king , who , by the theory of the English constitution , can do no wrong , is the fountain of justice ; that , consequently , the judges " sit in the seat of the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these judges , for example , of depriving the subject of the privilege of habeas corpus , was " to accuse the king of violating his coronation oath ! ! " And it is to this miserable jumble of false assumptions , and sophistical inferences , that a District Judge of the United States has ventured to appeal for a justification of his judicial tyranny ! No minion of despotism ever ventured to advance more slavish doctrines , and God forbid that they should produce any other impression upon this court , than to excite a sentiment of unmingled abhorrence . It is distinctly laid down in this argument of Chief Justice Wilmot , that it is not lawful to publish anything , whether true or false , concerning a public functionary , which tends to his disparagement . And it is the private opinion of a judge , who maintains this infamous doctrine , that we are called upon to recognize as a judicial authority , in the highest tribunal known to the constitution and laws of the United States ! It is the distinguishing glory of our institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemption from public scrunity and public censure , that does not equally belong to a private citizen . I go even farther , and contend that many things would be libellous , if alleged against a private citizen , that would not be so , if alleged against a public functionary or a candidate for a public office . In the former case , the follies or the vices of a private man do not concern the public ; and there is no motive to justify their obtrusion into the public prints ; whereas in the latter case , the public have a deep interest in the free and fearless discussion of the conduct and character of publie men . It is a right essential to the enforcement of political responsibility . In this view of the subject , there is hardly any latitude of licentiousness , which it were not better to indulge , in canvassing the conduct of public men , than to run the hazard of restricting the liberty of discussion and the freedom of the press , under the color of restraining its abuse . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two elementary writers , on the common law of England , from which I think it will be manifest , that Judge Peck can find no warrant for his proceedings , even in that code . I admit that there is some apparent discrepancy between the dicta of elementary writers ; but I am not aware of any English adjudication , that comes in conflict with the principles 1 am about to lay down on the authority of Hawkins ; a writer not certainly remarkable for his leaning against the power of the crown , and in favor of the liberty of the subject . It is true that Judge Blackstone , with whose work we are all familiar , as a text book , and whose principles many of us have unfortunately imbibed , in the course of our professional education , speaks loosely and vaguely of the power of the courts to punish for what he denominates consequential contempts . But this is the mere dictum of a writer , notorious for pushing prerogative to its extremest limits , and entirely unsupported by any English decision that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authorities in Hawkins . In the first volume of his Pleas of the Crown , ch. 6. sec. 12. it is laid down , " That it was formerly holden that a man might be indicted for a slander of the justice of the nation , by reflecting on a sentence given in any court Ecclesiastical or Temporal . " Chap . 13 . " But it seems the better opinion of this day , that a man can not be indicted for any scandalous or contemptuous words , spoken of or to such officers , not being in the actual execution of their office ; " /q/ as for saying " that such an order was a numskull order , and that the justice deserves to be hanged who made it . " It will not be pretended that there is anything in the publication of Mr. Lawless , that will bear any comparison with the words just quoted , for harshness and severity ; words which an English subject might use to the very face of a judge , with perfect impunity , unless they should be addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Holt upon the law of libels , it is laid down that the opinions of the judges are fairly subject to criticism and even to censure , provided that improper motives be not imputed . Both these writers , however , seem to have regarded it as a matter of course , that libels against judges , like all other libels , were to be punished only by indictment and trial by jury . Mr. McDuffie having proceeded thus far , the court adjourned to to-morrow at J 2 o'clock . /z/ The United States vs . James H. Peck . Tuesday , Dec. 21 . The court having been opened by proclamation , the managers , accompanied by the House of Representatives , attended . James H. Peck , the respondent , and his counsel , also attended . Mr. McDuffie resumed and concluded the opening of the cause on the part of the United States , as follows :  --  With a view to demonstrate that the respondent , in the exercise of an usurped power , has committed a wanton and unprovoked outrage upon Mr. Lawless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an analytical review of the publication signed " A Citizen ; " and if I am not grossly deceived , it will be manifest , that there is not one word in that publication , in the slightest degree disrespectful to the Judge , or which misrepresents his published opinion , in any one material particular . And before I have done , I think this honorable Court will be satisfied , that the conduct of Judge Peck towards Mr. Lawless , and the extraordinary process of hypercritical cavilling by which he has managed to distort a perfectly innocent publication into a false and defamatory libel , exhibit all the characteristic features of judicial tyranny . Surely , Mr. President , nothing but the disordered imagination of a judge , infuriated by his excited passions , could have tortured the plain and inoffensive language of this publication into that monstrous " congeries of ridiculous absurdity , " which he has drawn from it . And I solemnly declare , that if I did know the very able and respectable counsel who appear for the respondent , and take it for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have received their consent at least , if not their entire approbation ,  --  1 should come to the conclusion , from reading that defence , that Judge Peck labored under some unaccountable derangement , in regard to this transaction . In the conclusion of the opinion which he published in the case of Soulard 's heirs , he states , after adverting to the novelty of the questions involved in it , " that counsel would not be excluded from again stirring any of the points which had been therein decided , when they might subsequently arise in any other case . " Mr. Lawless , in the commencement of his publication , refers to this concluding remark of the Judge  --  as I humbly conceive , in a spirit of unbecoming deference and humility , rather than of disrespect and contempt  --  as a permission from the Judge to examine his Opinion . He says , " I observe that though the Judge has thought proper to decide against the claim , he leaves the ground of his decree open for further discussion . " And then proceeds : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the opinion , so published , to be a fair subject of examination by any one who feels himself interested in or aggrieved by its operation , I beg leave to point the attention of the public to some /z/ of the principal errors , which I think that I have discovered in it . " Now , would any man of plain common sense , not frenzied by his passions , have discovered matter of mortal offence in this very courteous and respectful introduction to the subject ? Yet Judge Peck , with all that suspicious jealousy , whicjfr characterizes a tyrant doubting his own pretensions and feeling their insecurity , seizes upon " trifles light as air , " to prove the contemptuous design of Mr. Lawless . He discovers a most malicious sneer in the phrase , " although the Judge has thought proper to decide against the claim . " How dare Mr. Lawless to say Judge Peck " thought proper to decide against the claim ! " He also discovers a most wanton and palpable perversion , in stating , that " he had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and in adding the words , " availing myself , therefore , of this permission . " Who , exclaims the Judge , would not believe from this " that the Judge was so profoundly ignorant of what belonged , not only to the dignity , but even to the decency of the judicial character , as to have invited a general discussion of his Opinion in the newspapers ? " And who  --  I must be permitted to add ,  --  could be so " profoundly suspicious , " as to put any such construction upon the language of Mr. Lawless ? After very gravely complaining that he was accused by Mr. Lawless of having erred in certain " assumjitions , as well of fact , as of doctrine , " and formally denying that he " assumed any position as a postulate , " all being " bottomed on evidence or deduced by argument , "  --  after this ridiculous and puerile criticism upon the word " assumption , " the Judge proceeds to the separate examination of each of the specifications in the article signed " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imputed to the respondent in these words : " That by the ordinance of 1754 , a sub-delegate was prohibited from making'a grant for services , rendered or to be rendered . " Here the respondent says , he is falsely charged with having said that the ordinance of 1754 contained a positive prohibition on the sub-delegates from making grants in reward for services . Now , this court will perceive , that no such charge is made against the respondent . It is not stated that the ordinance contained a positive prohibition , nor is that inference fairly deducible from the words used by Mr. Lawless . What was the real question at issue , and what did the Judge decide ? When we have ascertained these facts , it will be seen that Mr. Lawless represented the Opinion of the court with substantial accuracy . The concession made to Soulard , of the land in dispute , was issued in consideration of public services rendered ; and it was contended by the claimant , that it had been the uniform practice of the sub-delegates to make such concessions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General , who thus recognized their validity . Judge Peck decided that by the ordinance of 1754 " no confirmations should be made , except upon sales , or compromises for a consideration in money , " and that , consequently , the uniform practice of the sub-delegates could avail nothing against these express provisions and requirements of the ordinance . Now if to direct that " no confirmation should be made , except upon sales or compromises for a consideration in money " but not to " prohibit a subdelegate from making a grant in consideration of services , rendered or to be rendered , " I certainly do not know how to estimate the force of the English language . But it seems that Mr. Lawless suppressed the fact that the Judge decided that the ordinance of 1754 was not in force in Louisiana , and also the reasoning by which the Judge came to his conclusion . Mr. Lawless does not profess to give the reasoning of the Judge , nor to state every position of law or of fact laid down by him . And yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , for omitting , what he was under no sort of obligation to state . If the fact alleged to be suppressed had been inconsistent with the one stated , there would have been some foundation for the charge . But the respondent contends that he did not say that , by the ordinance of 1754 , a sub-delegate was prohibited from making a grant for services ; that he only said the ordinance did not authorize such a grant . /q/ Now , taking a full view of the ordinance and the Opinion , I will not undertake to say that Mr. Lawless has followed the most approved models of English composition . With due deference , I must say , that I do not think the word " prohibit " is precisely the most appropriate word to communicate the idea he evidently intended to convey ; though the words of the Opinion justify the use of it . But the most cavilling critcism can do nothing more than convict Mr. Lawless of violating the strict rules of grammatical propriety ; of committing a blunder which is of very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Scotch Irish residents . Where the law regulating the granting of land , for example , authorizes grants with certain limitations and conditions , it would be said , that the law prohibits a grant in any other cause ; meaning that the requirements of the law are incompatible with such a grant . In like manner , it is a common mode of expression , with the persons to whom I have alluded , when they mean to assert that they are under no obligation to do a certain thing , to say , " they have no right to do it . " What the sentence pronounced upon Mr. Lawless would have been had he perpetrated this latter violation of the king 's English , it is difficult to conjecture . As Judge Peck seems to imagine himself " in the seat of the king , administering his justice , " he may also think himself bound to punish any outrage upon his standard English , thus constituting himself a high court of criticism , with power to inflict fine , forfeiture and imprisonment , by the summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second specification in the offensive article . 2 . It is in these words : " That a sub-delegate in Louisiana , was not a sub-delegate as contemplated by the above ordinance . " Here , says the respondent , the Judge is exhibited in the light of assuming the ridiculous solecism , " that a sub-delegate is not a sub-delegate ! " One of the plainest sentences in the English language , of which the meaning must be obvious to every reader , at the first glance , is thus tortured by the most downright judicial quibbling , into a palpable contradiction in terms . Judge Peck decided that the Lieutenant Governor , who exercised the functions of sub-delegate in Louisiana , was not appointed in the manner prescribed by the ordinance of 1754 ; and consequently , that although he did exercise the functions of sub-delegate , in certain cases , he could not be recognized as a sub-delegate under the said ordinance . Surely no one but Judge Peck himself would have thought of drawing any other inference than this from the language of Mr. Lawless . 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Reilly 's regulations , made in February , 1770 , can be considered as demonstrative of the extent of the granting power , either of the Governor General or the sub-delegates , under the royal order of August , 1770 . " The respondent first gives a strained and unnatural construction to this specification , and then pronounces it a gross and flagrant misrepresentation , calculated to bring the court into contempt and ridicule. - Interpolating words and ideas of his own , he makes Mr. Lawless say , that the regulations of O'Reilly were " in themselves , demonstrative of the whole extent of the granting power . " This court will clearly perceive that Mr. Lawless neither said nor meant any such thing . The word " demonstrative , " is equivalent to the phrase " tending to demonstrate . " The error imputed to Judge Peck , therefore , in this specification , was simply that of maintaining that O'Reilly 's regulations of February , 1770 , could be considered as having any tendency at all to indicate the extent of the granting power , under the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say in what attitude of contempt and ridicule the Judge is here presented ; but I do maintain that it is the very attitude in which he has placed himself . He does distinctly contend that the previous order of February , aids the construction of the subsequent order of August , adding these express words : " That the regulations of O'Reilly are of a date anterior to the order of the king of 1770 ; does not appear to affect their authority . " /z/ 4 . The fourth specification : " That the royal order of August , 1770 , ( as recited or referred to in the preamble of the regulations of Morales of 1799 ) related exclusively to the Governor General . " Now Judge Peck admits in his defence , what is evident from his Opinion , that he did maintain , that the royal order of 1770 , so far as it regarded the authority to grant the royal domain , did relate exclusively to the Governor Genral ; he being vested by that order with the exclusive power of granting lands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern with any other power of the Governor General than that of granting land  --  meant only to be understood as imputing to the Judge , the opinion that the order of 1770 " related exclusively to the Governor General , " so far as it regarded that power . In the case of Soulard , no other power of the Governor General or of the Spanish authorities in Louisiana , was involved ; and it is utterly absurd to suppose that Mr. Lawless could have referred to any other . Yet Judge Peck , with the ingenious perversity which pervades his whole defence , pretends to understand Mr. Lawless as ascribing to him the assumption , that the order of 1770 related exclusively to the Governor General , in all its provisions , whether they related to the granting of lands , or the most petty regulations of local police ! If anything can exceed the absurdity of this construction , it is that placed upon the next specification . 5 . " That the word c mercedes ' in the ordinance of 1754 , which , in the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowed down by anything in that ordinance , or any other law , to the idea of a grant to an Indian , or a reward to an informer , and much less to a mere sale for money . " In this specification Judge Peck seems to think Mr Lawless has reached the grand climax of contemptuous misrepresentations and violated majesty ; and I must be permitted to say , that , in his comments upon it , the respondent has reached the very climax of judicial cavilling and absurdity . Mr. Lawless had maintained that the word " mercedes , " in the preamble of the ordinance of 1754 , meant " gifts , " and that , therefore , the body of the ordinance  --  the enacting part  --  should receive such a liberal construction , as to include grants for services , as well as sales or grants for money , or otherwise there would be a discrepancy between the preamble , and the enactments of the ordinance . Judge Peck replied in his Opinion , that the word " mercedes " did not necessarily mean " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean " grants ; " but that even if it did necessarily mean gifts , " effect was sufficiently given to it in this sense , " by those provisions of the ordinance which relate to gifts to Indians , grants to towns , and rewards to informers . Now , Mr. Lawless , in this specification , imputes to the Judge , in very plain language , precisely what he decided . And not only is there no misrepresentation calculated to bring the court into contempt and ridicule , but , in my judgment , it is apparent from the very face of the statement of Mr. Lawless , that the Judge was correct in the assumption which Mr. Lawless imputes to him as an error . But the respondent , in the true spirit of a tyrant , in the very delirium of a jealous and suspicious tyranny , has strained and tortured this charge , by a tissue of absurd inferences , into what he denominates " a congeries of most ridiculous absurdities ; " and then , turning round upon these phantoms of his own disordered fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he denounces Mr. Lawless in terms , not very well becoming the " dignity and the decency of the judicial character , " for making such monstrous imputations against him . The first in this congeries of absurdities supposed to be imputed by Mr. Lawless is , that the respondent assumed , that the word " mercedes " meant " gifts . " Now , any man familiar with common English and common sense , will perceive at the first glance , that Mr. Lawless does not impute to Judge Peck anything like the opinion , that mercedes means gifts . It is obviously Mr. Lawless himself , who expresses this opinion ; and the error he imputes to Judge Peck is , that he narrowed it down , so as to make it mean a grant to an Indian , a reward to an /q/ informer , or a sale tor money . The next absurdity imputed by this specification to the respondent , as he alleges in his answer , is , that he conceded , that the ordinance of 1754 conveyed to the sub-delegates an unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any cause , and yet narrowed down this unlimited power to a grant to an Indian , a reward to an informer , or a sale for money ! Now all this is the merest fabrication of the respondent , for which there is not a shadow of foundation in the article of Mr ! Lawless . There is no such absurd contradiction in that article , as " an unlimited power , limited by construction . " Its whole import is that the word " mercedcs " in the preamble of the ordinance , means gifts ; and that Judge Peck narrowed down the meaning of that word , so as to limit the granting power to a certain description of gifts , and to grants for money . And in this imputation , Mr. Lawless is clearly sustained by the Opinion of the Judge . 6 . The sixth specification : " That O'Reilly 's regulations were , in their terms , applicable , or were in fact applied to or published in Upper Louisiana . " Here we have another of the respondent 's wretched quibbles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misrepresentation . The argument had been used at the bar , in the case of Soulard , that O'Reilly 's regulations were not of force in Upper Louisiana , not being applicable to the peculiar situation of that part of the province . Judge Peck decided , that they " were made for the whole province , " and insisted that their policy was as applicable to the upper as the lower divisions of it . Yet he now gravely contends that he did not say the regulations were " in their terms " extended to Upper Louisiana . I beg to know how they were extended there at all , if it were not by their terms ? But Mr. Lawless only ascribes to Judge Peck the assumption that these regulations " were in their terms applicable , " or " were in fact applied " to Upper Louisiana . He certainly decided one or the other of the alternative propositions . 7 . The seventh specification : " That the regulations of O'Reilly have any bearing on the grant to Antoine Soulard , or that such a grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawless is here wantonly perverted by the respondent , and he is most absurdly represented , as imputing it as an assumption of the Judge , " that the regulations of O'Reilly authorized the grant to Soulard , " the very reverse of what is obviously intended . If the grant to Soulard were to be governed by the regulations of O'Reilly , it would be void ; and Mr. Lawless had contended that this grant did not come within the purview of those regulations , or in his own words , was not contemplated by them . Judge Peck held the opposite opinion , and Mr. Lawless imputes nothing more to him , in the short sentence under consideration . 8 . The eighth specification : " That the limitation to a league square of grants to new settlers in Opelousas , Attakapas , and Natchitoches ( in 8th article of O'Reilly 's regulations ) prohibits a larger grant in Upper Louisiana . " Here again , as in the first specification , Mr. Lawless may be liable to be ar- raigned before a court of competent jurisdiction for violating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that as the regulations limited grants of land to a league square in Opelousas , Attakapas , and Natchitoches r he saw no reason why  --  as " the regulations were intended for the province at large "  --  grants of land should be unlimited in Upper Louisiana . In a word r he made a constructive limitation of the granting power in Upper Louisiana , which he deduced from the limitations expressly prescribed for other parts of the province . Now this , to be sure , was not deciding that the 8th article of the regulations expressly prohibited grants for more than a league square in Upper Louisiana - r but it was undoubtedly asserting a virtual or constructive prohibition ; and this is obviously what , by the very terms of the specification , Mr. Lawless intended . /z/ 9 . The ninth specification : " That the regulations of the Governor Gen-eral , Gayoso , dated 9th September , 1797 , entitled ' instructions to be observed for the admission of new settlers , ' prohibit in future , a grant for services , or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made in 1796 , and not located or surveyed until 1804 . " Now , though the respondent asserts that not one word of this specification is true , this court will perceive , on comparing it with the Opinion , that every word of it is true . It imputes to the Judge precisely what he decided , saving and excepting the Scotch Irish use of the word " prohibit . " The Judge decided that " these regulations contain provisions not to be reconciled " with a power in the Lieutenant Governor to make this concession ; and that , therefore , his official act , which , if it had stood alone , would have been regarded as prima facie evidence of the existence of the power in question , could not be so regarded , in the face of provisions incompatible with it . The regulations , therefore , in the opinion of Judge Peck , made void a grant which would have been valid had they not been in existence . But he complains of misrepresentation on another point . Mr. Lawless imputes to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have the effect of annulling the grant to Soulard , which was made in 1796 . The Judge unquestionably did so decide , with this exception only , that he used the term " forfeit " in place of " annul . " And he said expressly , " that the regulations are of a date subsequent to the concession , forms no reason why they may not impose duties on the claimant , and prescribe forfeitures for a failure toperform those duties . " Now I can not perceive the difference between annulling a grant and declaring it void by forfeiture . If the great political doctrine of nullification  --  very much discussed of late  --  had been at that time agitated , Judge Peck might have had some grounds for supposing that Mr. Lawless designed to impute it to him . In that view only , could the difference be material . As to the distinction which he now makes , between the prospective and retroactive operation of the regulations  --  between " striking back at the grant , " and striking forward at it  --  between annulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however just that distinction may be , it is not to be found either in the opinion of the Judge , or in the article of Mr. Lawless . 10 . The tenth specification : " That the complete titles made by Gayoso are not to be referred to , as affording the construction made by Gayoso himself , of his own regulations . " 14 . The fourteenth specification : " That the language of Morales himself , in the complete titles issued by him , on concessions made by the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana , anterior to the date of his regulations , ought not to be referred to , as furnishing the construction which he , Morales , put upon his own regulations . " Both of these specifications are s/q/
