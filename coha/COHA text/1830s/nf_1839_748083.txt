txt On the 12th of March , 1838 , Me . Samuel B. RugGLES , Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means , of the Assembly of the State of New-York submitted to the House the following /z/ on the United States Deposite Fund , and on the recommendation of the Comptroller to levy a direct tax . Mr. Ruggles , from the standing committee of ways and means , to whom were referred so much of the annual message of his excellency the Governor , as relates to the surplus revenues of the United States deposited with this State , and also the annual report of the Comptroller , upon the finances , begs leave , in respect to that portion of the message , and also in respect to that portion of the Comptroller 's report which recommends the imposition of a direct tax , to submit the following Report : That under the act of Congress , passed June 28 , 1836 , which directed the surplus moneys in the /z/ treasury of the United States , beyond the amount of five millions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $3,974,520 71 has been paid over to this State , being three-fourths of the moneys which it was entitled to receive under that law . By virtue of the subsequent act of Congress , passed October 2 , 1837 , which directed the transfer of the remaining fourth to be postponed until the first day of January , 1839 , the residue of those moneys , amounting to $1,338,000 , has hitherto been withheld ; and whether it will be paid at the time specified in that act , may for the present be regarded as doubtful . Serious differences of opinion have prevailed in respect to the expediency of thus depositing the surplus revenue with the States ; and if the sentiments of those who believe it more politic for the federal government to retain it , shall happen to prevail , the fourth instalment may possibly be permanently withheld from this State . It is not , however , reasonably to be anticipated , that the money already received will be withdrawn . The act of June 23 , 1836 , which directed the deposite to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , " should be wanted by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States " to meet appropriations by law , it should be called for upon certain notice mentioned in the act ; but the subsequent law of October 2 , 1837 , provided that the amount thus deposited should remain with the States , " until otherwise directed by Congress . " It can not be deemed probable , that a majority of the States represented in the National Congress , will direct the withdrawal of these moneys . Whatever may have been the literal provisions of the law , directing these moneys to be " deposited " with the States , the intention of those who passed it evidently was to secure a permanent distribution , and not a temporary loan of the surplus revenues . In fact the doctrine on that subject , as it was first advanced by President Jackson himself , plainly contemplated an irrevocable appropriation . In his message to Congress , in 1829 , he declared that " the most safe , just , and federal disposition which could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the several States , according to their ratio of representation : "  --  and in the message of the subsequent year , he removed all doubts as to his intention in that respect , by stating , that in his prior message , he had felt it to be his duty " to recommend the adoption of some plan for the distribution of the surplus funds among the States , in proportion to the number of their representatives , to be applied by them for objects of internal improvement . " The sentiments thus promulgated at Washington , were distinctly responded to and adopted by the Governor of this State , in his annual message to the Legislature , in the year 1830 ; in which , after speaking of the funds to be derived from the surplus revenue , as " applicable to the extension of our public works , " he says that " there can be no valid objection to the distribution of the surplus revenue among the States , to be disposed of at their discretion . " The same chief magistrate , in the succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished predecessors ( Governor Clinton , ) had alluded to the same subject in his message in 1827 , renewed the suggestion contained in his former communication ; and pressed it earnestly upon the consideration of the Legislature . A committee of the Senate in the same year , reported that in their judgment , the proposed distribution was " a matter of the first importance ; " and for the reason , among others , that it would enable the State , in prosecuting her works of internal improvem.ent , " to satisfy the just claims of all her citizens . " The committee fully concur in the soundness of the opinions thus expressed , in respect to the distribution of these moneys ; and in their judgment , the receipt by this State , of the large sum of $ ' 3,974,520 71 thus allotted to it , whatever may be the opinions of those who doubt the expediency of the measure , ought to be a subject of unmixed congratulation . Without pretending to question the obligation of this State to repay the money thus deposited , whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may nevertheless , be assumed that no reasonable probability exists that it will ever be thus demanded . Of the several states which have received their respective portions , amounting in the aggregate to nearly forty millions of dollars , the greater number have already appropriated it to objects of a permanent nature , from which it can not be withdrawn without serious injury and inconvenience . Many of the States have expended it in works of internal improvement , or in paying debts previously incurred for that purpose. - In some instances it has been loaned to their citizens ; while one example , at least , is presented , in which it has been actually distributed , numerically , among all the inhabitants of the State . In nearly all these instances , the repayment of the money , if called for by Congress , will become inconvenient and oppressive to the people of those States , and can only be made by incurring a debt or imposing burthensome taxes . Under these circumstances , therefore , it may be safely predicted , that a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , will hesitate long before they consent to withdraw from the States the moneys thus distributed ; but on the contrary , that they will prefer ( in case it should be found necessary ) to replenish the treasury by temporary loans in anticipation of the revenue . The committee , therefore , wholly dissent from the opinion expressed by the joint committee of /z/ the last Legislature , upon the subject of this deposite fund , that the pecuniary means which it has furnished to the State , should be regarded as merely " temporary , " and that the period of repayment is " not far remote . " On the contrary , they are well satisfied , that the sum of $3,974,520 71 thus acquired , will never be withdrawn ; and they recommend , that in all measures of legislation , it should " be treated as a portion of the permanent property of the State . The amount so received , has been loaned under the law of the last session , upon mortgage , to the citizens of this State , and yields a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then arises  --  How shall that income be appropriated ? It may be used in either of three modes . First , in defraying the ordinary expenses of supporting the government ; or , secondly , in paying the interest on debts created , or to be created , for works of internal improvement ; or , thirdly , in providing for public instruction , and the diffusion of knowledge . It is not the province , or the intention of the committee , to estimate the comparative merits of these important objects . The duty of providing adequately for the education of the people , and that of furnishing the means of cheap and easy intercourse between the different sections of the /z/ State , are equally pressing and imperative . If the Legislature should be satisfied , however , that the State possesses other resources for prosecuting , with vigour and effect , all its necessary works of internal improvement , no question need arise as to the propriety of appropriating the whole of this sum , ( large as it may be deemed , ) to the gratifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But before such an appropriation shall be permanently made , it ought to be distinctly understood , that the other means of the State are , and will continue to be , entirely sufficient to satisfy the claims of that large portion of its population , whose welfare is depending upon the proper extension of its works of internal improvement . The original intention of the State , in procuring the distribution of the surplus revenues , evidently was to apply its portion " to the extension of our public works ; " and until it shall be satisfactorily ascertained , that this great duty may be otherwise adequately discharged , it may well be doubted whether these funds ought to be wholly appropriated to any other object , however meritorious . It is believed that an attentive examination of the pecuniary resources of the State will satisfactorily demonstrate its ability to prosecute and extend its system of public works on the most liberal scale , w ithout resorting for aid to the fund in question : and the investigation of this point has occupied the anxious attention of the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also the future fiscal condition of the State , as its aspect may be varied from time to time by the progress of the public works . The want of a definite and well-digested system , by which to prosecute our measures of internal improvement in regular and proper succession , increases the difficulty of accurately estimating the future condition of the treasury . The movements of the State , for the last few years at least , have been irregular and disconnected , yielding only to occasional impulses , and proceeding without much plan or method . A struggle for some time has been going on between the friends of a vigorous system of internal improvements , and those who deny its expediency or safety ; and our legislation has fluctuated according to the prevalence of one or the other of these contending opinions . It is not necessary or desirable to enter at this time into the particulars of this controversy , and it is alluded to only to explain the difficulty which it occasions in predicting , with that precision which could be desired , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend truly the present situation of our finances , and correctly to estimate our future progiess , it will be useful to revert to the condition of the treasury when the canal policy was commenced . Our financial history , during the last twenty /z/ years , is indeed replete with instruction . Within that eventful period we behold the origin , progress , and final success of those great measures of internal improvement , which have overcome not only the barriers of nature , but the more formidable obstacles of prejudice , incredulity , and error , and which are destined , in the latter respect at least , to achieve victories yet more signal . No fact in all that history is more striking than the remarkable failure of our distinguished men adequately to estimate the pecuniary value of the canals . The most sanguine anticipations of the most enthusiastic supporters of our policy of internal improvement , fell far short of the actual results which that policy has produced ; while the doubts and forebodings of its opponents , are remembered only as curious portions of our intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latent strength . In the present plenitude of our success , the fact is hardly credible , and yet the documents of the day testify , that before commencing the canals , the Legislature by a deliberate act , directed commissioners to solicit pecuniary donations in aid of the enterprise , not only from Connecticut and Vermont , but even from the States , then in their infancy , beyond the Alleghanies : and so far was this timid and discreditable policy pursued , that the very preamble to the law of 1817 , which finally directed the canals to be commenced , took /z/ care to express the humble hope , that the States interested in the work , " would contribute their full proportion of the expense . " The torrent of ridicule and obloquy which the canals encountered , during the first few years of their progress , as well as the more solemn doubts of some of our ablest statesmen , will long be remembered . Without adverting to names less distinguished , it needs but to state the memorable fact that Mr. Jefferson pronounced the undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a century in advance of the age . " Nor did the more decided friends of the canals appreciate in any just degree , their pecuniary value . In the year 1821 , four years after they had been commenced , the Comptroller of the State , in obedience to a resolution of the Legislature , prepared an estimate of their respective revenues , in which he stated , that for the ten years next succeeding their completion , the tolls would amount annually to one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ! The amount which was actually received during that period often years , exceeded ten millions of dollars . Among the names truly illustrious in the early history of our public works , few are more distinguished than that of Gouverneur Morris . His comprehensive intellect and ardent temperament enabled him to look far beyond most of his contemporaries into the rapidly expanding future ; and yet even he fell short of the realities which the Erie canal has /z/ brought within our view . In the siniularly eloquent and animated memorial by which his fame is forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavoured to enforce upon the Legislature the importance in all future time of connecting the Hudson with the western waters , after depicting the wide spread region around our inland seas , and its capacity to supply the means of a great and profitable commerce , he asked whether it would be deemed extravagant to predict that the canal , within twenty years , " would annually bringdown 250,000 tons ? " The actual amount which reached the tide in 1838 , was 697,347 tons , or nearly three-fold the quantity estimated by Mr. Morris ; and the total tonnage of that year , ascending and descending , exceeded thirteen hundred thousand tons . The tolls of the canals in 1824 , one year before their completion , were s340,000 . In the next year they reached $566,000 , and rose in 1826 to With the rapid progress thus strikingly exhibited , few of our citizens were inclined to believe that the canals had impoverished the treasury , or that they would prove in any way injurious to the pecuniary interests of the State . The subject was , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and unexpected light . In that year , the canal committee of the Senate , of which Mr. Silas Wright , jr. , was chairman , introduced into that body a report , made avowedly for the purpose /z/ of drawing the attention of the public to the effect which the construction of the canals had produced upon the finances of the State , and of generally diffusing among our citizens a knowledge of the real situation of the public funds . It announced that " an alarming change had taken place in the public funds "  --  that the school fund was annually " charsfins ; the State with a debt of $15,000 "  - -  that the literature fund was " no longer able to answer the calls which the interests of education required should be made upon it "  --  that the actual income of the canals was " highly exaggerated in the public opinion "  --  that their gross receipts for the year 1826 , without any deduction for expenses , were but 752,000 , and paid an interest of only 6 i " , per cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State for the canals then made or making " would more probably be enlarged than lessened at the end of the year "  --  that " so long as it thus continued to increase , its final payment was not even approaching "  --  that " unless assisted by auxiliary funds , the canals would not pay their own interest and expenses , and redeem their debt within any reasonable time , if they would ever do / "  --  that " the debt , with the whole aid of those funds , could not be paid off in a great number of years yet to come "  --  and finally , that any appropriations by the State for the purpose of constructing other works , unless they should be more productive than the Erie and Champlain canals , would " hasten the period when direct taxation must be resorted to . " /z/ The feeling of despondency which this celebrated document produced among the friends of internal improvement , not only in this State , but throughout the Union , is well recollected : and 3-et it is somewhat surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted themsolves for a moment to be misled by the financial view which the report professed to take . Its fallacy was obvious  --  consisting in the total omission to take into the account , the prospective , but certain and inevitable increase in the growth of the country , and the trade of the canals , and in assuming the receipts of 1826 as an immutable basis . It is needless to add , that the friends of internal improvement made a resolute , though ineffectual struo ; o:le asfainst the doctrines and tendencies of this report . The late Governor Clinton , on the assembling of the Legislature in the year 1828 , labored earnestly in his annual message to disabuse the public mind . He declared that " the real condition of the finances had been greatly discoloured and misunderstood by inaccurate views and partial examinations "  --  that " fallacious statements had been mingled with the subject "  --  that " the constant and progressive increase of the canal revenue , and the correspondent diminution of the debt , would in a few years produce its total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depreciate the utility and arrest the progress of internal improvements , were equall ' astonishing and mortifying "  --  that " the means /z/ ol the State were ample , her resources great , and her credit equal to any emergency , " and he renewed , " in the most earnest manner , his recommendations in favour of the leading objects which he had presented in his former communications . " The death of this great man in February of that year , withdrew from the cause of internal improvement its ablest champion , and the loss has been severely felt by the people of this State . The predictions of his last message as to the progressive increase of the tolls , and the extinguishment of the debt , have been fully realized . The annual tolls , which in 1826 were $762,167 , ( or according to the statement of Mr. Wright about 1752,000 , ) amounted , in 1833 , to 1 , 542 , 695 , although the rates had previously been reduced nearly 20 per cent . ; and in the year 1835 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the 1st day of July , 1836 , the tolls had accumulated in the hands of the commissioners to an amount sufficient ( with the aid of the auxiliary funds previously realized from the salt and auction duties ) to extinguish the whole of the outstanding debt . Previously to that time , upwards of four millions of dollars had been paid in cash directly to the public creditors ; and the residue , amounting to between three and four millions , was then invested /z/ in temporary loans by the Commissioners , as trustees for the holders of the balance of the debt . This final consummation may justly be regarded as the crowning event in the canal policy of the State , and fixes an important epoch in its fiscal history . It affords , moreover , an opportunity peculiarly fitting , not only to review the progress of our treasury since the commencement of our canals , but also to examine how far the view of the finances taken by the committee of the Senate , in the report of 1827 , has been borne out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canals were commenced , the funds of this State consisted of , 1 .

" When the canals were commenced in 1817 , another special fund was created for the security of the public creditors of whom money should be borrowed for the construction of the canals , designated as the " Canal Fund , " and consisting of the salt and auction duties above mentioned , the tolls to be received from the canals when constructed , and some other items of minor amount . The establishment of this latter fund conse- /z/ qusntly diverted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction duties , amounting to $239,937 , and reduced the net income of the State from $419,907 65 , as above stated , to about $180,000 annually . A tax had previously been laid on the whole property of the State , to defray the expenses of the war , which had recently terminated . That tax was continued at a reduced rate , until the year 1823 , and was applied , together with the annual income of $180,000 above mentioned , to the payment of the ordinary expenses of the government . In 1828 , the rapid increase in the canal tolls began to exhibit itself as is above stated , and the State tax was then discontinued , upon the ground that the principal of the remaining balance of $2,740,001 51 , would sustain the government until the debt for which the salt and auction duties and canal tolls were pledged should be extinguished , and that those revenues would then be liberated and placed at the service of the State . Between that time and the year 1836 , the whole of that balance was accordingly expended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amounting to . . $2,740,001 51 and the State also borrowed the bank safety fund , amounting to . . 416,532 43 Making in all , $3,156,533 94 /z/ Of this amount , a portion exceeding J ' 500,000 was expended in erecting the State Hall and the State Prisons . The amount of the salt and auction duties which were received , between the years 1817 and 1836 , by the Commissioners of the Canal Fund , and paid over to the public creditors , and which , if they had not been so applied , would have been used during that time for the ordinary purposes of the government , exceeds ; so that although the above sum of 94 was thus expended , the salt and auction duties remain to the amount of the virtually invested in the canals , and stand as a substitute for the /z/ In the year 1832 , in order to extinguish a claim of John Jacob Astor to hinds in Putnam county , sold by the State , and the title to which had proved defective , a debt was created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1825 , the State has also created debts in constructing lateral canals , which remain outstanding , viz : For the Oswego canal , Cayuga and Seneca , 237 , COO Chemung , 3I(),000 Crooked Lake , 120,000 Chenango , 2,270,000 /z/ And it has commenced the construction of the Black llivor cuial and the G'caasee Valley canal , and created debts on those accounts , lor .... 9D,920 Making the total existing debt for lateral canals , $3 , o55,224 Between the years 1817 and 1837 , the Common School Fund was increased from . 982,242 26 to $1,916,647 68 , and the Literature Fund from 126,696 10 to $268,092 87 . On the first of January , 1837 , the productive property of the State consisted of the canals :  - -  which produced a net revenue in the year 1836 , ( after deducting all expenses of collection , and of maintenance and repairs , ) of 30 ; equivalent to an annual income at 5 per cent , on a principal of $22,157,742 The debts of the State now are : To the Bank Fund , $416 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canals , .... 3,55.5,224 /z/ Which , deducted from the productive property as above , leaves a balance of $17,624,986 The income of the State may then be estimated as follows : /z/ Nett revenue from the canals as above , . . $1,107,871 30 The revenue of 183C is assumed in this estimate , for the reason that the tolls of J 837 were reduced by accidental and temporary causes .

It would naturally be supposed , that the signal success which has attended the prosecution of our canal policy , would have removed all opposition to the extension of a system which has produced such prosperous and profitable results : and /z/ yet there are still to be found within this State , individuals of respectability and influence who zealously maintain that the treasury has been impoverished and exhausted by our public works : that the extension of the system will impose grievous and everlasting burthens upon the people :  --  and that " internal improvement , " ( in the often repeated phrase of a distinguished advocate of these opinions , ) " is but another name for eternal taxation . " Upon what ground this strange doctrine rests , is really not easy to discover . The State , within the last twenty years , has quadrupled its productive property ; relieved its citizens from taxation , and now enjoys a clear annual revenue of nearly eight hundred thousand dollars ; and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as impoverished or exhausted , is wholly beyond the comprehension of the committee . The supporters of this doctrine , however , allege that the " General Fund " is squandered , and gone ;  - -  that the State has no other fund to which it can legally resort ;  --  and , therefore , that the treasury is exhausted , and taxation has become necessary . But neither of these propositions is founded in fact . The General Fund is neither squandered nor gone , but now exists in full vigour , invested in the canals , and in that shape yields an ample revenue to the treasury ; and it is no more lost than the seed is lost , which , when sown , produces an abundant harvest . The treasury , in fact , is overflowing with the tolls derived from the canals ; /z/ and to those tolls the state may now legally and properly resort , for the purpose , not only of meeting all its present obligations , but of extending the benefits of internal improvement to those hitherto neglected portions of its population , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the canals were constructed . But it has been contended that these revenues are placed " wholly beyond the reach " of the representatives of the people : and upon the ground that the ICth clause of the seventh section of the Constitution of 1821 , has declared that the tolls shall not be " reduced or diverted " at any time before the " full and complete payment " of the moneys borrowed for the construction of the Erie and Champlain canals : and it is averred , that in point of fact , those moneys have not been fully and completely paid , according to the literal requirements of that clause . This objection , it will be perceived , if well founded , will apply equally to the reduction , as to the diversion of the tolls and as it involves in both respects important consequences , it deserves attention . The Convention which framed the amended constitution assembled in the year 1821 , and only a few months after the comptroller had estimated that the tolls of the canals for the ten years next /z/ after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars annually . From peculiar causes , not necessary now to state , a large majority of that body participated in the doubts and forebodings as to the eventual success of the canals , which then prevailed with a considerable party throughout the State ; and there is good reason to believe that many of its leading members honestly feared , that the debt to be incurred in constructing those works would never be paid ; and that if the tolls should be reduced or diverted , a perpetual tax to pay the interest would be imposed upon the people . It was mainly under the influence of this apprehension , and far less , if at all , for the purpose of affording a specific pledge to the public creditor , that the clause in question was inserted in the constitution . The total amount borrowed to construct the canals , was $7,672,782 , of which amount . 5,326 , - 295 has since been paid directly to the public creditors , and certificates of stock have been cancelled to that extent . The duty of receiving the money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the board of Commissioners of the canal fund ; and that body stands between the State and its creditors , acting at the same time as agents of the State and trustees for the creditors . The Commissioners have discharged their duty so far as to receive from the State " full and complete payment " of the debt ; and they are now engaged /z/ in executing the remainder of their trust , by paying the money to the creditors . They have repeatedly notified those creditors by public advertisements , both in this country and in Europe , and also by written circulars whenever their residence could be discovered , that they had received the money , and were prepared to pay it ; but as the debt , according to the terms of the loan , does not fall due until 1845 , the Commissioners , in order to avoid the responsibility incurred in keeping so large an amount permanently invested , have offered large premiums to the creditors to come forward and receive payment and surrender their certificates . The Commissioners have thus reduced the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original sum now remains unpaid . As a considerable portion of this remnant of the debt is held by persons residing in foreign countries , it is not improbable that some of them may neglect or refuse to receive payment until the year 1845 , and the money must consequently remain at least until that time invested for their benefit in the hands of the Commissioners . It will be perceived , that whatever force there may be in this constitutional objection , will not be diminished by the payment of any portion of the debt , however large ; so that whether fivesevenths or ninety-nine-hundredths of the debt should be paid , the position would not be varied . The pledge can only be literally performed by paying the last remaining dollar to the last remaining creditor . No middle ground exists between this extreme consequence and the position that the /z/ pledge is satisfied for all fair and practical purposes , when the amount of the debt is paid over to the Commissioners and safely invested by them in trust for the creditors . It is under these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the holders of this remnant of the debt , ( for it is believed that they are wholly indifferent as to the matter , ) but by those who seek to arrest the progress of our public works , that the canal tolls shall not be reduced or diverted until the last dollar shall be literally paid to the creditor . That no matter how important it may become to our commerce and general interests to revise and regulate the rates of toll ; that no matter how just or pressing may be the claims of other parts of the State for works of internal improvement ; the canal tolls shall be held " beyond the reach of the Legislature ; " at least until the year 1845 , when interest ceasing on the debt , the creditor may probably be W'illing to receive payment :  --  and the doctrine involves this monstrous consequence , that the whole accumulating amount of the tolls , which with the compounding interest , would produce , by the year 1845 , at least ten million of dollars , must be kept invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sum of two millions , and which very two millions already exists in money invested on safe security ; and that in the mean time the public improvements of the State must be deferred , and direct taxes /z/ imposed to defray the ordinary expenses of the government ! In the judgment of the committee no such absurdity was contemplated by the framers of the Constitution , or could ever be submitted to by the people . The clause in question evidently was intended merely as a guaranty , not so much to the public creditors as to the people of the State at large , that a sum should be raised from the tolls and other revenues pledged , sufficient to satisfy the debt , and provide against the hazard of taxation for that purpose . And this was all its object . It was never dreamed that ten millions should be accumulated in order to pay two millions . The restriction was adopted upon the mistaken calculation that the revenue would not more than pay the debt as fast as it became due . Time has disclosed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon every sound and rational principle of construction the pledge is satisfied . The State has done all that the most scrupulous good faith could require , and no reason exists why the tolls which are thus redeemed and unfettered , should not be regulated or reduced in such manner as the Legislature shall think fit , or applied to any beneficial purpose which the public interests may require . And in this light the question has been viewed by the representatives of the people . By the act /z/ of May 11 , 1835 , the Legislature directed that the canal tolls should be expended in enlarging the Erie Canal to such dimensions as the Canal Board should determine , who were thereby also authorized to construct an " independent canal , " in such parts of the route as they thould think expedient . The canal , according to the plan since adopted by the Board , will be about three times as large in volume as the existing canal , and its location will be changed for several miles of the route . The Revised Statutes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be completed : so that both legally and practically , the canal thus altered in dimensions and in location , may be considered as a new work . The tolls expended in its enlargement , to all technical intents , are as much " diverted , " as if employed in constructing a lateral canal or any other of the public works of the State ; and the consequences , so far as the public creditors or the people of the State at large are concerned , are in no respect different . But the 9th section of the act placed the intention of the Legislature beyond all doubt : for it directed that the expenditures in thus enlarging the canal " should be so limited as to leave from the canal revenues an annual income to the State of at least pOO , 000 . " In other words , the Legislature appropriated that amount of the canal tolls to the ordinary uses of the government . By a subsequent act , passed May 16 , 1836 , /z/ the Legislature increased this annual sum from $300,000 to $400,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the phraseology of that law directed the Commissioners of the Canal Fund to " loan " that sum annually " to the treasury of this State , for the use and benefit of the General Fund ; " and the Comptroller was directed to charge the General Fund " as a debtor , " for such loan to the Canal Fund . It is rather to be regretted that it should have been thought proper or necessary to throw the transaction into this form . If the State owned the tolls free from the encumbrance of the public creditor , no necessity existed for this legislative fiction . If it did not , the propriety of abstracting the tolls , under the guise of a loan to the General Fund , ( which fund existed only in the canals themselves ) may well be questioned : while the very fact of charging the State , or the General Fund , " as a debtor , " for the amount of the tolls , was calculated needlessly to perplex the public mind in regard to the true state of the finances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canals have been brought fully within the reach of the Legislature : and the very important question then arises , in what mode shall they be appropriated so as most effectually to promote the progress of the public works ? By the acts of 1835 and 1836 , the tolls , after /z/ deducting 8400,000 annually , ( and of which sum about one half is applied in paying the interest on the debt for lateral canals , ) have been appropriated to the enlargement of the Erie canal . The cost of that enterprise , originally estimated at S12,000,000 , will not probably fall short of 115,000,000 : so that if only the net revenues ( now amounting as it is above shown , to 8787,183 , ) shall be applied to that purpose , the work can not be completed short of twenty years : and during the whole of that time those other works must be deferred , which could be aided by this revenue in case a proper scheme of finance were to be adopted . The policy and the plan of enlarging the canal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after mature consideration . Expenditures have already been incurred in prosecuting the work to an amount exceeding 8600,000 , and contracts have been made in addition to the extent of nearly three millions . The idea of abandoning the undertaking , even if it were desirable , is therefore quite out of the question . The committee are moreover satisfied , that the speedy enlargement of the canal is required by the best interests , not only of the inhabitants in its immediate vicinity , but of the people of every part of the State . The Canal Commissioners in their recent report to the Legislature , have estimated its annual tolls within a few years after it shall be completed , at no less than /z/ three millions of dollars , equivalent to an annual income of five per cent , on a capital of sixty millions , and that of this large revenue at least one half will be paid upon property passing to and from other States . It is quite evident that such an income will enable the State , after making the most judicious revision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every portion of its territory , however remote or sequestered . To secure such a result with the least practicable delay , is therefore an object of general importance . The canal , when enlarged , will be greatly increased in value and power , and in point of magnitude will be one of the most important works , not only of this country , but of the age . Its capacity exceeding that of the present canal , at least seven fold  --  being seven feet deep and seventy feet wide , with double locks of enlarged dimensions throughout the whole line ,  --  it will furnish the means of convenient transit for not less than ten millions of tons annually . The supply of water will be abundant and unfailing , and the enlarged size of the boats by which it will be navigated , will reduce the cost of transportation nearly one half ; so that if the tolls should even be retained at their present rates , the saving to the community in the aggregate expense of conveyance , would be from one-fourth to one-third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind however , that to effect this saving , the enlargement must be completed /z/ throughout the whole line , so as to avoid the expense and delay of trans-shipment ,  --  and from this fact it will be obvious , that important financial consequences are involved in its speedy prosecution . By proper efforts the enlargement may be completed and made available within five years . At the expiration of that period , the interest , at five per cent. , compounded half-yearly , on the cost of the work , ( estimating it at fifteen millions , ) will amount to about two millions and a half of dollars ; whereas , if the completion shall be delayed twenty years , the intervening interest alone will exceed nine millions ; showing a loss of interest by proceeding at the present sluggish rate , of at least six and a half millions of dollars ; a sum which of itself would go far to extend the benefits of internal improvement to every other section of the State . In order thus to expedite the work , it will become necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this suggestion will alarm those who regard a public debt as the greatest of all public calamities , is not improbable ; and it may very possibly arouse opposition , as violent as that which was arrayed against our canals in their early stages . The hope is however indulged , that the successful example furnished by that great experiment will dispel any groundless fears , and impart to our public councils that degree of moral courage which the occasion requires . /z/ Our fathers did not hesitate to encounter debt , even when the means of paying the interest were unascertained and contingent ; and surely we may venture upon a similar effort , now that we are certain that the revenues of the State will suffice to pay the interest . The present nett annual revenue of the State , after paying its expenses and the interest on its debt , is 787 , 183 , as above stated . That sum alone will pay the annual interest , at five per cent , on $15,743,660 ; and that amount may therefore be borrowed and expended , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be experienced ( either by means of the expenditure of that sum , or from any other cause ) in the revenue of the canals , will itself increase to a corresponding extent the ability of the State further to borrow and pay the interest . It is evident that every $500,000 of revenue will serve as a basis of finance to sustain ten millions of debt . If the estimate of the Canal Commissioners is correct , ( and from their well known caution their opinions in this respect are peculiarly entitled to confidence , ) that the enlarged Erie Canal will yield an annual revenue of three millions , equivalent to five per cent , on sixty millions , it will at once be obvious that a sum of thirty millions may not only be borrowed , and expended , but wholly reimbursed , within twenty years ; or that forty millions may be so borrowed , expended , and reimbursed , in twenty-eight years . /z/ Nor need it be apprehended , that in order to produce these immense results , the tolls of the canals must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1833 , 1834 and 1835 , the rates were reduced in the aggregate about 35 per cent. , and yet during these three years the tolls amounted to 4 , 209 , 000 ; whereas in the three years next preceding the reduction they had amounted to only 83,185,000 , exhibiting an increase of upwards of a million of dollars . The responsible duty of regulating the tolls to be imposed upon the great and almost illimitable trade which our canals are to enjoy , and of fixing the rates so judiciously as best to promote our commercial and agricultural prosperity , and at the same time adequately to strengthen our fiscal resources , will undoubtedly be exercised with that prudence , liberality , and forecast , which the magnitude of the subject demands . Whatever rates of revenue may be eventually adopted , we may safely assume that the State will take care to reserve such an amount in the a2:gre2:ate as the interests of its treasury and the general welfare of its citizens shall require . The committee , therefore , have no hesitation in recommending that the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecute most vigorously its public works ; and in lieu of appropriating the revenue only of the present canals for the purpose of making such expenditures as the general interests require , they would /z/ suggest that the State should retain that revenue as a sinking fund to pay the interest on all moneys it may borrow , from time to time , to prosecute and perfect a liberal system of internal improvement . It is not the appropriate duty of the present committee to point out those particular works which stand most in need of the efforts or the fostering care of the State . That gratifying office will devolve upon those by wdiom it will doubtless be faithfully and wisely discharged . The view which they have sought to take , is purely fiscal in its nature : aiming only to demonstrate the pecuniary ability of the State to proceed promptly and liberally in the great work of improving its internal condition and developing its resources . They confidently believe , that the success hitherto attained in the prosecution of our system of internal improvement is but the precursor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now enjoy but faintly shadow forth the vast realities which are within our reach ; and that it needs but to employ promptly and vigorously our resources to augment yet more fully and gloriously the power and prosperity of the State . Without trespassing upon the province of those whose duty it is to prescribe the particular details of those great measures of policy , by which our dormant energies may thus be roused into salutary and profitable action , the committee would observe generally , that the works which for /z/ the next few years will occupy the attention of our public authorities , are , 1 . The rail-roads connecting the distant extremities of the State , and the interior portions with each other . 2 . The Erie canal with its various tributaries . On the subject of the policy to be pursued by the State in regard to the construction of railroads , differences of opinion exist . On the one hand it is contended , that these great avenues of travel and communication which affect so intimately the convenience and welfare of all our people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under public authority ; and the success of those governments which have pursued that policy , not only in cheapening the cost of transport , but in avoiding the mischiefs of monopoly has been adduced as a reason why the State should possess , and at all times regulate , this important branch of our internal improvements . On the other hand it has been urged , that the employment of the great number of persons required to conduct the manifold details of these crowded channels of transportation , would throw into the hands of the State , an undue amount of /z/ power and patronage : and it is alleged that this danger will be avoided , and the public convenience in other respects promoted , by entrusting their management to companies of individuals duly incorporated . It is also contended , and especially by those who are habitually sceptical as to the success of our public works , that the value of rail-roads has not yet been sufficiently tested , and that they will eventually fail to yield results sufficiently profitable to render it desirable for the State to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined , hitherto , to construct rail-roads on its own account , but has preferred to commit that duty to incorporated companies ; and has afforded aid , at least , in one important instance , by a loan of the public credit , taking as security a mortgage of the work . If a similar course shall be pursued in respect to all the railroads which may stand in need of public assistance , and the interest on the stock to be thus loaned shall be regularly met by the companies , the treasury will remain wholly unaffected by such measures of aid , and in a fiscal point of view , the State will experience neither profit nor loss . The Legislature has taken care , however , in the charters by which the rail-road companies have been incorporated , to reserve the right ultimately to take those works for public use , and the State may possibly exercise this right at some future /z/ period . The total cost of the leading lines will not fall short of eighteen or twenty millions of dollars ; but the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take these works , in making such financial arrangements as the occasion may demand . The sum which the treasury will require for the canals now in progress , will be : 1 . For enlarging the Erie canal , including damages , .... 2 . For the Genessee Valley and the Black River canals , ( authorized to be constructed by laws passed in 1836 , ) in addition to the amount of $190,920 22 , herein-before included as part of the State debt , not less than 5,000,000 /z/ For the two last mentioned canals , loans have been already negotiated to the amount of 2,800 , - 000 , but the proceeds , ( with the exception of the $190,920 , ) have not yet been expended . In addition to the amount above stated , it may be observed that sundry projects for other canals of smaller extent , have been more or less enter- /z/ tained , including among others , an extension recommended in the Governor 's message in 1836 , of the Erie canal from Buffalo westward to a point on Lake Erie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River canal into the mineral districts of St. Lawrence county : the continuation of the Erie canal , or the construction of a branch from it to some proper point below the Overslaugh : and some other extensions of existing works . If any considerable portion of these projects should be carried into execution , the cost will not probably fall short of 5,000,000 . The connexion which it is proposed to effect by means of a ship canal between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario , has been excluded from the above estimate , under the belief , that a work so interesting and important in a military point of view , will be constructed at the expense and under the authority of the general government . It thus appears : 1 . That the amount which the State must expend under existing laws , for the enlargement and construction of canals already commenced , will be $20,000,000 2 . That the amount to be paid from time to time , for taking rail-roads for public use , whenever the State shall find it beneficial to the public interests to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the extent of the works to be selected : or say ..... $15,000,000 3 . That the amount to be hereafter authorized for extensions of the present canals , may be ... $5,000,000 Making a total of $40,000,000 It is not , however , to be inferred that the committee intend by statino ; the above sums to recommend an expenditure to the amount of forty millions upon our public works . It is certain that , under existing laws , at least one half of that sum must be so expended ; but whether any portion of the residue will be appropriated , will of course depend upon the views of the present and succeeding Legislatures . They wish merely to be understood , that if the Legislature from time to time shall see fit to expend that sum , it may be safely borrowed , without imposing any burthens upon the people ; and that if the views of the Canal Commissioners , as to the future revenues of the canal , are correct , the whole amount , within thirty years , may be reimbursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not improbable , that those who are in the habit of decrying our public works , may assert that a debt is to be incurred to an alarming amount , to be handed down as a grievous burthen to all future generations : and yet , in truth , we shall /z/ only hand down what our fathers have transmitted to us , public works , paid for and free from debt , and themselves affording the means of still further auo-menting the power and wealth of those who are to follow us . Nor will this event be deemed at all improbable , when we reflect that within the last twenty years the canals have come down to us free from debt , and worth more than twenty millions . Actual experience has thus familiarized us with the certain operation of an excess of revenue in extinguishing a debt created for public works ,  --  but for the sake of presenting the suject in a more perspicuous form , an arithmetical table is subjoined ,  --  exhibiting the progress of a debt within the next ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the successive stages by which it will reach its final extinguishment . In respect to that part of the annual report of the Comptroller of this State on the finances referred to the consideration of the committee , which suggests the expediency of levying a tax for the purposes of the treasury , they are compelled to state that , in their judgment , no necessity exists for that measure . They are aware that , from the year 1827 , when the report of Mr. Wright announced to the public that internal improvements could only be sustained by direct taxation , down to the present time , our fiscal officers have habitu- /z/ ally urged upon the Legislature the necessity of resorting to that method of levying money for the use of the State . It is not without diffidence , that the committee fsel themselves compelled wholly to dissent from the experienced individuals who , for the last ten years , have controlled our public affairs ; but , after a laborious and careful investigation , they have been unable to discover any reason why such a mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the committee there is no possible ground upon which a tax could be justified . The treasury is full and needs no replenishing : and ample means are provided for meeting the future engagements of the State . Under such circumstances , to subject the people to the burden of a direct tax , would be equally unwise and unnecessary . It is stated , however , by the Comptroller , and the fact has been repeatedly urged in other official communications , that Mr. Jefferson lays down the rule that a government disposed to cherish its credit " should never borrow a dollar without laying a tax in the same instant for paying the interest annually , and the principal in a given time . " But the maxim is not sound , to the extent to which it is thus attempted to be applied . It will be recollected that Mr. Jefferson lived in a period of war and wasteful expenditure ; and in speaking of the consequences of public debt , he doubtless intended to refer to expenditures upon objects not of them- /z/ selves yielding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of commerce , or the expenses of the civil administration . No reason can possibly exist for extending the rule to debts incurred for public works , themselves producing an income equivalent to the interest ; nor is it absolutely requisite , that such revenue shall be received " in the same instant " in which the debt is created , provided that it will be realized within a reasonably moderate period . It may , indeed , be admitted , that when such result is problematical , or only to be realized at a remote period , the tax ought to be laid when the v ork is commenced ; provided always that the government possesses no other pecuniary means of paying the interest . But then it must be shown that no such auxiliary resources are possessed , for otherwise there could be no necessity for levying money by tax for the mere purpose of preserving pecuniary funds which could be more directly and economically applied to the object in question . And this is the view which the Legislature has taken of this question , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the present moment , xllthough annually urged to levy a tax , they have annually refused : but have seen fit to rely on the revenues from the public works , to meet the demands on the treasury . The result has shown that they were right ; for although the State since 1825 , has expended in constructing lateral canals the sum of 3 , 364 , 304 , it has still remaining an /z/ annual surplus revenue of nearly $800,000 ; and its people are free from taxation . Without pretending , therefore , to detract from the general authority of the maxim thus quoted , it may be claimed that our own experience has shown it to be inaccurate , when applied to debts created for works of internal improvement . In truth , it is hardly credible that Mr. Jefferson ever intended thus to apply it ; but if he did , it only shows , what his incredulity in respect to the Erie canal had sufficiently testified , that enterprises of that character had not occupied his most deliberate attention . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the committee are based , is the estimate of the Canal Commissioners submitted to the Legislature , in which they state that the Erie canal , w-ithin a few years after its enlargement , will produce an annual revenue of The importance of verifying the accuracy of this estimate will be evident , as any material error would lead to the most injurious consequences . The inquiry has neces- , sarily embraced details of unusual magnitude , but having subjected them to a careful scrutiny , the committee state succinctly , the reasons why , in their opinion , that estimate is entitled to reliance . The steady progress of population and wealth of /z/ that portion of our own State which is tributary to the canal , needs little remark . Whether owing to the growth of the country on its immediate borders  --  or to the influence of the lateral canals , in swelling its commerce ,  --  the tables of tonnage exhibit a rate of increase which will probably be maintained for many years . Although the contribution thus furnished by the State to the revenues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for two-thirds of the whole of its tolls are now drawn from the trade of our own people , ) yet the amount becomes relatively unimportant , when compared with the enormous results we are hereafter to derive from our commerce with the west . Let us then advert briefly to the present extent and future progress of that commerce , and the probable eff'ect which it is hereafter to produce upon our fiscal aff " airs . The western termination of the Erie canal looks out upon Lake Erie , the most southerly and central of the great chain of navigable lakes , which stretches far into the interior from our western boundary . Around these inland seas , a cluster of five powerful States is rapidly rising . The territory which they comprise , and which is to become tributary to the canal , embraces that great area , extending from the lakes on the north to the Ohio on the south , and from the western confines of this State to the upper Mississippi , and containing 280,000 square miles . To measure its extent by well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that part of the State of New York , west of the county of Oneida  - -  nearly twice as large as the kingdom of France  - -  and about six times as extensive as the whole of Ensfland , It contains 180 millions of acres of arable land , a large portion of which is of surpassing fertility . The productive power of this region , and its capability of supplying tonnage for export , are greatly strengthened by the facilities which it enjoys for cheap and easy transportation . In this respect , no country on the face of the globe enjoys greater natural advantages ; for it is nearly encircled by navigable waters , and its broad area is intersected in numerous directions by streams furnishing ample means of conveyance , while unusual facilities for the construction of canals , and other artificial channels of communication , are afforded by the level and uniform character of its surface . These being its geographical advantages , it needs only the requisite number of inhabitants , to fully develope its agricultural resources . Its progress in this respect has been truly surprising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within its limits . In that year , Indiana , having obtained the requisite number of 60,000 inhabitants , entered the Union , and took its place by the side of Ohio . Illinois and Michigan were then distant and feeble territories , with a iew set- /z/ tiers thinly scattered over their broad surface , while Wisconsin , unknown even by name , Mas an undistinguished portion of the great North-Western territory . In the brief period of twenty-one years , such has been the influx of population into this great district , that Ohio , the eldest member in this brotherhood of nations , now numbers 1,400,000 inhabitants ; Indiana upwards of 600,000 ; Illinois and Michigan , ( both of whom have organized their governments and come into the Union , ) 700,000 ; while west of Lake Michigan , not only is Wisconsin rapidly rising , but even beyond the upper Mississippi , 30,000 citizens have already laid the foundation of yet another State . Such is the onward march of this population , that the amount of its annual increase alone exceeds in number the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population already embraced within the district in question , falls little short of three millions , and if the same rate of progress shall be maintained for the twelve years next to come , by the year 1850 it will exceed six millions . The peculiar activity and energy of these people , and their power most rapidly to develope the resources of the broad domain which they inhabit , are also worthy of consideration , in estimating the eventual extent of their trade . They probably possess a greater aggregate power of production than any other portion equally numerous of the human race . Their population is made up almost exclu- /z/ sively of the young , the resolute , the vigorous , and the intelligent , who have gone from the more crowiei communities in the eastern and middle portions of the Union , to seat themselves around this chain of waters , and there build up an empire . They have taken with them the laws , the habits , the language , and the institutions , civil and religious , of their parent States , but above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honest love of labour , a:i.l in the very act of organizing their governm3nts , they testified their willingness to exert an J rely on their own energies , by prohibiting slavery forever , throughout all their limits . This group of inland States has two outlets for its tra le to the ocean ; one by the Mississippi to the G.ilf of M2x:ic3 ; the other through Lake Erie and the navi2:able communications of this State to the Atlantic . Whether it be attributable to similarity of origin , of laws , or of habits , or to ties of CDnsanguinity , or superior salubrity of climate , this people evidently prefer the market on the Atla itic , and they are making prodigious efforts to reach it . Three great canals , ( one of them longer than the Erie Canal , ) embracing in their aggregate length about one thousand miles , are to connect the Ohio with Lake Erie , while another deep and capacious channel , excavated for nearly thirty miles through soli : ! rock , unites Lake Michigan with the navigable waters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , they are also constructing /z/ lines of rail-roads , not less than 1,500 miles in extent , in order to reach with more ease and speed , the lakes , through which they seek a conveyance to the sea-board . The undaunted resolution of this energetic race of men is strikingly evinced by the fact , that the cost of the works which they have thus undertaken , ( and most of which are in actual progress ) will exceed forty-eight millions of dollars  --  a sum far exceeding all that New York , with two millions of inhabitants , and two hundred years of accumulated wealth , has ever attempted . Thi ciicumstance , moreover , is particularly important , that the public works in each of these widespread states are arranged on a harmonious plan , each having a main line supported and enriched by lateral and tributary branches , thereby bringing the industry of their whole people , into prompt and profitable action , while the systems themselves are again united on a grander scale , in a series of systems , comprising an aggregate length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its common centre . The various portions of this vast work are now in a train of rapid construction . Indiana alone has 6,000 men in her employ ; and Ohio , Illinois , and Michigan are making correspondent efforts ; so that it m.ay be confidently predicted , that within seven years from this time , the whole inland trade of that broad region around the lakes , will crovvd the entrance of the Erie canal on its way to the Atlantic . /z/ It will at once b obvious , that the whole of the tonnage thus to be furnished by these communities , whatever may be its bulk , will pay to our treasury a transit duty for the whole length of the canal ; an 1 will therefore yield a revenue twice as large as an equal quantity of products from the districts of our own State , mid-way between the Lakes and the Hudson . And what will be the amount of this tonnage , and by what standard shall we measure it ? If we take the area and the products , and the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far short ; and even if we resort to more populous nations  --  if we select England or Franca , and compare their prorluctive power with that oi this youthful and rapidly increasing race , the parallel will not be complete ; for a much smaller proportion of the inhabitants of those kingdoms is devt ) ted to agricultural pursuits ; nor is their inland commerce wholly concentrated with any single channel . But we , fortunately , possess ai adequate and appropriate standard in the Mississippi river , the great rival and competitor of the Erie canal , with which it is destined hereafter to hold divided sway over the vast trade of the west . The number oi inhabitants who at present employ that stream and its tributaries , for the purpose of conveyance , is scarcely five millions , and yet the amount which /z/ they paid during the last year for transportation on its waters , was between eight and nine millions of dollars . The momentous question , whether the tonnage of the inland district under examination is to seek the Atlantic through the Erie Canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is mainly to depend upon the comparative cost of transportation . But when we consider the circuitous course of the Mississippi , the less of time in ascending its strong current , and the greater rapidity of communication presented by the Atlantic route ; when we advert moreover to the ample volume and trifling lockage of the enlarged canal ; and especially when we estimate the commercial effects of the navigable passage opened by the Hudson through the Alleghany ridge ; we shall perceive that when the artificial communications thus concentrating upon Lake Erie shall be put in full operation , the cost of transporting agricultural products from the interior of this district will not materially vary , whether carried to the Atlantic or the Gulf of Mexico . The inference , then , may safely be drawn , that whenever a population of five millions around these western waters shall resort to the Erie canal for the means of conveyance , they will supply it with an amount of tonnage equally great with that now transported on the Mississippi by an equal number of inhabitants . It is estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend the Mississippi and its tributaries , has already reached $70,0 JO , COO . The value of the property transported on the canals of the State of New-York , during the year .1836 , is shown by official tables to be $67,000,000 . Of that amount , it maybe estimated that $ ' 50,000,000 consisted of property belonging exclusively to a portion of the population of this State net exceeding a million and a half in number , being at the rate of $33 33 for each inhabitant ; and that the amount which they paid for its transportation exceeded two millions of dollars . If the same scale of production and consumption shall be asNumed for the population of the district in question , ( and no reason is perceived why it should not be , ) the six millions of inhabitants in the west who will resort to the Erie canal for the means of conveyance , will furnish tonnage , in exports and imports , of at least $200,000,000 in value . The experience of other nations will show that this amount is not over-estimated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an agricultural population of about eight millions , was valued by their political economists at $604,000,000 ; while that of France was ascertained by its Minister of Finance to be 5,237,000,000 of francs , or $980,000,000 . But there are peculiar reasons why the proportion of agricultural exports of this great inland population should far exceed that of other nations . The exuberance of their soil , the salubrity of their /z/ climate , and the cheapness of their lands , ( arising from the vast supply within their limits ) will enable them always to furnish food to every other portion of the continent , on more advantageous terms than it can be elsewhere produced . Labor there reaps its best reward , and harvests of an hundred fold repay its exertions ; and such is the superior productiveness of this region , that when the completion of its great series of public works shall bring a bushel of wheat on the plains of Indiana within a few cents in price of a bushel in New England , its production in New England must cease . The same cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cf our own State ; for the unequalled fertility of the West will always enable it to supply those products requirino-richness of soil with a less amount of labour , and consequently at a cheaper rate , than they can be produced within our own borders . The consequences then of perfecting these systems of intercommunication will inevitably be a distribution of labor , on a grand scale , throughout the whole northern part of the continent : the maritime portions engrossing the active pursuits of navigation , commerce , and manufactures , while this central group of agricultural States will become the common granary of the Union , and discharge the important duty of supplying subsistence to all the surrounding communities . Indeed they have begun even now to perform that office . The vallies of the /z/ Miami , the Wabash , and the Illinois , are already pouring out their overflowing riches upon the cotton planting States below ; and , although their power of exportation has hitherto been kept in check by their rapid increase in numbers , yet it is stated , that during the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars descended the Mississippi and its tributaries , from that part of the valley north of the Ohio , and constituting a portion of the great district in question . Nor is this descenJing stream of trade wholly withdrawn from our own channels of conveyance , for its proceeds find their way by a circuitous course through the canals of New York , and in that form swell the i-evenues of the treasury :  --  and the fact will strikins-ly illustrate the value of the Union , in binding in bonds of mutual benefit all our commercial interests , both foreign and domestic , and in animating every portion of our various industry , that the food thus exported from the inmost recesses of the West  - -  exchanged for cotton at the mouth of the Mississippi  --  exported in that form to the workshops of Europe  --  again exchanged for their fabrics , and brought home by our shipping to the seaports of the north ,  --  is at last returned through the Erie canal to the luxuriant rallies from which it first originated ; thus revolving through the whole circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view the Erie canal as one of the miiihity sesments of that vast circle , that we can rightly estimate the importance and grandeur of its connexions . /z/ It is necessary also to be apprized of the course of this traJe , in order to explain the disparit ' in value which will always exist between the descending and the ascending cargoes . The amount of merchandise now sent into the Western States very far exceeds that of their products reaching the Atlantic sea-board . An additional reason exists , it is true , for this difference . The flood of emigration which has poured into that portion of the country has temporarily produced so great a disproportion between its consuming and producing classes , that they have scarcely been able to obtain an adequate supply of food even from their own exuberant soil . Population has outstripped production : so that their agricultural products , instead of seeking a market in the eastern portions of the Union , have been sent westward in larofe quantities into the upper lakes ; and such is the movement which animates all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last year , reached the port of Chicago , at the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan . So long as this great influx of population shall continue , the capacity of these interior States to supply tonnage for the Erie canal will be necessarily diminished , but the effect will be only to augment more enormously their eventual power of exportation ; and thus the present temporary check is but aiding increased energy to those causes , which are operating with concentrated force to swell our future commerce . /z/ The progress in population of that portion of this inland territory , immediately adjacent to the lakes , has been three times as great as its progress in the portion adjacent to the Ohio . The ratio of increase in the former , between the years 1820 and 1830 , ( as shown by the census , ) was 130 per cent. , and in the latter , only 44 per cent. ; and the comparative rates since that time have not , probably , lessened . And this circumstance explains why so large a surplus should have been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison with that which has hitherto found its way from the lakes into our canals . The total amount of tolls , realized by our treasury in the year 1836 , from property passing to and from the country surrounding the lakes , was only $385,000 , or less than one-twentieth part of the sum paid annually for transportation on the Mississippi , and its confluents . To fix the precise period when the population , now swarming into this district , wull reach the point when their power of furnishing products for exportation , will fully exhibit itself , is , of course , impracticable . The same causes which operate to diminish their exports , now that their population has reached to three millions , may not be wholly removed , when its numbers shal ! be doubled , but it may be confidently predicted , that before that time they will be so firmly seated on their productive soil , as to be able to supply a vast surplus of food for export . /z/ The population of the western portion of our own State still continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an annual export of at least 20,000,000 in value . By the year 1845 , the States of the West , surrounding the lakes , will hold the same relative position in respect to the whole of the Erie canal , which the counties of New York , west of the Seneca lake , now bear to that part of the line east of Utica . Our trade will then be measured , not by counties , but by sovereign States , themselves containing their fifty counties ; and our revenues , no longer dependent on the villages and townships scattered along the borders of the canal , will be drawn from the wide-spread and populous communities , inhabiting the broad expanse between the Ohio and the Lakes . We obtain , then , the following facts , by which to guide the present inquiry :  --  That the value of the tonnage , annually transported on the canals of this State , being $67,634 , - 000 , and the tolls paid being . 1,614,000 , the rate of toll is about 2 per cent , on the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance from tide water , of the place from and to which the tonnage is transported , the rate paid on the western section of the Erie canal , is proba- /z/ bly as high as four , or even five per cent . :  --  ( The present toll of 32 cents on a barrel of flour worth passing the whole length of the canal , is 4 per cent. , or 5 per cent. , if valued at :  --  ) That the rate of toll , on commodities passing to and from the States west of Buffalo , may therefore be safely assumed to be equal to at least two per cent , on their value ; and it is believed , that the interests of the State will not require a reduction of the tolls below that rate :  --  That a population , within this State , of one million and a half of inhabitants , furnished a tonnage of to the canals ,  --  and that , therefore the population of the States in question , when it shall amount to six millions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed , that a considerable portion , and perhaps two fifths of their exports , will continue to descend the Mississippi and its tributaries , and that one fifth of their imports may ascend that stream . We shall then have these results : Descending cargoes , after deducting two fifths , sS60,000,000 Ascending cargoes , after deducting one fifth , 80,000,000 Total trade , . . . /z/ At the present rates of toll , say at four per cent. , this trade would yield an annual revenue to our treasury of $5,600,000 ; and if reduced to two per cent. , it would yield $2,800,000 ; and even at one per cent. , ( equal to 2 cents only on a bushel of wheat , ) it would yield $1,400,000 . The evidence furnished by these facts has therefore satisfied the committee , that the estimate of the Canal Commissioners , that the tolls of the Erie canal when enlarged will , at the present rates , pay annually three millions of dollars , and that one-half of that sum will be received from property passing to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not exaggerated . It will be observed , that many of the views which are above taken of the future magnitude of our inland commerce , will be applicable to the two lines of rail-road which are to traverse our territory from the Hudson to Lake Erie . The immense effects which these wonder-working instruments of commerce are to produce in securing the trade of the West to the Atlantic States , and in binding the most distant portions of our country in bonds of beneficial intercourse , would furnish , upon the proper occasion , a subject of interesting and profitable inquiry . Nor need it be apprehended that they will affect injuriously our fiscal interests ,  --  for so far from lessening the commerce of the canals , they will more probably serve to secure /z/ and increase it , by affording the means of rapid transportation for property and persons during those winter months in which their navigation is impeded , and thereby preventing the diversion into other channels of those more bulky products which furnish to canals their most lucrative revenues . Regarding the event as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take these great thoroughfares of trade and travel as public property , and that they are eventually to become a portion of our system of public works , of which all the parts will mutually sustain and strengthen each other ,  --  the growth of the West in swelling their revenues is by no means a matter of indifference to the public treasury . The committee will not trespass upon the attention of the House , by expatiating upon the grandeur of the prospect which would open upon us , were we to look beyond the brief period , which the present view has embraced . It is for the philanthropist and statesman , to indulge those feelings of honest hope and patriotic pride , which can not but arise , in contemplating the mighty realities which the future has in store . The duty which the present occasion has required of the committee , has been of a more practical character . They have attempted honestly , perhaps over- /z/ zealously , to show that our own noble State is neither ruined nor bankrupt ,  --  that its treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however impeded in its progress by a narrow policy which would retard its growth , undervalue its strength , and stifle its energies , it is yet vigorous and erect , and able to move onward with a giant 's powers . They have sought to show that the foundations of our prosperity are deeply laid ; that our resources are manifold , and that they will prove adequate to any efforts which our government may make , to promote the prosperity , reward the industry , or stimulate the enterprise of our citizens , whether occupying the fair and fruitful plains of the west ,  --  the forests and mines of the north ,  - -  or the sunny slopes and fertile vallies of our southern and midland districts . They will not attempt to measure the consequences which the completion of a great and harmonious system of intercommunication , extending into the utmost recesses of the interior , and concentrating within our borders the trade of the most populous portion of the continent , will produce , in augmenting the aggregate riches of our State ; in covering its surface with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in securing its political supremacy ; and in enlarging , in all respects , its prosperity , power , and glory . Nor will they seek to compute the pecuniary results /z/ which this vast and ever increasing stream of inland trade , flowing through our territory for all future time , will produce in augmenting the wealth of its commercial metropolis . The history of Venice , in its palmiest days , stretching her long line of islands and colonies far into the East , and controlling by her position the commerce of Asia , presents but a feeble picture of the splendour and riches which our own great mart must eventually attain . Still less will they seek to span within their narrow arithmetic , the pecuniary value of the illimitable West . Were they to state that from an assessed value in 1798 , of only 26 millions , for all the vast territory west of the mountains , stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Superior , wealth has arisen and been created within the short space of forty years to the amount of twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first step in that long series , by which an empire is to ascend to a height of power and dominion as yet unequalled in the history of our race . Least of all will they attempt to compute the pecuniary consequences of these great arteries of trade , in cementing and preserving the union of these free and flourishing republics . It is not for New York , or her sons , to " calculate the value " of that sacred bond . But if we would catch a glimpse , however imperfect , of the gigantic stake which is depending on our prudence and patriotism  --  if we would count the cost of ruined cities , and desolated fields ,  --  of our lakes and rivers , obstructed by fleets and fortresses in war , and by commercial restrictions still more destructive in peace , we may contrast Europe as it is , convulsed by centuries of strife , and broken into jarring , disunited , and discordant communities , with Europe , as it would have been , had its whole population been united like ours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common law , speaking one common language , and bound by one common constitution . Let us then go forward in th broad path of duty which is spread before us  --  and in riveting , as now we may , the bonds which unite the mighty members of this glorious Union , discharge those high and solemn obligations which we owe not only to ourselves and those who surround us , but to the long line of generations who are to follow in after ages . The Committee , in order to carry out the views of this report , will prepare a bill , making the necessary appropriations , as soon as their object and amount shall be determined by the proper committees , and sanctioned by the House . In the mean time they beg leave to submit the following resolution : /z/ Resolved , That it is not necessary or expedient to levy a direct tax . /z/ VICTORY BIRDSEYE , ! mmtttee of /z/ March 12 , 1838 . Ways and Means . /z/ Estimate of the progress of a State Debt to the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it will reach its final extinguishment . - It is deemed safe to assume , that the net revenue from the canals , for the year 1838 , will be 1800,000 . It is also deemed safe to assume , that such a net revenue will increase , for the four next years after 1838 , at the rate of $100 , - 000 per annum ; and that after that time , to the end of the year 184-5 , owing to the completion of the enlarged Erie canal , and other works of internal improvement , and the great increase of the commerce through our public works , with the Western States , such annual increase will be $200,000 per annum ; and that after the year 1845 , owing to the operation of like causes , and the more extended and perfect development of the commerce and agriculture of the far West , such increase will beat the rate of $31 ) 0,000 per annum , until such increase shall reach $3,000 , - 009 per annum , which will be in the year 1849 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so reduced , that the net revenues from the canals will not exceed the said sum of $3,000,000 ; and that after the full completion of our internal improvements , the State may make such further reductions in the tolls , as the general interests and wishes of its people may require . It is not supposed that this estimate will be found entirely accurate ; or that the ratio of gradations of increase in the different years , will precisely conform to these assumptions . But inasmuch as our past experience , and a reasonable estimate of our future revenue , afford entire assurance that the estimates thus assumed for future years will fall below the actual results , it is deemed safe to proceed upon such assumptions for the purpose of the present estimate . 1 . We will suppose the State , for the next ten years , should borrow four millions of dollars a year for the public service . The amount of debt to be contracted will stand as follows : At the end of the year /z/ 2 . It may be presumed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instalments , as the public service during the year may require , the interest on the loan of any one year will not be payable for more than six months of the year in which it is contracted . 3 . Such moneys may be borrowed on five per cent , stock , not under par , and redeemable at the option of the government after 10 or 15 years . 4 . The annual surpluses of income may form a sinking fund , and invested in State stock or loaned to our citizens , so as to produce at least five per cent , per annum upon their principals . The following table is prepared , and exhibits the revenue payable in each year ; the interest to be provided for in each year ; the surplus revenue going to the sinking fund in each year ; and the net amount of the sinking fund at the end of each year ; and the period at which the sinking fund will suffice to pay off and reimburse the whole principal and interest of the debt . 1 . The net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ; oj , ooo /z/ 2 . The interest ! 3 .

The amount of the sinking fund at the end of each year /z/ Showing the final reimbursement of the whole debt in the year 1865 . N- B.  --  If the stock shall be negotiated at a lower rate than five per cent. , or if five per cent , stocks shall command a premium , this result will be correspondingly hastened . /z/ If the revenue assumed is not overrated , and it is believed that , for the average of time , it is greatly underrated , the State has an ample provision made for the punctual payment of the interest , and the final discharge of the principal of a debt of forty millions of dollars . Variations in the revenue received , or in the interest realized on the sinking fund , may expedite or postpone the final discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sure and final extinguishment by the means provided may be regarded as certain .
