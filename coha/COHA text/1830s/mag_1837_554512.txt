txt DR . Wiseman , we are told , in the advertisement to this edition of his Lectures , is the head of the English College at Rome , an institution devoted to the instruction of young men in theology , under the supervision of a cardinal , and receiving the attention of the head of the Romish Church . We are also told , that Dr. Wiseman was horn of English parents , in Spain ; and though we are not informed concerning the places in which he received his education , or the methods in which he pursued his early studies , it is evident that he is a man of varied learning ; and he has shown himself , on another occasion , well acquainted with the xvritings of some of the most distinguished German authors . About two fifths of the present work are taken up with the early history of the human race . Beginning without any thesis or theory on the subject , the author plunges deeply into comparative philology ; or , to call it by its recent and more learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations by means of the comparative study of languages . He adverts to the limited // views of the linguists of former times , in looking only for a lineal descent of words , where collateral branches might have extended , and in relying upon direct etymological derivation without comparing the affinities of various kindred languages or dialects . Instead of supporting a system , Dr. Wiseman turns himself to facts , and does not begin to philosophize till he thinks that the boundaries of observation have been faithfully explored . When a considerable number of words in two languages nearly resemble each other , notwithstanding there is a great want of resemblance in other words , a strong presumption is furnished that they sprung from a common , primary language . Every one , who has any fondness for philological pursuits , must receive much gratification from examining the portion of the Lectures of which we are now speaking . Besides the condensed history which the author furnishes of the labors of the learned in this department , in different countries , he holds impartially the scales in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . Among those who have aimed to demonstrate this unity , he singles out with special favor Alerander Von Humbolt , Julius Kiaproth , and Frederic &amp;hlegel ; the first of whom pronounces the following strong decision as the result of his extensive inquiries ; - " However insulated certain languages may at first appear , however singular their caprices and their idioms , all have an analogy among them ; and their numerous relations will be more perceived , in proportion as the philosophical history of nations , and the study of languages , shall be brought to perfection . " - p. 68 . The difficulty of tracing the relationship of the new world with the old , by means of comparative philology , is admitted by Dr. Wiseman . Still , the traditions that prevail among the Aborigines , on portions of this continent , relative to the early history of the human race , analogous to those of the Asiatics , go to establish , in his opinion , a common origin . Under the disadvantages of comparing the American unwritten dialects with those of Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be found in the former , of a primitive language , to reconstruct their original speech , and show its identity with the language from which it had so long and so widely diverged . The oneness of the human race is discussed in these Lectures , at much length ; and the aid of learned travellers and scientific physiologists is called in to prove a unity of origin , notwithstanding the marked varieties which have been wrought by time and circumstances . The author does not deny or shun the difficul // ties of the subject ; while he acknowledges that the way in which nature has wrought in producing this variety is mysterious , he maintains that there is no impossibility , that races , apparently so peculiar and so unlike in many particulars , should have sprung from one family . The following is a brief summary of what the author has attempted in a portion of this subject , which we select , together with the illustrations he has annexed . These are striking and ingenious . " We have seen it well established ; first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there have arisen varieties similar to those in the human race , and not less diverse from one another . Secondly , that nature tends , in the human species , to produce varieties in one race approaching to the characteristics of the others . Thirdly , that sporadic varieties of the most extraordinary sort , may be propagated by descent . Fou*thly , that we can find sufficient proofs , in the languages and in the characteristics of larger bodies , or entire nations compared , of their transition from one race to another . Fifthly , that though the origin of the black race is yet involved in mystery , yet are there sufficient facts collected to prove the possibility of its having arisen from another , particularly if , in addition to the action of heat , we admit that of nioral causes acting upon the physical organization . " And here I will remark , that we are often precipitate and unjust , in judging of the past by causes now in action . Itis indeed true that nature is constant and regular in her operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , or that of past observers , no variation may have been noted in the uniformity of her workings , it is that the little segment of our duration 's cycle , over which we and they have travelled , is but as a straibht line , an infinitesimal element , whose curvature can only appear , when referred to a much larger portion of her circumference . That , besides the partial laws with which we are acquainted , there have been others once most active , whose agency is now either suspended or concealed , the study of the world must easily convince us . There were times , within the verge of mythological history , when volcanoes raged in almost every chain of mountains ; when lakes dried up , or suddenly appeared , in many valleys ; when seas burst over their boundaries and created new islands , or retired from their beds and increased 01 ( 1 continents ; when , in fine , there was a power of production and arrangement on a great , magnificent scale ; when nature seemed employed not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the procreation from age to age of the vaster and more massive elements of her sphere ; when her task was not confined to the embroidering the meadows in the spring , or to the paring away of shores by the slow eating action of tides and currents , but when she toiled in the great laboratories of the earth , upheaving mountains , and displacing seas , and thus giving to the world its great indelible features . And how are we to account for this , but by supposing in nature a two-fold // action , one regular from the beginning , and uniform to the end , the other a mysterious , slow-moving power , which , though revolving on the same plane , travels over it with an imperceptible motion , proportioned to the wants of the entire system . ' ? - pp. 144 , 145 . Geology , another fruitful subject in its relation to the Mosaic history , is handled next to the history of man , in this course of Lectures . The statements here made concerning the conclusions of modern geologists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are valuable in themselves , while they serve to allay the fears of those who have taken alarm , lest the cosmogony of the Old Testament should not only not be verified , but should be even brought into discredit , by means of new discoveries in geological science . We can not forbear , in this connexion , to extract the pleasing reflections of the author at the close of one of his lectures ; " And surely it must be gratify ! ng thus to see a science , formerly classed , and not , perhaps , unjustly , among the most pernicious to faith , once more become her handmaid ; to see her now , after so many years of wandering from theory to theory , or rather , from vision to vision , return once more to the home where she was born , and to the altar at which she made her first simple offerings ; no longer , as she first went forth , a wilful , dreamy , empty-handed child , but with a matronly dignity , and a priest-like step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its sacred hearth . For it was religion which , as we saw at the commencement of this lecture , gave geology birth , and to the sanctuary she hath once more returned . " p. 192 . Of the lectures on the remaining subjects , namely , Early History , Archneology , and Oriental Literature , sacred and profane , we have not room to speak particularly . The treatment of these , as well as of the other great subjects , is marked with frankness on the part of the author , when he is met by difficulties ; while he ever takes delight in verifying the scripture histories , by the light shed through the advancement of learning and science , and by the great discoveries to which these have given birth . The history of science and literature here unfolded , in relation to the Scriptures , is applied in its results to the verification of revealed truth , not only as that history is drawn from the friends of religion , but as it is deduced from the writings of those who have carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any suspicion that the results would be so applied . Thus the antiquary and the orientalist are unawares made tributary to the theologian . The writings too of unbelievers , and even of those opposed to the Scriptures , are in this way employed in defence of religion , contrary to their expectation and their will . // On the whole , we have been highly gratified with these Lectures . They are adapted to convey much instruction . And though the style has not the freedom and ease which we should have expected , if the author had been mainly conversant with English scholars , yet it is perspicuous and pure , and sometimes beautiful . Dr. Wiseman , as we have said , is a Catholic ; and we add , so far as we discover his character and disposition from this work , a man of generous and liberal feelings . If he believes in the adage said to have heen current in the church to which he belongs , that " ignorance is the mother of devotion , " he has no fears , on the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in the end , be converted into weapons of hostility against the Christian faith ; for thus far , the more searching they have become , the more have the fears of the timid believer subsided , and the conviction of the ingenuous inquirer been strengthened.
