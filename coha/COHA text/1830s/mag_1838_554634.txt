txt THE subject of costumes is curious and interesting . Dress is an object of universal attention . It occupies no small portion of our time and thoughts ; it forms a distinct and impor* tant trade , or , we should be more inclined to call it , profes*@@183058639.txt IN 1803 , Ward Nicholas Boylston established a fund , affording an income of one hundred dollars a year , to be expended in prizes for Medical Dissertations ; the fund to be managed by the Corporation of Harvard University , and the prizes to be awarded by a committee of physicians , appointed by the Corporation . At first three subjects were proposed in each year ; and the premium awarded to the author of the best dissertation on each , was a gold medal of the value of thirty-three dollars . In 1815 , the number of annual questions was reduced , at the suggestion of the Committee , to two , and the value of the medal increased to fifty dollars ; and so it continues to the present time . It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a single medal each year . The Committee , in 1815 , recommended this change ; but the founder did not assent to it . As it is , the Boylston medal has drawn out a considerable number of discussions , some of them of no small degree of merit . The questions proposed are such as the committee judge to be best suited to lead to valuable discoveries or important observations ; and entire impartiality in the adjudication of the premium is secured by having the names of the authors concealed until after the award is made , when the sealed packet , accompanying the successful dissertation , is alone opened . Unsuccessful authors are never known , unless they choose to avow themselves ; and thus they are spared any mortification , which might otherwise add to the disappointment of their failure . The volume before us contains three Dissertations , for which the Boylston premiums were awarded to the author in 1836 and 1837 . It affords a proof of his industry as well as of his talents , that the author should be successful in obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter year both that were offered . The first Dissertation is a " History of Intermittent Fever , " VOL. xLvII. - No. c. 21 // so far as it is known to have prevailed in New England , on the question , as proposed by the Committee ; " To what Extent , and in what Places , has Intermittent Fever been indigenous in New England ? " For many years past , the only cases of this disease , which have appeared among us , except in a few peculiar situations , have been evidently caused by exposure elsexvhere . There were some traditions , and some scattered notices , which seemed to imply that it was not always so ; hut that , on the contrary , the early settlers of New England , had , in common with most pioneers in a new country , to encounter this among the other difficulties of their enterprise . The inquiry , therefore , involved more of antiquarian research than of recent history . The materials for the investigation were few , and of the most miscellaneous character . The few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had too much else to do , to employ themselves in writing for the benefit , or to gratify the curiosity , of their successors . There were no medical journals to receive occasional communications ; and to make a medical hook was an undertaking in that day rarely accomplished , and in this new world not attempted till long after . What notices there are of the early diseases of New England , are to be found chiefly in the incidental mention of them in the letters and journals of the first settlers , as collected in biographical memoirs , and local histories ; and in the traditions , which , in some instances , have been handed down and preserved by curious conservators of the sayings and doings of their ancestors . In these repositories of ancient occurrences Dr. Holmes has Inade a diligent search ; and he has succeeded in bringing together many facts , of which the record was scarcely known to exist , and in rescuing from oblivion others , of which the knowledge would soon have been irretrievably lost . It may serve as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hope for healthier days , at least for their children , when their forests shall have more thoroughly decayed , to learn , that the same fever and ague , which now so seriously disturbs their comforts and enjoyments , once pervaded the most healthy parts of New England , from which it has wholly disappeared for more than a century . The justly celebrated Eliot contracted the disease in his missionary excursions to the Indians on the hills in // Newton ; where no trace of it has been seen for several generations . Since the early forests were cleared off , Intermittent fever has appeared in New England only in a very few situations , in which some peculiar local cause has operated to produce it . An example of this kind occurred on the banks of the Connecticut River , in Hampshire county , Massachusetts . A dam was carried across the river , in 1792 , at South Hadley , to aid the operations of a canal , in consequence of which the low grounds on the borders of the river were partially overflowed . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable extent in the neighbourhood ; and so confidently was it attributed to the dam , that several of the sick persons recovered damages at law from the canal corporation , and ultimately the dam was removed by order of court , and the disease has rarely , if ever , originated there since . The valley of the Housatonic River , in Berkshire county , has been still more productive of intermittents . The detailed accounts of these , given by Dr. Holmes , belong rather to the members of his profession , interesting as they are to them , than to our readers in general . But we can not forbear to quote an amusing example of successful confidence in an empirical remedy , from the letter of one of his correspondents , written at the advanced age of eighty-seven years . " About forty years ago , " writes Dr. Partridge , of Stockbridge , " a Mr. Smith , from the hills east in Connecticut , bought a farm , mostly tillage land , in the southwest part of Stockbridge , bounding east on the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way above and below said farm ; no stagnant water near , fogs rare ( except in calm weather ) , and more rarely reaching his house , on rising ground , so as to bide the morning sun . His wife of a sedate disposition , quiet and slow of speech , not readily disturbed and rarely from home . After about two years ( 1802 I think ) , the occurrence took place . I lodged in Tyringham , say about ten miles southeast from borne ; in the morning rode a few miles northeast into Haycock Hollow , to see a patient , and return home down said vale through South Lee ; between 9 and 10 A. M. , I met said Mrs. Smith , riding southeast up said vale , as I supposed , out only on a visit , and passed with only a Good morning . ' I here was nine miles from home , and she nearly thirteen . The same day , at four o'clock , P. M. , four miles northwest from home , I // met Mrs. Smith again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Where have you been to-day ? You must have been a round-about way , to be returning on this road . ' She says , I do not know where I have been . A few days ago , the fever ague took me , and I was told , that if I would rise early in the morning , eat some crusts of bread and drink water , and take an horse , and crusts in my pocket , and ride all day , all the roads I could find which I never see before , and eat only crust and drink vater , I should lose the fever ague . Well , is this your fit day ? c Yes . ' Have you felt any ague ? No ; a little before I see you in the morning , I might have a little chill ; but I did not regard it , the sun was so warm and pleasant . ' Any fever ? No ; but may have drinked more water than common with my crusts , and felt pretty well all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ? I do not know . After I saw you in the morning I rode on , and coming to the hills , turned and came back , took a road , went on north , till noon , or after , and turned about to find the way home , - going right , I suppose Yes , - farewell . ' Desiring to know the issue of the strange impression on her mind , with the exercise and diet , I soon after went and inquired as to the event , and found that she lost the ague and fever that day , and had no more of it . " - pp. 98 , 99 . The second Dissertation , " On the Nature and Treatment of Neuralgia , " gives scope to a different kind of investigation . A young man , just entering upon the practical duties of his profession , can not of course be expected to do much in the way of discovery , by original observations , in reference to an obscure and not very frequent disease . All that is left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations of others , and , by a skilful examination and comparison of them , to draw from them such a description of the disease , and of its character and treatment , as they afford the means for . This Dr. Holmes has done ; and with such industry and ability , as to render his treatise highly valuable to the profession . The third Dissertation , " On the Utility and Importance of Direct Exploration in Medical Practice , " had been already published ; and under rather peculiar circumstances . It obtained for its author the Boylston premium for 1836 . Two other dissertations on the same subject , though not entitled to the prize as being the best , were thought by the Committee worthy of notice ; and , a liberal medical gentleman having furnished the means , they awarded a prize of the same pe // cuniary value to their authors . The three were then published , at the expense of the same gentleman , by the Massachusetts Medical Society , and distributed gratuitously , not only to all the Yellows of that Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be distinguished as the successful one among such worthy compeers , is sufficient evidence of the value of this treatise in the estimation of those most competent to judge of it . Like the others it was written for the medical profession , and is chiefly interesting to them , rather than to our readers in general . It gives a survey of the affections in which direct exploration is applicable , the extent to which it is required in consequence of the inadequacy of other means of investigation , and of the results to be obtained from the examination . Most of our readers must have often seen , if they have happily been too much exempt from disease in the last few years to have felt , the physician tapping on the chest of his patient , and then applying his ear , and listening wistfully , as expecting some wise suggestion from within . To many of them , all this has seemed like mere trifling or quackery , while others have been ready enough to suppose that valuable information is gained by it ; although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have any very distinct notion of the nature of this information , or of the principles on which the means of obtaining it are founded . This knowledge we propose now to supply them ; and , if their curiosity has been enough excited by seeing the process of thumping and listening ( percussion and auscultation ) to induce them to give us a hearing , we shall hope to make it all plain to them . We might do this chiefly in the words of our author . But , as we have already intimated , in writing for physicians , he has of course made use of the technical terms by which they avoid circumlocution and gain precision . We shall strive to make ourselves intelligible to the uninitiated , even though it may be at the expense of some more words , and of some loss of professional exactness . The language of auscultation has been more encumbered with technical phraseology than any department of medical science . The later French medical writers , from whom we have derived a large portion of our knowledge on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . Sometimes they doubtless obtain by this means a term , which // better expresses the qualities of the object they wish to designate . But , in many instances , the whole idea might be fully as well or better expressed by words already in use , and too often we get only new names for old ideas . The whole matter of auscultation has been peculiarly overburdened in this manner , by the use of new terms , coined with learned etymology from the Greek or Latin language ; and we have no doubt , that a knowledge of its real utility has been greatly retarded by so much erudite phraseology . We do not mean to intimate , that the author of these " Dissertations " has exhibited any of this silly affectation . It is quite otherwise . He has merely used the language as he found it ; and , writing for those to whom it is familiar , he had no reason to take any special pains to avoid or to explain it . The principal methods of direct exploration , and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and auscultation . The others , palpation , succussion , &amp;c. , are either used too unfrequently , or their mode of application is too obvious , to demand our attention at present . The principle , on which percussion is applied to the detection of disease , is sufficiently plain . Indeed , it is often used in the common affairs of life . The carpenter strikes his hammer against the wall , to ascertain where to drive his nail in a sure place . ' ' The spirit-dealer knocks upon the head of his cask , to learn the quantity of liquor contained in it . With precisely the same view , the physician thumps the chest of his patient , that he may judge of the state of the organs by the sound which is given forth . The chest is an enclosed cavity , containing , and in the natural state filled by , several organs of different degrees of density . Of course , the part corresponding to each organ gives a dull or a resonant sound , according as the organ is firm and solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chest is occupied by the lungs . They are of a light and spongy texture , partly filled with blood , and partly with air . The sound they emit is intermediate between that of an empty cavity , or one filled with air only , and a collection of fluid , or a solid organ . In the neighbourhood of the lungs is the heart on one side , and the liver on the other , both solid organs ; the latter , indeed , not strictly in the same cavity , but capable of pressing upon the others . If either of these is increased in size , so as to encroach upon the langs , // the existence and the extent of the encroachment will be shown by a flat sound in the place of the natural resonance . If the membrane which lines the cavity of the chest becomes inflamed , a fluid is gradually poured out into the cavity , compressing the lungs , and occupying their space and then a flat sound is the consequence . Or , the same space may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as the effect of disease ; and then the sound on the other hand is unnaturally resonant . The structure of the lungs itself is also liable to be changed by disease . On the one hand it may be emphysematous , too much distended by air , when the sound is hollow . On the other hand , it may be rendered unnaturally solid , either by a pressure of blood , or by inflammation , or by the formation of tubercles ; either of which will cause the sound to be dull or flat in proportion to the extent of the disease . It is not our purpose to go into particulars , and show how all the several affections are distinguished from each other . Such details belong to the physician , and must be studied by him with industry and care . The distinction is made partly by other considerations , and partly by differences in the percussion itself . We may give an example by way of illustration , of the extent to which this mode of investigation may be carried . We have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs , inflammation , and tubercles , all cause a flat sound . How shall we know one of these from the rest ? The formation of tubercles is a slow process , and the disease they produce is chronic ; and it is attended by circumstances quite unlike those which ordinarily accompany the others . For this reason there can generally be little question between them . But this is not all . Tubercles are almost always first deposited in the upper portions of the lungs , while inflammation as generally occupies the middle and lower portions . In any case , therefore , where the disease has not advanced so far as to leave no room for doubt , if the flatness be in the upper part of the chest , the presumption is strong in favor of the existence of tubereles ; if in the lower part , it is something else . In like manner , a crowded state of blood in the lungs is ascertained , chiefly by means other than those we are now considering . Between a collection of fluid in the chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inflammation of the lung itself ; that is , // between pleurisy and pneumonia , the distinction is not so easy . Both are acute diseases ; and both give rise to many of the same symptoms . Indeed , so much alike are they in these respects , that it was formerly said to be impossible to distinguish them . Yet the importance of their effects is widely different . The one is a grave disease and often destroys life , the other is rarely fatal . And the treatment required by each is often very unlike . Here , too , we are by no means restricted to the use of percussion . Other modes of examination serve to explain , or correct , or confirm , as the case may be , the results of this . But we must show what this can do . We have seen that , in pleurisy , the flatness of sound is caused by a fluid poured out into the cavity of the chest , taking the place of a portion of the lung . The flatness is consequently complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly . In inflammation of the lung the condensation , and the consequent flatness , are complete only at the part most highly inflamed , and diminish by a more or less gentle gradation towards the healthy portions . This flatness , too , is constantly observed in the same place , whatever may be the position of the body , whereas in pleurisy every movement of the body causes the fluid to flow to the lowest part , and consequently changes the seat of the flat sound . These different circumstances are not always enough of themselves to establish a perfect diagnosis between the two diseases . But they go far towards it ; and , taken in connexion with the results of the other principal mode of exploration , they rarely leave any just cause of doubt between them . In detecting diseases of the heart , percussion , regarded by itself alone , will do little more than to point out an enlargement , without showing its precise character , or whether it be an enlargement of the heart itself , or a distention of the pencardium by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions , with a greater or less degree of certainty . The organs of the abdomen are less concealed from observation , than those of the chest . The walls of the cavity are yielding , so that any considerable change in the size , or texture , or position , may be detected by pressure ; a mode of examination now learnedly called palpation . Percussion is often useful , however , in diseases of these organs . It enables the physician to discover their precise condition with // greater accuracy , to detect with more certainty the nature and extent of any enlargement of an organ , or the existence of any morbid growth , or the accumulation of a fluid . From the almost constant use of percussion , in a large proportion of diseases , by most intelligent physicians , at the present day , and from the obvious principles upon which its proper application is founded , it would seem strange , that it should not have always been in use . But so it is . Until witbin the last few years , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced it as a new invention , in 1761 . But his discovery excited very little notice until Corvisart called the attention of the profession to it , in 1808 ; and it did not come into general use until the publication of Laennec , in 1815 . Since that time much has been written upon it , and much has been done to improve the art of practising it successfully . At first , percussion was performed by striking with the ends of the fingers directly upon the part examined . But this is liable to serious objections . Besides that it sometimes gives pain , there is an uncertainty in the resonance , in consequence of the difference of texture in the several parts struck upon . The present practice is , therefore , always to interpose something to receive the blow . A variety of substances have been used for this purpose . An ivory plate has been much commended and much used ; others prefer a piece of India rubber ; and many use only a finger of the left hand . " Fingers were made before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the finger is always at hand , while any other pleximeter adds something to the already cumbersome apparatus of the physician , is much in its favor ; though in general , that will practically be the best in the hands of any practitioner , which he is most accustomed to use . The degree of resonance on percussion is very considerably modified in different persons by the form and bodily condition of the patient . The chest of a thin , spare person , gives a much louder and clearer sound than one which is well clothed with fat and flesh . All this is easily taken into consideration by the physician , so that he is in little danger of mistaking an accumulation without the chest for disease within . A comparison between the two sides of the chest VOL . XLVII. - NO.C. 22 // gives additional security against such a mistake . In some parts , it is true , the organs are different in the two sides ; but to a considerable extent they correspond . It is also true , that the same state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obscure the results of a comparison between them . But this is extremely rare . In general there is a marked difference in the sounds of the two sides in most cases of decided disease . To take advantage of this comparison , it is of course necessary , that the practitioner be accurate in his knowledge of the anatomy of the parts , or he may confound the flatness produced by striking upon a solid organ for that of diseased structure . The practice of auscultation is founded upon principles of physical science equally well established . Sounds , which are caused by certain actions within the cavities of the body , are transmitted through the walls of the cavity , and are perceived when the ear is applied closely to the surface , or through the intervention of a proper instrument . These sounds are always alike under like circumstances , and are changed when the circumstances which caused them are changed . Hence the physician , if he render his ear familiar with the sounds caused by the internal actions of the body in a healthy state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is diseased . What disease is indicated by any particular unnatural sound , he can learn only from repeated and extensive observations . But that there is a deviation from the natural state , he will perceive at once ; and the accumulated observations of all the physicians , whose attention has been directed to the subject , have now gone far to explain most of the deviations which have been noticed . These principles are chiefly available for practical purposes in reference to the actions of the lungs and the heart . The air in passing through the windpipe gives rise to a certain sound , which in health is always nearly the same . This sound is modified in the smaller tubes ( the bronchia ) into which the windpipe divides , and again still more decidedly in the little air vesicles in which the bronchia terminate , and which occupy every part of the lungs . These several sounds are readily perceived and easily distinguished by a practised ear , applied to the corresponding part of the chest and neck . Hence we have tracheal , bronchial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in their appropriate places , and in a right degree of force , they indicate a healthy state of the parts . When a portion of the lung is diseased , the current of air in that part is either obstructed or its natural force changed , and of course the sound is modified . Hence , by applying the ear extensively over the chest , we are enabled to detect the existence , and the precise seat , and generally the nature , of the disease . In inflammation of the lungs , the air cells are for the time obliterated in the part affected . As there are no vesicles for the air to enter , there is no vesicular respiration . But we have , what would not at first view be anticipated , bronchial respiration in its stead . In the healthy condition of the lungs , the porous character of the vesicular structure renders it a bad conductor of sound , so that the sound caused by the air in the bronchial tubes is not transmitted through them . But when they are consolidated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the same time , the morbid condition of the parts gives a greater degree of intensity to the sound itself . Bronchial respiration , then , heard in the place of vesicular , always indicates - inflammation ? That would be a simplicity in the art of distinguishing diseases , which nature does not tolerate . But it always indicates a consolidation of the lung from some cause , and inflammation is one of the most frequent of the causes . Another , and unhappily a frequent cause , is the deposition of tubercles , in incipient consumption . As in regard to percussion , so in reference to auscultation , there are means of distinguishing between the several morbid affections , which give rise to phenomena in many respects similar . These it is the business of the physician to study , and they often exercise his ingenuity and industry not a little . But it would lead us too far to attempt to explain them here . There are other morbid sounds in the respiration , besides those which arise from what we may call the misplacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines the air passages is inflamed , as in common cold or catarrh , its surface is at first unnaturally dry ; and in that state the current of air through the tubes gives rise to various sounds more or less musical , which are the different modifications of // the sonorous rdle. * At a later period the membrane becomes more than naturally moist , and the passages are crowded , and more or less obstructed , by an adhesive fluid . In this state , if the ear is applied to the chest , the air is heard bubbling through the mucus , aTid this is the mucous rdle . Inflammation of the substance of the lung , in its earlier stage , before the air vesicles are obliterated , is accompanied by a still different rdle , the crepitous . In the advanced stage of consumption , a cavity , sometimes more than one , is formed in the lungs , at first filled with purulent matter , which is afterwards discharged through an opening into a bronchial tube . The air as it rushes into , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a peculiar hollow sound , which is the cavernous rdle . If the cavity is very large , and the opening into it from the bronchia small , the sound resembles that caused by blowing into the mouth of an empty bottle ( amphoric resonance ) . The same sound is produced when air escapes into the cavity of the chest , compressing the lung which is sometimes the result of an accidental injury , and sometimes of ulceration . The sounds of the voice give still farther aid in detecting and distinguishing the diseases of the lungs . In the healthy state of those organs , no peculiar sensation is communicated to the ear , unless it be applied over the windpipe , or over the larger bronchia at the root of the lungs . But where a portion of the lung is condensed , whether it be by inflammation , or tubereles , or by the infiltration of a fluid into its substance , a resonance of the voice is transmitted to the ear at the corresponding part of the chest , resembling that from the bronchial tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty cavity in the lungs , the sound is still more remarkable . The voice seems to enter the ear , as if the mouth of the speaker were applied closely to it . This speaking from the chest ( pectoriloquy ) , when strongly * There is a good deal of difference of opinion as to the best term to designate these morbid sounds . Some writers use the English word rattle , and others the Latin rhonchus . We prefer to adopt the French rdle , used by Laennec. *Vhere the thing to be expressed is new , it is better to adopt a new word , than to assign a new meaning to a word already in common use . As no new English word has been proposed , we can only do this by borrowing from a foreign language ; and the French term was first introduced , and is more extensively used , and more agreeable to the ear than the Latin . // marked , is a very decided characteristic of confirmed consumption , and sometimes gives evidence of a hopeless condition of that deceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel any apprehension . Dr. Williams says of it , " More than once has it occurred to me , that the very words , which in that delusive confidence with which this malady enshrouds its victims , ridiculed my examination of the chest , roundly saying , that nothing ailed them there , have belied their meaning , and , coming from the breast , have told a far different tale . " A modification of the voice , of a different character , is observed in some states of the chest in pleurisy . The voice comes to the ear through the walls of the chest , not in its clear natural tone , but in a vibrating , thrilling , squeaking sound ; like the bleating of a goat ( hcegophony ) . Auscultation is applied to the investigation of the diseases of the heart as well as those of the lungs , although the actions of this organ are more obscure , and the phenomena which attend them are less understood . On applying the ear over the region of the heart , we perceive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating against the ribs ; then we hear two distinct sounds , following each other at every pulsation , in regular succession . By habitual practice we learn to distinguish the natural force of the impulse , as well as its natural extent and limits , and the regular cadence or rhythm of the successive sounds , and to appreciate the difference if either is changed by disease . The diagnosis of the particular diseases of the heart and large arteries is still involved in much obscurity . Considerable progress has been made in the knowledge of them within the last few years , and much may be hoped from the investigations which are constantly going on . As it is , we are in general able to distinguish with confidence between the actual changes of structure in that organ , and the nervous , and sometimes imaginary affections , which have often , in past times , been confounded with them . And , in many cases , if not in most , we can ascertain the particular character of the morbid affection , and give a tolerably sure prognostication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , that some of these diseases , which were formerly classed together without any other distinction than " diseases of the heart , " and regarded alike with terror , // as surely fatal , excite very little alarm , now that their true character , and the means of distinguishing them , are better known . Enlargements of the heart , or its envelope , are easily detected by the greater extent over which the impulse and the sounds of its action are perceived , and hy the absence of the sound of respiration , in consequence of the encroachment of this organ upon the lungs , as well as by an enlargement of the correspouding part of the chest , and a change in the sound on percussion . But a knowledge of the general fact of au enlargement is not enough . We wish to know , whether it be a simple dilatation of the cavities of the heart , or the thickening of its muscular substance , or a distention of the pericardium by a fluid . And each of these has its appropriate , characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them . The membrane which covers the external surface of the heart , and that which lines its internal cavities , and occasionally also the muscular substance itself , are liable to inflammation ; its numerous valves are exposed to various diseases ; and both its cavities and its orifices are subject to unnatural dilatation or contraction . Most of these changes can be detected with a greater or less degree of confidence during life , and some of them are capable of successful treatment . We shall not trouble our readers with a description of the different sounds heard in the several diseases , as we have done in regard to the lungs ; partly because these sounds are less fully understood , and partly because we are afraid of wearying them with so many details . Let us now see how these two modes of exploration , percussion and auscultation , bear upon each other . We have thus far examined them only in their separate capacities . In their relations to each other , they do much to correct or confirm the results obtained from either separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge obtained from the symptoms , we have two distinct modes of observation . If the inferences drawn from the sounds on percussion are confirmed by applying the ear to the chest , - and , in regard to the lungs , we have both the respiration and the voice to reveal their secrets to us ; - and especially if these inferences are in accordance with the symptoms , we may feel an assured confidence , that we have come to a just knowledge of the disease . // A man has pain in the side , with difficulty of breathing , attended by more or less fever . All this may arise either from rheumatism in the muscles , or from pleurisy or inflammation of the lung ; and the symptoms alone will not always tell which is the disease . If it be rheumatism , we are not likely to find any external sign of it , except perhaps some feebleness of respiration , on account of the difficulty of expanding and contracting the chest . If the disease be pleurisy , we shall have flatness on percussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing its place if the patient changes his position , so as always to keep the lowest part ; absence of all sound of respiration in that part , while the respiratory sound is louder than natural in the surrounding parts ; and generally h*egophonic resonance of the voice . If it be inflammation of the lung , there is dulness on percussion , increasing , as the disease advances , to flatness , retaining the same place in all positions , not bounded abruptly by healthy resonance ; crepitous role in the respiratory sounds , at first , followed by bronchial respiration and bronchophony . These several characteristics , however obscure they may seem in the description to many of our readers , to an intelligent and experienced observer will perfectly designate the character of the disease , so as to leave no doubt whatever in his mind . The disease may , indeed , be complicated , and then the evidences of its nature will be so too ; and so will be the treatment that it will require . A more interesting case is unhappily also much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually loses his ruddy color and vigorous strength ; he loses flesh , and occasionally a slight cough alarms the fears of his friends , though he himself thinks it nothing but a trifling cold . On examination , a slight dulness is observed at the apex of one lung , - so slight as scarcely to be appreciated except by comparison with the opposite side . The respiratory sound is at first remarkably feeble at that part , or a little later there is bronchial respiration and bronchophony . These are sure indications , that the way is already prepared for consumption . Still there is hope , if a proper regimen can immediately be begun and persevered in ; for direct remedies can here do but little . Too often , either the patient is not alarmed early enough , or , in despite of every precaution or effort , the disease advances . Bronchial respiration is followed by a muco // crepitous , and then by cavernous rdle , bronchophony by pectoriloquy , and so on till life is destroyed , each step of the destructive process being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what avails it thus to trace the melancholy progress of a disease which we have no power to arrest ? There is some consolation in knowing the just amount of what we have to fear , however great that amount may be . And , if we have no remedies that are able to reach this formidable disease , who shall say , that we shall never have them ? The first steps towards acquiring them must be taken in obtaining a full knowledge of the disease . We can now do something towards prolonging life and diminishing suffering . We can at least abstain from doing harm by vain attempts to effect what is impossible . Above all , by an early discovery of the disease , we may teach our patient to flee from the danger before it overtakes him . In very many cases , a careful examination of the chest will detect unequivocal evidence of approaching consumption , long before the symptoms excite any considerable apprehension . At this early period much may be done to avert the danger . And if the attention of physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more might doubtless be done to diminish the fatality of consumption than ever has been . If it be asked , on which we are the most to depend for the elucidation of disease , the investigation of symptoms , or an examination by physical signs , we answer , that there is no opposition whatever between them . The use of direct exploration does not preclude a careful inquiry into the symptoms of the case . On the contrary , it prompts to a more full investigation . In practical life , it certainly is true , that those physicians who most constantly make use of the benefits of exploration , are not only equally , but generally much more , thorough in their inquiries into all the circumstances of a patient 's health , than those who neglect or ridicule it . This may be partly because those , who are the most zealous in their researches , are the most willing to take the trouble requisite to acquire a new method of investigation , when it promises adequate advantages . But this is not the whole of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different modes of examination , that , were it a mere matter of specula // tive philosophy , the mind would necessarily be stimulated by the comparison . There are still some physicians , who laugh at the whole matter of direct exploration as either idle foolery , or empiricism . But they are those , who have never taken the pains to learn how to practise it ; were there no more advantage in it than they know how to obtain from it , their ridicule might be better founded . Whether their ignorance be the effect of indolence or incompetence , it becomes us not to say . But , while they laugh , others will learn ; and the time is not far distant , when the physician , who is unable to practise percussion and auscultation , will be held to be unfit for his profession . We have not written these remarks in the expectation of converting such men to our views . Nor , indeed , has it been our leading object to instruct the profession generally . Our aim has been , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of examination . Neither our limits nor our plan admit of going fully into the details of the subject . But we have hoped to do enough to show , that the means of acquiring an accurate knowledge of an extensive and highly important class of diseases are vastly improved by the introduction of this mode of examining them.
