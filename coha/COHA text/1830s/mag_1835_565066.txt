txt SAMUEL LEWIS SOUTHARD was born , June , 1787 , at Basking Ridge , Somerset County , New-Jersey . His father , Henry Southard , is now living , in his eighty-seventh year . For sixteen years , he was a member of the State Legislature of New-Jersey ; and in the year 1800 , he was elected a member of Congress , which office he uninterruptedly sustained , with credit to himself and his constituents , for the term of twenty-one years , with the brief exception of two Congresses-from the year 1811 to 1815 . Samuel L. Southard was educated at Basking Ridge , and Princeton , where Dr. Finley commenced his celebrated academy , by the advice of Mr. Southard , the father , who was desirous of educating his son at home . Among his classmates , at school and college , were Dr. Lindsley , President of Nashville University , Theodore Frelinghuysen , his colleague in the United States Senate , and Mr. Kirkpatrick , a clergyman of high reputation . // Mr. Southard was the youngest son of a numerous family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State with himself . In the fall of 1802 , having finished his preparatory studies , he entered college , and graduated in the September of 1804 , then hut seventeen years of age , and with the first collegiate honors . On the fourth of March , 1801 , at the inauguration of President Jefferson , he delivered an address , which was puhlished in many of the newspapers of the day . immediately upon leaving college , he took upon himself the ushership of an academy , in Menham , New-Jersey , under the direction of Rev. Dr. C. Armstrong , and then in a flourishing condition . His reasons for doing this , were two-fold : first , that he might review his studies and improve his classical educationand secondly , that he might support himself , until he had selected his profession ; although his father expressed his entire willingness to support him , in the pursuit of his profession ; yet he declined the generous offer - choosing rather to depend upon his own industry , than to make farther demands upon a parent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenses of a numerous family . From the time of his taking his first degree at college , he supported himself entirely . Ahout six months after he went to the Meudham Academy , Dr. Armstrong , with the consent of the trustees , gave him the entire charge of the institution , thus throwing upon him the instruction of ahout fifty scholars , of all ages , many older than himself , and others preparing for the junior class , at college - some of whom are now holding distinguished stations . While occupying this station , he sustained and increased the reputation of the academy , and received the thanks of the trustees . His health ( in his youth , always feeble ) now failed him ; and , at the close of eighteen months , he was compelled to resign his charge . IHis success in govermag , was good ; and when leaving , he obtained the kind regards and good wishes of both parents and children . In April , 1806 , he left Nexv-Jersey , for Virginia , and resided in the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time was spent in giving instructions to three or four children , in a private family , and in a diligent course of reading . He commenced the study of the law , though with no intention of practising it ; hut , that he might obtain a knowledge of its principles . The study of Blackstone , to whom he gave many diligent perusals , inflamed him with a desire of prosecuting the inquiry farther , and of reading the authors , to whom references were made . He therefore studied many of the leading and most valuable works on national and municipal law . He was not in the office of any practitioner , hut often conversed with Judge Brooke , Chancellor Green , and others , whose friendship he had acquired . In 1808 , he was persuaded to take a license , though still without // the intention to pursue that profession . Advancing yet farther , he was also induced to argue a few causes , for some of his acquaintances , but without meaning to obtain business , or to set tie in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice . His first effort was at Stafford Court-house , before the ven&amp; rable Judge Parker , who held the District Court . He proposed to his associate counsel to take a point in the construction of a statute of the State , which purported and was intended to be a copy of a British statute , the construction of which had uniformly been the same in all the courts . His associate declined , but Mr. Southard persisted and argued the point , and was answered by Mr. Botts , one of Burr 's counsel , who was afterwards burned up , in the theatre , at Richmond ; Mr. Southard replied ; and , after advisement , the Judge decided in his favor , which decision was subsequently confirmed . The Judge declared that , when the point was first taken , he considered it altogether untenable , and would not have heard an argument from any one but a young stranger . When Mr. Southard arose , to argue the case , he remained motionless , and without recollection or apparent consciousness , for several minutes , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he unconsciously moved his hand and touched a book , which he intended to use ; this book fell on a table , some inches lower , and opened to a page he meant to quote . The noise aroused him ; his eye caught the passage ; his recollection returned , and he made his argument . The fall of that book probably decided his profession - for , had he taken his seat , without making the argument , he would not afterwards have made an attempt . He argued a few other causes , and had the offer of business , but declined it . Mr. Jefferson , Mr. Monroe , Judge Brooke , and others , advised him to settle at Charlottesville , near the seat of the Virginia University - but circumstances prevented ; and , in the winter of 1810 , he left Virginia , and in January , 1811 , he settled at Hemington , Huntendon County , New-Jersey . His residence was selected under the solicitation of the Governor and others , and with promises of aid , in which , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thrown wholly upon his own resources , he almost immediatly obtained as much business as his health and experience would enable him to attend to - more , perhaps , than any other young practitioner in the State , in so short a period after his commencement . In May , 1811 , he obtained his license . In October , 1811 , he was appointed Deputy Attorney-General , in the large counties of Sussex and Morris , which office he held from two Attorney-Generals , of different politics , until he was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court . In June , 1812 , he married , in Virginia . // In the winter of 1811 , the democratic party , to which he was attached , had resolved to change the Attorney-General . A part of them were dissatisfied with the candidates selected to take his place , and applied to him to consent to he run as a candidate . The federal party , despairing of the election of the old Attorney-General , stated to him that they would vote for him , which would have ensured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too young and inexperienced for such an office , and desired the election of the then incumbent , who was a worthy man , and a faithful officer . About this time , he was appointed Master and Examiner in Chancery - an office which he holds up to this day , and in which he has performed much service : this office does not interfere with practice , and may be held by any practitioner or other citizen , by Judges and other officers . While he held this situation , his practice was extensive . In the winter of 1814 , 15 , the great steamboat controversy , between New-Jersey and New-York and their citizens , assumed an interesting character ; and , upon the application of the assignees of Fulton , a hearing , by counsel , of the parties , took place before the Legislature - he was employed as counsel , and the cause was argued by him and Judge Hopkinson , on one side , and by Mr. Emmett , on the other . It attracted great crowds . A report of the case has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminently successful in the competition . Mr. Emmett spoke of his efforts and success , in strong terms . By the active part he took in this case , and the ability with which he managed it , his reputation rapidly spread throughout the State . In October , 1811 , he was elected to the Legislature , by what is believed to he the largest vote ever given in the county of Huntendon . He was of the democratic or republican party . His father was one of the first individuals who espoused that party , in his part of the State , and was always an active and ardent supporter of its principles . His son was of the same school - ardent , zealous , and active . The leading members of the bar were generally federalists ; and , while they were attached to him , treated him with personal kindness ; they pressed him with severity , and constantly required from him , in conversation , an active defence of his opinions , which he never avoided . In 1812 , the peace party prevailed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen ; and the change , that was effected in the following year , was , in a great measure , attributed to his exertions . During this year , he probably wrote more than any two men in the State . When he took his seat , as a member of the Legislature , the office of Judge of the Supreme Court became vacant , and he was looked to as candidate for the office . // His health had declined ; and it was thought necessary , by his physician , that he should , for a time at least , quit the labors of the bar . He desired to have the office , but his youth and the short time he had been at the bar , made him unwilling to request it . It was the pleasure of the Legislature to select him , and it is believed , that he would have had no opposition , if he had not advocated the re-appointment of one or two officers , in the joint meeting , who were among the best in the State , but who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had skilfully discharged his duty , who did not abuse office for party purposes , should not be abused , for opinion 's sake . He was successiTul in saving them , although the party was in a large majority ; but some of them were offended , and therefore changed their purpose of making him Judge . He was not ignorant of the effect , which his course would produce , and that it might be a sacrifice of his wishes , which , though not spoken of at the time , were strong , on account of his health . His opponent was an eminent laxvyer , of his own party ; but , notwithstanding this , Mr. Southard was chosen , by a large majority . Although his offence had been his refusal to displace a federalist , yet the federal party divided equally between him and his opponent . Mr. Southard was twenty-eight years old , when he took his seat as a Judge of the Supreme Court , and he had been but a little more than four years at the bar . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of which time , he reported the decisions of the court , under a law of the State , requiring such decisions , as affected the court for the trial of small causes , to be printed . He was confined by the terms of the act , but extended the reports beyond what was done by others . His reports are in two volumes . In 1816 , he was appointed , by the Chancellor , a Master to decide upon injunctions , in the absence of the Chancellor from the city of Trenton - an office , rendered important by the fact , that the Chancellor , who is also Governor , does not usually live at the seat of government . He still holds this appointment , and is often called to perform its duties when he is in Trenton . His youth and short service at the bar made his political opponents question the propriety of his appointment as Judge ; but , in a very short time , he was found to be an efficient member of the bench . The jurisdiction of the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in each county , a Circuit Court , for the trial of issues joined at the bar . The duties of this office , it is well known , are laborious . So much satisfaction did he give , and such a reputation , for probity , consistency , and ability , did he acquire , that , when he left the bench , the bar gave him a very unusual testimony of their esteem . They all united in a public // dinner , under circumstances which manifested respect and affec* tion . His character as a Judge , is unspotted ; and , though always a politician , he was never even suspected of being influenced , hy his feelings or partialities , in any cause . In October , 1820 , he was chosen Senator to Congress . He had previously been much urged , by his political friends , to take this office ; but he had refused . Two days , however , before the election , circumstances occurred , which induced him to consent , . and he was elected . It was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Mr. Wilson , who then held the seat . Although he did not expect to take his seat until December , 1821 , yet the incumbent resigned , and he was appointed to supply the balance of the term . He took his seat in the Senate , Fehruary , 1821 , while the Missouri question was yet not fully settled . The great question had been decided in the preceding session ; and the only point remaining , was the acceptance of the Constitution . Against this , but one objection was urged , which was to the provision excluding free blacks from the State . Mr. Southard thought that , under the laws of the last session , the question was decided , as to slavery in Missouri - and that , the law and faith of the government required the admission , if the Constitution was republican . He voted against the admission , until some provision was made for altering the provision referred to , as against the Constitution of the United States . But he voted for the admission , upon the condition that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any terms . Some of the members of New-Jersey , in the House , changed their votes , and the State was admitted upon that condition . This change was attributed to Mr. Southard , and he was strongly censured for it . But it is not , perhaps , known what would have been his vote on the main question , if he had been there at the former session . He considered , that that question was settled by solemn law , and that the faith of the Union was pledged to the admission , on the sole condition that the Constitution of Missouri was republican . He opposed the violation of the law of the former session ; and upon the Constitution of that State being altered , in the particular mentioned , he gave his assent . The joint committee , that prepared the resolutions for the admission which passed , consisted of twenty from the House* and seven from the Senate , all elected by ballot . His father was a member of Congress , of the House , and he of the Senate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the close of that session , his father left Congress , declining re-election , having served his constituents , as acceptably as any man ever did for so long a period of time . Mr. Southard was in the Senate sixteen days , at the end of the session of 1820 , and his period of six years then cornmenced. // He continued in the Senate the two succeeding sessions , and belonged to the republican party , then in the majority ; and of that party he was always found an active , attentive , and industrious member . In August , 1823 , Mr. Monroe offered Mr. Southard the appointment of Secretary of the Navy , which office he would have declined , if he had not been strongly urged by friends , to whose wishes he yielded . One of his reasons for hesitation , stated at the time , was , that a violent electioneering presidential contest was approaching ; that he was young - but little known to the nation - and it was probable , in the short period of Mr. Monroe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the administration of the department such character and weight , as to make it the xvish or interest of the successor to retain him ; and thus his discharge might operate injuriously to his character . It was thought , at the time of this appointment , that the election was in some degree influenced hy Mr. Calhoun ; and on this account , some of the friends of Mr. Calhoun and Mr. Adams felt unfriendly to him . But they were in error , and the election was unsolicited and purely the act of Mr. Monroe . The members of the cabinet , in its then state , were not consulted ; nor did any of them know of it , until Mr. Monroe announced to them his determination , provided he was not personally unacceptable to any of them . Thus the selection was made , purely from Mr. Monroe 's own knowledge and estimate of his character and ability . They became acquainted when Mr. Southard was but nine years of age , and from that time they had been upon the most friendly and intimate terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this office , Mr. Southard entered the sixteenth of September , 1823 . The registers , therefore , are wrong , in stating it to have been in December of that year . When Mr. Southard became a member of the cabinet , three of the members of it were spoken of as candidates for the presidency . Their friends were anxious and zealous ; and it was scarcely possible for Mr. Monroe to make an appointment , or to recommend a measure , to which some partizan would not give a character of partiality to one or the other of the candidates . Though holding a position of perfect neutrality , his situation was still very painful , and his acts often misconstrued ; and much hostility of feeling arose against him , from this cause . But , all this was without foundation , only illustrating the evils of having candidates for the presidency in the cabinet , and thus creating dissatisfaction , and rendering the President himself unpopular . Mr. Southard saw the difficulties by which he was surrounded , and at once decided , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either candidate ; that his first duty was to his country and Mr. Monroe , and to aid in furthering the administration of the // government , upon the principles which he had approved , He was aware , that this was dangerous ground for himself , as he could have no personal claims on any successor , and would probably be discarded , to make room for some more active partizan . But this could not change his course . He did not express his preference to any ; but , as he was , at the time , very intimate with the most powerful friends of one of the candidates - General Jackson - whenever they spoke to him , as they often did , on the subject , he apprised them distinctly , that the was not in favor of their candidate . Until after Mr. Adams 's election , no conversation , even alluding to his election , or the formation of his cabinet , took place between him and Mr. Southard . When Mr. Monroe retired from the presidency , he expressed , in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the manner in which , unsolicited , he had performed his duties , and the aid he afforded him on all subjects ; and he added , that he had never associated with one , from whom he had received more faithful and efficient aid . Their intercourse was of the most intimate and friendly character , and continued until the death of Mr. Monroe . After Mr. Monroe had been given over by his physicians , Mr. S&amp;nthard made him a visit ; and when he entered the room , Mr. M. raised his head , and taking his hand , said , with great emotion , My friend , I am glad to see you ; I love better to see you and Mr. * than any other men in the world . ' It is impracticable to embrace , in a sketch so short as this must necessarily be , all the points of Mr. Southard 's administration of the Navy Department . A few days after he had assumed the duties of the office , information was received of the illness of Commodore Porter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Key-West . Mr. Southard promptly dispatched medical and other aid , and sent Commodore Rogers out to relieve , as necessity might require . Such relief was very beneficial . In the Navy , previous to Mr. Southard 's administration of the department , there had been an entire cessation of promotions , and the Navy was dispirited , He urged a change , and more promotions were made than have before or since been made . The Navy registers , for the different years , will show that , in this respect , he regarded the just claims of the officers , and the interests of the service . And , in recommending to the President for promotion , he uniformly refused to recommend those whom he thought unfit for the higher office . His example , in this respect , has been useful to the service , though it has not been always followed by his successors . For some time , it had been customary to make appointments in the Navy , without much regard to age , or the States from which the persons came ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes appointed . Mr. Southard endeavored to produce equality , as // far as practicable , and thus exerted an equal interest in all sec tions of the country ; and therefore a rule was made , that no one under fourteen and over twenty , should be appointed - a rule that is still followed . It had also been customary to make appointments of the medical officers , when recommended , without much knowledge of the qualifications of the applicant ; and hence , there were surgeons very unfit to trust with the health and lives of the officers and men . Mr. Southard established a board of examination of competent surgeons - required every applicant to submit to an examination , and be recommended by it , as fit and competent , before he could be appointed . The result was most salutary . Several incompetent officers were disposed of , and the medical corps was made equal , if not superior , to any in the world . It had its origin with Mr. Southard . The hospital fund had been much neglected . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left iii the pay ; and in that mode , about one hundred and twenty thousand dollars had been used for other purposes . Mr. Southard devoted great attention to it ; recovered what had been thus taken , required it to be transferred , every three months , to the commissioners , and thus increased it to such an extent , that he purchased hospitalgrounds at New-York , Philadelphia , Norfolk , and Pensacola , for which he paid between thirty and forty thousand dollars , and commenced a hospital at Norfolk , and an asylum at Philadelphia . The intention being to erect , at each place , a hospital , and place an asylum in Philadelphia . These were , for a time , neglected by his successor . Mr. Southard was also engaged , before he left , in preparing to put into operation a system of hospital discipline . The building at Norfolk is admirably located , and fitted for the object . The asylum , at Philadelphia , is the best building , for the object , in the world , and the cheapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His object , in all cases , was to build large and permanent edifices , which would not require alterations and repairs ; and when , in future years , additions should be required , their construction was such as to be extended without altering or affecting that which was already done . Shortly after coming into office , he perceived that a safe , economical , and efficient administration of the department , required that he should not be obliged to rely on others , for his knowledge of the various yards and stations ; but should make personal observations upon them . In May , June , July , and August , he visited them all , except that at Pensacola ; made a minute examination , and formed his own opinions of their character and qualities . This practice has been , to some extent , followed by others . Some very important alterations and additions were made , in consequence of this visit . He also examined the stations on the lakes , at Erie , // Sackett 's Harbor , and Whiteh*ill ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recommended , at the next session of Congress , that the materials and vessels should be removed and sold - except the two large ships , Chippewa and New-Orleans , on the stocks at Sackett 's Harbor - and the stations broken up ; thus creating an annual revenue of about thirtythousand dollars . And during the last session , a law was reported by him , giving up to the owners the ground , which had been occupied for naval purposes , at Sackett 's Harbor . Many of the recommendations , which Mr. Southard made to the executive and to Congress , were not then adopted ; but some of them have recently met more favor . Among those not adopted , was the recommendation to establish a line of packets , to start every fifteen or twenty days , to be composed of schooners in the service , and then the establishment of a passage across the isthmus , connecting some point in the United States with Lima or Valparaiso ; thus giving a communication with our squadron , and with our merchant vessels , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now consumed - a project immensely important to the navy , and to our growing commerce in the Pacific ; but it was defeated , through party motives . Mr. Southard also commenced a system of sending some of our vessels to the islands in the Pacific , and thence , by the Cape of Good-Hope , homexvard . The first vessel- the Vincennes - which made this circumference of the globe , was under his orders . He also urged the establishment of a naval school , and pressed it without ceasing . A bill , for the purpose , passed the Senate , and was lost in the House , by a few votes , in consequence of the accidental absence of a number of friends when the vote was taken . He has again reported a bill for the purpose . He also appointed skilful officers , and provided plans for the future improvements of the navy-yards , which were approved , and by which all additions and other alterations should be made ; thus saving great expense in changes and alterations . These plans are now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , they will form navy and dock-yards , equal to any in the world . The plans for those at Norfolk , Washington , Philadelphia , Charlestown and Portsmouth , were completed . That at New-York , was not entirely finished . It consisted of the present yard at Brooklyn and Governor 's Island ; the transfer of which , from the war to the navy department , had been procured by him . It has since been returned to the war department , and much to the injury of the naval service . It would have afforded an admirable site for dry-docks , and other important objects . T he dry-docks , at Charlestown and Norfolk , were recommended , the appropriations made , and the works commenced , under his auspices . Mr. Southard also recommended *n exploring expedition to the South Seas , and made arrangemeats // of vessels , scientific officers , and instruments , for its execution which were to depend upon the approbation of Congress and competent appropriations . These , however , were not obtained , and the plan was of course defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southard sent his resignation of the office to Mr. Adams , and received a letter from him , written in strong terms of affectionate regard , and of approbation of his official conduct . Mr. Adams , also , in a letter addressed to some of the citizens of Rahway , New-Jersey , expressed his regard for him , in language , which any individual might be gratified to have applied to himself by such a man . His health had been very feeble during the last session of that administration - so feeble , that he was unable to go to his office for some months ; but , sick in his room , he not only attended to all its duties , but , for a short time , performed the duties of Secretary of the Treasury , during an indisposition of Mr. Rush . On several occasions , while he was in the department , he performed the duties of the other departments , in the absence of the other secretaries , or when the offices were vacant . At one time he held an appointment of acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than five months - discharging the duties of both offices ; and , at another time , he also held an acting appointment , as Secretary of War , for two or three months . No man ever devoted himself more diligently to his duties . The friends of Mr. Adams 's administration were in a majority , of four or five , in the New-Jersey Legislature , in the winter of 1828 , 29 ; and they desired to send Mr. Southard to the Senate ; but , by the contrivance of an aspirant for the place , a resolution was passed , declaring him ineligible , because he was not , at the time , an inhabitant of the State - a resolution , for which every Jackson man voted , with a small number of those who were pledged to the individual referred to ; and it was carried by a majority of one or two . The dissatisfaction of his friends , at the passage of this resolution , was so great , that they would not vote for the member of the party , who alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dickerson , who was thus , against all hope , re-elected . A few days afterwards , the election of Attorney-General of the State came on ; and , although he had written to his friends not to permit his name to be used , he was elected to that office , which , however , he concluded to accept , and which he held for four years , until he was chosen Governor of the State . His practice , as a lawyer , was extensive ; but no practice in that State is very profitable . His return to the bar was more successful than is common . After being on the bench five years , and in the Navy Department five years and a half , he was fortunate enough , on both occasions , to find his position at the bar very // favorable , and his practice full , without the usual delay in such cases . He is engaged in almost all the leading cases , and has been fortunate enough to receive higher verdicts in several cases , than were ever before rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chosen Governor , aud very reluctantly accepted it- a sacrifice to the wishes of his friends . He held the office for four or five months , during which time the nullification question was the subject of agitation . He communicated the documents from South Carolina to the Legislature ; and , in a message , which was generally published , conveyed his sense of the doctrines which were then agitated . In the winter session of the Legislature , he was transferred from the government of the State to the Senate of the United States - the Legislature fully supposing , that the times called for him rather in the latter than in the former station . Mr. Soutbard was originally of the democratic party , and took an early and a conspicuous part in the expression of his opinions . With his tongue and pen , lie engaged in the discussions which agitated the country from 1804 to his appointment as Judge , in 1815 ; and since he left the bench , he has always been ranked among the republicans of his native State , unless we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy and republicanism , as peculiarly their own - a claim , which is preeminently ridiculous in New-Jersey , where once-prominent federalists have seized the name of de.mocracy , and turned over to an imaginary federal party the men most prominent , during the war , in the democratic ranks . In addition to the active part Mr. Southard has taken in the political discussions of the day , and his professional career , he has written , on various occasions , many speeches and addresses , which , if collected , would make a volume of no ordinary size . The sketch of his argument , ( but the sketch is quite imperfect ) in the great steamboat controversy , before the Legislature of New-Jersey , in the winter of 1813 , 14 - in which , the right of the State to pass acts countervailing the exclusive privileges granted by New-York to Fulton and Livingston , was discussed - has been published ; and although , in this litigation , he was engaged with Ogden , Hopkinson , and Emmett , yet he won in it distinguished reputation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1811 , has been published , in a pamphlet form ; also , a speech before the Columbian Institute , at Washington , in 1827 ; an address before the Mechanics ' Society , at Newark , New-Jersey , fourth of July , 1830 ; an eulogy on Chief Justice Ewing , delivered at the request of the court and bar of New-Jersey , and of the corporate authorities at Trenton ; an address on the centennial birth-day of Washington , at the request of the corporate authorities of Trenton , and of the Legislature of the State , then in // session ; an address before the Alumni of Princeton College ; atid also , an address , in the hall of the House of Representatives , on the professional character and virtues of William Wirt , at the request of the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States . This last address was delivered before as intelligent and as select an audience as can he assembled in the United States . The venerable Marshall , with the whole Supreme Court , almost all the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representatives , with the taste and beauty from all sections of the Union , that usually crowd the saloons in Washington during the winter , were present , and all were highly gratified with the eloquence and fervor of the speaker . Of the many speeches of Mr. Southard , in Congress and at the bar , we have room to say but little . A report of his argument , before the Court of Appeals of New-Jersey , in the Quaker controversy , has been published . His speeches , also , in the Senate , during the late session of Congress , have appeared in a pamphlet form . His great speech upon the deposite question attracted unusual attention , and has circulated far and wide . Indeed , it is not only powerful in argument , but bold , heroic , and chivalrous , in its thrusts at arbitrary power , and at that violation of the laws , which reduced so many to ruin and heggary . In this eloquent defence of the laws and the Constitution , in this assault upon usurpation , Mr. Southard appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shine . Never fearing the frowns of power , he struck at it with the strength of the Roman soldier , who defended Rome with his single battle-axe ; and wherever he struck , power trembled and quivered at the shock . Enthusiastically attached to liberty , and gifted with an ardent temperament , he was admirably fitted for such a combat as that in which the Senate was involved . ID enunciation but awakened his eloquence . Abuse only stimulated his industry . Threats but aroused and invigorated all that was manly and heroic in him ; and his high moral courage , thus enkindled , often rolled forth thunders of rebuke , that not only muttered around the cars , but shook the powers behind the throne . ' During the last winter , but few men were more abused than Mr. Southard . True , Webster was violently attacked ; Clay , as usual , was assailed ; Calhoun was not spared ; but , upon Southard 's devoted head , the weight of that power , unknown to the Constitution , but known and fearfully felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true , the fulminator of this wrath , he who presides over the orgies of the kitchen-cabinet , was stimulated to this attack by an exposure , which Mr. Southard made , of his perfidy , at the trial of Watkins , when called as a xvitness in that case . But , all this wrath was but noise-mere noise  --  the sound of the thunder , but // without the bolt or the flash ; and certain it is , that it fell pow* erless upon the man against whom it was directed . Mr. Southard has not only received many political honors from his countrymen , but science and literature have awarded him their gifts ; and of them , to the extent of his ability , he has been a friend , and a patronizer . For fifteen years past , he has been an active trustee of the college of New-Jersey , in which he graduated . For some years , he has been a member of the American Philosophical Society ; and of the Society of National Statistics of France . He is also an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . In 1830 , he received the degree of L. L. D. from the University of Pennsylvania . The reader , who but glances over this , but a sketch of the life of Mr. Southard , must see that it has been a life of activity , full of no common incidents - instructive and interesting , too , to every young American , who traces it out , from the early beginflings of the schoolmaster , in all the various mutations , which the lawyer and statesman went through . It is hardly necessary to add , that the man who has been in so many posts , with honor to himself and profit to his country , must be a man of undaunted perseverance , of pure and elevated ambition , animated by the high and patriotic impulses which never forget one 's duty to his felloxv-rnen , or that fame which follows and abides by actions truly great and good . Mr. Southard has aimed high , and reached high ; and on that pinnacle of elevation he stands , guilty of no mean action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of honor his State could give him , he has run . Offices have been fled from , rather than solicited . They clustered , as it were , upon him ; and there they ripened into glorious fruit . Enemies he undoubtedly has - and who has not , that ever lets loose the tongue , in the unbridled independence of a freeman ? That warmth of feeling , which defies power , and thus terrifying it , makes it his enemy , also makes friends . In debate , Mr. Southard uses no doubtful words . If an act is niean , mean is the word used to designate its character . If a charge is false , false it is pronounced to be . And yet , he is ever kind and courteous towards associates in debate . Whatever he says , comes from the heart , and , therefore , with all the life and soul of a sentiment springing directly from the heart . An energetic , ardent manner , may often give it more force than , of itself , it really claims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled along in impetuous strains , awaken and often startle . These are , perhaps , the exaggerations of eloquence ; but such exaggerations as ever make the eloquent man . When Mr. Southard speaks , he is all alive . If excited , if flushed , if assailed , he bursts forth , in fearless language . The best of words are at his command , and them he // uses with the best effect . An audience catches his enthusiasm . The crowd go away , instructed and warmed , not so much by the sudden flash , which glitters but to darken darkness yet the more , but by one broad blaze , one continuous light , ever burning and ever streaming over all around it . Others may now and then launch heavier bolts . The lightning of some man 's wrath may blast a victim with a deadlier blow ; but his is a constant peal - a loud* long voice of eloquence , as of the cloud , charged to the full with electric matter , that breaks and flashes on every side .

His eye is keen and penetrating , and , when excited , commanding . In social intercourse , he is one of the most agreeable men in the world , ever accessible , always polite - with a fund of information , and an abundance of good humor , which ever make his company desirable . No extra dignity , no encumbering pomp , no parade and show , distinguish him ; but , there is a simplicity of manner , and freedom from ostentation , which , almost always , mark the strong mind , and the strong man . No Sec. - retary of the Navy has been more popular , we had almost said so popular . The officers of the navy , almost to a man , will bear witness to the liberality , kindness , and yet economy , with which he presided over that department .
