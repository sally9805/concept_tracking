txt SOUTH-CAROLINA . NO . II . HAD I anticipated a second number , I would have so ordered the first , that one theme might follow another in some natural order ; but as it is , I may as well go on . The fault , if there be any , is yours , not mine . You required three pages and a half : , and no more  --  but I will not submit to your bed of Procrustes-I have more to say " T was for your pleasure then I wrote ,  - -  You now must print for mine , " There are , between Charleston and the Savannah river , ranges of islands , as rich as any in the world . Before the cultivation of cotton in Carolina , many of them were the haunts of alligators , overgrown with woods and rank weeds ; but they now are cultivated by a polished and intelligent people , and when a traveler passes them swiftly in the steamboat , they seem to him like the blessed islands in Mirza 's vision . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one . Not far from Beaufort , you will discover before you a settlement that looks , at a distance , like a thriving New-England village ; so much so that you might think yourself at home , without wishing to be there . At the landing is a thick cluster of palmettoes , so close that their tops are interwoven and resemble a dilapidated entablature , while the tall straight trunks look like the pillars of a temple . The palmetto will increase your sense of the beautiful , and its graceful figure is well chosen , as an emblem in the arms of the state . Beyond this is a line of orange trees , bending under fruit worthy of the Hesperides . The ground is covered with oranges , and I have seen on the trees clusters of eight , all of the largest size . Next you will see what magnificent trees may spring from an inconsiderable acorn , in a couple of live oaks , the emblems of strength and immortality . There is majesty in an old oak . His trunk is of twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great distance , and seem to wave with an air of gentleness and protection . But like the Persian 's , his noblest characteristic is his beard , " a sable silvered. " 43 // Men call it moss , and you may see sprouts of the same in a maple swamp in New-England , but not so long as a dandy 's moustache . But in the live oak it descends below the girdle , it almost sweeps the ground , and hangs from the upper branches . The effect of it upon a tree is precisely that of a long beard upon a man , giving it a grave and solemn appearance . A tree , " an ' please your honor , has a soul " At least I could never be hard enough to wound one like this with an axe . I should almost expect to see the blood flow , and to hear like A*neas-Quid miserurn laceras ? The laurel is well seen near the oak-it is the union of beauty and strength ; it is the very tree into which Apollo might well transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets and heroes . The trunk is round and smooth ; the tree is lofty ; the leaves are five or six inches long , and of a deep and glossy green , to which northern woods afford no parallel . The whole tree is studded with blossoms as thickly as the sky is spangled with stars . The blossoms are of a delicate white , of the lily shape , and of the circumference of twelve inches . Solomon never had such a robe as nature has thrown over the laurel . Let us walk up to the planter 's gate , through an avenue of the aloe , and we shall be welcomed by the barking of some twenty dogshounds , setters , spaniels , terriers , mongrels , and " curs of low degree . " The house has two wings , and in the rear , at the distance of eight rods , are the kitchen and store-houses . On the plantation the sportsman will find abundance and variety of game . On a long sea-beach , like a sanded floor , and extending for miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large kind of a wood-cock , ( in appearance , at least , ) and it is little less in size than a domestic fowl . Many may be killed at a shot , and , when any are sl*sin , the survivers settle round it , and expose themselves again . The coves and creeks have geese , and many kinds of ducks . In the woods , the deer , before he bounds away , will sometimes stop a moment to look at the hunter . The deer is sometimes hunted at night , with a torch , and , when startled , stands to gaze , while his luminous eyes betray him , and he is shot in the forehead . Men have sometimes been killed in this sport , as in all others . It is said , that the eyes of a colt have an appearance like those of a deer , and the sportsman , therefore , sometimes strikes a coarser meat than venison . There is a large spider , and his eyes emit a pale bright ray like that of a diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moccasin snake lies listless in the rice fields on the surface of the water , and will not bite the naked leg that presses against him , though by day I would not cheerfully set foot near any of his tribe . Raccoons and opossums are vermin too ignoble for the gun , and are hunted with clubs and curs . When the tide is rising , many raccoons , may be seen slowly returning from the marshes . They have been after shell-fish , and it is an opinion that fire can not burn out of the negroes , that the taccoons catch crabs with their tails . The raccoon places himself on the bank and moves his tail with a gentle motion on the water . The crab seizes it for a moment , and by a sudden jerk is thrown upon the bank . But the oyster sometimes catches the raccoon ; the quadruped , finding the shell invitingly open , thrusts in his // paw ; but he sometimes ventures upon an oyster so large and so firmly embedded , that it closes the shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be drowned by the tide . The smaller oysters , that are left bare by the tide , are called raccoon oysters ; they stand upright , are five inches long and closely wedged together . The upper part comes to an edge , the nature of which I shall long remember ; they are more perilous to pass than the broken junk-bottles that are set upon the garden walls at Charleston . I was once landing on a beach from a boat , which moved suddenly backward from my step , and left me falling on the oysters . In moments of extremity , many thoughts pass through the mind in brief time ; and , although I am a heavy body , I yet found time in falling to devise the best means of alighting , where all were bad . After weighing the disadvantages of falling on the knees or shoulder , ( and the latter position would hardly have saved my face , ) I made a sudden effort , and came upon the right arm and hand . The boatmen gave a general groan ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with my sleeves cut into shreds , and in my palm as many deep cross-cuts , ( disclosing bone and sinew , ) as there are seams in the back of an armadillo . It was six weeks before I could free the wound from all the broken fragments of shells . The sport , that has pleased me most in Carolina , is digging out an old alligator from his hole ; he is so touchy , that it is pleasant to put him in a passion . He burrows in the ground like a wood-chuck , and the first operation of the siege is to prevent a sally , by driving stakes at the entrance of his hole . The next movement is to dig down upon him at some fifteen feet from the stakes , and he is commonly found two or three feet beneath the surface . He takes very quietly a few punches with a pole , thinking to pass himself off for a pine log ; but a touch or two with the corner of the spade brings his head to the aperture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tries to crawl forth , and when . his forepaws are on the surface , and while he is striving to draw himself out , is the time to cleave his hard head with an axe . If he should get unharmed upon the green sward , it is unsafe to await his charge , and it is a great misfortune to be lame . I had rather be a cripple at a dance ; for the alligator 's mouth is about a fifth of his length , and his teeth are like spikes . When the monster is dead , the negroes shout and caper with extravagant joy . The blacks are never better pleased than when they are hunting in the woods ; and it is seldom that they have not in larder the flesh of a raccoon or opossum . The allowance of food to an adult is a peck of corn weekly ; and , to children , half as much . This fare is sometimes varied with a larger quantity of rice and yams . This is not sumptuous living ; but the slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can often purchase delicacies ; and I believe , that one , very prudent , might , in twelve years , collect enough to pur. chase his freedom . They are often in condition to sell the corn that is dealt out to them , having various means of providing for their own tables . The rivers and tide creeks are stored with fish , and among the islands oysters may be had in any quantity . Besides , on a plantation there are often five hundred neat cattle ranging the woods , and swine innumerable . Slavery seldom fortifies honesty ; and , besides , // the slave may fancy that it is just to make reprisals on his master 's property for violence done to his own person ; it often happens , then , that there is more flesh in the house of a negro than he would willingly exhibit to the overseer . The supply of game and fish , however , is so abundant , that a runaway negro often lives in the woods for months upon them , though , to vary his fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fugitive may live in this way for months and years , but it is difficult for him to leave the country ; he can not pass in the road without a written license , which every white he meets would require of him , and those of his own condition are as ready to arrest him . Perhaps there is much in the climate of South-Carolina that you think desirable . There is  --  but be contented with your own lot , and stay at home . Nature has bestowed some blessings , but the most precious she has withheld . The low country is so level that the rivers hardly flow ; there is not a hill high enough to hide a horseman with a tall plume , and you may go over the best land and call it barren . There are few grasses , and none are cut . Of trees , the most common are pines , which either grow in a poor soil or impoverish a rich one . The orange and pomegranate are delicious fruits , but they are the product of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . The evaporation from the stagnant or sluggish waters poisons the vital air . The insects that , single , are insignificant , have yet , when they come in swarms , powers of intolerable annoyance . The night is no season for rest ; they must be kept at bay by nets , that break the freshening breeze which should fan the feverish limbs . The planter walks forth in the morning unrefreshed , yet he must heed his steps , for the poisonous reptiles lie in his path  --  the shark watches for him when he laves his burning body in the surf , and the alligator pulls him down in the rivers . For nearly half the year he can not visit his own plantation-he may , indeed , go there in winter and spring , but it is not always to find his garners full ; when the seed is in the earth he must quit his fieldsNos patrisi fines , et dulcia linquimus arva . He must be absent at the most critical stage of vegetation , when his own care might double his harvests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the charge of an irresponsible hireling , and , if he come back before the frosts , it is like the return of the banished Foscari , on pain of death . Thus he becomes an absentee . There is , indeed , a magic circle at Charleston , which the malaria seldom invades , though he presses closely upon it ; it is of small diameter , and all beyond is the dominion of that pale monarch , " to whose complexion we must come at last . " If the planter 's patriotism be so rigid that he will pass his summers in Charleston , it is at a greivous sacrifice of comfort and liberty . It is unsafe for him to be abroad when the sun shines or the dew falls ; his house is , therefore , not only his castle , but his prison . Behold him then in New-England , where he disburses liberally the remnant of the splendid income , that rains , droughts , storms and tariffs have left him . Our arts , stages , steam-boats , hotels , and shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who know him esteem his frankness , his social qualities , and his high feelings . The individual // is honored , but the class is contemned , and we are too prone to act as though a difference in political opinions should , of right , subject a class to the loss of all human sympathy or civil usage . Sarcasm , irony , and invective do not always fall harmless to the earth , and they may do something to relax the bonds with which the South is connected with the North ; perhaps they have already had much influence in abating cordiality of feeling . A Carolinian , like a Jew , has some feeling ; if you prick him , he will bleed ; although if you tickle him he will laugh , and roundly too . Good and intelligent men have opposite opinions on the expediency of the tariff , and all should dispassionately consider whether it may not produce as much evil as advantage . In Boston itself : , there is a body opposed to the tariff , respectable in wealth , numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be counted by states . There is probably no state in the Union that would cease to remonstrate against measures that she might think would bring on her a slow , but sure decline ; and Massachusetts was not supine when , in the last war , her own interests were so much depressed . Sufferance often becomes a precedent , and the very patience of the injured may be quoted against him as an admission of consent . In Carolina , it is held ,  --  and whether right or wrong , I believe with perfect sincerity ,  --  as much a duty to oppose the tariff : , as it was to resist the stamp act . The people believe that they are not only opposing an unconstitutional law , but that they are acting also for self-defence , which is above all conventional provisions , which is inalienable and indefeasible , and can not be surrendered even by consent . Now , as revolutions never go back , " it should be our care that they may never commence . Is it unprecedented , that , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of policy , which they believe enriches another section and impoverishes their own , they should in the end consult what they hold to be their interest , and do as little for the Union , as they believe that the Union is doing for them ? I am speaking not from my wishes , but my fears  --  and God forbid that our Union should be endangered . It is the last hope of freedom . Its dissolution , or any civil disturbances in the country , will add nerve to- the strong and evil arm that is , in Europe , uplifted against the free , and that has , perhaps , even now , crushed the most noble , gallant and injured people that ever strove to resist it . If we fail , it must then be conceded , even by those who are under the rule of fearful masters , that , as reason and justice can not govern mankind , they must continue now and forever under the stronger dominion of force . G. M.@@183067960.txt FROM THE MSS . OF A TRAVELER IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrill voice of a soldier on the watch ; our reveillee was the ringing of his pistols , at which sound each man sprang to his feet , and busied himself in getting open his eyes , tighten* ing his sash , and examining his priming ; and , in five minutes , the beasts having been loaded , we all , with our pipes in our mouths , made for the olive tree , under which our leader was sitting on his mat , smoking , and waiting for the assembling of a council of war . He had been unable to come to any conclusion the evening before with his confidential soldier , about the route , and the whole band was summoned to give their opinions and settle the business . They gathered around to the number of fifty , and , sitting down on the ground in circles , in the centre of which was the captain , his pipe ever in his mouth , and his string of beads in his hand , they began a noisy , chattering and disputatious conference ,  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great majority deciding that it was better to neglect the common precautions , and strike across the plain to // 385 Navarino , rather than follow the less dangerous , but more circuitous route of the mountains , the captain decided with them , and we all moved off instanter , except three soldiers , who determined to have their own way ; so we left them . The march was disturbed by no uncommon event , except that we hurried more than usual , and often caught ourselves looking anxiously about us , lest we should be surprised on the open plain by the Turkish cavalry , twenty of whom would have been more than a match for us , and would , probably , have carried off our heads at their saddlebows . But we arrived without accident at a small open village , in the centre of the plain , which had been entirely deserted by its inhabitants , but where we found that several captains , with their bands , had rendezvuused , making our number more than three hundred men . We had eaten our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are both delicious and nutritive , when fully ripe ; after which , we were treated to a cup of the true mocha , by a captain of our acquaintance , and in a short time the whole camp was wrapped in stillness , like that of midnight ; all were taking their siesta , or afternoon nap , and I lay listlessly with my pipe , watching the fantastic figures assumed by the smoke , as it rose in the still , sultry air of noonday . Suddenly , methought , I heard a low , rumbling sound like the roaring of a distant beach ; it continued-I could not be mistaken , and I gently , with my foot , pushed Francesco , who lay asleep near me ; he started up , and as soon as I directed his attention to the noise , he applied his ear to the earth for a minute , then sprang up with a look of alarm , and ran toward the outside of the village , and in a moment more I heard his shrill cry of " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry are upon us ; " and , quick as light , every man was upon his feet , and without thinking of defence , ran to gratify curiosity and see the danger . At first , we gazed without saying a word , at a wide-spreading cloud of dust , which , advancing , seemed to extend itself in every direction , until it became distinct , and we could see the flash and glimmer of arms ; then all was bustle and confusion in our camp ; the captain cursed , and gave orders in the same breath ,  --  the men ran to and fro , regarding neither one nor the other , and all busied themselves , as by instinct , in preparations for defence . The mules and baggage , with the provisions and extra ammunition , were driven into a stone church , which all seemed to consider as a strong hold , and place of refuge , in case the outworks should be carried ; some rolled empty barrels and huge earthen oil-jars , to the ends of the streets , where they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block up the streets ; while others went furiously to digging a ditch , in which they could lie down , and be sheltered by the few feet of earth which they flung up before them ; and others punched holes through the outer walls of the cottages facing the plain , from which they could put out their muskets and fire in security . All were busied in preparing for defence ; but defence with the least possible exposure ; all but W. ; his spirits seemed to rise , and his eyes to flash fire , as he stood impatient on a bank , with his hand on the trigger of his cocked gun , the muzzle resting on his left arm , his body bent forward , and watch-49 // ing the coming host . I stood beside him , and though I mastered my feelings and showed the same front and bearing that he did , I think it was not the same within . I glanced at the space between our station and the mountains-there was no hope of escape there ; I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant at a stand . I saw the plungings and curvetings of the impatient steeds , the glitter of their trappings , the flowing , gilded dresses of the riders , the flashing of their scimitars , and , I could distinguish , dashing here and there , among the mass , the high-cap of the furious Delhi ; and , as I thought of the feeble barrier on which I stood , and over which they could dash their steeds at a single leap , I half shuddered , and my thoughts flew back to home , to my mother , and to the nursery ; I felt all that man must feel when first in danger , but which we are too cowardly to betray by looks or words . But there was no time for thought ; there was a sudden movement of the foe  --  the horses dashed forward toward us at a gallop , the riders waved their scimitars , and raised a tremendous yell of " Hu ! Hu Hu ! Allah ! Ha ! " - when I felt myself pulled into the ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for the purpose , I lay and waited till they should be within shot . There was a deadly , breathless silence among us ; there were moving of lips in prayer , but no sound ; there was making of sudden crosses , but no eye ceased to glance along the gun-barrel towards the foe , who , advancing , like lightning , now began to raise their carbines . I saw them bend their bodies , and try to crouch behind their horses ' necks ; I saw the very glare of their eyes ,  --  when , in an instant , a flash of fire ran along their line-their balls whizzed over our heads-our muskets instantly rattled in reply ; the smoke arose , and , after that , I saw nothing , and thought of nothing , bat to load and fire ; and fire we did so fast and furiously into the cloud of smoke , out of which flashed the enemy 's guns , and where they seemed to be a moment checked ; but as the smoke arose I saw a troop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fire their pistols , receive our shots , wheel , and away ; and , when the smoke again cleared up , they were half a mile distant . Then there was shouting , and congratulation , and exultation , in our hitherto breathless band ; W. leaped over the barrier , and , yatagan in hand , would have advanced  --  but no one followed the fool-hardy boy . In a few minutes more the enemy were moving off at a full trot , and we saw no more of them . Half a dozen slight wounds was all the damage we received , and the carcasses of a few horses were all the proof we had of the loss of the enemy ; but the rich saddles of two of them were soaking with yet warm blood ; and as we knew the Turks always carry off their dead , if possible , our leaders did not fail to report fifty slain Moslems , be*. sides a great number of wounded ; and , I doubt not , our skirmish will flourish in the journals of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we left our dangerous position , and a hard night 's march brought us to the main body , where we were more 8ecUre . But W. soon tired even of that ; his restless spirit needed more excitement , and the company of some reckless spirits , whom he had unfortunately met with , and who pressed him to join them in Western Greece , where they had , as they said , hard fighting , indeed , but beauty and was8ail to recompense them . I trembled as he left me , fin I ktiew he was the // darling of an aged mother , and the hope of a proud family I knew he was high-minded and generous ; but goaded , as he was , by ambition , and credulous , and inexperienced , he might become the victim of his own passions , or of the villany of others . * * * * * * * * Months rolled away , and nothing from W. I heard , indeed , strange tales of the proceedings of some Europeans , in Western Greece ; men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassination ; but the East abounds with such tales , and I noticed them not . One evening , at Hydra , I was sitting gazing on the rich sunset , and for the want of any one with whom to exchange the tones of my native tongue , and in the absence of books , I was repeating the oft-repeated lines of our beloved bard " On Old Eginas rock and Hydra 's isle The god of gladness casts his parting smile O'er his own regions lingering loves to shine , Though there his altars are no more divine . Descending fast , the mountain shadows kiss Thy glorious gulf , unconquered Salamis ! Their azure arches , through the long expanse ; More deeply purpled meet his mellowing g lance , And tenderest tints , along their summits driven , Mark his gay course , and own the hues of heaven ; Till , darkly shaded from the land and deep , Behind his Delphian cliff he sinks to sleep . " Here my attention was attracted by the singular appearance of a young man , who was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his once magnificently embroidered dress presented a strange contrast of rags and riches , of splendor and dirt ; he was without arms , though his silver cartridge-boxes and pistol.belt shewed him to have been a soldier . As he drew near , I saw that he was sallow and emaciated , and was surprised to find him turning in at our gate ; I met him at the door , against which he supported himself with one hand , while he , hesitatingly , held out the other to me , and fixed upon me his ghastly sunken eyes . I took his hand , doubtfully , when he exclaimed in a hollow voice- " Do you not know me ? " It was W .. ; but so changed so different from the fiery , yet blooming youth , I had seen a few months before , that I could scarce believe my eyes . We got him food , and tried to cheer him , and find out his disorder ; but he was sad and reserved ; or , if he roused himself , and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh of the distracted . I suspected his mind was affected , and we got him to retire , having made up the best bed we could , with some rags , on the floor of an adjoining room . At midnight , I was awakened from a sound sleep , by the most dreadful screams from the room of W. I seized a pistol in one hand , and a sword in the other , and dashing open his door with a blow of my foot , found him rolling on the floor , apparently weltering in his blood , and groaning out in a dreadful voice- " I am stabbed , and murderedI am dying ! " " Who has stabbed you ? " cried I , looking eagerly around the room , " there is no one here . " " There , there , " cried he , clinging around my legs , and pointing to a dark corner of the room , " there he is-there , " and threw himself back with a groan . I advanced slowly and cautiously toward the corner , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . I almost fancied I could see the glare of a pair of eyes ; I expected the instant flash of a pistol ; there was certainly a dark figure ; I thrust quickly at it  --  and hit  --  the bare wall ! Not a souj was to be found ; and then the truth flashed upon me . W. had been dreaming-his conscience had conjured up a spectre . I passed my hand over his body before a light could be brought , and persuaded him he was neither dying , nor even wounded . But it was long before he ceased to tremble , and to be agitated ; and , when I attempted to go out of the room with the light , he shrieked aloud , and begged , for God 's sake , I would not leave him in the dark . There were horrible workings of his yet unseared conscience , and before morning the unhappy youth disclosed to us the plot , which , aided by his own folly , and pride and ambition , had made him a wretch , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bore every impress of truth , which subsequent events have proved to be in the main correct , and which is yet so strange , and so horrible , as to seem to belong rather to the province of romance than of history.
