txt THE rules of Architecture are probably violated more frequently , in practice , than those of the other fine arts and in no civilized country are they less regarded , than in the United States . In this art we may fairly claim originality . There may be no American literature , painting , sculpture ; but there certainly is American architecture . We have columns , which mock at the narrow limits of the Grecian orders ; domes , whose proportions are more stupendous , if not more vast , than the marvel of Angelo ; ornaments , which it would baffle the genius of Palladio to class and " shingle palaces " that rival pandemonium itself , rising like an exhalation , ' ' " Built like a temple , where pilasters round Are set , and Doric pillars overlaid . " Thus far the art , with us , is in a very chaotic state , however . There are certain causes existing here to oppose its progress , which have not been found in other countries , and which must always exert a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still there is room for great improvement ; and we propose in this article to speak of some of our principal edifices public and private , as specimens of art , and to offer some hints with regard to the forms which architecture would naturally assume in our country . We shall express our oj ) inions with frankness , as in no other way could we contribute any thing towards an object , which appears to us of great public importance ; and we do this with the less scruple , as , in the cases where we are compelled to find most fault , we are wholly ignorant whose are the works , on which we are animadverting . Regular architecture has appeared under two general forms ; the Grecian , including the round arch and the dome , and the Gothic or pointed-arch style . Each of these forms owes its origin and perfection to a deep and enthusiastic sentiment , which pervaded society , and constituted the spirit of the age . Classic religion gave birth to Grecian architecture ; the spirit of the Crusades called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that the spirit of the age was the origin of American architecture in its genuine form . The settlement of New England was the result of a deep sentiment , with which the hearts of our Pilgrim fathers were filled , the stern spirit of Puritanism . This displayed itself in every possible form , hut in none more strikingly than in the architecture . Houses of worship , which they disdained to all Churches , and which still hear universally the name of Meeting-houses , were erected almost before the first rude dwellings were completed ; and the style of architecture , if indeed it deserves the appellation , arrived at its perfection in less than a century after the first settlement of the country . The simplest form of the meeting-house is much like that of a large barn with gahle ends . There are doors on three sides , each one having a small porch or square toxver rising as high as the eaves of the building , to contain a flight of stairs conducting to the gallery . No cornice , no ornament of any sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extremities of the building is broken by the unaccountable number of windows , with which our ancestors saw fit to adorn the sacred edifice . We speak within bounds , when we say , that the number of windows in an old-fashioned meetinghouse of seventy feet by fifty , is never less than forty . // Around three sides of the interior runs a gallery , supported upon columns of an unknown order . The ceiling is plastered ; but the huge rafters , which project from the walls about six feet below the eaves , and help to support the roof , are not concealed . On the fourth side , and directly opposite the middle of the long gallery , stands the pulpit , upon which the whole magnificence of architecture , that the age could hoast of , was lavished . rrhe fluted pilasters with their wondrous capitals ; the heavy balustrade of the staircase ; the graceful elevation of the desk ; the superb how window , in whose presence the other lesser lights seem to withdraw , and hide their diminished forms ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , heavy with mouldings , and rising in the centre into a boss most marvellously sculptured ; all these formed an assemblage of magnificent objects , which seemed to mock at the Puritanical simplicity of the remaining parts of the edifice . If the ambition of the builders was lofty enough for a steeple , one of the gable porches was made to rise considerably above the ridge-pole . Upon this was erected the belfry , a structure which strongly resembles the top of an urn standing upon six or eight legs . From the belfry a slender spire shoots up , terminated with a gilt vane . There was , however , another form of the steepled meetinghouse , which we believe is of earlier date than the one last described . This sort of edifice , of which very few now remain , is square ; the four sides of the roof meet in a point over the centre of the building , and from this point springs the steeple , consisting of a belfry and spire . We must not forget one remarkable contrivance in our early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made with hinges , so that in prayer-time they might be raised up , and allow the occupants to lean against the back of the pew ; at the close of the prayer they were slammed down with a noise like the broad-side of a frigate , and served as a warning to all the backsliders in the village , who were remiss in their attendance at meeting . Such were the early houses of worship in our land . But few of them remain , and these are rapidly disappearing before the spirit of improvement . Yet we should be sorry to lose all traces of them ; for not even the Gothic mmster , with all its splendors , - the tall windows of stained // glass , the lofty arches and vaults , crowded with prophets , martyrs , and saints , the canopied tombs where repose in solemn marble the mailed knights and the mitred abbots , the carved stalls of the choir , where kings are proud to have their seats , - is more characteristic of the spirit of the crusades , than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This spirit is still a strong element in the New England character , but it is much modified and softened . Commerce and politics have now become as much the objects of thought with us as religion , which so exclusively occupied our forefathers ; and our commercial and political edifices rival our churches in size and cost . Every capital of the Union has its State-house , which makes some pretension at least to architectural elegance . Every commercial city , and every town of two or three thousand inhabitants , has one or more banking-houses , which are generally as much decorated as the resources of the company will allow . Meantime , the Grecian and Gothic styles , neither of which is discoverable in the earlier architecture of the country , are beginning to appear in every village . The most costly , and undoubtedly the noblest edifice in the United States , is the Capitol at Washington . There is one great fault in its construction , which is not , however , to be attrihuted to the artist who designed the building . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and out of place . By the original design it had the same curve as the domes over the wings , which are low and very elegant . The plan was partially changed for the centre dome , and it now rises with a high and very ugly curve , from a base not half large enough to support it . The Capitol is built of a stone commonly called Potomac freestone , of a rich brown color . A more beautiful material we have never seen ; but unfortunately the parts which were completed , when Washington was taken in the late war , were so begrimed with smoke from the burning of the edifice , that it was found necessary upon repairing and completing it , to paint the whole ; so that , at a short distance , one would suppose it to be constructed of white marble . The interior is simple and elegant . The Rotunda , which is under the large dome , is probably the finest room in America . It would , undoubtedly , add greatly to its beauty , // as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall of Representatives , if the ceilings xv ere painted in fresco . But this kind of decoration has not yet come into use amongst us . Philadelphia abounds more in good architecture than any city of the Union , notwithstanding that the tall column in Baltimore , and the little trophy of marble near Barnum 's hotel , have gained for the latter the proud name of the Monumental City . The United States Bank , the Mint , and the Exchange are the finest specimens of architecture which Philadelphia contains . The very material of which they are composed , white marble , gives them an imposing appearaace , and the style of architecture is suited to the material . The Bank is undoubtedly the most faultless monument of its size in the United States . It is of the purest Doric , classic in its proportions , and severely chaste and simple . Indeed , considering the place in which it stands , in the midst of a populous city and in close neighbourhood to other buildings , a higher degree of ornament would not have been amiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bas-reliefs , a good effect would have been produced . It is much to be regretted , that an edifice of so much architectural merit should be so badly placed . It stands in a small area , hemmed in by buildings on every side , so that it is impossible to obtain a distinct view of the whole . Now the very nature of the Doric order requires that it should be exhibited in an open or commanding situation . The idea which it is intended to convey , is that of duration . The massive columns , the vast blocks which rest upon them , and more than all , the heavy proportions of the Doric , seem to bid defiance to the elements and to time itself . Could the very foundations of the earth assume a harmonious form and rear themselves into symmetry , it seems as if they must create this order , which , more than any other , combines strength and durability with beauty of proportion . Hence Doric monuments should always stand in open and exposed places , and not seem to court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave the elements , and invite the storm . The air should circulate freely around , and the clear open sky should alone encompass them . The Greeks acted upon this principle , when they built the Parthenon on the Acropolis , and the far-kimed Hesperian temples on the plain of Pa*stum . One may easily imagine // how much the effect produced by the Bank in Philadelphia xvould be heightened , if it had been erected on the summit of Fair Mount , instead of the confined spot in which it stands . " The President , Directors , and Company " probably would not thank us for this suggestion ; but we remind them that we are speaking only in an architectural sense . In speaking of the United States Bank , we can not avoid noticing the peculiar aptness of the Grecian architecture for banking-houses . The simplicity of the form , so well adapted to strength and durahility ; the plain walls , with the heavy entablature , not requiring the relief of xvindows ; the broad steps which invite the crowd ; the lofty porticoes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , form a befitting temple for the worship of the blind goddess . And this style of building has been found to answer the purpose so well , that it prevails throughout the country , wherever an edifice is erected expressly for a banking-house . The architecture of New-York is truly meagre ; but , after being at a stand for many years , is at last in a fair way to be improved . The Custom-House , judging from the plans , will be a superb edifice . It is to be of one of the higher Grecian orders , with fluted columns and a pediment at each extremity ; the whole of white marble . The City Hall has hitherto been the most remarkable building in the city . It abounds in small ornaments , and , being of white marble , which contrasts pleasingly with the green trees of the Park , makes a pretty appearance ; but as a whole it is very deficient in character , and fails to produce the effect which should be expected from its size and cost . The new building for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some striking merits ; and , though far from perfect , is still very interesting as the first remarkable specimen of a style , which has been but lately introduced into this country . Thus far the Gothic order , where it has appeared in the United States , has been almost exclusively appropriated to churches . Wherever it has been found necessary to erect large secular edifices , they have either been entirely destitute of ornament , and belonging to no order of architecture , or slightly adorned with Grecian cornices and pilasters . Instances of this architecture appear all over the country ; but we // do not recollect any that are more illustrative of what we mean , than most of the College buildings at Cambridge , New England . We would cite these as very perfect specimens of no known order of architecture ; vast brick barns , destitute alike of symmetry , ornament , and taste ; and with all their plain and uncouth proportions , there is a sort of horrible regularity and squareness about them , which heightens their deformity . Four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture , and , making no pretensions , perhaps hardly deserve to be noticed . But what shall we say of the stone edifice , which insults us with its long piazza , and its wooden Ionic pilasters , and the entablature which extends part way across the front ? The proportions of this wonderful building are about one hundred feet by forty or fifty ; at the ends , it is three stories high , with basement rooms the sides are partly two stories and partly three stories high , the great expanse of wall being somewhat relieved by the pilasters and entablature . The chef-d'ceuvre of the whole building , however , is the piazza or portico , which runs along part of the western side or front . It is approached by a lofty flight of stone steps guarded by an iron balustrade ; nine columns , from twelve to fifteen feet high , each of a single block of granite , and surmounted by a Tuscan capital of soap-stone , are ranged along the front of the piazza , and support a flat roof eight inches thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a breath of wind would blow it away . We doubt whether the world contains any other architectural abortion , to be compared to this . The Gothic style , admirably relieves architects from the embarrassment of combining size , convenience , and elegance , in buildings intended for civil or domestic purposes . The various towers , oriel windows , and battlements , and the pointed arches , obviate the disagreeable effect which a large and unbroken expanse of wall produces , and are increased in grandeur the more the proportions of the building are magnified . The new University at New York is on this account vastly handsomer than any college building which we have seen , in the United States . This style of architecture might , with excellent effect , be employed for any edifice , which is to be large , and at the same time to contain a number of different rooms varying in size . We have always thought it peculiarly appropriate to the Court-houses // in our large cities , which , besides the large halls for the sessions of the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other purposes . A proof of the conven*nce of this style is , that it has been selected in the construction of several of the larger prisons , as the one at Auburn , N. Y. , and others . In these buildings , however , the beauty of the Gothic can not be entirely displayed , as the windows must necessarily be small and narrow , and the florid ornaments would not be appropriate . We are happy to learn that the edifice , which is about to be erected for the library at Cambridge , is to be of the Gothic order . Coming northward from New York , we can not help noticing the State-House at New-Haven ; a chaste Grecian building of the temple form , surrounded by a colonnade , and forming a remarkable contrast to the uncouth buildings of the college . But let us proceed to Boston , " the Athens of America . " Athens it may be ; but the days of Pericles have not yet come , if we may judge from the architecture of the city , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen upon approaching Boston , is the State-House . The situation is truly noble , being the most elevated in the city , and rendering the dome a conspicuous object for many miles both by land and sea . The architect of the State-House deserves great praise for his general plan . The idea was extremely good , to place on a high elevation a building of such a description , that its proportions might be at the same time lofty and grand , and which was to he surmounted by a dome . The effect of this is very striking . The dome rises above every other object , crowning the city , and seeming to give a unity and decided character to the whole . We doubt whether any other plan could have produced so good an effect at a distance , as the dome depends less , for the impression it makes , upon the detail of ornament , than any other form of building . The general idea of the architect was excellent ; but the execution , though not a failure , is on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so short as to appear mean , and render the whole too small for the dome which surmounts it . This fault , however , we believe is not to be attributed to the architect . The original plan made the wings more extensive ; but they were clipped by our legislature , who could not afford to buy so much architecture* // The fafade is certainly handsome , but would be much improved , if the columns in the Corinthian portico were single throughout , instead of being doubled at the extremities . The great fault , however , is the dome , which is very heavy . The circular tower or foundation , upon which it rests , should have been carried up much higher and surrounded by a Corinthian colonnade . The same architect who planned the State-House , designed many years afterwards a much smaller dome for the Church in Lancaster , Massachusetts , the proportions of which are almost faultless . The church itself is beneath criticism ; but the cupola which surmounts the tower , consisting of a circular Ionic colonnade with open arches between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , is hardly equalled for beauty in our country . Could the same happy idea have occurred to the artist while planning the State-House , we might now have made our boast of Boston architecture . - The next remarkable edifice is the Massachusetts General Hospital , some parts of which are fine . The Ionic portico in front , taken alone , is dignified and imposing ; but the angle of the pediment unfortunately rises higher than the roof of the body , and thus produces an unpleasant effect . The square tower , and the dome which surmounts it , are rather handsome ; as a whole , however , we consider it a failure . We regret , that there is no better instance to illustrate our remarks upon the conveniences of Gothic architecture , than the Masonic Temple ; an edifice , which , in consequence of its pointed windows and the small spires which stick up like asses ' ears at the front corners , claims to be Gothic . Barbarous enough it certainly is . The front belongs to the early English style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in keeping with it , should be adorned with buttresses and flying buttresses , battlements , pinnacles , niches ) and canopies , and a profusion of sculpture . Unfortunately the sides of the edifice do not belong to the same age as the front ; and the low-arched windows are very disagreeably contrasted with the more elegant proportions of the one in front . But criticism is wasted on such a building ; the whole is bad . rrhe most perfect piece of architecture in Boston , is the facade of the Tremont Theatre . The only fault we find in it is the steepness of the roof , which is too great for classical elegance . With this exception it is uncommonly chaste and // dignified , and the proportions are admirable . We should be glad to see the two niches occupied by statues , and the pediment adorned with a bets-relief . It is difficult to explain on paper the merits of this edifice , because they consist chiefly in the beauty of the proportions ; the height of the whole compared with its breadth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of its great beauties is the simplicity of the architecture . Upon a base of solid masonry , pierced by three arched doorways of great depth , rises a second story , containing three lofty windows , and supported by Ionic pilasters . This story is carried up so high , that the basement seems only a proper foundation for it . Ahove this rises the pediment , which , though too heavy , is far from being a deformity . Another very pretty building , belonging to Boston , though probably unknown to two thirds of the inhabitants , is the Hospital at Rainsford 's Island . It is of an oblong form , entirely surrounded by a Doric portico like the Parthenon ; and standing upon a bold rocky promontory , jutting out from the island , it makes a fine appearance when viewed from the neighbouring shores , or from the boats which pass in front . Some of the banks in Boston are pretty , particularly a small stone edifice nearly opposite Boylston Market , the proportions of which are very good . The edifice erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instance of what occurs very frequently in the city , great expense with very little effect . In designing any building , some regard must be had to the place , in which it is to stand . Now it appears to us , that , as the Bank in question was to be smothered between other houses , in such a manner that Michael Angelo himself would have been puzzled to make it look well , it was of little or no consequence what the architecture should be . A plain edifice of brick or rough stone with a facade but slightly ornamented , would have answered as well as any thing else . It is very evident that somebody was obliged to pay for those enormous shafts of a single block of granite each ; and it is equally evident , that , as far as architecture is concerned , the money was thrown away . With the edifice , independently of the situation , we have no fault to find . If it stood upon the summit of Beacon Hill , in an open area , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present its beauties are lost . // These remarks lead us to the examination of another building , which , as we never saw the plan , has been an unfailing source of wonder to us , as we have watched its progress ; we mean the new Court-House , which is now so nearly completed , that one can form a pretty good idea of what it is intended to be . For the benefit of those , who have not looked upon this astonishing structure , we will attempt a description , though with a very faint hope of doing justice to the genius of the designer . Let the reader imagine a building so long , narrow , and high , as to resemble a sheet of bakers ' gingerbread standing upon the edge , and he will have some notion of the outline . " I think , Gentlemen , " said a western friend of ours to a building Committee , who were asking his opinion of an edifice of nearly the same proportions as the new Court-House , " I think , Gentlemen , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academy over upon the side , it would cover a good deal of land . " We doubt if good-nature itself could , in conscience , say any thing more than this , in praise of the Court-House . The sides of this elongated and attenuated pile are pierced by numerous windows of different sizes , some arched and some square . At each extremity is a door , above which towers a dead wall , terminated by a cornice , like that of the sides , of the simplest form . From this , the roof slopes back towards the centre . Near the eaves of each end of the building , rises a broad , thin chimney of stone , terminating in several small pyramids , the effect of which is very remarkable . Thus far there is nothing in the edifice to complain of , because thus far it makes no pretence to architecture ; and had the artist , or the civic committee , or whoever was concerned , been content with leaving it in this state , we should have been satisfied with having a cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were designed . But it seems as if , after the building was planned , it was thought necessary to make a little display of taste and classical skill ; and accordingly we have Grecian porticoes built against the end walls . When General Jackson and Major Downing were at the village of Downingville , the President made a speech to the people , of which the Major gives a report . " Here , " says he , " the gineral was soin ' to stop , but says I in his ear , You must give em a little Latin , Doctor . ' Here he off hat again ; E pluribus unum , ' says he , sine qua non . ' That 11 do , Gineral , ' says I. " Our // architect 's porticoes are about as appropriate to the other part of the building , as the General 's Latin to the speech he had been making . In themselves they are extremely beautiful . They are of the Doric order , and consist of four fluted columns , the shafts of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and surmounted by a pediment of the true Attic proportions . But they do not belong to the building ; they would look just as well , and would seem as appropriate , if they stood on the opposite side of the street ; they add nothing to the beauty of the edifice , because it has no beauty to add to , and they certainly do not constitute its beauty , because no one thinks of viewing them as parts of it . We should he in favor , therefore , of having them removed from their unfavorable position at the ends of the Court-House , and carefully preserved , till they can be used for some building of Grecian architecture , to which they may seem actually to belong ; and we assure the architect , that his fame would not be in the least diminished by the abstraction . We have thus far avoided speaking of the churches , while noticing the public edifices of our various cities , because we wished to treat of sacred architecture separately . It assumes , in this country , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our forefathers appear to have been desirous to obliterate entirely the memory of the stately worship from which they had fled ; and they studiously avoided every thing , in the construction of their houses of devotion , which might recall it . Not only is the entire form of the early meeting-house unlike that of the church , but all the interior divisions of nave , transept , and choir are utterly confounded and lost . The pulpit and communion-table are placed on the long side , that they may not remind any one of the chancel and altar ; the aisles are mere alleys , running between the pews and across the building , as the case required ; the long columns extending to the roof have disappeared , and all traces of the church , as it exists in Europe , are lost in the plain and Puritanical meeting-houses of our ancestors . The churches which have been erected within the last half-century , are , with few exceptions , rather modifications of the first plain meeting-houses , than imitations of the European churches . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pulpit is now placed at the extremity of the room ; the aisles begin to be distinguished ; occasionally tall // columns are found , dividing the interior into aisles , and supporting the roof ; and the entrance is at the front . With these changes also have been introduced the tall xvindows reaching to the whole height of the edifice , whereas the old houses of worship were always divided into as many as two , and sometimes even into three stories . A much greater amount of ornament is also found upon our modern churches , than was allowed to those of the last century . There is not to be found , however , in the United States , a single instance of a church built in the style of the English Cathedrals , with nave and transept , and the screen parting the choir from the nave , or the lady chapel behind the choir . One important distinction is now made , which was entirely neglected by our ancestors ; namely , between churches which are to have steeples , and those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume a distinct style ; generally that of the oblong Grecian temple , with a projecting portico in front supported by columns of the height of the edifice . Great improvement has also been made in the form of steeples , wherever they appear . The loftiest steeple in the United States , we believe , is that of Park-Street Church , in Boston , which rises somewhat above two hundred feet . The proportions of the steeple are good , though by some they may , perhaps , be considered too heavy ; and the various divisions harmonize well . If any portion is too heavy , it is the spire , which from its great elevation should be extremely light . The ornaments are of the Grecian order . We should have preferred to have them of the Gothic , which the architect might have employed as appropriately , the body of the church belonging to no order whatever ; but on the whole we regard it as an elegant structure . One of the best proportioned steeples in our country is at Salem , in Massachusetts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best specimen of architecture in that city , notwithstanding the various efforts which have been made since its erection . We are not aware that it has any name ; but the building will easily be recognised as the only church in Chestnut Street . The Ionic portico in front is uncommonly elegant , though simple and unpretending . Above this rises the steeple , to the height of nearly a hundred and fifty feet . Its principal merit is beauty of proportion , which // is not equalled in any steeple , that we know of , in the United States . The lightest and most graceful steeple in Boston is in Federal Street , of the Gothic order . We believe the FederalStreet Church is the first attempt at this style of architecture in Massachusetts , and one of the first in the United States . It has great faults , and indeed few merits except the steeple . One great defect is dividing the building into two stories , of which the upper windows only have the pointed arch . The piers in the interior are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is nothing in the form of the edifice to distinguish it as Gothic , and Grecian ornaments with round arches might have been employed with equal propriety . The same remarks apply to Grace Church in New York , which is also a specimen of the early American Gothic . The windows in that building , if we remember rightly , are lofty ; but they are only distinguished as Gothic by having the pointed arch . The artist seems to have forgotten that mullions , tracery , and transoms are equally characteristic of this order . Since the erection of these churches , the Gothic order has come greatly into use , not only in cities , but throughout the country ; with great faults , however , as it is not uncommon to see a church with pointed windows , and a portico supported by Grecian columns , like the Orthodox Church in Bolton , Massachusetts , and many in the western towns of New York . Buttresses are almost unknown ; and as for flying buttresses , we do not believe there is an instance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches is generally still less Gothic than the outside . In very few is there any appearance of aisles ; and if the gallery and pulpit are ornamented , they are quite as often Grecian as Gothic . No distinction is made in the form of the building with regard to its being of the Grecian or Gothic order ; and in general , if the ornaments were not to be apj ) lied till the body of the edifice was finished in other respects , no one could tell , unless by the pointed windows , to what style of architecture it was intended to belong . As for the richer ornaments of the florid Gothic , they are not to be found on any edifice in the country . This style of architecture is , however , undergoing considerable improvement . Trinity Church in Boston is superior to any edifice in the city of the same style , that was // built before it , and we are inclined to think that the tower is the best Gothic in the United States . As a whole , the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kinds of arches ; the flat arch at the side windows , and the high arch in front , which belongs to a different style of Gothic . The sides of the church look hare and mean from the want of buttresses , dripstones to the windows , machicolated or open-work battlements , and other appropriate ornaments . The interior is very poor ; the vast expanse of white-washed walls , and of pine painted white , is disagreeable to the eye ; the ceiling over the middle aisle is too low , and the length is not great enough for the other proportions . The interior of Grace Church is much better , though the effect is injured by the glare of white . We regard this as the nearest approach , that has yet been made in Boston , to what a Gothic interior ought to be . The prettiest Gothic churches in our country , are at Gardiner , Me. , and at Hartford , Ct . Though neither of them is richly ornamented , they have both , and particularly the one at Hartford , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proofs of far better taste , as well as of greater knowledge , than appears in the construction of most of our churches ; and we are not aware that there are in either of them any of those gross violations of architectural rules , which are so common among us . In concluding our remarks upon Gothic churches , we will select one example for criticism , which we believe is more universally known than any Gothic structure in the country ; the church at Cambridge , in which the annual Commencement performances of the University take place . The front is the best part of the building . It has a square P tower , ornamented at the corners by small octagonal towers , and having in its front a broad low-arched door , and a lofty window of the early Gothic . The belfry opens with pointed arches , above which rises the spire . Four small spires or minarets rise also from the four corners of the tower . In each side of the building , near the ends , are two doors , between shallow buttresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors is adorned by Gothic arched pannels , and surmounted by a battlement . There are three windows , with high arches , and adorned with mullions and transom on the side ; but there are no // buttresses between them , and the battlement is not continued above them , which is a great fault . The form of the building is of the most awkward kind ; so nearly the same in length and breadth , that the interior , after separating a few feet for the porch , is square . It is not divided by piers into aisles , nor are there any divisions in the ceiling to denote them ; indeed , but for the pointed windows and the pulpit , one would never discover from the interior , to what order the edifice was intended to belong . One of the greatest defects of the building is the roof , which is extremely uncouth and barn-like in its appearance , there being nothing to relieve the dull expanse of shingling . The space from the eaves to the ridge-pole is about the same as from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been made by the architect to conceal this deformity . The tower and spire are both too short , and have the appearance of having been cut off , and curtailed of their fair proportion . In general , the edifice looks more like a barn with a steeple to it , than any thing else . Near by , as if to increase the hideousness of this Cathedral , is the modest and beautiful little Episcopal Church , whose faultless proportions have so often been praised , but never imitated . We mention it , only to take the opportunity again to express the wish that it may be copied in stone ; regarding it , as we do , as faultless , both externally and in the interior . St. Paul 's Church in Boston has undoubtedly the finest interior of any in the city . The chancel is supported by two columns of Grecian Ionic ; the ceiling is arched and elegantly pannelled ; the windows are lofty and arched ; and the gallery extends only across the extremity opposite the pulpit . The simplicity and excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even colossal appearance . The exterior is not so good . The slope of the roof is too steep for Grecian architecture ; which makes the pediment so heavy , that the Ionic columns , or piles of cheeses as they have been called , do not seem sufficient for its support . We can not take leave of Boston , without bestowing a word upon two abortions of ugliness which purport to be churches , fronting upon Washington street at the South* // End . We can not believe that any architect planned these monstrous edifices . Corporate bodies , it is said , have no conscience , and these buildings may possibly be the result of corporate irresponsibleness ; no individual of mortal race could have been atrocious enough to design them . We attempt no criticism upon them . Were we to make the effort , we should be in the situation of the clergyman , who , being called to visit a dying man , after a little conversation with him , came from his chamber , declaring with some warmth that the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused , that he neither knew where to begin nor where to end with him . One is tempted by these horrible structures to the wickedness of wishing , that " The Goth , the Christian , Time , War , Flood , or Fire , " or any other means of destruction might " deal upon " them , and relieve the street of their presence . The remarks we have made upon the architecture of the New England churches , apply equally to those of the South . Neither New York nor Philadelphia contains a church , which has any claims to be called fine architecture , or which is worthy of the wealth and population of those cities . There are two in Baltimore which are better ; the Unitarian and the Catholic . The former is remarkably elegant in the form and proportions of the interior , having some resemblance to the Pantheon . The Catholic Church , or Cathedral we believe it is , has the divisions of nave , transept , and chancel ; and the interior is imposing , though too plain . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We think the Gothic would have been more appropriate . The Ecclesiastical architecture in our country is in a very unsettled , ill-defined state . It has neither the stern sunplicity and unpretending rudeness of the puritanical meetinghouses , nor the grace and richness of form and ornament of European churches . It seems worth while then to inquire , what kind of churches the religion of our country requires , and what points are to he particularly attended to in their construction . The majority of our religious societies are of denominations corresponding to the English Protestant Dissenters ; and their services require , that the church should be provided with pews or seats , and should be of such a size that the voice of the preacher may be heard with ease in every part of the building . It is also desirable that the cler // gyman should be seen by the whole congregation . Hence , their churches ought never to be very large , or crowded with ornament in the interior ; especially should massive columns be avoided . The same remarks apply to the Episcopal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected tl ) at this form of worship should be found here , attended with the same pomp and splendor as in England . There is no need of a choir in our Episcopal churches ; nor is the cathedral service daily chaunted in them as in the minsters of England . The Catholics of the United States are not numerous or wealthy enough to rear edifices worthy of their superb ritual ; and they have , at the same time , so many models abroad for their churches , that any advice from us would seem superfluous . There are some considerations , however , which may be of service to the majority of Christians in erecting churches . In the first place , we earnestly recommend to all societies who are preparing to build , however small and insignificant their edifice is to be , to employ an architect to make a regular plan , and then to abide strictly by the plan . The plague of architects , and the destruction of symmetry and elegance in our churches , is the disposition so universally prevalent , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modify the original one . Were a committee of gentlemen , unacquainted with painting , to attempt to alter and improve one of Allston 's pictures , each one adding or erasing to suit his own taste , it may easily be imagined what an effect would be produced ; yet this would hardly be more absurd , than the various alterations made by building committees in the plans of architects . It should be remembered , that , in general , alterations must either cost more than to follow the plan , or else the beauty of the building must be sacrificed . It is extremely desirable that our churches should be made of some more durable material than wood , of which the most of them consist . Stone or brick may be had in every part of the country . The Quincy granite is easily obtained for all towns upon or near the sea-coast , and forms a very elegant material . We like it especially , rough hewn , as in Trinity Church . Granite and slate quarries abound throughout New-England ; besides which there are quarries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches which we have ever seen . If the churches are composed // of such durable substances , they are less expensive in the end , as they require much less repair , and , if properly built , may last for centuries . Besides this , there are associations and sentiments connected with ancient buildings , which can not be called up by those of our own age . We have a natural reverence for antiquity . We regard an edifice over which ages have rolled with a respect we can not feel for those of our own time . True , we Americans have but little opportunity to experience these feelings ; but we are certainly not less affected with veneration for whatever antiquities we do possess , than other nations for the remains which are found among them . A peculiar sacredness , however , seems to invest ancient churches , where our forefathers have met and worshipped ; where the voice of eloquence and the solemn strains of music have been heard for ages ; around whose walls repose in their last sleep those friends whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much the value of our sacred edifices would be increased by age , if we imagine the Pilgrim fathers to have built upon the shore of Plymouth a church , no matter how rude , of sufficient strength and durability to be in preservation at this time . With what veneration should we regard such an edifice ; how carefully should we protect it ; how eagerly should we enter the sacred precincts , hallowed by the memory of the mighty dead ; with what emotions should we listen to our orators , if their eloquence were heightened by the recollections and associations , which would arise in such a temple It may be received as a truth , that , if a church be so constructed as to defy the inroads of time , every revolving year will add to its value . The situation of a church , particularly in the country , is also to be carefully attended to . If possible , let it be placed in the midst of a grove of trees ; if not , let trees be set out around it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our country churches , standing as they generally do , upon some naked hill , without a shrub or even a blade of grass round them , and a long row of sheds for horses half encircling them . There are two churches which we remember to have seen , that strikingly illustrate the effect produced by trees surrounding them . One of these is the chapel of St. Mary 's College , Baltimore , a little bijou . Alas , how forlorn is the Chapel of Cambridge compared with this The other is the Catholic Church at South Boston , a modest // little brick structure , which hides its unpretending form in a rich grove of oaks , and forms a delightful contrast to the absolutely disgusting churches which one passes on the way to it . There is much in this little edifice , which we could wish to see copied . It is built of durable material , and , if the work is faithfully done , may last for centuries ; nothing can he less ornamented , yet the form , entirely different from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It stands upon a hill-side , commanding a fine view of the surrounding country , and yet is sheltered from the gaze of passers , by the beautiful grove which surrounds it . We know of nothing in the country round Boston , to be compared to it . We would impress upon our readers the fact , than a handsome church costs no more than an ugly one ; hecause the beauty of such buildings depends much more upon the proportions , than upon the ornaments employed . By attending to a few points , a great deal of elegance may be secured at a comparativel ) r cheap rate . Great care should be taken , that no ornament should be used which is disproportionate in cost to the other parts of the building ; that all the ornaments should belong to the same style of architecture ; and that none should be used , but for some express purpose , either to aid in the support of the edifice , or to conceal some deformity . If the church is to be of Grecian architecture , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat , and consequently costs more , and at the same time , if necessary , to give up the portico with columns , which are very expensive , than to have a portico and a steep roof . A very elegant church may be had at a small expense hy merely erecting an oblong edifice of proper proportions , with a flat roof of the same angle as that of the Parthenon , and giving it no other ornament than a Done entahlature , supported perhaps by pilasters . In the interior , it is better to make the pulpit and gallery very simple , and to finish the ceiling with a proper cornice , if the funds of the society are not enough for both . The most common deformity in our churches , is the roof , which is generally so steep as to appear extremely uncouth and heavy . Every effort should he made to obviate this . In Grecian buildings , the roof should be made as flat as those of the classical models , and covered with lead or zinc to guard it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , to secure // this beauty , many of the ornaments which are common in our churches had better be abandoned . The Gothic roof is much steeper than the Grecian ; hut at the same time this beautiful style provides an expedient for concealing the roof , and obviates the unpleasant effect produced by it . We are not aware , that , in any instance in our country , the architect has availed himself of this advantage , which the Gothic offers ; and yet we think that many of the usual ornaments bad better be sacrificed , in order to secure this . A Gothic church is generally divided into three aisles , which are distinguished by the piers or columns which go from the floor to the ceiling . To correspond to these , the roof should be divided into two portions ; the slope should begin as usual at the eaves , and be carried up till it covers the side aisles here it should be interrupted by a wall rising perpendicularly over the piers , and supporting the remaining part of the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion is nearly concealed by the battlement ; and the upper part is too narrow to produce a bad effect . Besides this , with such a roof the ceiling is of course higher over the middle than the side aisles , and being ribhed and arched is very imposing . We doubt whether it is expedient for us to employ , in the construction of our churches , an order which depends so much upon ornaments for its effect , as the Gothic . We are not yet rich enough to build Gothic churches ; nor is there a single example in the United States which does justice to this noble style . If , however , we are to have it , let us begin in the ribht way , and build really Gothic edifices , instead of Yankee meeting-houses with Gothic ornaments on them , which we have now . Let it be remembered , that pointed arches can not alone 5nstitute this style ; and that all the common ornaments , the mullions , tracery , foliage , transoms , clustered pillars , battlements , parapets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canopies , are wasted , if they are attached to a huge unseemly barn , like the one in Cambridge . The Gothic depends , not less than the Grecian , for its beauty , on form and proportion . A church built in this style should be - much greater in length than in breadth . A. steeple is not necessary ; hut , if it is resolved upon , let it he well-shaped rather than highly ornamented ; and we should prefer that the building should he without a steeple , rather than he deprived of buttresses . It is also highly desirable to introduce the // division of the roof to which we have alluded above , as this adds greatly to the effect both externally and in the interior . As yet , stained windows are hardly known in our country and still , if our congregations would sacrifice some of the luxuries of the pews , gallery , and pulpit , they might afford this precious ornament , which we prize more than any that adorns the sacred edifices abroad . The effect of one large window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not xvitnessed it ; and if the money , which it would cost , could be saved by building the pulpit of pine , instead of mahogany , by having the organ in a cheap case , and by lining the pews with inoreen instead of velvet , we think it would much better he expended on so noble a decoration . We can not dismiss the subject of churches without offering a word upon the arrangement of the singing-seats . These are generally in the front of the gallery opposite the pulpit , the most prominent and exposed situation in the building . The organ is usually placed immediately behind the first row of seats , leaving only a narrow space between the keys and the front of the gallery . Now it is a principle in music , very little recognised here , that the performers should be concealed . The effect of such an arrangement is remarkably illustrated in the Sistine Chapel at Rome , and in many of the convents in Europe where the nuns chant behind a lattice . By *lacing the organ and singers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is improved in several ways . There is a certain mingling and union of sound which can not be produced when the performers are stationed in a long row round the front gallery and the tones are echoed from the recess with a power and harmony , that are lost in a considerable degree , when the music is performed in a more exposed situation . As our churches are commonly built , it would he extremely easy to have such an arrangement for the music , by cutting a recess from the back of the gallery into a porch or tower , large enough to contain the organ and singers . The whole front of this recess should be open to the church , and the back closely walled up ; and we venture to predict , that , if such an orchestra as this were built , it would contribute greatly to the effect of the music . A contrivance somewhat similar to this has been lately adopted in the Chapel of the University of Cambridge , and renders it one of the finest music rooms in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the alt , which is quite new in the United States , though it has been cultivated and perfected for centuries in Europe ; - Sepulchral architecture , which has been unknown in our country till within a few years , unless perhaps the rude grave-stones of our burying-grounds may be thought to deserve the name . The only remarkable display of this architecture is at the Mount Auhurn Cemetery , near Boston . Too much praise can not be given to those , who originated this design and selected the place . A lovelier spot we never saw . The lofty heights , the deep glens and valleys , the calm reservoirs which reflect the surrounding hills and the skies from their unruffled surface , the deep shades , the retirement and peace of this hallowed ground , the tasteful paths winding with labyrintl ) ine turns along the varied surface , the green turf and the sweet flowers which bloom over the silent graves , the simple monuments of white marble which are discerned here and there amid the shade , the birds that warble their lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw a charm over the place that we can find nowhere else . Its natural beauty is not equalled by that of the famous Campo Santo of Pisa , the cemetery at Liverpool , or even Pare Ia Chaise . In architectural splendor it falls far short of these , and of many other cemeteries of the old world . Nor is it to be expected , that we should see at Mount Auburn such a display of magnificence as in Europe . It is very desirable , however , that whatever is done , should be in good taste ; and we have a few remarks to offer with regard to this . It is worthy of notice , that the fe*v models for monuments which were at first displayed , have been very eagerly copied , and with no great variety . It is of great importance that the public taste , therefore , should be well directed , before the cemetery becomes filled with uncouth structures and monuments . The most remarkable specimen of architecture , and that which seems to have diffused its character over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian architecture ; and , in imitation , the principal portion of the monuments are in the same style . We have , accordingly , a great number of pyramids , and obelisks , and tombs supported by Egyptian columns , and fashioned in the heavy proportions of that style . // It is very doubtful whether the Egyptian style is most appropriate to a Christian burial-place . It certainly has no connexion with our religion . In its characteristics , it is anterior to civilization , and therefore is not beautiful in itself . No one will deny the superiority of the Grecian style in mere point of beauty . But more than this , Egyptian architecture reminds us of the religion which called it into being , the most degraded and revolting paganism which ever existed . It is the architecture of embalmed cats and deified crocodiles ; solid , stupendous , and time-defying we allow , but associated rn our minds with all that is disgusting and absurd in superstition . Now there is certainly no place , not even the church itself , where it is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the cemetery , which must be regarded either as the end of all things , the last , melancholy , hopeless resort of perishing humanity , the sad and fearful portion of man , which is to involve body and soul alike in endless night , or , on the other hand , as the gateway to a glorious immortality , the passage to a brighter world , whose splendors beam even upon the dark chambers of the tomb . It is from the very brink of the grave , where rest in eternal sleep the mortal remains of those whom we have best loved , that Christianity speaks to us , in its most triumphant , soulexalting words , of victory over death , and a life to come , Surely , then , all that man places over the tomb should in a measure speak the same language . The monuments of the burial-ground should remind us that this is not our final abode ; they should , as far as possible , recall to us the consolations and promises of our religion . But there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and owes its existence even to this religion ; whose very ornaments remind one of the joys of a life beyond the grave ; whose lofty vaults and arches are crowded with the forms of prophets and martyrs and beatified spirits , and seem to resound with the choral hymns of angels and archangels . But peculiarly are its power and sublimity displayed in the monuments it rears over the tomb . The elevated form , on which reposes the marble statue of the mailed knight or the holy woman , composed into the stately rest of the grave , yet the hands folded over the breast as if com // mending the spirit to God who gave it ; the canopy which overhangs it ; the solemn vault that rises above ; the gorgeous window , through which is poured a flood of golden light , like a beam from heaven , upon the abode of the dead these are the characteristics of the architecture of Christianity , the sublime , the glorious Gothic . And this is the style we would have chosen for the prevailing architecture of Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures , which the fervor of the middle ages called forth in Europe ; no more can we rival the Pyramids in our Egyptian style ; but , if we attempt to imitate either , the Christian style should have the preference . We shall be told , perhaps , that very few persons have the same disagreeable associations with the Egyptian architecture , that we have expressed ; that its solemn and heavy proportions become the tomb ; and that it has the great merit of combining cheapness and durability . To these it may be replied , that , although there may be no preference existing previously in the minds of the community foi ' one style or another , yet it is well to cultivate a preference for the Gothic , since it is a fact which nothing can alter , that this is Christian architecture , and the Egyptian belongs equally to paganism . It is desirable , that those who visit the graves of their friends should associate with the spot , the monuments and decorations which their religion has consecrated for a thousand years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . " And is it , then , a principal object in rearing a monument to the memory of those we loved best , to save expense ? Far be it from us to encourage extravagance in these structures ; yet it seems to us , that if a few dollars more will purchase the change from the architecture of paganism to that of Christianity , they would be well expended . We doubt , however , whether a simple structure , such as the Gothic affords , might not he afforded as cheaply as any thing of the same size which is actually found at the Cemetery . As yet the gateway must be considered as unfinished ; the present structure being only a model in wood , of what is hereafter to be perpetuated in granite . We would , therefore , suggest the question for the consideration of those who are interested in the matter , whether the plan might not he changed , and a Gothic structure erected , instead of the one // we now have , at little , or no additional expense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by three pointed arches , the middle one very lofty and broad for the admission of carriages . This wall should be surmounted by a battlement of open-work , or machicolated as it is called , and should he supported by buttresses , or by octagon towers terminating in light pinnacles . Such a structure we think might be erected at no greater expense than the present one , and would serve as the model for a more suitable style of monuments , than that which prevails in the Cemetery . We are far from wishing , that the architecture of Mount Auburn should be exclusively Gothic . We are only desirous , that this noble style should be introduced ; for at present we believe there is not a single specimen of it in the place . Nothing can be more beautiful than some of the classic monuments which are found there , Spurzheim*s for instance . The broken shaft and the Grecian altar are simple and intrinsically elegant , and certainly deserve a place in the Cemetery . Nor would we exclude the obelisk , by far the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions seem to speak of eternal duration ; but among these we would claim a place also for the architecture of Christianity . We come finally to the consideration of a very important branch of the art , Domestic architecture , which is yet in a very unsettled state among us . With the internal arrangement of dwelling-houses we have little to do ; supposing that every man can suit himself best . We would only suggest , that , in building a house , the comfort of the interior is of much greater consequence than external symmetry or elegance . For the fashion of the exterior , however , there is much to be said . Domestic architecture seems to take two forms , which we shall call the Palace style , and the Cottage style . Under the former class we range all the larger edifices destined to be inhabited , which , from their dimensions and the money expended upon them , are designed to assume regular architectural forms , and , hem6 decorated with the usual ornaments of the Grecian or Gothic styles , contribute equally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are built . Such edifices are to be judged by the regular laws of the art . The most remarkable specimen of the palace style in the United States , is the President 's House at Washington . // Under the cottage style we rank all dwelling-houses , whose interior is fashioned less with regard to the rules of architecture , than the convenient arrangement of the interior . These buildings do not depend upon architectural ornaments for their beauty , s* much as upon their obvious fitness for comfort and use ; and their forms , so far from being necessarily regular , are often most picturesque and beautiful when least symmetrical . By the cottage style , we do not mean to convey the idea of small or mean structures . It admits of large proportions and of great elegance . It only does not aim at that unity and symmetry of form , and richness of ornament , which belong to the palace . But it happens unfortunately , that the domestic architecture of our country is as ambitious as the society ; and as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we would be all on equal terms in our houses ; and if we have not money enough to build a large palace , we must forsooth have a little one ; but a palace it must he , at all events , if it is but ten feet square . The result of this is , that the country is filled with ambitious little buildings , covered with strange ornaments , and as fine as white and yellow paint can make them . The comfort of the rooms is sacrificed to the splendor of the exterior ; and , the purse of the builder being exhausted by the effort , he is forced to abandon the improvement of his grounds , so that his unhappy palace stands alone in its glory , without a tree to shade it , or a single green shrub to rest the eye . Of late , it has become much the fashion to build country houses in the form of a Grecian temple with a projecting portico in front , resting on very magnificent columns . This style prevails at Cambridge . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely in Cambridge-Port . Two or three specimens of this style are to he seen on the road which forms the continuation of the old Concord turnpike through the Port . One of them in particular we have noticed , as it has been in progress . It is a small edifice , the whole length of which , including the portico , may possibly be thirty feet , and the breadth fifteen . The front of this little building is adorned with four massive fluted columns , with elegantly carved Ionic capitals , the cost of which can scarcely have been less than that of all the rest of the house . // There seems to be a prevailing passion for columns , throughout the country . One gentleman , in an interior county , has surrounded his house with them , and his example has been followed in a house at East Boston . We do not deny that these columns are very handsome ; it is the thought of their material , pine wood , which destroys their effect ; and we must say that , to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettier as well as more convenient , if the same money were expended in constructing it of some more durable material , and in adorning it with vines , shrubbery , and trees . Nothing can be more admirable for imitation , than the English cottage style , as it is perfectly adapted to our climate , and in good keeping with our taste in ornamental gardening ; and we would earnestly recommend to our architects , to import plans and elevations of these buildings , which constitute the true style of domestic architecture , rather than to go on multiplying among us the abortive temples and palaces , with which the land already groans . Let them remember , as a general rule , that a house is made to live in , and the convenience of the occupants is the first thing to be considered ; after this , the ornaments may be thought of . The general form of a dwelling-house in the city , is in most cases of less importance than in the country , because houses are built in blocks , and are often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is one kind of ornament which might be used with good effect in our blocks of dwelling-houses , which are generally so plain as to be painful to the eye ; we mean the appropriate ornament of windows , a rich heavy cornice above them , and a moulding extending sometimes down their sides . This contributes very greatly to relieve the plain surface , and give it a finished and elegant air . Any one who has visited Florence , must have been struck with the prevalence and beauty of this ornament . It is hardly to be found in our cities ; the best specimen of it in Boston , we believe , is on a large brick mansion in Beacon Street . In general , the windows are nothing more than square holes cut in the wall , and entirely destitute of their appropriate architecture . It may easily be imagined how much the fronts of the Tremnont House and the Albion would be improved , by the addition of these ornaments . // We are not aware that Oriel windows are found i n any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more ornamental to the exterior* or contribute more to render the rooms agreeable . The effect of these beautiful windows , whic.h project from the front of the house , something like the large shop windows , may he seen in all views of English cottages and ancient halls . They abound , too , in the college buildings at Oxford and Cambridge , and form a remarkable feature in the beautiful domestic architecture of that country . These windows might be adopted in our houses without any great expense , and we think would be found more convenient , and certainly much more beautiful , than the bows in front of many buildings . A row of oriel windows , projecting from the second stories of the houses in Park Street , for instance , would have a very picturesque effect . We conclude with exhorting all house-builders to " fling away ambition " ; to contrive their houses with a view to comfort rather than show , and to take special care that the proportions be not so great , and the cost so extravagant , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
