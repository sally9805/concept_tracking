THE ITALIAN BRIDE The manuscript of The Italian Bride , in Payne 's hand , is in the Luquer collection . This tragedy , a so-called " dramatic romance , " was completed sometime before Payne 's return to America in 1832 , for in a letter dated September 13 , 1836 , Payne mentions a copy of it that he had " left in England . " ( For this reason A. H. Quinn 's conjecture in A History of the American Drama from the Beginning to the Civil War , New York , 1923 , p. 437 , that the play was written after the year 1832 , seems incorrect . ) Although Payne did his best to find a producer he was never successful . On February 5 , 1833 , just before Kemble 's arrival on a tour , Payne wrote from Boston to Colonel S. P. Morris in New York asking him to sound Kemble out about the play ; Morris did so , but Kemble , after demanding a more legible manuscript , with which Payne supplied him , rejected it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been left in England , made " some alterations " in it and sent it to Wallack . Which one of the versions has been preserved in the only manuscript that has survived , it is impossible to say . Payne probably based the tragedy on some undiscovered French source , for the original text of his extant manuscript is a tragedy of love intrigue set in Paris ; by means of extensive revision of this text , however , he Americanizes it completely , altering the scene to Baltimore , changing the characters ' names , and adding a few details . Plays that might be expected to furnish a clue in the search for a French source , such as Milman 's Fazio ; or , The Italian Wife , acted in 1816 in London , or Knowles 's The Wife : A Tale of Mantua , 1833 , or a tragedy by S. G. Levy with the same title as Payne 's , produced in 1857 in New York , are of no help , for they resemble Payne 's only vaguely . The portrayal of Baltimore society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , travel , and balls is noteworthy as an experiment . Kemble , however , was justified in turning the play down , for the far-fetched heroics are wholly unsuited to the domestic characters .

Main text ACT I. Scene : Apartment in the mansion of Mr. Morton at Baltimore . Estelle Morton is sitting , with her head reclined on a harp , which , in the earlier part of the scene , she now and then carelessly touches . Near her stands Edward Somers . Lucy Colvin is at work at a little side table . Est . Estelle Morton And about what year was this that you were at Venice ? Edw . Edward Somers The close of 1829 . Lu . Lucy Colvin Do you think the Queen of the Adriatic merits the high fame which the poets give her ? Est . Estelle Morton Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen of our countryman Fenimore Cooper , whose genius has proved to distant lands which so long fancied ours almost barbarous , that we can send forth works upon which even refined Europe dwells with ecstasy ? Edw . Edward Somers No other city in the world could detain Byron three years . Est . Estelle Morton Is Byron remembered there ? Edw . Edward Somers Estelle , cities whose monuments are crumbling soon forget men . Aye , there yet may be Venetians who remember having seen a haughty , pale-browed stranger , whom they heard called Byron ; and they remember him , not as the gifted bard who has enhanced their city 's fame in the immortal verses of Childe Harold , not as a sort of rebel angel wandering over earth upon whose lofty front the hand of Heaven had written : " Genius and Misanthropy ; " but because , to a spot where their race is almost unknown , he brought splendid chargers which bore him on the gallop across the humid square of St. Mark 's when the promenader could scarce keep his footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the Lido , leap with those coursers the tombs of the Jewish cemetery , where , unless upon compulsion , no Christian step dare , after night-fall , venture . Est . Estelle Morton Ah , this disenchants me with Venice , Edward . Edw . Edward Somers It ought only to disenchant you with its inhabitants . I have seldom found a people 's character to harmonize with the scenery in which they dwell . You should see Venice , dear Estelle , from the height of the obelisk of St. Mark 's  --  Venice , standing with her feet in the waves like the Venus of the ocean ; glittering at night with beacon lights blazing in front of her thousand black gondolas , as they dart across each other , like shooting stars . You should see Venice from the Lido , when in the morning , wrapped in mist , each breeze from the Adriatic bears away some fragment of her veil , disclosing now a church , now a bridge and now a palace . Indeed , she may be compared ( forgive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the most of her charms , will only let them break on the gazer one by one , each new perfection lovelier than the last . Lu . Lucy Colvin You talk more like a poet than a traveller , Mr. Somers . Est . Estelle Morton Once married , Edward , we 'll go to Venice together  --  you 'll promise , wo n't you , dear Edward ? Edw . Edward Somers Yes , my Estelle , and Venice will then look more beautiful than ever , for then you will look with me from the obelisk of St. Mark ; you will stand by me at the Lido ; and if in you , Estelle , I do not forget Venice , Venice will have charms she never had before for me , for I shall then behold her  --  not with the eyes of sadness . Est . Estelle Morton And from Venice we will go  --  Edw . Edward Somers To Naples . Lu . Lucy Colvin Ah , your father , Miss Estelle , will be able to tell us all about Naples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edward shall tell us about it . Come . I long to hear of Naples . Edw . Edward Somers I must not deprive your father of the traveller 's greatest pleasure . Lu . Lucy Colvin Rather say , Sir Poet , that your recollections of Naples are not such as you would confide to a lady who only awaits her father 's return to be made your wife . Edw . Edward Somers And wherefore not , Lucy ? Est . Estelle Morton To Edward What does she mean ? Edw . Edward Somers I know what she means , but she is mistaken , as you shall soon be convinced she is . Estelle , as ere long we shall be wedded , it is fitting I should have no concealments from you , love . Your heart is calm , Estelle ; no stormy feeling ever ruffled it ; but I am not so happy . I bring a heart less pure ; a wild attachment lost me for two years in a tempest of passion . My excuse is in one word  --  then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a time , when such a declaration would only have raised my curiosity . Now , it does more , I own  --  but I am not so absurd as to continue jealous of the past , when I have no cause to doubt that all the future may be mine . So tell me all , Edward  --  tell , tell me all . Edw . Edward Somers Lucy , I thank you for having opened the subject , even if your raillery had other ends in view than it has gained ; even if you did not mean to spare me , as you have , the embarrassing part of a confession , which , as a timid lover I retarded , but as a man of honor it was my purpose to have made ( though you seem to have thought otherwise , good Lucy )  --  yes , to have made this very hour  --  but knew not how to begin . Lu . Lucy Colvin Well , now you 've found the way , do begin . Quick  --  Est . Estelle Morton And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me show you . First of all , then , her name  --  Edw . Edward Somers Over that I have no right , Estelle . That is the only portion of the story that I may not mention . Est . Estelle Morton I honor your delicacy ; but you can tell me how you came to know her  --  how much you loved her  --  and how long  --  if she loved you  --  and if she was beautiful  --  and what her age was ? Tell me all about it ! Edw . Edward Somers And you 'll forgive it all ? Even to her being beautiful ? Can you , Estelle ? Est . Estelle Morton Edward  --  Edw . Edward Somers Well ? Est . Estelle Morton Look at me . Edw . Edward Somers With all my soul . Est . Estelle Morton You are forgiven . Edw . Edward Somers You are an angel . Est . Estelle Morton No compliments  --  my story  --  come ! Edw . Edward Somers I had been about a week in Naples ; my dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those delightful villas which border the gulf of Ischia . One night I was startled from my sleep by a sharp , sudden shiver . I flew to the window  --  a blood-red brightness glared into the apartment and lit up all the sky  --  a hoarse hurricane howled  --  a shower of fire was falling . I at once perceived that I was about to view one of those awful eruptions of which I had so often read and longed to be a witness . Scarcely had I time to hurry on my dress and fling my mantle over me  --  for the stairs trembled and crackled at each step  --  I darted into the street . Oh , it was terrible to behold the whole population of a mighty city and its countless neighboring villages outpouring in wild confusion upon the heaving earth , between long rows of edifices whose towering walls swung to and fro above their heads like tall trees bowing in the tempest . Before me hurried two unprotected females , heedless , hopeless . I caught them . I observed a path conducting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fisherman had just put off to seek the safety of the opposite shore . I plunged into the wave  --  detained his boat  --  forced my companions into it  --  and sheltering them with a canvas from the falling flakes , the boatman spread his sail , and our bark cut the waves like a belated sea-bird . Lu . Lucy Colvin Why , this is like a romance , Edward . Est . Estelle Morton Do n't interrupt him . Edw . Edward Somers From the moment the two females whom chance had thrown under my protection were in safety , the desire of gathering all the wonders of the scene shut out every other thought . Propped against the mast of our little bark , I stood and gazed . Oh , Estelle , let me not even attempt to picture what I saw ! Fancy a column of broad flame shooting two hundred feet in air and tumbling , then , in flakes  --  streams of burning lava leaping in cascades  --  a sea of fire rolling wildly into the sea of water , first driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repelled  --  two elements struggling like gladiators for the mastery  --  nature in the last convulsion seeming to implore for mercy  --  in a sky of blood , disheveled shadows , like the damned of Dante , hurrying in throngs some one way , some another , along the palpitating shore . Fancy all this , and you will still have but a feeble idea of a night of Naples from the gulf of Ischia , during an eruption of Vesuvius . Est . Estelle Morton And what became of you ? Edw . Edward Somers I stood immovable , with folded arms , eyes fixed , and bosom heaving , when , in the tossing of the bark , I felt an arm involuntarily grasping for support , at mine , and heard a voice exclaim , " Is it not , indeed , a stupendous scene ? Sublime beyond conception ? More than the awestruck mind could long endure , and not go mad ? " The sweet tones thrilled me  --  I turned  --  Est . Estelle Morton Was this the object of your love ? Edw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , and I will tell you all . The piercing eye of black , the flowing ringlets dancing in the breeze , the Neapolitan complexion lighted by the fantastic hues of the volcano 's blaze ; they made me feel as if that voice had come from a guardian angel , commissioned to see the work of wrath accomplished and to shield me from its fury . Never had I seen aught so splendidly beautiful before . The romantic way in which we became acquainted , and the service I had rendered her mother and herself , established a ready intimacy between us , which her father , on his return from a long absence , broke with a single word . She was a rich banker 's daughter  --  I without fortune  --  he aimed at a splendid alliance which should increase the wealth of his daughter  --  I had nothing even for myself . Calling one day at my accustomed hour , I learned that she was gone . A letter from her apprised me that she had acted in obedience to her father , and begged me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become of her , or ever naming or thinking of her , more . I obeyed her and returned . You were then at school , Estelle . Est . Estelle Morton Oh yes , and I remember to have heard of some great feud between our families at that time about party politics  --  Edw . Edward Somers True . My father was a native of England , where he had left a brother , who was attached to the British Army and fell fighting against us at the battle of New Orleans . The British origin of my father drew bitter sarcasms against him during an election struggle from party papers and from certain hotheaded political opponents , among whom your own father was conspicuous ; but mine nobly vindicated his loyalty to his adopted country by arming in her cause ; and after he was slain  --  was slain  --  Est . Estelle Morton Pardon  --  pardon , dear Edward  --  pardon my thus thoughtlessly disturbing you with that dreadful recollection  --  Edw . Edward Somers Slain in the same field which caused his brother 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he sought me , and courted every opportunity of serving me , and often , after he had taken me into his employ , would exclaim , with a smile , how happy it would make him to have a son-in-law like me  --  Est . Estelle Morton Of which hint you were ungallant enough to take no heed  --  Edw . Edward Somers Because till he went on business to Italy and left me the management of his affairs at Baltimore , I had not seen you , Estelle . But when you and I became acquainted , love , how eager was I to remind him of what he had said and how grateful when he confirmed it by his consent . Since then , the memory of my earlier passion has hourly faded , till at length it only comes back to me like some strange dream . I still think of it , of course , but I think of it merely as a touching episode inseparable from the history of that tremendous night when I saw Naples convulsed , the sea upheaving , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I go to Naples , and witness an eruption of Vesuvius from the center of the Gulf of Ischia , you shall turn as you did before and look  --  not on the dark Italian  --  but the blue eyes and rosy cheeks of America . Perhaps they , too , may derive a beauty in your mind from the fantastic glare of the volcano . Then as you turn to gaze on me , you 'll smile , and oh , Edward , I sha n't think , then , upon the girl of Naples , I shall forget your story in your smile . Enter Francis Fr . Francis A letter , madam . Hands it , bows , and exit Est . Estelle Morton Oh , from my father ! How my heart beats ! Estelle eagerly breaks open the letter and reads it hastily and with agitation Edw . Edward Somers Well ? Are not we also to be made happier ? Do you mean to keep the good news entirely to yourself ? Est . Estelle Morton Handing the letter to Lucy There  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much flurried  --  Lu .

Belmunda " Implore you to unriddle the mystery of your marriage and of your presence here  --  glad that you , as I have done , gave no intimation of ever having seen me before  --  Mr. Morton  --  best of men , but sensitive , quick-tempered and wrong-headed  --  better for him and all , to remain entirely unapprised  --  " Seeing Estelle approaching Ha !

Estelle Morton But papa looks so hurt when I do not . Bel . Belmunda It costs you an effort , then , to call me mother ? Est . Estelle Morton You are so young that it would seem much more natural to call you sister ; and I am sure we should be like sisters , if we were better acquainted ; and were there no other reason for wishing to prevent your returning so soon to Naples , the hope of that would be enough without the rest .

I could think , I could dream of no one but him . I can not tell you how glad it made me when I found that change was love . Bel . Belmunda Girl !

Bel . Belmunda You ? Est . Estelle Morton Yes . When I think of the past , when I recall the indifference I had for him so long , I almost wonder that he should ever have brought himself to care about me at all . Oh , if I could bring back those days of coldness which I doubt he now remembers deeply ! But I will make him forget them in my redoubled efforts to deserve his devotedness in the days to come .

Cowers down towards the door of Edward 's apartment Now they stir again  --  the footfall grows more distinct  --  now more  --  ha ! The door opens ! ' T is he ! Recoiling Whither goes he ? Edward , pale and trembling , appears upon the threshold of his door , pressing his hand to his bosom , as if to still the beatings of his heart . He glides cautiously , gazes around to watch if anyone is within view , listens , crosses the stage , places his hand upon the knob of Belmunda 's door , pauses a moment to wipe his brow , then enters . Galeazzo follows him in the darkness , still paler and more trembling , ready to throw the stiletto , which , when he perceives the door of Belmunda ajar , he flings with a wild laugh Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Rushes out ACT III . Scene : A more richly decorated apartment than the last . Three doors at the back , opening into another magnificent suite of rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting Mr. Hartley . Edw . Edward Somers Mr. Hartley , this is most kind . I called at your house because I was anxious to see you about what you were suggesting  --  you remember ? The mission to Guatemala  --  how attentive of you , to return my call so promptly . Has the nomination gone in ? If it has , I would accept it on the instant  --  aye , and gratefully . Hart . Mr. Hartley Then I think you may make your mind easy ; for two days ago I received a letter from Washington assuring me that it has not only been sent to the Senate , but a favorable report has been made upon it by the Committee on Foreign Relations , and it was to have been brought up yesterday finally in Executive Session . No doubt today 's mail is in . I will hurry home and bring you the result at once  --  Edw . Edward Somers Oh , no  --  do n't give yourself that trouble . Leave it till night . We are to see you at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . Do you think I would be absent from the anniversary of your wife 's eighteenth birthday ? I , who knew her before she knew herself . By the bye , is it not almost time for your father-in-law to return ? Why , it is at least six weeks , is it not , since he went to New Orleans ? Edw. Edward Somers Full . He finds great difficulty in settling the dispute about the plantation which was left to him there just as he was preparing to embark for Italy . I should not wonder if it detained him at least six weeks longer . Hart. Mr. Hartley The signora your mother was looking amazingly well last Thursday at the ball . Is her intended return to Naples entirely given up ? Edw . Edward Somers Since the sudden illness which prevented her departing the day after my wedding , I have heard no more of it . Hart . Mr. Hartley Oh , she 's getting more reconciled to America , now she knows it better . People are generally homesick when they first come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you will manage among you to make her forget Italy altogether in time . She 's a charming creature ! I should not much like to have such a mother-in-law always near my husband , were I your wife , Edward . Apropos  --  I forgot to ask  --  is Estelle better ? Edw . Edward Somers I hope she will be shortly . Sighing Hart . Mr. Hartley I hope so too . I never saw a girl so changed in so short a time . Edw . Edward Somers Do you think there is really a hope of the mission we spoke of ? Will it take me thither speedily ? Speedily ? Hart . Mr. Hartley How impatient you are all of a sudden ! You forget it is your own fault that you were not off somewhere long ago . But when I urged it , you always had some pretext for lingering . Will you have the mission , do you ask ? There 's not a man in the United States that stands so good a chance , I can tell you ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt not I shall bring what you desire and I can almost promise . Till then , adieu ! Exit Hartley Edw . Edward Somers Alone Oh , if Belmunda fancied I were about to quit her ! But it must be . I trifle with my peace and with her happiness and that of all around me , by remaining . Oh , how blind passion fooled me when I exulted at the accident which delayed her projected return to Naples and flung her as an inmate under my own roof during her new husband 's absence ! But we are only at the precipice 's edge . Be it my care that neither of us fall . Flings himself on a chair , where he sits , pensively , while Belmunda gaily enters on tiptoe , gets behind him , and leans over his shoulder . He starts Ha ! Bel . Belmun da What ! Have I startled you from your day-dream ? Ah , that 's an ill thing in anyone as this world goes . What were life but for its dreams , Edward ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . Edw . Edward Somers And are you happy , then ? Bel . Belmunda Aye , when in the wild whirl of society , when , amid the intoxication of lights and music , eyes may meet unobserved , hands touch unseen , and love breathe its whisper not dreading to be guilty or fearing to be heard . Oh , then , I can for a moment think that I am happy , for then , Edward , I dream . Never had society , never had the gay dance , the romantic play , the crowded promenade such charms for me as now . Edw . Edward Somers I fear , on the return of my father  --  Bel . Belmunda Edward , that word has waked me ! With that word starts up a specter to fright the fairy forms that circled me , and I am left alone and desolate ! Edw . Edward Somers Nay , nay , Belmunda  --  Bel . Belmunda I ought not to have remained in the same country with you . I ought not to have trusted myself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have known there may be a guilt which in the world 's eye is innocence , though that unsinning guilt brings its sure anguish . My heart rebels , although my deeds are loyal . And when they call me exemplary wife , I sicken at the praise  --  I know I am all hypocrite ! Edw . Edward Somers Be calm . With what can you reproach yourself ? Bel . Belmunda With this : with giving way to the delirious hope that I might continue the mastery over my feelings which enabled me to resign you at my father 's bidding and when I thought you dead , accept another ; and that I might continue that mastery without again parting with him whom I had left so lightly . But oh ! The consciousness that I am bound for life  --  for life  --  while I see you hourly and know you to be lost to me  --  makes him they call my husband hateful . And then I picture him arrayed in vengeance . Did I not start when last night they sang that touching song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All thought it was the song . I heard no song  --  Edward , it was remorse  --  Edw . Edward Somers For what ? Bel . Belmunda That my heart should be less blameless than my conduct ; that I should not have conquered even my thoughts , for erring thoughts are crimes and their retribution , if we repress them not , despair . Mine make me mad with terror  --  Edw . Edward Somers Terror ? Bel . Belmunda Aye , of myself , my husband ; of your wife , too , whose calm , clear eye seems fixed on me when none beside can see her , and silently speaks daggers . Enter Francis Fr . Francis Mr. Morton 's carriage is entering the courtyard . Bows and exit Edw . Edward Somers Here ? Here ? And so unlooked for ! Bel . Belmunda Now you have lost your self-possession , while I am calm and ready for the meeting . Edw . Edward Somers I am  --  I am unmanned . Oh , Belmunda , what must guilt be , when but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus overwhelm the innocent ! Bel . Belmunda I am the best dissembler . Did I not tell you I was all hypocrite ? Go in .

Enter Morton with Estelle Est . Estelle Morton Here , father , she is here . Mor . Mr. Morton Embracing her You might have been kind enough , love , to come down and bid one welcome . Estelle , Lucy , and all the household came , while you  --  Bel . Belmunda I was just going as you entered . I had not expected your return so soon . Mor . Mr. Morton True , true . How unreasonable I was to think you could be on the alert to welcome one you could not have expected . But the truth is I 'm jealous even of the suspicion of a slight from you . Ah , I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what 's worse , there 's no help for it , when you 're looking  --  why you are looking lovelier than ever , darling ! I wish I could say as much for Estelle , poor child ! Did you ever witness such an alteration ! What has been the matter with you , Estelle ? Est . Estelle Morton With a melancholy smile Oh , nothing  --  nothing  --  but , look ! Here 's Edward . This way , Edward , this way . See , here 's our father ! Enter Edward Edw . Edward Somers My dear sir  --  Mor . Mr. Morton " My dear Mr. Morton  --  dear Mr. Morton "  --  how formal ! Have you lost your senses , Edward ? What have you all been about since I was gone ? You seem in a strange way , all of you . Edw . Edward Somers Oh , my father  --  Mor . Mr. Morton Why , if anything , Edward , you look more miserable than your wife ! How dare you look miserable , any of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found I had brought my business to a close , and might by hard travelling get here in time to keep it with you , trust me , I did not spare myself night or day . Come , Belmunda . We must make ourselves interesting for the occasion , and , hang it , love , I 've so many things to say to you that I do n't see how I am to spare you out of my sight long enough for you to make your toilette . Come along , dearest , or we shall be too late for the young folks . Exeunt Morton and Belmunda . Edward is following Est . Estelle Morton Edward  --  you are not going to leave me ? Leave me thus , too ! Edw . Edward Somers I beg your pardon , I  --  I  --  Est . Estelle Morton One word and I release you . Edw . Edward Somers Estelle ! Est . Estelle Morton My father thought me pale and altered , love . Edw . Edward Somers I , too , have remarked it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never asked the cause . Edw . Edward Somers The cause , did you say ? The cause ? Est . Estelle Morton ' T is this : I 'm very , very wretched . Edw . Edward Somers Ha ! How can that be ? Wherefore ? Est . Estelle Morton Because Edward do n't love me as he did . Edw . Edward Somers Estelle ! Est . Estelle Morton No , you do n't love me now , Edward , and it must be through some unconscious fault of mine ; but I have examined my conduct rigidly and I can not find that I have not always been the same to you , with this only difference : I love you more than ever . Edw . Edward Somers And what can lead you to suppose that my affection is failing ? Est . Estelle Morton Everything . Do your best to dissemble your indifference , there is an instinct in the heart which will not be deceived , Edward . Even while you listen to me now , your mind is elsewhere , love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but one  --  and I have done . Edw . Edward Somers Speak . Est . Estelle Morton Be careless as you will of concealing your coldness from me , but do not , oh , do not let my father see it . It would break his heart . In his presence , be attentive and affectionate as you once were . And then , when we shall be alone , if you do not speak to me , if you do not look on me , I will not ask a question , nor utter a complaint . I will even keep my own apartment and you may remain away from me in yours , provided my father is not allowed to know it and I to see his tears . Yes , I am strong enough for that . I am strong enough to bear anything , Edward , except to see my father 's tears . That I could never bear . Edw . Edward Somers Estelle , dearest Estelle , you know  --  you know I love you . Est . Estelle Morton Taking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say does not come from there  --  now , does it ?

Give me your pity and your pardon . There shall be a change , a mighty change , and suddenly . Est . Estelle Morton You appal me ! What 's the matter ? Edw . Edward Somers Nothing  --  nothing , at least , which you should wish to know . I have a sorrow here . Here let it rest unquestioned . Est .

Lucy Colvin Was not that Edward that went out ? Est . Estelle Morton It was . Lu . Lucy Colvin He seemed strangely discomposed  --  and bless me ! Your eyes are full of tears . Est . Estelle Morton Tears ? No , no . Tears ? What should bring tears into my eyes ? Lu . Lucy Colvin Why , girl , they are in your very voice . Do n't strive to suppress that sob  --  Est .

Estelle Morton Yes . Lu . Lucy Colvin Has he been false to you ? Est . Estelle Morton Yes , yes . Is it not horrible ? I , who loved him so ! He loves another . He loves a different person altogether from his Estelle . Lu . Lucy Colvin I ca n't believe it ! Est . Estelle Morton I 'm sure of it . Lu . Lucy Colvin What makes you think so ? Est . Estelle Morton Listen . He receives letters which he conceals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . He trembled as he read it and hurried it into his bosom  --  next his heart , Lucy ! Oh , you can form no imagination of what jealousy is ! It freezes up every gentler feeling , and  --  only to think of it !  --  prevents our seeing things even as we know they really are . Lu . Lucy Colvin And those letters ? Est . Estelle Morton I have noticed where he hides them ; for , twenty times  --  I am ashamed to own it to you , Lucy , but twenty times have I been upon the point  --  it would have been wrong , would n't it ? Lu . Lucy Colvin Where does he hide them , then ? Est . Estelle Morton In a secret drawer of the chiffonier in my boudoir . He puts them in a pocketbook where I am sure there are a great many , and he locks up the pocketbook in that drawer . Lu . Lucy Colvin And can you have a jealousy of that sort and not make sure whether you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? Lu . Lucy Colvin I can see but one way . Est .

Estelle Morton Taking a key from her bosom I have a second one of which he never knew . Indeed , I never thought of it myself until this affair happened , and then I would not name it to him , because he might guess my suspicions of the use he made of that drawer , which , if one ca n't help having , one can , at least , help exposing . Lu . Lucy Colvin Shall I go help you open it ? Est . Estelle Morton Oh , no , no ! If Edward were to come in and find us together ! Lu . Lucy Colvin Well , go by yourself , then . Est .

Est . Estelle Morton You 'll not tell , Lucy ? Oh , I feel how right you are . I am so wretched that I shall die if I do n't put an end to this uncertainty at once . And if I am doing what I ought not , I do n't mean any harm ; and , oh ! may the innocence of my intentions bring me pardon ! Lu . Lucy Colvin Courage . I 'll wait here . Be sure you bring them .
