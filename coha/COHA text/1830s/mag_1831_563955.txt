txt EXTRACT FROM THE JEWISH CONVERT . AN UNWRITTEN TALE . SooN after the occurrences related , and the final adjustment of them , and the more effectually to prevent all misrepresentations to the Roman authorities , it seemed advisable to me to go up to Jerusalem , and if possible to have a personal interview with the Roman governor , Pon .. tius Pilatus , whose general reputation for justice and probity was so far good , that I thought I might , with confidence , look for a favorable termination of the affair . Another motive , partly of interest and partly of curiosity , also influenced me . At no great distance from Jerusalem lived a family of our near kindred , being the children of my mother 's cousin . With this family in my boyish days we had considerable intimacy , which , for several years past had been broken up by the various calamities I have already described as having befallen our house , and my own absence so long from the country . They , too , had been visited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family had died , and there remained but two sisters and a brother , all unmarried , and living in reduced circumstances , though still with sufficient means of modest comforts . The father had taken an active part in some of the disturbances following the death of Herod the Great , which had been severely visited upon his property by the satellites of Roman authority . Having , however , made his peace , and procured his personal safety by the sacrifice of much of his wealth , he had , at length , withdrawn from the active business of the world to a small estate in the town of Bethany , where he remained until his death , undisturbed , save by the loss of some farther remnants of his property , which , fell a prey to the convulsions of the world around him . The brother and sisters , above referred to , as now the only survivers of the family , were nearly of my own age , and had been , more especially , my companions and playmates , in the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms with many hours of youthful pleasure , and scenes of past enjoyment . It was but natural , then , that when , after some years of stormy vicissitudes upon the sea of life , and after the loss of many much endeared to me by the ties of kindred or well-tried affection , I found myself again an inhabitant of my native land , and of the dwelling of my fathers ; wasted and desolate as it in some degree was , it was but natural , that I should look around me to discover the sources of happiness , and the means of gratifying the affections of our nature still within my reach , and while memory retraced the sunny steps of departed time , that a yearning should arise in my bosom to see again the friends in whose company they were trodden , now too , with but few exceptions , the nearest kindred remaining to me . Such was the source and nature of my interest ; my curiosity had a different origin . In making the inquiries which afforded me this knowledge of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the full understanding of which farther detail is necessary . In the early ages of our nation , we had been favored , above all others , with a direct communication with the Most High ; and rulers , // priests and judges , receiving their appointments especially from the manifestation of His will , had guided our affairs , and raised them to the summit of their glory . In later times , under a succession of monarchs , ascending the throne by hereditary right , or often usurping it by violence , and distinguished far more often for their evil , than for their good qualities , and for their wanton violation of our most sacred and holy laws , than by their concern for the welfare of their people , the intercourse with the Deity had been kept up through the medium of the prophets , men not possessing any temporal authority , but inspired by the wisdom of the Most High to rebuke the sins of the people , and of their rulers , to point out to them their wickedness , and to foretell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a consequence of persisting in the ways of ill-doing . As time passed on with but little er transient effect , these denunciations became darker and more gloomy , and the terrors that they threatened , were threatened as things that must inevitably come to pass , and from which there would be no escape ; while yet there was an ambiguity in the language in which they were conveyed , that , favored by the natural self-confidence of men in their own judgement , and the success of their own schemes , prevented their being applied by the rulers and the mass of the nation to their own times and actions , so that they pursued their course , heap .. ing crime upon crime , and preparing the way for the threatened wrath , till the beginning of preparation for the final catastrophe overtook them in the destruction of the national independence and sovereignty . After this time the race of the prophets ceased ; and though some transient gleams of prosperity , and even of temporary freedom for the most part from foreign domination , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merely human energies and virtues of men , that sprang up from time to time in the natural course of events , and who did and dared from patriotism and zeal for the purity of religion , without being favored by any special manifestation of Divine Will , or any direct interposition of Divine Power . Through all the fearful denunciations of the prophets , there still might be traced the vestiges of hope , a presage of future glory struggling through the clouds and storms of the moral world , as sun-beams throw their light through the tempests , that blacken and convulse the natural heavens . There was in many of them , from time to time , a promise held out of some one that was to arise , whose power should transcend any that had ever before appeared upon earth ,  --  and who was to rescue the people forever from the calamities brought upon them by their own sins , and those of their rulers ; *nd not only so , but who should extend his dominion over the whole earth . In some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence this deliverer should arise , was distinctly , though figuratively pointed out , and even allusions were made , though obscurely , to the time when he should am pear . It may readily be supposed from the circumstances above related as belonging to the history of our national career , that faith was not wanting to our people in expecting the fulfilment of this promise . On the contrary , it was ever present , an argument for impatience un* der the galling yoke of foreign servitude , and a perpetual stimulus to the fanatic to acts of desperate rebellion . Thus , in later days , from time to time a person would spring up , proclaiming that the appointed // time was come , and that he was the chosen instrument of the long expected deliverance . To one or another of these , thousands of the unthinking multitude had gathered themselves , and had been drawn into open defiance of the constituted authorities , in consequence of which they had perished miserably , with their self-deceived or deceiving leaders , by famine , or the sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them but scorn for their delusion , and hatred for its consequences . Shortly before the time of which I am now writing , another had appeared , professing also to be the glorious personage foretold by the prophets , but whose life and character , as far as I could learn it from those with whom I then conversed , formed a striking contrast , not only with the history of his predecessors in the career of seeking for popular favor , and the honor of being considered the deliverer of the nation , but , if possible , still more so with what was expected among the people of him , to whom this character should truly belong . With his early history my informants did not seem to be very well acquainted ; but I gathered from them that he was by birth of humble extraction , and a native of an obscure and poor village of Galilee , simple in his manners , and making no pretensions to any temporal authority , and countenancing no resistance to the established civil powers . The character in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the country , attended by a number of followers , the principal of whom were said to be a few poor fishermen of those who gained a humble living upon the shores of the lakes of Tiberias and Gennesareth . As convenience or pleasure dictated , he would stop at various places , and exhort the multitudes that soon assembled about him from curiosity or desire of instruction , warning them of their sins , and of the punishment to which they would bring them in a future state of being , and desiring them to repent , to believe in him , to lead holy lives , and assuring them , as a reward , of happiness that should await them in the same future state . He was said , also , to declare new and singular opinions concerning the Supreme Being , whose immediate messenger and authorized agent he professed to be , and whose especial power he asserted to be vested in himself ; and he was affirmed to make light of the authority of the laws of our religion , as inculcated by the priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were also reports of various things that he had done in confirmation of the truth of his profession , and in corroboration of his assumed authority , which , if correct , showed him to be possessed of powers beyond the natural endowment of man , and equally wonderful with those exercised by any of our ancient prophets . Such was the amount of the confused and imperfect accounts I then collected concerning this new teacher ; and , considering the remoteness of my situation and the errors to which popular reports are obnoxious , I afterwards wondered to find them so near the truth as they actually were . It was added , that , though bitterly opposed by the priests , the zealots of the law , and by many of the higher classes , and the pretenders to secular power , he had greatly conciliated to himself the favor of the middling and lower orders of the people , particularly those of simple and unambitious views , and that some , even among the titled and rulers of the land , were not averse to his doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arid his 1 ) eaceal ) Ie demeanor had suffered him to pass without ostensi* bly attracting the stern watchfulness of our foreign rulers , and even , from default of reasonable grounds of offence , saved him from the well attested malignity of the priests and zealots , which yet watched eagerly for the commission of something which might serve as a pretence for his destruction . Among those , who had either become converted to his views or attached to his person , or perhaps both , my cousins were numbered ; and , it was said , that they evinced even more than common reverence and affection for him . Of the truth of this I was anxious to know , and , if I found it true , to ascertain the meaning and extent of this , as I then deemed it , singular and dangerous delusion , and by what means it was brought about . Such was the source of my curiosity . Though brought up from my earliest youth with an habitual reverence for our holy law , and with a firm belief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigot . My wanderings had taught me that many discrepancies of opinion concerning certain points of it were to be found even in our own race , especially among those whose home was not in the inheritance of the sons of Jacob . They had also led me into much and close intercourse with many of the heathen nations , more especially the Greeks and Romans ; and , though I could not but both despise and abhor their impious idolatry , and the obscene and abominable rites that made a part of it , yet I found among the worshipers by no means a corresponding destitution of those qualities , that constitute moral excellence . I found , among the votaries of Jupiter or Apis , many , whose virtue and kindness would have done credit to a purer and more holy religion , and I learned , that sincerity and truth were of higher importance than adherence to ceremonials . Yet I could not feel altogether unconcerned at hearing of the credence my kindred were said to have given to the author of the new doctrine , which seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fathers ; and was yet in hopes to find the reports exaggerated , or to be able , by renewing our old friendship , to exert an influence that might counteract any bias of mischievous tendency in their minds . Having accordingly made a few necessary preparations , I set out on my journey ; but learning on my way from a public messenger whom I accidentally encountered , that Pilatus had withdrawn himself from the city for a few days of relaxation from the fatigues of business , I determined to spend the interval of time before his expected return , in making my intended visit . Turning aside , therefore , from the direct road to the city , I took an unfrequented route across the country , which , at the close of the next day brought me to the dwelling of my kinsman . On entering the court of the house , I heard sounds of lamentation from within , that told me of the presence of some new calamity , probably of the death of one of the inmates . This was soon confirmed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made myself known , but who , though familiar to me in former days , had much difficulty in recognizing me . The news was indeed afflicting ; the death that had happened was that of my kinsman himself who had expired a few // days before , after a short and severe illness , and whose body had that day been deposited in the sepulchre . Inured , as I was , to suffering and affliction , my sorrow was great , and naturally increased by the thought of the recentness of the event ; at the very time , too , when my mind was busy in contemplating the pleasure of our expected meeting , and looking forward to a renewal of our ancient friendship . A week , or too sooner , and I should have found him in health ; and , so slight are the circumstances by which the changes of human affairs are connected , our meeting , by affecting a change in the current of his thoughts , in the routine of his occupations , or in particular circumstances of exposure , might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not have taken place . How momentous a change that event was destined to produce in myself it did not occur to me to contemplate , nor even if it had , would the reality ever have occurred to my wildest imaginations . The idea of meeting again for the first time , in this , the moment of their great bereavement , the sisters to whom I had been so long a stranger , was very painful . It would awaken with additional force the remembrance of past sorrows , and make them doubly poignant by the present anguish . It might , however , after the first awakening of these feelings , be the means of some solace , as they would naturally want some one for a protector and friend , an office which belonged now to me , as the only near male relation that the Divine Will had spared to them . The particulars of this first meeting it is unnecessary to relate ; it was indeed , as I had expected , fraught with much of painful excitement and remembrance . When , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a calmer state , and I had leisure to contemplate my kinswomen , I noticed considerable alteration in their appearance .. When I last saw them , they were arrayed in the buoyant graces of youth , which had now given place to the more mature and less ob-* trusive beauties of perfect womanhood . The trials they had undergone , had given a pensive cast of expression to their countenauces , but what struck me as most unusual , was the calmness of sorrow which marked their present demeanor , very different from that often displayed upon similar occasions by our Jewish women . It seemed as if some latent and undefined hope still lingered in their bosoms , though their words gave it not utterance ; or , as if some internal source of tranquillity breathed its balm over the wounds of their affliction , and afforded a solace ordinarily denied . In endeavoring to account to myself for this , I was led to connect it with what I had heard of the doctrines of the new Teacher , and of the belief they were said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the false impressions under which I supposed them to labor , with perhaps a mingled feeling of contempt for their weakness , yet I could not but own , that , so far as concerned their own feelings , the effect was happy . It , however , increased my desire to know more of the matter , while the circumstances of their situation rendered it proper for me , fi*r a while , to repress my curiosity , which , however , it was appointed should soon receive an unexpected gratification . On the fourth day after my arrival , while sitting with the sisters in company with a number of their friends and relations , who had come ) 641 // according to custom , to pay a visit of condolence , one of the sisters left the room , as was supposed for some domestic purpose . Her pro . longed stay , however , after a time , excited our curiosity , and in some degree occasioned uneasiness , when she suddenly entered , as if from a walk and flushed with exercise . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , an illumination of the eye , and an excitement that betokened more than the mere use of the corporeal powers ; her feelings were evidently awakened in no common manner , though the briefness of the time , and the rapidity of her movements did not permit nie to analyze the nature of her emotion , farther than that it did not appear to be either of grief or anger . Hastily approaching her sister , she stooped down , naid uttered a few quick words in a low voice . The sister started with a brief suppressed exclamation , and , hastily rising , they left the room together , with out making any apology , or appearing to notice the presence of their guests , otherwise than by the low tone of the words that passed between them , which seemed not to be meant for general hearing . The company at their abrupt departure arose also , one of them remarking , that the sisters were , doubtless , going to visit the tomb of their brother , there to give vent to their sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamentations and tears with theirs . To me , however , from the observations I had made upon the demeanor of the sister who had been absent , this did not appear to be a true explanation of their conduct ; and , moreover , being seated the nearest to them of any one present , I had caught the words that she uttered , which were merely , " The Master is come , and asketh for thee ; " and the exclamation , that was uttered by her to whom they were spoken , was an expression of mingled pleasure and surprise . My curiosity , however , readily led me to comply with the proposal just mentioned , and we hastily followed at a small distance behind the sisters , who passed with a quick and hurried step from the house to the highway running near it , along which they pursued their course . Proceeding for a little more than a furlong , we came to a glen opening to the road , at a little distance within which , under the shade of an aged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing . This collection was composed of persons of both sexes , and many of them seemed the ordinary inhabitants of that part of the country , mostly peasants , with , however , some of higher standing in society mingled with them . As our party approached , the crowd opened a little on the side nearest to us , and disclosed a smaller party , that seemed to form , as it were , a centre of attraction to the others , and directly towards this , the sisters bent their way with increased rapidity . As this central group became visible by the movement of the surrounding multitude , I glanced my eye among our own party to discover if they comprehended the meaning of it . That they did , was evident from the instantaneous change of their countenances , though the effect was widely different upon different individuals . On some , were visibly portrayed the expressions of surprise and gladness , on others , of vexation and anger ; others showed merely looks of euriosi* ty , or unconcern , while a few , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the broad hem of their outer tunic , as belorging to the sect of the Pharisees , contracted their // brows , and with dilated nostrils , as if in the presence of some object both of fear and detestation , looked at each other , and threw towards the group above described glances expressive of deep hate and deadly malignity . The truth instantly flashed upon my mind ; this was the Teacher of whom I have spoken , and his arrival it was , that was announced by my kinswoman as the coming of " the Master . " My attention was immediately directed to the group , which was now near enough to afford me a distinct survey of the persons of whom it was composed . The principal of these were hard-featured men mostly of middle age , in the coarse dress of the lower class of peasaiil* , and which bore evident marks of recent travel . All they had to distinguish them from any other collection of men of a similar class , was an air of superior intelligence and wisdom , while their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love , were , for the most part , earnestly fixed upon one , who stood in the open centre of them , and who was evidently regarded by them as their leader . No second glance was required to confirm this impression , for nothing could be more dissimilar among men in external appearance , than was that of this person compared with that of his followers . This difference was not by any means in merely outward habiliments , for his dress , though neat , was unaffectedly simple and plain , and , like that of his companions , showed that he was a way-farer . So perfect a form , so noble and lovely features , had never before met my eyes . I had gazed upon the symmetrical figures and beautiful countenances of the Greeks , even when carried to what was deemed a faultless exemplification in the statues of their false gods . I had seen the finest specimens of the human race , from every known country under the heavens ; but they were but human . The eye , and the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , of its hopes , and its passions ; even the contour of the frame , in its different varieties , told of its fitness for the various exertions and graces of the world , and much as artists had labored , and successful as they had thought themselves in eradicating this expression from the representations of their divinities , memory brought its existence to my mind , in contrast with what I now saw , as but too apparent . The form of the countenance upon which I looked , was in its outline decidedly Jewish , but its unrivalled features bore no traces of the weakness of humanity , of its earthly desires , or its base or stormy passions . The full deep eye was of hazel , tinged with gray , and its glance , while piercing as an eagle 's , was tender as that of a dove . It spoke of unerring penetration , wisdom and knowledge , and unconquerable fortitude , with mildness and patience that no provocation could excite to anger ; all that could be conceived of benignity and love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while these two features harmonized with each other , and with the rest of the face , in a manner the most perfect , yet the general expression was that of pensiveness , untinged , however , with aught of melancholy . Corresponding with these traits was the character of the body and limbs . The eye could rest upon no faulty proportion , no want of harmony between the parts or in the whole , but no idea rose upon the mind of any peculiar adaptation , whether for feats of grace , agility or strength , // single or combined . Its whole character at rest was that of calm and beautiful repose , and when moving that of simple , easy and unlabored motion , as if , though upon the earth and in an earthly form , it belonged not to it . Such is the result and analysis of the impressions then made upon my mind by the singular being before me , whose image , as it then appeared , even to the minutest detail of form and feature , remains on my mental vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had been engraven on adamant . To examine then , as I have now , the nature of its excellence i*a , s not in my power , nor was time allowed for more than a brief and almost instantaneous survey ; for that one of my kinswomen , who had been summoned , as I have related , arriving within the group , and springing with a convulsive effort towards the Teacher , threw herself at his feet , and embraced his knees ere he could prevent , while her hitherto subdued feelings burst forth in one passionate and fervent exclamation , " Master , hadst thou been here , my brother had not died . " Sobs and tears prevented her farther utterance . The effect of this scene upon the feelings of those around was instantaneous ; the females broke forth into loud lamentations , and many of the men were affected even to tears and sobbing ; the very pride and supercilious malignity of the Pharisees , seemed softened down to compassion , as they witnessed the grief and unavailing confidence of the mourner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my emotions so far overcame me , that I became a mere passive spectator , regarding with intense interest what was passing before me . The Teacher , with a look of the utmost tenderness and compassion , and with unspeakable grace of manner , raised the mourner from the ground , and supported her , till the first inexpressible agony of feeling was over , but as he listened to her sobs and the lamentations of the multitude , and saw the weeping faces around him , his own emotions became strong within him ; more than once , he sighed deeply , and tears fell plentifully from his eyes . This did not escape the notice of those about him , some of whom I overheard remarking upon it as an evidence of his love for the deceased , while others wondered that he who possessed such power , that he could restore sight to the blind , should not have exerted it to prevent the death of one , the loss of whom seemed so deeply to affect him . After a few moments , when greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters where the body of their brother was deposited , and was answered by an invitation to visit the sepulchre . He assented , and they immediately led him thither , followed by all present . The tomb was in a valley situated at a small distance , and vonsisted of a cave , hollowed in a rock at the foot of a range of hills ; immediately above it grew a gigantic wild fig-tree , and its entrance was closed by a large stone , rolled directly against the aperture . When we arrived there , the Teacher directed that the stone should be removed . Against this , one of the sisters remonstrated , stating that four days had already elapsed since the burial , and that considerable decay must already have taken place in the body , which would render the air of the cave offensive , if not injurious . The reply was brief and energetic , though spoken with great mildness and majesty of manner " Said I not unto thee , that if thea wouldst believe , thou shouldst // see the glory of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rolled away the stone , so as to leave the entrance clear . While they were doing this , the Teacher stood with his face bowed , as if in silent prayer . Looking around me to observe the apparent feelings of those present , I encountered a similar , though not the same , diversity of expression with that I had before noticed , when we first approached the assemblage under the sycamore . The prevailing sentiment that appeared was that of wonder and curiosity , blended in some with anxiety , and in others with confidence ; in the faces of the Pharisees , it was attempted to be veiled , under an air of indifference and contempt . When the obstruction to the entrance had been completely removed , the Teacher lifted up his eyes , while his whole countenance lighted up and became almost effulgent with joy and beneficence , as he said aloud in a clear harmonious voice , with his looks upraised to heaven , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me . I know , indeed , that thou hearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , I speak , that they may believe that thou hast sent me . " Having thus spoken , he advanced towards the mouth of the cave , and in a loud , calm tone , as of assured authority , said , " Lazarus come forth ! " At these words , a sudden start and tremor pervaded the whole multitude , followed by a death-like stillness , as all held their breath in astonishment and fear , and gazed with intense earnestness upon the dark portal of the chamber of death . Immediately a slight rustling noise was heard within the tomb , and in an instant after issued forth one arrayed as a corpse , moving with difficulty , his hands and feet being bound together , though loosely , and his face covered with a napkin . At this sight , shrieks of terror and shouts of astonishment burst from the multitude ; and many , through fear , covered their faces with their hands , as if to shut out the sight of a supernatural visitant . The Teacher , however , waved his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , and addressing himself to the kindred who stood nearest , said gently , " Unbind him , and let him depart . " The bandages were hastily removed , and when the napkin was taken off , that covered the face , I readily recognized the lineaments of my kinsman , wasted and haggard indeed , as of one who had suffered the pangs of dissolution , but with a brightness of eye , and a returning color to his lip , as he inhaled the free air of heaven , that proclaimed that life was now strong within him . We forthwith accompanied him home , followed by many of the people , even to the very gates , but without the Teacher , the author of this stupendous wonder , who , resisting the earnest intreaties of the sisters , departed another way with his disciples , saying briefly , that he would see them shortly , and bidding them give to God their thanks , and their praises , for what had been done in their behalf . S. // LITERARY PORTRAITS* NO . II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large printing establishment in one of the most crowded streets in New-York , distracted by the countless duties and vexations to which the editor of a daily paper is exposed , and encompassed by the most unpoetical sights and sounds , the author of Thanatopsis may be seen , during the business hours of the day , by any of his admirers . He is a man , rather under the middle size than otherwise , with bright blue eyes and an ample forehead , but not very distinguished either in face or person . His manners are quiet and unassuming , and marked with a slight dash of diffidence ; and his conversation ( when he does converse , for he is more used to thinking than talking ) is remarkably free from pretension , and is characterized by good sense rather than genius . Would that Mr. Bryant was employed in writing poetry in the aforesaid room , and sending back his thoughts to the streams and mountains which his young eyes were familiar with , and from which he drank his first inspiration ! But alas ! he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is writing is as little like poetry , as General Jackson is like Apollo . He is scrawling political paragraphs , and these , by no means favorable specimens of that kind of composition , with the same hand that wrote the " Lines to a Waterfowl . " He is burning incense to strange gods , to idols which the hands of men have fashioned , and offers no longer to Nature , upon her mountain altars , a sacrifice of song . The stillness , majesty , and repose of the outward world seem to have lost their old charm ; he is in love with the vulgar excitements , the senseless uproar and the empty triumphs of the solemn farce of politics , and delights to be elbowed and jostled in the worid 's great thoroughfare , and to breathe the hot atmosphere of party strife . The eyes of the muses are yet red with weeping at the apostacy of their favorite son , and they are calling him back to their arms , with an invocation , like that of the shepherd in Virgil ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Bryant has been placed by common consent at the head of the list of American poets ; and in all matters which concern any of the *original instincts of humanity , of which the love of poetry is one , the decision of the majority is pretty sure to be correct . We are not disposed to enter our protest against it , but would even go a little farther , and claim for him a high rank among the living writers of English verse . And as he has not written a great deal , and as what he has , has been of the same character , it follows that he must have reached very great excellence in that department to which he has principally confined himself . Poets may be divided into three classes ; those who describe Nature , those who delineate men and manners , and those who draw their materials from the contemplation of both .
