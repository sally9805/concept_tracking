txt IT is with unmingled pain , that we have felt ourselves authorised to take up such a subject in a New-England magazine . But the events of the few past months are too fresh in the recollection of every one to need any explanation of the propriety of selecting this as a topic of animadversion . It is not , however , because in one place property may have been destroyed , and in another life may have been sacrificed , that we have selected this subject at the present time . It is the spirit which prompted the springs of action , which caused these disgraceful outbreakings of unbridled passion , rather than the destruction of property or life , which calls for the united reprehension of every friend of his country . For the base and dastardly attack upon the defenceless tenants of the Charlestown Convent , we have no terms in which to express our abhorrence and disgust . It has fixed upon New-England a stain which the lustre of all her achievements and her institutions can never obliterate . But we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riots which have been witnessed in Philadelphia and New-York , for any other purpose than to illustrate the wide extent of that ungovernable spirit among certain portions of the people , which , if it be not checked , will work certain destruction to our constitution and our liberties . It is , indeed , idle to talk of liberty and the security of property , or character , or life , if they are to be made the sport of infuriated mobs . If , whenever a subject of popular excitement arises , the expression of opinions upon the one side or the other , is to be suppressed by a fear of popular violence , it is an abuse of terms to say that there is any freedom of opinion left . The government , in fact , ceases to be free , and a despotism far more cruel and absolute than that of an autocrat , enslaves the public mind ,  --  the despotism of madmen , rioting in their combined strength , and reveling in the indulgence of our heated and malignant passions . If ever our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government seized by the strong arm of one man , it will be , like France after the storm of the Revolution , to escape from the licentious misrule of anarchy , to which the spirit which excites and sustains the ravages of a mob , almost irresistibly tends . It becomes , therefore , a question of deep moment , to know what remedy may be applied to check this alarming spirit in our land ; and in order to do this we must first detect its origin and the cause of its prevalence . It would be of little use to rebuild what a mob has destroyed , if there is no means to protect it from destruction . We may again rear the walls of the demolished church , but the voice of eloquence must be hushed within it , if a censorship of violence and outrage is to govern the opinions which may be uttered there . It is in vain that we make laws , giving a right of suffrage and securing the freedom of speech , if the one is to be exercised at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gangs of ruffians and outlaws . While we boast of // our being freemen , we shall find that our only liberty consists in thinking with the unthinking mass , and our boasted franchise of electing our own rulers , will be but to register the selfish decrees of the leaders of the populace . The primary causes of mobs and riots in this country , are more numerous and more deeply laid than many might , at first , suppose . Men see an African church rifled , or a meeting upon slavery broken up , and think they have discovered the cause of this in an accidental and temporary excitement upon one disquieting subject . They see a convent burnt , and its inmates escaping at midnight from its flames , and they seek no farther for the reasons of this outrage than the unpopularity of the Catholic faith . They see violence and bloodshed at the polls of our cities , and lament that the short-lived excitement of an election should lead to such disgraceful excesses . But these are not the moving causes of such scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fire the trains of combustible materials which are spread through our land , ever ready to blaze arid explode when the mass is ignited . One of the greatest causes , or rather the medium by which other causes are made effectual in producing that excited state of feeling which vents itself in riots and public outrage , is the frequency of our popular elections . The evils arising from these are , in a measure , inherent in our system of government ; and , as the freedom and frequency of elections are among the last rights which a people should surrender , we have referred to them here , that , while ' we alluded to some of the evils which have grown out of popular elections , some means might be devised whereby they may be corrected . By the genius of our government , elections were designed as a means of selecting the most proper agents to administer its restraints and extend its protection . But , as they are now managed , they are , too often , the strifes between leaders whose ambitious views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices and by arraying the jealousies and bad passions of one part of the community against the other  --  a contest in which the spoils of office are won by the few by adulation , and falsehood and flattery to the many . The corruption , which has crept thus early into our elections , calls loudly upon the people to arrest it . They should know and feel , that the preservation of their liberties depends upon the preservation and exercise of their constitutional government in its purity and vigor : while the theory of every republican form of government is that the people , if left to themselves , will , in the end , do right , the very necessity of any government over them is based upon the idea , that the people will sometimes do wrong , that checks and balances to popular power are wanting to save the people from the consequences of their undue excitement or misguided zeal . It is designed thereby to interpose a barrier which , by staying the effects of popular phrenzy , may give time for reason and judgement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , appeals to the passions of the people to correct a supposed evil , or promote a supposed good by the exercise of physical power , in a manner not recognized by our constitution and our laws , is doing violence to the cause of national liberty . That // ruler is a traitor to his trust , who seeks to trample upon the constitution by substituting the heated passions of the multitude for the ivellknown principles of that instrument . If these views are not wholly erroneous , no man can , for a moment , countenance a mob , however honest may be the zeal or however meritorious may be the purpose of those who may enga0e in it , for it strikes alike at the stability of our government and the preservation of our liberties . The frequency and freedom of our elections are , however , as we have already said , rather the medium through which the really exciting causes of mobs operate , than exciting causes themselves and if these could be removed , we should have little grounds to fear a recurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of popular excitements , the most immediate agent in driving them to excesses , is the use of intoxicating drinks . No riot is perpetrated without them . The sale and use of ardent spirits has been the greatest curse that ever visited our land . It has produced more crime , more misery , and more misrule , than all other causes together . Wherever there are mobs , they may he traced directly or indirectly to those **26;879;TOOLONG either the rioters are plied with ardent spirit , which is drunk at their counters , or carried away to influence the otherwise harmless crowd into a band of furious madmen . We have it from eye-witnesses , that , in the late riots of Philadelphia and New-York , ardent spirit was freely distributed among those who took part in them , and the consequences were such as we might have anticipated , such as have made freemen blush for their country . While rum is sold at every corner under the sanction of a license by law , while elections are more or less managed and controled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to secure the influence of rum-sellers and rum-drinkers , will countenance what they know to be a national evil as well as a moral wrong , we may expect to see riots , we may expect to see the outbreakings of the passions of madmen , we may expect to see elections disgraced by scenes like those in Philadelphia and New-York , and quiet citizens driven fromn* the polls , and sacrificing to personal safety , one of the most valuable rights , which our fathers won with their bbod . Connected with the cause just alluded to , is the influx of foreigners into our country . Our cities and towns swarm with this class of population . They come here ( we speak of the mass , for there are many eminent and honorable exceptions ) ignorant and poor , without a knowledge of our institutions , that should make them prize them , and without any of that self respect , which might restrain an indulgence in vicious courses . However honest in their purposes , they are proverbially creatures of passion , and , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their poverty and their propensity to drink to excess , they become a most dangerous engine in the hands of designing and bad men , to overawe and control our native citizens . Thousands of them have fled , from starvation , to this , as a Jand of plenty ; and , give them wherewithal to enjoy the comforts of animal existence , little do they care whether the man who rules them rides into office over the necks of a prostrate people , or rises by his own // merit and the free suifrages of his fe11o*v-citizens , to office and to honor . It is such men as these , whom we might look for in the riots and mobs , which disturb our city elections ; and we need not add , that it is such men as these that have formed an essential part of every such mob that has disgraced our country . We would have our country an asylum for the oppressed of every nation . But God , in his mercy , avert the day , when our elections are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rum and whisky ! We can not , when seeking out the causes of popular outrages in our country , * by the condition of the public press . This engine of good , this lever , more powerful than that by which Archimedes would have moved the world , may become in bad hands and in a bad cause , an engine of immeasurable evil . Here every party in politics and every sect in religion and irreligion , has its newspaper in which its own errors and corruption are concealed or unblushingly denied , while every thing opposed to them is denounced or held up to ridicule . The press has become the organ of party discipline and political rancor , ( we speak of the partisan press , ) and the libeler of private character , the foe to good order and good government , and the false-hearted demagogues find here a vehicle by which to scatter their poisons through the community , corrupting the public mind and sapping the foundations of public morals . How can it be expected that the rights of property will be respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant and unreflecting classes , when candidates for the highest offices , and the managers of the public press , hold character and reputation of so little worth ? Why should we be surprised that elections are carried by brute force , when appeals to the brute passions of men are so undisguisedly made ? But we hasten to the cause of this condition of the press  --  the universal spirit of party which prevails through our country . It taints and poisons every thing . No conduct however base , no doctrine however odious , no course of policy however dangerous in its character , that does not find supporters , if it can , by any means , be brought into alliance with some party movement . Under a government like ours , it would be idle to expect to live without parties . Where people have the right to think and speak , they will exercise this right , and differences and disputes will , of necessity , thence arise . And while these disputes are confined to legitimate objects , while parties divide upon questions of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public rights . But when these divisions become a mere scramble for office , a mere partisan war for spoils , the many become the mercenaries of the few , and this spirit becomes one of the sorest evils which can afflict a community . It matters little in such cases , upon what point the rival factions split . In any event man becomes degraded in the struggle , and the people unwittingly are forging chains for themselves to wear . We enter no list as partisans in the struggle which has been of late going on under the banners of party in our country ; but we are not so blind as to overlook the means by which success is sought to be attained . We , every day , hear doctrines openly advocated , which strike // at the foundations of every thing which renders society valuable . We hear , from time to time , from the highest officers of our government , principles proclaimed which , if they could be carried into effect , would destroy all law , and resolve society again into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , by promoting a union of sentiment and an attachment to our admirable institutions , it has been the study of too many to foment jealousies and excite animosities between citizens of a common country , enjoying common rights and common benefits . We are told of distinctions in society , and that these ought not to be tolerated . The cry is up against the bug-bear " Aristocracy , " and an epithet which , under other governments , has its well-defined meaning , is here made a term of unfounded reproach . The flatterers of the people have been raising a war against wealth , and every idle knave , who is too proud to labor , and too poor to live honestly without industry , is ready to join in the crusade . By the creed of modern reform " there is a natural hostility of the poor towards the rich , " and he , whose industry and frugality may have placed him above want , is branded with the modern epithet of political jargon , as an " accumulator , " and is denounced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like these in our public newspapers , in popular harangues , and in all political meetings , the public mind necessarily becomes corrupt ; men are willing to engage , without reflection , in any enterprise however desperate , if directed against a class in society whom they have been taught to envy and to dread . The mobs which we have seen are but the precursors of more general outrages , if this doctrine of hostility towards every man , who is above the condition of a beggar , is to prevail . If our laws will not protect property as well as life and reputation , they can not and ought not to be sustained . Men , who fan the flame of discord between what they choose to call the higher and lower classes , know full well how false and deceptive are the appeals which they make to the people . They know that a physical equality among men can not be attained  --  the shrewd man will acquire property more rapidly than a less astute one , upon the same principle , that a strong man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeble one . But they know that laws can not be more free than are our own if they are strong enough to bind society together . These men play upon the passions , the weakness , and ignorance of a portion of their fellow-citizens , not to make them happier or more independent , but to raise themselves into an unenviable distinction . We , every day , hear of a working-man 's party  --  a working-man 's party ! as if the idlers in the country were so strong as to require a combination of working-men to put them down ! And who are the leaders of this party ? who its candidates for office ? A worn-out lawyer , who knows no more of manual labor than of Symmes 's inner world . Another living upon his patrimonial estate , and one of the very few in this commonwealth who is able to do it , who neither knows nor cares for the laboring poor . We might enlarge the catalogue , but it would be only to repeat the same inconsistencies between profession and practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course we had proposed to ourselves , from the attempt which has been made to ideatify // that reckless and outrageous project of Agrarian equality of property , with the party called the " Working-men's. " if they could see the atrocity of this doctrine in its true colors , not an honest man among them would countenance it for a moment . It is a doctrine for mobs , for cut-throats , and for demagogues ; but if ' it ever prevails , the mad scene of anarchy which would follow , would be but the first step towards a despotism as absolute as ever enslaved man . The feeling to which we have alluded , which has been excited between one class and another in the community , has spread wider than many might at first imagine . It shows itself in various forms and guises . But whether it is preached by Fanny Wright in her unhallowed tirades , or is made the hobby for some unprincipled knave to ride upon into power , it ought to be frowned down by every one who would not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgrace to her sex , which we have just written , recalls another increasing cause of mobs and crimes of every sort-the spread of infidelity . We wage no war with men 's honest opinions ; but when we hear the laws of marriage denounced as monopolies not to be tolerated , and the right of property openly denied ,  --  *I*en we hear the Christian religion ridiculed and treated as a fable , and its sanctions disregarded , we feel as if no honest man should hold his peace . What are the sanctions of civil laws , if all accountability as moral agents is removed from those for whom they are made ? What shall check the hand of the midnight assassin , or the wildest excesses of a mob ? or , in short , the commission of every crime , if there is no restraint but the fear of a detection by a human tribunal ' ! If life may thus be sacrificed , if reputation is but a bubble , as worthless as it is frail , if the fruits of one 's industry may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious , if he can no longer feel that his widow in her age , or his children in their weakness , may not , when he is gone , enjoy that for which he has toiled , it would be mockery to talk to him of liberty and right ,  --  his only liberty would be that of the savage-his only right that of the prowling wolf . We have written at greater length than we had intended upon this part of our subject , and yet , have scarce touched upon it . Illustrations from history will crowd upon the mind of every one who may read this , but our limits will not admit of our adverting to even the most obvious of them . Whenever a man is called upon to join with any party or class , to break through the proper restraints of the law , to undermine the great principles of right and wrong , upon which society alone can rest , he should pause and look to the consequences before he acts . He should remember that the same spirit which triumphs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may reek itself to-morrow upon him or his property . We can not dismiss this subject without one remark upon the measures of ' that class of men who , under the name of Abolitionists , have undertaken to give freedom to the slaves in our country . They complain , and justly , of mobs and riots . But do they not in reality ride over the constitution and the laws to reach their end , as much as the multitudes who have disturbed their meetings ? They preach freedom to the captive , and at what price is it to be given ? By // violating the compact which binds the Union together-by destroying , at a blow , six hundred millions of what the law regards as property , and , at best , substituting the evils of poverty , vice , and wretchedness for those of servitude . We are , by no means , advocates for slavery . We view it as one of the most dreadful scourges which ever afflicted a nation ,  --  dreadful alike to master and to slave . We would rejoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any feasible method by which to break the chains of the oppressor and let the oppressed go free . But the measures of the abolitionists do not seem to promise this result . Their appeals to the people of the North can do little more than rivet still stronger , the fetters of the slaves at the South , unless they are ready to break down at once the bulwark of our liberties ,  --  the constitution ,  --  and thereby bring us all under the yoke of some despot , in order that those who are now slaves may be called free . Such appeals as we often hear upon this subject are , in the present feverish state of the public mind , dangerous in no small degree . It is , in fact , a project in which the mass of the people are called upon to substitute the dictates of their own feelings , for the laws which exist . And , whether this is done to free a slave , to tear down a chapel , to burn down a convent , or to drive decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the distinctions which exist in society , or to break down pretended monopolies ,  --  to give questionable freedom to one class or rivet the chains of despotism upon another , it is alike to be dreaded and alike to be condemned . We would not be misunderstood . We admit , and would be the last to give up , the right of the people to make known their wants , to discuss freely , and at all times , measures of policy and whatever else concerns them . They have a right to spread their complaints and their grievances before the public , and to proclaim abuses throughout the land ,  --  and they have a right , too , to a full and ample redress for all these . But they have already chosen their own mode of redress ; they have fixed by their constitutions and their laws the terms of their mutual compact , by which they are to test their rights and to seek their remedies . The causes of public disturbances upon which we have dwelt so long , are alarming , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the laws of the land the heated action of unrefiecting masses . We know that the doctrines we have advanced may not meet the sanction of sycophants and demagogues . But , the history of many a nation would bear melancholy testimony to their truth . Our government has no guards about it but the moral integrity of the people , and when this shall be corrupted the citadel must yield . No man can shut his eyes to the danger that assails us in this quarter , and no man should hold his peace till the danger has passed away .

Yet Sampson was so tempted ; and he had an excellent strength : yet was Solomon so seduced ; and he had a very good Wit . Love 's Labor Lost . M* juvenile philosophy was entirely opposed to the tender passion ; my first lesson in self-knowledge resulted in the axiom that love could never conquer a heart which held it in such supreme contempt . I resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end was perpetually sneering at those who had been ensnared in the toils of Sir Cupid , and it became the leading principle of my life to guard against the machinations of the fair deceivers , who I imagined were constantly prowling about in quest of pretty fellows like myself . I will be fire-proof and water-proof , thought I ; sighs shall not consume , nor shall tears wash away my fixed determination . I will be unsuscepttble and invincible . Armed with this tremendous moral power , I gloried in exposure to imminent danger , and became decidedly un komme galant . I braved peril and resisted the devices of Satan like a hero ; amused myself with the follies of the fickle fair , and chuckled over the false notions which I gave them of my own character . Being somewhat puppyishly disposed , and willing to earn a reputation by means which I secretly despised , I treated the sex with easy familiarity , and soon had the satisfaction to enjoy among them the reputation of being an impudent dog . The more sensible were taught to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to give utterance to nothing which bore the most distant affinity to sober sense . My conversation teemed with fulsome flattery , most mendacious compliments , and , withal , an unbridled levity and conceit . This style I perceived to he well attempered to the taste of the vulgar mass , ( with whom I passed for " a very pleasant fellow , " ) although exceedingly disgusting to the cultivated and refined-so that , while the majority mistook my nonsense for wit , it followed , of course , that the truly sensible wrote me down a fool . Some persons may wonder why I never endeavored to undeceive those who imbibed such uncomfortable notions of my character . The reason is easily given ; for , apart from my indifference to female opinion , I felt that the notice of the wise , would withdraw from me the favor of the foolish , and I was by no means willing to relinquish my popularity in that quarter . A sensible man who plays the fool may attain an exalted rank in the great empire of folly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an humble citizen in the republic of wisdom . Two years had elapsed since the discovery of the aforesaid axiom , and the formation of its guardian principle , ( for even axioms are prone to prove false in love affairs ) two years had elapsed , and I had manfully withstood all the artillery of the sex , and begun to consider myself safely seated in the saddle of celibacy for life , when an accident happened which put to flight the idle and happy dream . The axiom did prove false , and the stern principle was swept away before the charms of the adorable Grace Ashley . This heavenly creature was none of the common-place beauties of ihe day-her person was not her chief attraction-there was nothing of display to strike dumb with admiration  --  but she was all modesty , gentleness , and sensibility  --  to be loved in proportion as she was known-one of those whom it is most dangerous to love ; for the heart which is truly , entirely gained by slow degrees , will break ere it yield up its idol . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought seriously of being in love , and had it not been that 1 was in some degree forced into her society , the passion would never have had birth . When my philosophy began , gradually but steadily , to crumble away , I made up my mind to bear the mishap with a good grace ; and notwithstanding an occasional blush of remorse , soon succeeded in persuading myself that nothing upon earth was half so pleasant as the connubial state . I committed a grand error at the outset of my acquaintance with Miss Ashley-notwithstanding the superior cast of her mind , 1 neglected to amend my manner towards her , and could perceive that she occasionally felt offended at the license of my tongue ; but that discovery made no impression . Nonsense ! thought I. She s beautiful ; and therefore to be wooed : She is a woman ; therefore to be won . Ay  --  and where can you show me sounder logic than this ? To be sure , notl*ing is said about the means , but the divine bard certainly meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , in the confidence of conceit , I began to consider what the world would say of my marriage , and what sort of a Benedict I should make . My passion grew apace . I courted the society of its object with increased assiduity , and , gentle reader , I need not tell you , if you have ever been in love , that I always parted with her with increasing reluctance . Matters were approaching a crisis-my attentions became marked-my heart grew as soft as C s head-it was evident that the man of honor , and the true lover , could not defer much longer those interesting proposals which so frequently jeopard the happiness of life . The lovely Grace was intimately acquainted with my friend Mrs. Ridgely in Washington-Square ,  --  a lady of most agreeable qualities , and one of the very select few who could properly appreciate my modest worth . At her house I first became acquainted with Miss Ashley , and it was there that my passion had birth and acquired strength-indeed , I may say that I fell in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of Mrs. Ridgely prepared . By // the way , that was excellent tea  --  but I am traveling out of the record . Twice had it been my fortune to accompany Miss Ashley home , after these delightful tea-drinks . How enraptured was my poor heart when that round little arm ( and I could not help , fancying it very white also ) was passed through mine , and I found myself slowly pacing down Broadway , beneath a clear winter sky . How earnestly did I direct her gaze to the bright constellations above us , and how exhaustless and silly were my starlit rhapsodies ! As the time drew near , when the important declaration was to be made , . I became less confident of success , and took the trouble to appear more like a rational being . The time was fixed upon . I was to meet her at Mrs. Ridgely 's , and to declare my passion as we returned home under the before-mentioned starlight . On that occasion I spent two hours and a half before the glass , in imparting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a palpitating heart , hastened to the dreaded interview . After expressing a proper degree of surprise at again meeting with Miss Ashley , I seated myself beside her , with a determination of appearing to the best advantage . Accordingly , I attempted a very agreeable conversation but , alack ! how little are we the masters of our actions . After divers fruitless attempts to inveigle my angel into a grave argument , I found myself , for my sins , , indulging in most extravagant expressions , in a tone so audible , that the whole family , Charley , and Mary , and all , gazed upon me in speechless astonishment . I feared to check the ardent strain which I had adopted , for when the flame was quenched , I well knew that smoke only would succeed . Like a desperate gamester , I wen.t on more extravagantly than ever ; and had not the compassionate mistress of the house relieved me , by sending Miss Ashley to the piano , I can not answer for the indecorums which I should have committed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there be any thing which pre-emineritly awakens the whole soul to tenderness , which appeals directly to the affections of the heart , it is the voice of a lovely woman-provided , always , that the voice be good , and the listener have an ear for music . Miss Ashley 's voice reminded one of the imaginary strains of the angels ,  --  deep , thrilling , and , withal , mysterious . The air was Mrs. Hemans 's exquisite Tyrolese Evening Hymn . Ah ! musical reader ! if you have not heard it , go straight to Mrs. C- , of your own dear city , and learn the luxury of a tear ; or if you can not obtain an introduction to her , ask every young lady you know to sing the Tyrolese Evening Hymn . I have always been fond of country life , and , with Heaven 's blessing , shall take up my abode in some happy valley , watered by the beautiful ilousatonic , before many years elapse . My first , most ardent wish , is like that expressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , A bee-hive 's hum shall soothe my ear , A willowy brook that turns no mill , With many a fall shall linger near . I ca n't go the mill , however agreeable it may be to less nervous people . It was of the country that I thought , when that heavenly voice discoursed such eloquent music . The song refers so admirably to the most delightful part , the very poetry of a summer day , that I could not // help imagining the exquisite reality , with my own sweet Grace for my chorister . How enchanting , thought I , to hear this joyful welcome from her lips ,  - -  Come come ! come ! Come to the sunset treeThe day is past and gone . The woodman 's axe lies free , And the reaper 's work is done ! But all my dreams of rural felicity were now to be rudely broken off ; all my imagined joys in the society of Miss Ashley were to be savagely put to flight , and sent trembling to the regions where the murdered shades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewailing the instability of all human dreams . I shall not detain the reader long with the recital . I have become too much of a philosopher to waste half a quire of sentiment upon such a subject . The clock struck ten  --  the well known signal of my lady 's departure . With trembling steps did I approach her , and crave the honor of being her escort . She paused a moment , as if to gain courage , then thanked me for my civility , assured me she would not trouble me , but that " C'harley would go home with her . " Gentle reader , were you ever seated on the box of a stage-coach while Jehu was driving his four wild horses at full speed down a gentle angle of forty-five ? If so , it is more than probable that you felt a queer sensation about the throat , as if your breath were attempting in vain to escape . Such was my delicious situation when , after the gentle accents of Miss Ashley had stunned me like a thunder-clap , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , madam . " I was quite too proud to sue for a favor once refused , and with calm bitterness took leave , to reap the satisfaction of a sleepless and painful night . When in a measure recovered from the shock occasioned by my constructive rejection , my animosity towards the whole sex became unbounded . I shunned society and resolved to cut the whole race of womankind . Some sensible person has remarked that violent diseases are apt to work their own cure . It soon struck me that my behavior was unmanly and ridiculous , and spite of philosophy I began to sigh for the pleasures of the world . It is poor revenge , thought I one morning while I lay in bed , to coop myself up the livelong day in my library , confined to the society of Burton 's Anatomy , and my own melancholy cogitations-who cares whether I mingle with the world or not ? who loses besides myself ? My resolution was soon taken , and I was again enrolled among the care-despising votaries of fashionable dissipation . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end ,  --  it was not so . The bitter remembrance of my mischance incited me to seek a worthier object of affection . I was not long in fixing upon Miss Diana Huntley , a very beautiful young lady at the top of ton , who could trace her descent as far back as her grandmother , and was possessed of a snug little fortune in her own right , besides magnificent prospects . Miss Huntley was reckoned very accomplished , too . She could flirt , waltze , and sing to perfection , and recited Byron quite prettily . She was vain enough , in all conscience ; but that failing was wiped away by the reputation she enjoyed for spotless modesty . Her mind had not been too much cultivated ; but // where was the necessity ? Miss Huntley was esteemed a decided bas bleu . To be brief I made up my mind to regard her in a very favorable light , and soon fancied myself deeply in love . It was no easy task , however , to gain the favor of the fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracting admirers , and Miss Huntley was , of course , literally besieged by hungry lovers . My game was perseverance , and sedulous devotion , and 1 had no reason to complain of the skill with which it was managed . Most studiously did I avoid the society of rival beauties , and devotedly did I attach myself to the object of my adoration . Nothing appeals more effectually to a woman 's heart than the exclusive attention of her lover . The effect of my devotion was soon perceptible . I was , evidently , singled from the crowd , and could not doubt that I stood foremost in the catalogue of the faithful . In this liberal city a flirtation may go great lengths without exciting suspicion , and generating whispers ; it may be concluded , then , that matters were carried to considerable extent , when it is known that Miss Huntley and myself became , in a short time , subjects of conversation . I was in no humor to trifle with time , but resolved to tempt my fate without delay . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time seriously in love . I did not feel that thorough respect for her character , which every man ought to feel towards one whom he selects for a life companion ; but I could perceive buried beneath her follies , an abundant spring of genuine affection and amiability , and with these I was satisfied . It was on a delightful morning in October , that I called on Miss Huntley , with the somewhat awkward design of declaring my sentiments , and making lawful tender of my heart and hand . Never did she appear more charming ,  --  - by the way , 1 have always found that ladies grow more charming each time they are seen . After a short conversation , she sang to me a soft Italian love ditty ( neither of us comprehended its meaning ) with such exquisite tenderness , that I could not resist falling as gracefully as possible on my knee , and making a clear conscience of all the tortures which her charms had inflicted . XVith a crowd of blushes she acknowledged my merit , and accepted my proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , " added she with a smile , " I can not entirely dispose of myself without the consent of my father . " Enraptured with my good fortune , which flattered my vanity in no small degree , I took leave of my charming Diana in a manner that shall be nameless , and half delirious with joy hastened home to await my destiny . this state of suspense was not of long duration . The next morning brought me a note from Mr. Oscar iluntley , requesting an interview whenever it should be agrceable to me . My answer , specifying an early hour , was soon in the hands of the messenger . It may be guessed that I was riot behind the time . The master of the house greeted me with great cordiality . 1-Je was an affable , kind-hearted gentleman of the old school , which , in my humble opinion , is infinitely superior to the new . I begin to think that the class properly called gentlemen , is nearly extinct . Your nineteenth century man is either an animal that carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow , whose gross selfishness has blinded him to the nature of true politeness , who , perchance , overwhelms you with reverences bccause he imagines his // antics impart an interesting air to himself ; but whose conversation is as coarse as his manners are absurd , and his whole social intercourse regulated by what he deems advantageous to his pitiful self , not by what may be agreeable to others . In a word , the majority of us are either coxcombs or boors , despite the boasted march of refinement . This is an unintentional digression . Mr. fluntley 's manner was ceremonious without being stiff , cordial hut not familiar ; it inspired respect without creating embarrassment . Our conference was entirely satisfactory . He declared himself greatly flattered by the honor which I intended his family , and very good naturedly assured me th t he did not require the production of my rent-roll , or certificates of stock . He spoke feelingly of his daughter-said she was a nice girl , the image of her departed mother , and hoped that she would make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hand was the only , and , perhaps , most fitting manner , in which I could express my sense of so much kindness , lie sent for his darling child , and my heart beat high when she made her appearance , Modest as morning , when she eyes The youthful Pbxebus . The kind-hearted old gentleman joined our hands , and ) after bestowing his benediction , left us to our bliss . How bitterly have I regretted my folly for allowing these brief moments of sincerity to pass without deciding on the day which was to crown my felicity ! Let me counsel all men , who are in pursuit of hymen , never , for a moment , to loosen the reins of love , or their irnprudence may cost them their happiness . heaven knows how much my false delicacy has cost me ! A week elapsed before I mentioned the subject of our nuptials ; but , before that time , my giddy mistress had , in a measure , relapsed into her coquettish habits . Perhaps she did not love me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the hapless lover dwindled into a mere tropkb de lamour . When , finally , I did request her to appoint a day , she replied , that indeed she had not thought of such a thing , but would consider . A month slipped away , and she was still deliberating ; but the charms of her society beguiled the time so pleasantly that I could not murmur . When , however , a second and a third succeeded , and her deliberations had still resulted in no decision , I thought it time to take more decisive measures . Accordingly* , I gently upbraided her for the ill-usage I had sustained . But how will it affect a Christian community , to learn the manner in which my remonstrances were received ? After the whimsical fashion of the sex , she thought proper to be angry , and was greatly shocked at my teasing her so perpetually ! But this was not the only act of Miss Huntley which gave me pain . She was gradually returning to her former follies , in a manner qoite unbecoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , an once more to cluster around her , and she treated them ith scarcely less reserve than formerly . Often did I feel tempted to commit personal violence on these offensive animalcul * , but was forced to satisfy my jealousy by making them ridiculous to their idol . One creature , in particular , was the object of my hearty execration . This was an // Italian adventurer , who wore a moustache , and peered through a quizzing-glass . It was notorious that this animal subsisted on credit and borrowed capital , and , in his own right , knew nothing of the delights of a hard currency . His impudence was matchless-his in*enuity unequaled . He enjoyed a tolerable education , had attained much varied information amidst the vicissitudes of life , and knew enough of human nature to gull one half of his acquaintance , relieve them of their spare cash , and bilk his tailor to a heavy amount . Such was the person , regarded by Miss Huntley with particular complacency-such the wretch , who , in a short time , became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in my parties of pleasure , and finally played a conspicuous part , first in a love-quarrel , and then in a rupture with my mistress , which I shall speak of hereafter . It chanced , one morning , that I called early on Miss Huntley , and found her alone . Being in a serious humor , I could not restrain my reproaches . The lady received them worse than before , and used broad terms . 1 thought proper to bide the pelting of the storm with apparent unconcern . She was mortified , and resolved to move me . I shall go mad , Mr. B- , " cried she . " I assure you it is quite a matter of indifference to me , Miss Huntley , what you do . " " You say it is a matter of indifference , sir- " " Entirely so , madam , " I replied , with the most phlegmatic calmness . " Your coolness , sir , is certainly commendable . May I presume to ask if you go to the opera to-night ? " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Certainly , madam ; you probably have not forgotten our engagement to go together . " " But I have forgottema , Mr. B- ; and , now that I think of it , am engaged to go with your friend , Count Lazzaroni. " " *y friend , Miss Huntley ? You have been acquainted with me long enough to know what company I keep . " " As you please , MT . B- ; the Count is not here , it is true ; you may speak safely- " " Miss Huntley ! " Mr. B- ! " " Did you mean , young lady , to charge me with-with- " " 0 no , young gentleman , I of course meant nothing-you wait to be released from your engagement ; sir , you are at liberty to go . " " You treat me like a dog , madam ! " cried I , unable to bear her taunts any longer . " I wish you a very good morning . " I spoke in anguish , and the tear which stood in my eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some book that nothing stirs the heart so painfully as the tear of a man ; - it is a mighty grief , which can trouble the depths of that hidden fountain . My cruel mistress was touched to the quick ; she earnestly called me back , and , clasping both my hands , fell on her knees before me . " Can you forgive me she cried ; " can you forgive so many outrages ? " Her tears flowed freely ; it was my turn to relent ; I raised her to my arms . " Forgive you ? what the deuce shall I forgive you for ? but if you say there is // something , I do forgive you , freely , willingly . " Bah ! how like a woman I felt then . She , poor soul ! wept like a child ; and , if I had said another word , I am sure I should have blubbered like a great school-boy . We sat in silence for nearly an hour , and our emotions gradually suhsided . We were both a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was a pleasant bashfulness . At length I hazarded a remark upon the beauty of the weather . My dear Diana looked into my face with a sweet smile , and assented with the grace of an angel . Our eyes turned , almost involuntarily , to the window ; it was raining torrents , and , to all appearance , had been for the last hour . This amusing mistake furnished us with conversation , and we were soon chatting away at our ease , as if nothing unpleasant had occurred . A golden opportunity now offered for pressing the appointment of the important day , and three months from that time was soon fixed upon . This triumph so elated me , that I rushed into the street without an umbrella , and had the satisfaction to reach my rooms without an inch of dry skin to bless myself with . The afternoon found me again in the society of my angel ; the opera was forgotten ; the Count shuffled off with a " regret , " and my spirits exalted into the seventh heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past misfortune added zest to present bliss . But this delightful state was destined to a brief existence . A few short weeks restored the fickle arbiter of my weal and wo to her former faults . I became desperate . There was nothing in my conduct that could have lost me her respect-the woman was a confirmed coquet ; in the face of the bitter scene I have before described she had again deserted me-again received into favor that detestable , damnable , Italian knave . My friends ( kind souls ! ) sneeringly complimented me on the attractions of my mistress-the frequent visits of that foreign puppy became the theme of common scandal . I endeavored to act as became a philosopher , but felt like one of the damned . My thoughts at length became so intolerable that I was weak enough to resort to the threadbare expedient of dissipation ; but even the beastly carousals in which I participated could not drive away the fiend that haunted me . I soon became a pitiable object . In the morning I arose a desperate madman , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senseless brute . I now no longer saw the author of my calamities , but shunned the house which contained her as if it were the habitation of the dark angel . One evening , in the dead of winter , when I was in the midst of an accustomed revel , in a state between sobriety and intoxication , the party was joined by a notorious debauchee , who had sacrificed health , friends , fortune , every thing , to the pursuit of that accursed illusion , which , with such bitter irony , we call pleasure ! He approached me , and familiarly slapped my shoulder with his contaminating hand . " Ab , B- , " he exclaimed , " I congratulate you from the bottom of my soul ; here you sit at your ease , and leave others to make love for you . I just saw Lazzaroni sneak into old Huntley 's , with that d-d intriguing smile of his ; you are a lucky dog , by G- . " A forced " ha ! ha ! " was all that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretch , but , debased as I was , I felt that a quarrel with such a character was too humiliating for a slave . A // thought struck me-it was a dark and desperate thought . I stole quietly from the room , and rushed , like a maniac , to my lodgings . It was the work of an instant to arm myself with my pistols , and be on the way to the dwelling of my false mistress . A pass-key , which had been used in happier days , admitted me . I made directly for the drawing-room ; to my asonishment , it was perfectly dark , with the exception of a little spark of fire , resembling the burning wick of a lately extinguished candle , which appeared at the opposite end of the room ; it seemed to recede as I advanced . It flashed across my mind like lightning that the light was held by my detestable rival . In my right hand I held a loaded pistol ; for an instant I stood still-so did the apparition . " Who s there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " Speak ! or I 11 fire I " I advanced a step  --  the light moved-I became infuriated  --  the light trembled- " Speak ! " I cried again , " or -once-twice-three times-there ! " The faithful hair-spring obeyed the touch . The bright flash of powder , the loud roar of the explosion , and a crash , at the extreme of the apartment , like thousands of fragments of shattered glass , told that the instrument of destruction had done its duty . For an instant I stood like one petrified ; but a smart pain on my thigh , occasioned by a cigar in my left hand , which had burned through the pantaloon , recalled me to a sense of my situation . The mystery of the light was solved in an instant ; I moved towards the door , but , utterly overcome , fell senseless ere I could reach it . The next morning I awoke in my own room . The adventure of the preceding night haunted me like a horrid vision . I could scarcely convince myself of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it became necessary , either that a reformation should take place , or that I should rush on headlong to destruction . A small occurrence often affects the tenor of a whole life ; in critical cases , the most minute incident may turn the scale . Happily for me , when I arose from bed , I found it almost impossible to walk . The burn on my leg had inflamed it exceedingly , and rendered it extremely painful . This accident confined me to my room . Left entirely to the society of my own thoughts , my good genius seemed to return . I shed bitter tears of contrition and repentance over my past follies . I exerted all my philosophy to fortify my mind , and those exertions received their reward . I could soon revert , with calm regret , to the misfortunes which an overstrained passion had brought upon me in an evil hour ; and when I thought of the being who had caused all my calamities , a sigh was the only reproach which I suffered myself to make . This turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with pleasure , a note , which was left for me in the course of the day , and which ran as follows Sir ,  --  After the occurrences of the last fortnight , and especially of last night , you probably ivill not be surprised that my daughter deems it proper to release you from the engagement which you have contracted with her , in which arrangement I fully concur . I will not trouble you with reproaches , as I am sufficiently impartial to believe that the blame in this affair does not lie so much with you , as with my daughter . Your letters and presents to Miss Huntley are herewith returned , and she requests that you will reciprocate . I have the honor to be your obedient servant , OSCAR HUNTLEY . // I need not say that I did reciprocate with many warm thanks to the kind-hearted old gentleman , for his honorable way of proceeding . Years have elapsed since then , but never since have I felt any inclination to abandon the single state . I have not forgotten those unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence ; her remembrance can never be effaced from my heart . She is now an inhahitant no more of this earth ; hut , if we had shared together , hand in hand , all the vicissitudes of life , I could scarcely have mourned her more sincerely than I do . I do not , however , exhibit my melancholy feelings to the world , hut partake freely of its enjoyriments , and appear as cheerful as . other men . But , alas The deepest ice which ever froze , Can oniy o'er tho surface close ; The living stream lies quick below , And flows  --  and can not cease to flow . B. New-York , October , 1834.
