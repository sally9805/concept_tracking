txt NEXT to Farming , the Mechanical Arts occupy the greatest space in the estimation of the people of New-England . We seem to have inherited the love of manipulations from our ancestors , the English , who have excelled in the most useful of them . If Goldsmithery , which we have selected for this number , be not the most useful calling , in a Republic , it certainly stands very high for its antiquity , ingenuity , elegance and complication of workmanship ; for it includes jewelery , engraving , embossing , and every kind of workmanship in the two most precious metals , Gold and Silver . A Goldsmith , then , is an artizan who makes vessels and ornaments of gold and silver ; and , as we want a strictly proper and appropriate name for the trade , we shall follow the customary phraseology , and call the man who works in silver , a Goldsmith , without much fear of wounding the pride of an exclusive goldsmith , if we have such a one , by calling him a silversmith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible manufacturer of the richest of raw materials , a Goldsmith , although he be a can-maker , tankard-maker , or spoon-maker , a silverturner , a chaser , refiner , burnisher , or silver-plate engraver , or gofdbead-maker . Gold and Silver Smithery , thus combined , ranks high for its great antiquity , from Aaron 's gorgeous breast-plate , arid the molten calf of the Jews , and the furniture of Solomon 's temple , down to the days of the apostles , when a democratic mob was raised in the streets of Ephesus , by Demetrius , a silversmith , and others of his craft , lest PAUL , by his preaching , should spoil their lucrative trade of Godmaking ; which , it seems , was the principal husiness of that rich city , whose image of Diana fell down from heaven ,  --  being their Palladium , like that of Pallas in heathen history , on the preservation of which the city of Ephesus depended , as did the safety of Troy before their time ; for it was the same old story , new varnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ignorant people . Until the modern invention of the rolling-mill , goldsmiths used to hammer the metal from the ingot to the thickness required , whereas now they have it rolled out into plates at a small expense ; and this is carried by the gold-beater 's art to a degree of exility that is astonishing . Still the silver can is raised by dint of repeated strokes of the hammer , made in regular circles , while tankards , tea-pots , and coffee-pots are formed of plates soldered together . Wire-drawing was a part of the goldsmith 's occupation , as well as the gilding of it , which exhibits to the eye of wonder the surprising ductility of the king of metals ; but even this falls short of the astonishing ductility of gold in the laborious process of the manufactory of gold.leaf . ( See the calculations of the celebrated Dr. halley , in the London Philos . Trans . ) Beside the honor attached to the art from its great antiquity , we have annexed to it the epithet of responsible ; for kings , provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goldsmiths , vast // quantities of gold and silver to be formed into furniture for the palace , for personal ornaments , royal and sacerdotal  --  and for images civil and sacred , and for votive tablets with which heathen and papal altars were decorated , not to mention household vessels , and rich vestments of the highest officers , and most opulent citizens . A goldsmith was a man of great consequence in the reign of Henry Viii . and Cardinal Wolsey ; nor was it much diminished in honor and profit under Queen Elizabeth . It blazed with remarkable splendor during the peaceful reign of her successor , that ridiculous half-fool of a wise king , James the First , of glorious memory. * But what gave honor , consequence , and great riches to goldsmiths , beyond their mere occupation as artizans , was the lucrative circumstance of their being the only bankers in existence . Before the poor persecuted Jews of modern times invented the Bill of Exchange , money was paid and received in coin , in bags and purses ; and jewels , diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , it is hoped , they never will attain in the United States . When King James wanted money , he sent for his goldsmith , honest George Heriot , who came with him from Edinburgh to London ; and was one of the most valuable counsellors that queer king ever had . He was , to that just and pedantic monarch , the Bank of England , and pawn-broker to the nobility , and throughout , an honest , generous , and honorable man , whom the Duke of Buckingham feared , hated and respected ; and who has left a noble and elegant monument of his munificence at Edinburgh , under the name of fleriot 's Hospital , in a very singular but pleasing style of architecture , not very unlike the residence of the late Horace Walpole . Sir Walter Scott , in his Romance of " The Fortunes of Nigel , " has adhered closer to true history than in any of his other historico-romantic tales . George Heriot 's shop was near to where the London Exchange is now . Scott , speaking of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who , if fame spoke true , oftentimes acted as their banker , ( for these professions were not as yet separated from each other ) was a person of too much importance to receive the slightest interruption from sentinel or porter , and leaving his mule and two of his followers in the outer court , he gently knocked at a postern gate of the palace , and was presently admitted to the king , * while the most trusty of his attendants followed him closely with a piece of plate under his arm . " King James the First , who , like Dr. Johnson , gave to every one of his intimates , a nick-name , called honest George Heriot , jingling Geordie , because he dealt in clattering , sounding articles , as gold and silver coin , plate and trinkets . The highly valuable piece of plate , before mentioned , was an embossed salver of extraordinary dimensions , representing the " Judgement of Solomon , " highly wrought by the famous Florentine goldsmith and artist , Benvenuto Cellini , and made for Francis the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle of Pavia . As Scott says no more of this renowned artist , we shall add a few words respecting him , for the honor of goldsmiths . Benvenuto Gellini was contemporary with that prince of modern sculptors , Michael Angelo , and Julia Romano , the first and favorite * The famous Duke of Sully was wool to say , that King James was the wisest feel of all the kings in his time , in Europe . // pupil of Raphael and their companion . To his original business of gold . smith and engraver , he added that of statuary in smaller figures than the life . He was an extraordinary genius ; and , like men of that bright and dangerous class , was high-spirited , rash , proud , and indiscreet , and too often guilty of violent resentments , intemperate frays , and even assassinations ; and escaped the justice of the law more than once , on account of his matchless talents in the line of his business . He stood the first of the age as a designer , engraver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chevalier , than a contemplative artist . He was employed by cities , cardinals , kings , emperors and popes-by Leo X. the Emperor Charles V. and Francis the First-and , possibly , by Cardinal Wolsey . He wrote his own life ; which lay unpublished nearly two hundred years , on account of the freedom with which he speaks of certain great characters . His handyworks , or manipulations , were exquisite , and to be found only in the cabinets of Popes *nd Kings . He was concerned in several duels , and some fatal ones ; and tremblingly attentive to the ceremonials of the catholic religion , while he violated its principles by his passionate excesses . By this sketch of the character of Ceilini , it appears that three hundred years ago , the productions of the first-rate goldsmiths belonged rather to the fine arts , than to mechanical trades . A man can not come up to our idea of a complete goldsmith , without a sufficient knowledge of metallurgy to enable him to assay and separate mixed metals , and to apportion properly their alloy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goldsmith must make his own moulds , which requires taste in designing , and skill in execution . Nor should an artizan in this line be ignorant of mineralogy ; at least of the natural history of Gold and Silver , Lead and quicksilver ; yet so scanty was the knowledge of this department of nature , in the life-time of the subject of this memoir , that the first teacher of the science of Mineralogy in these United States , in the order of time , * found Mr. Revere the only man , in 1794 , who appeared to know any thing of the discrimination between the ores of the seven metals . We presume not to say how far these things were known and taught in Philadelphia , where there was a Medical School . We speak only of Mineralogy , previous to 1783 , as it regards New-England , and the history of the mineral cabinet at Cambridge , which was the first collection of the kind made in North-America . Thus much of goldsmiths , considered as artizans , bankers , or honorable money-dealers , prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of the Bill of Exchange , and the speedy and safe mode of transmission of letters through a national Post-Office . PAUL REVERE , or Rivoire , as his ancestors wrote the name , was born in Boston , in December , 1734 , 0 . 5 . ( January 1 , 1735 , ) and died there in May , 1813 , aged 84 . His grandfather emigrated from St. Foy , in France , to the island of Guernsey , and his father , at the age of thirteen , was sent by his friends from that island to Boston , to learn the trade of a goldsmith , where he afterwards married , and had several children , of which Paul was the eldest . Like most of the Huguenots , who emigrated to this country , the elder Revere was very industrious , and very austere in his religious opinions . To the great * J ) r XVate , : hou* // affliction of the pious and conscientious father , Paul was disposed to attend public worship with the congregation of the Rev. Dr. Mayhew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one occasion , suffered the infliction of a blow from his father , after he was grown up to man 's estate . Young Revere was brought up by his father to the business of a goldsmith , and made himself very serviceable in the use of the graver . Having a natural taste for drawing , he made it his peculiar business to design and execute all the engravings on the various kinds of silver plate then manufactured . In 1756 , about the time he became of age , an expedition was organized against Crown Point , then in possession of the French . In this expedition he received the appointment of Lieutenant of Artillery , and was stationed at Fort Edward , on Lake George , the greater part of that year . After his return to Boston , he married , and commenced business , as a goldsmith , which , with engraving and other mechanical and manufacturing arts , were objects of industry and study , from time to time , during a long and active life . He had a great fondness for Jlllechanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the most important principles , and though often engaged in other pursuits , he always returned to this with additional delight and vigor . Engraving on copper was an art in which , as in some others , he was self-instructed . One of his earliest engravings of this description was a portrait of his friend , Dr. May hew . in 1766 , he engraved on copper a picture , emblematical of the repeal of the Stamp Act . He also executed a very popular caricature , of the " Seventeen Rescinders . " As there are not extant many copies of this print , some account of it may be interesting . In the beginning of the year 1768 , when the measures of the British Government were assuming more and more of a threatening appearance , the House of Representatives of Massachusetts , voted to send a circular letter to the Legislatures of the several Provinces , upon the alarming state of affairs with the mother country . This measure gave so much umbrage to the King , that he sent out orders to Governor Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rescinded and obliterated . This demand being judged unreasonable , after debate , a vote was passed not to conform to it . Seventeen members only voting for it , and ninety-two against it . These numbers became notorious in a political sense . Seventeen being called the Tory number , and the glorious ninety*two , as it was called , was denominated that of the Whigs . The seventeen members were branded with the name of Rescinders , and were treated in the most contemptuous manner . Mr. Revere 's caricature helped to increase the odium . It was entitled , " A WARM PLACE-HELL ! " The delineation was a pair of monstrous open jaws , resembling those of a shark , with flames issuing from them , and the Devil , with a large pitch-fork , driving the Seventeen Rescinders into the flames , exclaiming , " Now I ye got you ,  --  a fine haul , by Jove . " As a reluctance is shown by the fore * Extract of the Earl of Hilishorough 's letter to Gov .

" Over the upper jaw is seen , in the back ground , the cupola of the Province House , with the Indian and bow and arrow , ( the Arms of the Province , ) which House was the Governor 's residence . A copy of this print fell by accident , many years ago , into the hands of a gentleman of our acquaintance , who inquired the particulars respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of age , and observed he had not seen a copy of it for many years ,  --  was pleased to find that one was in preservation  --  and offered to buy it . He said he was a young man , zealous in the cause of liberty , when he sketched it , and had forgotten many of the circumstances ; but this he did remember , that while he was doing it , the famous Doctor Church came into his shop , and , seeing what he was about , took a pen and wrote the following lines as an accompaniment . The colonel then delivered them with much energy , exactly as they are on the print . " On , brave Rescinders !  --  to yon yawning cell , Seventeen such miscreants sure will startle HellThere puny Villains , damned for petty sin , On such distinguished Scoundrels gaze and grin ; The out-done Devil will resign his sway ; He never curst his millions in a day . " In 1770 , Mr. Revere published an engraved print , representing the massacre in King-street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1774 , another , of a historical character , representing the landing of the British Troops in Boston . Copies of all these , though extremely rare , are still extant . A lithographic fac simile of the print first mentioned , has been recently republished . In the year 1774 , among other things , which the British Parliament did to intimidate and break down the spirit of freedom whose blaze extended from New-Hampshire to Georgia , they passed an act making the justices of the Supreme Court in Massachusetts independent of the people for their salaries . The grand jurors , returned to serve at the first term of the Court after this was received , met in Boston the day previous to the commencement of the term , and , after solemn deliberation , all but one of them signed a resolution not to serve in that capacity . Paul Revere was one of this jury . The person , who declined signing the resolution , was a Mr. Pratt , of Chelsea , and it appears that his objection was an uncertainty in his mind as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the people . When the Court opened and the jurors were called , they severally refused to be sworn . When Pratt , who was last on the list , was called , he asked the court , if their salaries were to be paid by the province or theking . The chief justice said , " Mr. Pratt , this court is organized as it always has been , and it can be of no importance to you as a juror , whether our salaries be paid from the treasury of the crown or of the province . " Pratt immediately rejoined , " I wo' n't sarve . " This was the last grand jury that was summoned under the judges of the crown . Many persons have often heard the anecdote related by Revere , and we have a manuscript of his in our possession , xv hich contains the names of the jurors. * The execution of this engraving was erroneously *England Magazine fur July , attrihutetl to Nathaniel liurd , in the New* // In 1775 , he engraved the plates , made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ordered by the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts , then in session at Watertown . He was sent by this Congress to Philadelphia to obtain information respecting the manufacture of Gunpowder . The only powder-mill , then in the colonies , was in the vicinity of Philadelphia . The proprietor refused to let Revere take any drawing or specification whatever , or any memorandum of the process of the manufacture , but consented to show him the mill in full operation . His mechanical skill was now brought into action . With the slight information thus obtained , he was able , on his return , to construct a mill , which was soon put in operation , and with complete success . During the whole of our struggle for independence and self-government , Revere felt like a true American , and acted like a worthy son of a Huguenot . He was several times sent by the Provincial to the Continental Congress on confidential business . He was one of the persons who planned and executed one of the most daring projects which characterized the times  --  the destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so copiously described nor so elaborately considered in its effects as it deserves by a philosophical historian . He was one of a club of young men , chiefly mechanics , who associated for the purpose of watching the movements of the British troops in Boston , and acted an important part in the events which occurred about the 19th of April , 1775 . In relation to this point , we let the patriot speak for himself and prefer his own account of the matter to any abridgement of our own . The following letter he wrote to the Corresponding Secretary of the Massachusetts Historical Society , in reply to some inquiries from that officer . It was published in the collections of the Society , but will probably be new to most of our readers , and contains incident enough to supply a novelist with the basis of a romance . Dear Sir , In the fall of 1774 and winter of 1775 , I was one of upwards of thirty , chiefly mechanics who formed ourselves into a committee for the purpose of watching the movements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of the tories . We held our meetings at the Green-Dragon tavern . We were so careful that our meetings should be kept secret , that every time we met , every person swore upon the Bible , that they would not discover any of our transactions , but to Messrs . HANcOcK , ADAMS , Doctors WARREN , Cisuacim , and one or two more . About November , when things began to grow serious , a gentleman who had connections with the tory party , but was a whig at heart , acquainted me that our meetings were discovered , and mentioned the identical words that were spoken among us the night before . We did not then distrust Dr. Church , but supposed it must be some one among us . We removed to another place , which we thought was more secure ; but here we found that all our transactions were communicated to Governor Gage . ( This came to me through the then Secretary Plucker ; he told it to the gentleman mentioned above . ) It was then a common opinion , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Gage was possessed of all their secrets . ( Church was a member of that Congress for Boston . ) In the winter , towards the spring , we frequently took turns , two and two , to watch the soldiers , by patroling the streets all night . The Saturday night preceding the 19th of April , about twelve o'clock at night , the boats belonging to the transports were all launched , and carried under the sterns of the men of war . ( They had been previously hauled up and repaired . ) We likewise found that the grenadiers and light infantry were all taken off duty . // 311 From these movements , we expected something serious was to be transacted . On Tuesday evening , the 18th , it was observed , that a number of soldiers were marching towards the bottom of the common . About ten o'clock , Dr. Warren sent in great haste for me , and begged that I would immediately set off for Lexington , where Messrs . Hancock and Adams were , and acquaint them of the movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I got to Dr. Warren 's house , I found he had sent an express by land to Lexington  --  a Mr. William Dawes . The Sunday before , by desire of Dr. Warren , I had been to Lexington , to Messrs . Hancock and . Adams , who were at the Rev. Mr. Clark 's . I r&amp;'urned at night through Charlestown ; there I agreed with a Colonel Conant , and some other gentleman , that if the British went out by water , we would show two lanthorns in the north church steeple ; and if by land , one , as a signal ; for we were apprehensive it would be difficult to cross the Charles river , or get over Boston neck . I left Dr. Warren , called upon a friend , and desired him to make the signals . I then went borne , took my boots and surtout , went to the north part of the town , where I had kept a boat ; two friends rowed me across Charles river , a little to the eastward where the Somerset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship was winding , and the moon was rising . They landed me on the Charlestown side . When I got into town , I met Colonel Conant , and several others ; they said they had seen our signals . I told them what was acting , and went to get me a horse ; I got a horse of Deacon Larkin . While the horse was preparing , Richard Devens , Esq . who was one of the Committee of Safety , came to me , and told me , that he came down the road from Lexington , after sundown , that evening ; that he met ten British officers , all well mounted , and armed , going up the road . I set off upon a very good horse ; it was then about eleven o'clock , and very pleasant . After I had passed Charlestown neck , and got nearly opposite where Mark was hung in chains , I saw two men on horseback , under a tree . When I got near them , I discovered they were British officers . One tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I turned my horse very quick , and galloped towards Charlestown neck , and then pushed for the Medford road . The one who chased me , endeavoring to cut me off , got into a clay pond , near where the new is now built . I got clear of him , and went through Medford , over the bridge , and up to Menotomy . In Medford , I awaked the Captain of the minute men ; and after that , 1 alarmed almost every house , till I got to Lexington . I found Messrs . Hancock and Adams at the Rev. Mr. Clark 's ; I told them my errand , and inquired for Mr. Dawes ; they said he had not been there ; I related the story of the two officers , and supposed that he must have been stopped , as he ought to have been there before me . After I had been there about half an hour , Mr. Dawes came ; we refreshed ourselves , and set off for Concord , to secure the stores , &amp;c. there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we found to be a high son of liberty . I told them of the ten officers that Mr. Devens met , and that it was probable we might be stopped before we got to Concord ; for I supposed that after night , they divided themselves , and that two of them had fixed themselves in such passages , as were most likely to stop any intelligence going to Concords I likewise mentioned , that we had better alarm all the inhabitants till we got to Concord ; the young Doctor much approved of it , and said , he would stop with either of us , for the people between that and Concord knew him , and would give the more credit to what we said . We had got nearly half way : Mr. Dawes and the Doctor stopped to alarm the people of a house : I was about one hundred rods ahead , when I saw two men , in nearly the same situation as those officers were , near Charlestown . I called for the Doctor and Mr. Dawes to come up ; in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in a straight road , that inclined each way ; they had taken down a pair of bars on the north side of the road , and two of them were under a tree in the pasture . The Doctor being foremost , he came up ; and we tried to get past them ; but they being armed with pistols and swords , they forced us into the pasture ;  --  the Doctor jumped his horse over a low stone wall , and got to Concord . I observed a wood at a small distance , and made for that . When I got there , out started six officers , on horseback , and ordered me to dismount ; - one of them , who appeared to have the command , examined me , where I came from , and what my name was ? I told him . He asked me if I was an express ? I answered in the affirmative . He demanded* what time I left Boston ? I told him ; and added , that their troops had catched aground in passing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in a short time , for I had // alarmed the country all the way up . He immediately rode towards those who stopped us , when all five of them came down upon a full gallop ; one of them , whom I afterwards found to be a Major Mitchel , of the 5th regiment , clapped his pistol to my head , called me by name , and told me he was going to ask me some questions , and if I did not give him true answers , he would blow my brains out . He then asked me similar questions to those above . He then ordered me to mount my horse , after searching me for arms . He then ordered them to advance and to lead me in front . When we got to the road , they turned down towards Lexington . When we had got about one mile , the Major rode up to the officer that was leading me , and told him to give me to the sergeant . As soon as he took me , the Major ordered him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulted them , to blow my brains out . We rode till we got near Lexington meeting-house , when the militia fired a volley of guns , which appeared to alarm them very much . The Major inquired of me how far it was to Cambridge , and if there were any other road ? After some consultation , the Major rode up to the Sergeant , and asked if his horse was tired ? He answered him , he was- ( He was a Sergeant of grenadiers , and had a small horse ) - then , said he , take that man 's horse . I dismounted , and the Sergeant mounted my horse , when they all rode towards Lexington meetin*r-house . I went across the burying-ground , and some pastures , and came to the Rev. Mr. Clark 's house , where I found Messrs . Hancock and Adams . I told them of my treatment , and they concluded to go from that house towards Woburn . I went with them , and a Mr. Lowell , who was a clerk to Mr. Hancock . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lowell and myself returned to Mr. Clark 's , to find what was going on . When we got there , an elderly man came in ; he said he had just come from the tavern , that a man had come from Boston , who said there were no British troops coming . Mr. Lowell and myself went towards the tavern , when we met a man on a full gallop , who told us the troops were coming up the rocks . We afterwards met another , who said they were close by . Mr. Lowell asked me to go to the tavern with him , to get a trunk of papers belonging to Mr. Hancock . We went up chamber ; and while we were getting the trunk , we saw the British very near , upon a full march . We hurried towards Mr. Clark 's house . In our way , we passed through the militia . There were about fifty . When we had got about one hundred yards from the meeting-house , the British troops appeared on both sides of the meeting-house. in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short halt ; when I saw , and heard , a gun fired , which appeared to be a pistol . Then I could distinguish two guns , and then a continual roar of musquetry ; when we made off with the trunk . As I have mentioned Dr. Church , perhaps it might not be disagreeable to mention some matters of my own knowledge , i*especting him . He appeared to be a high son of liberty . He frequented all the places where they met , was encouraged by all the leaders of the sons of liberty , and it appeared he was respected by them , though I knew that Dr. Warren had not the greatest affection for him . He was esteemed a very capable writer , especially in verse ; and as the whig party needed every strength , they feared as well as courted him . Though it was known , that some of the liberty songs , which he composed , were parodized by him , in favor of the British , yet none dare charge him with it . I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , that I never thought him a man of principle ; and I doubted much in my own mind , whether he was a real whig . I knew that he kept company with a Capt . Price , a half-pay British officer , and that he frequently dined with him and Robinson , one of the Commissioners . I know that one of his intimate acquaintance asked him why he was so often with Robinson and Price . His ansxv*r was , that he kept company with them on purpose to find out their plans . The day after the battle of Lexington , I met him in Cambridge , when he shew me some blood on his stocking , which he said spirted on him from a man who was killed near him , as he was urging the militia on . I well remember , that I argued with myself ; if a man will risque his life in a cause , he must be a friend to that cause ; and I never suspected him after , till he was charged with being a traitor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the committe of safety . He engaged me as a messenger , to do the out of doors business for that committee ; which gave me an opportunity of being frequently with them . The Friday evening after , about sunset , I was sitting with some , or near all of that committee , in their room , which was at Mr. 1-Jastings 's house , in Cambridge . Dr. Church , all at once , started up-Dr . Warren , said he , I am determined to go into // 313 Boston to-morrow- ( it set them all a staring ) - Dr . Warren replied , Are you serious , Dr. Church ? they will hang you if they catch you in Boston . He replied , I am serious , and am determined to go at all adventures . After a considerable conversation , Dr. Warren said , If you are determined , let us make some business for you . They agreed that he should go to get medicine for their and our wounded officers . He went the next morning ; and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the committee how things were , I took him aside , and inquired particularly how they treated him . He said that as soon as he got to their lines , on Boston neck , they made him a prisoner , and carried him to General Gage , where he was examined , and then he was sent to Gould 's barracks , and was not suffered to go home but once . After he was taken up , for holding a correspondence with the British , I came across Deacon Caleb Davis ; - we entered into conversation about him ; - he told me , that the morning Church went into Boston , he ( Davis ) received a billet for General Gage- ( he then did not know that Church was in town ) - when he got to the General 's house , he was told , the General could not be spoke with , that he was in private with a gentleman ; that he waited near half an hour when General Gage and Dr. Church came out of a room , discoursing together , like persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite surprised at seeing Deacon Davis there ; that he ( Church ) went where he pleased , while in Boston , only a Major Caine , one of Gage 's Aids , went with him . I was told by another person , whom I could depend upon , that he saw Church go into General Gage 's house , at the above time ; that he got out of the chaise and went up the steps inure like a man that was acquainted , than a prisoner . Some time after , perhaps a year or two , I fell in company with a gentleman who studied with Church ; in discoursing about him , I related what I have mentioned above ; he said , he did not doubt that he was in the interest of the British ; and that it was he who informed General Gage ; that he knew for certain , that a short time before the battle of Lexington , ( for he then lived with him , and took care of his business and books , ) he had no money by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at once he had several hundred new British guineas ; and that he thought at the time , where they came from . Thus , Sir , I have endeavored to give you a short detail of some matters , of which , perhaps , no persons but myself have documents or knowledge . I have mentioned some names which you are acquainted with ; I wish you would ask them , if they can remember the circumstance I allude to . I am , Sir , with every sentiment of esteem , your humble servant , Boston Jan. 1 , 1798 . PAUL R vxaE . After the British evacuated Boston , a regiment of artillery was raised for the defence of the State . In this regiment he was appointed a Major , and afterwards a Lieutenant-Colonel , and remained in the service until the peace . During all this period , he might be said to hold the sword in one hand , and the implements of mechanical trades in the other , and all of them subservient to the great cause of American liberty . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted for the public good , he was looked to for the consummation of the design . When the British left Boston , they broke the trunnions of the cannon at Castle William , ( Fort Independence ) and Washington called on Revere to render them useful-in which he succeeded by means of a newly contrived carriage . After the peace , he resumed his business as a goldsmith . Subsequently he erected an air-furnace , in which he cast church bells and brass cannon . Soon after this time a new era commenced in ship building . Hitherto all vessels had been fastened with iron . It was found that copper sheathing , which preserved the bottoms of vessels from worms , in the course of a few years destroyed the iron bolts and spikes ; and copper bolts and spikes were at length substituted for iron .
