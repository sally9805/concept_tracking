txt MR . MACARTO was born to a competent though not a very affluent fortune . His immediaf.e parents had been more distinguished for their personal worth , than their pedigree , or their pecuniary possessions . f hey were frugal and industrious , cheerful in their temper , rich in each other , happy in their children , beloved by their neighbors , and respected through the widest circles of their acquaintance . The education of their family had been a primary object of their attention . In this they had been judicious and successful . The influence of their own example and conversation , and a domestic library , consisting of three or four hundred volumes of well-selected books , had been the principal means of forming three sons and four daughters , which was the number of their children , to all they could expect , and almost every thing they could desire . They became fond of reading and study , curious about every thing most deserving of their attention , in nature and art , rich in solid information , sound in judgement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct in all their practical habits . From nature they had inherited very different tempers , from the most sedate or phlegmatic to the most lively ; but this diversity was so clearly understood by the parents , and so wisely directed , that it contributed much to their domestic enjoyment . In ordinary circumstances , indeed , no person of sensibility could have passed an evening in this happy group without being charmed by the mingled effusions of innocent gaiety , good humor , and good sense , from which they derived mutual satisfaction . On quitting the scenes of his early days , Justin Macario did not forget the lessons he had learned beneath his paternal roof . He had seen , he had gathered , he had tasted , the fruits of virtue too long , and enjoyed them too much , to think of abandoning the immortal principles , from which alone they can spring . He persevered , therefore , in the habits he had commenced . He was conscientiously active , methodical in the distribution of his time , and temperate in every self-indulgence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , or moral feelings . Though devoted to no profession , he usually employed five hours in a day in reading or philosophic investigation . He had a speculative acquaintance with almost every art , and many useful inventions of different kinds originated in the hints , which his penetrating eye and comprehensive mind enabled him to suggest . At the age of twenty-five , Mr. Macario was married to an amiable and intelligent lady in the town of Amenia , with *homn he received , as a part of her dowry , a farm , sufficient to afford him every convenience and gratification to be derived from such a source , but not so large as to embarrass him with excessive care . In the neighborhood he found a man of very different habits from his own , with whom he could not avoid some connexion , and of whom it may be expedient to give a brief account . Alexander Uden , the neighbor mentioned above , was eight or ten years older than Mr. Macario . He lived on a large estate , which he had inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vor*. vi . 58 // means deficient , nor was there any thing unpromising in his native temper . I-us unfortunate habits all originated in neglect or indulgence . His father had been too much en*rossed in business to pay any other attention to his children than what related to their sumptuary habits , and his mother had been equally devoted to those frivolities of fashionable life , which are incompatible with the common duties of a mother . In this situation the children had been left , from their eat liest years , to their own inclinations , or to any influence which might be exerted upon them ; to a thousand contradictory influences , indeed , from which the best results to be expected are no character at all . What they wished for , they took without permission , obtained from the listless indulgence of their mother , or were denied from the caprice of the moment , or for reasons which were too seldom urged to produce any good effect . Their time was at their own disposal . When they chose to spend a day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rambled about the streets or the fields ; and when it suited their humor , they went to school , but were rarely disposed to spend three hours iii diligent study , or in quiet submission to any authority . Of course , they were no scholars . Of all the fine arts they were as ignorant as the children of the peasant or the clown ; while , in the essentials of a common education , they were inferior to most of those , whom they despised for their humble birth . In such a state of things , it is hardly necessary to say , that they had few of those domestic enjoyments , which render home inviting . They knew little or nothing of the strong ties , which should bind together parents and children , brothers and sisters , rendering the happiness of each the joy of all . if they did not fall into lasting contentions , there was some reason to stispect it was because they had not spirit enough to commence a quarrel , or stability to continue it . The principal employments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , were huntin * , fishing , gaming , and an occasional ball or ride . his reading amounted to little more than a glance at a daily paper , and now and then a popular novel . His valuable farm had no attractions for him . In regard to all kinds of business , indeed , he was profoundly ignorant , both of their principles and of their practical details . About ten years before Mr. Macario established himself in Ameriia , the negative man , described above , had married a woman very niuch like himself ; and in a few years was surrounded by four or five children , growing up in the very habits and prospects , which might be expected from the influence of parents , who were equally ignorant and reckless of their most sacred duties . How little happiness lie enjoyed will appear from the following dialogue , which took place in the study of Mr. Macario , five or six years after he atid Mr. Uden became fellow townsmen ENTER MR . EDEN . Mr. Macario . Good morning , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macario . What a delightful day , at last , and what horrid weather we have had ! Have you not been tired to death by the storm ? For my part , I have been shut up three or four days , so that I could neither hunt , nor fish , nor ride , nor walk , // nor see any mortal out of my own house , unless it were some dripping wretch passing along the streets . How have you lived through these everlasting rains and piercing xvin ( ls ? Mr. Macario . It has indeed been a remarkable storm ; but , in the kind providence of God , I have been exempted from all exposure , beyond what is desirable for its happy effects ; and , in one way or another , I have contrived to be tolerably comfortable . sir . Uden . Happy effects of exposure ! Tolerably corn fortable in such a storm ! I have heard of something , called philosophy , which is said to render a man happy in the most unfavorable circumstances ; but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be found . My experience teaches me that rain is rain , and wind is wind , and pain is pain , and will he so in spite of every thing I can do . What is in the very nature of things , dismal , I can not make cheerful and pleasant , contrive as much as I will . What is in its very nature empty , I can not fill ; nor can I imagine fountains of pleasure , where I see nothing but vacuity . Ir . JJiacario . It is true , Mr. Uden , imagination alone can not create any thing very substantial ; nor can a momentary effort change the nature of things , or invert the relations they bear , one to another ; but the sources of enjoyment are many and various , and when we are occasionally debarred from one , we may have free access to another , which is equally pure and satisfactory . Yes , with a little attention , perhaps , we might discover many a hidden fountain , far preferable to any we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant , and in every way more valuable . r . Uden . It may be so , but it is all a riddle to me . We lave a natural love for freedom . We like to go and come when we please , and do what we please . So long as we are free , it is l ) leasant enough to sleep on the brightest morning of lay , and to sit or saunter in the house all the rest of the day ; but we hate to think that we must be mere stumps or stones . In such a storm as we have had , home becomes a jail , little better than a dungeon . If we look at the windows , they are as dark as if they were covered with sackcloth ; and if we try to open a door , it is so swelled with the dampness that it might as well be barred with irons , like any other prison . I have no patience with such things . They are all tedious and tormenting . Mr. Macario . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between this morning , and those of the last three or four days ; and yet , I have passed those three or four days very comfortably . Indeed , they have not seemed long . So far has the necessary confinement been from every thing tedious , that I have voluntarily devoted three hours this morning to my book , amid all the charms of nature inviting me abroad . True , I have indulged myself in a walk of two hours , and enjoyed it much . Mr. Uden . I suppose , then , your book has rendered you insensible to every thing unpleasant during the storm . I wish it was so with me ; but I can not imagine how it should be . I have little taste for reading , and none at all for study . My parents took no care of my education , and it is now too late to mend it . I like a novel now and then ; but Scott is dead , and there is nobody else that has got his name up enough to make it worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read them . I take a daily paper , but there is nothing interesting in that ; no battles , no cholera , no steam-boats burnt or blown up , for a month past ; no failures , unless it be of some farmer or mechanic ; nothing which any one cares for . Mr. Macario . From your own account of yourself : , Mr. Uden , I think your reading must be somewhat dry ; but where is your wife , and what are your children doing ? Can you not derive entertainment from them ? Do they not make you forget , for hours together , whether it rains or shines ? Mr. Uden . It is true , there is some comfort in a wife . Among other pleasant things , she may amuse one for a few minutes , now and then ; but who can think of being confined to such a source of enjoyrnent for several days together , to have nothing to do but sit and look at her , and hear her say the same things fifty times over , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw wine forever from the same cask , and to pour it from a bottle , when it has been turned up-side-down for an hour . Mr. Jacario . I make no great pretensions to gallantry ; but I must beg the privilege of saying a few words in defence of Mrs. Uden . From the acquaintance I have had with her , I can not think your insinuations do her full justice . It can not be , that her funds of agreeable , not to say useful , conversation , are so speedily exhausted , as your expressions would imply . At least , she seems to have so much of good feeling , and so many pleasant ways of making it apparent , as must serve to cheer the gloominess of home , under all the disadvantages of a protracted storm . Indeed , I can not imagine , that a man of your sense and discretion would have formed the marriage connexion with so empty a thing , as could not afford him satisfaction amid the common privations of a storm , or a winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most engaging seasons of life . Have you no interest in them ,  --  do they not amuse your leisure ,  --  do they not give such employment to many a serious hour ) to many a long day , as makes it appear too short for its purpose ? Mr. Uden . I do n't know . My children are sometimes pleasant enough . When the w'eather is fair , I see and hear very little of them . If Jam at home , they are rambling abroad , or are sometimes at school ; and when they are at home , I am generally out of hearing : hut in a storm , that confines us for days within the same narrow walls , 0 what a bedlam ! One minute laughing , another crying . Now teazh*g for something to eat or drink , and now complaining of the uneasiness produced by excess ; now quarreling , and now raising five or six voices together , in tones sufficient to stun or distract any one , that is not deaf ! What can I do ? Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suppose me able to give it ? Mr. Uden . Yes ,  --  you seem to be a thousand times happier than I , and I want to know the mystery of becoming happy . Mr. Macario . From the experience of about thirty years , I can name with great confidence some of the grandessentials of happiness ; but you will be sensible , that it is one thing to point them out to a friend , and it may be a very different thing to put that friend in immediate possession of them . The most substantial enjoyments depend a // thousand times more on our personal habits , than they do on our outward condition , whether transient or durable . There is a difference , indeed , between sickness and health , poverty and riches , foul weather and fair , and a thousand other things comprised in the lot of life ; but there is a much greater difference in the minds of men , in the power or disposition to accommodate themselves to those passing events , which will have their course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be converted into sources of pleasure . To use , then , the frankness you have invited , J must tell you , Mr. Uden , that you want employment . You want an object of pursuit , that is worthy of your active mind ; something which shall take the lead in all you do , and think , and feel ; something that shall be first in your mind when you wake , and last when you close your eyes in sleep ; something , which , in the progress of execution , shall flow on with the current of time , distinguishing , in a sensible manner , each year , and month , and day ; - and that something should be , to do all the good in your power ; to make every creature , whether man or beast , as happy as may be . With this view , you would do well to distribute every day into several portions , to be employed in different ways for the promotion of your great design . This will render each day , at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kinds of business which we can not pursue many hours together , without fatigue ; but , with a judicious appropriation of time , we may spend fifteen hours in a day , not only without weariness , but with a degree of pleasure , unspeakably surpassing all , that could be derived from dissipation or inaction . If you wish to avoid the tedium , of which you have been complaining ; if you would have a never-failing source of entertainment in those seasons which must otherwise be dreary indeed ; I would advise you to cultivate a taste for reading . That I may not task you at first too severely , I would say , appropriate for the first month , one hour in a day to books ,  --  to books of solid information or elevated sentiment , which may serve to give order , vivacity , arid strength to the mind , and furnish it with resources for the emergencies of life ; and let this hour be as exclusively devoted to that purpose , as you ever gave fifteen minutes to a meal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third , three hours , and from that time forward , four hours every day , be your inviolable rule ; a rule , which nothing but imperious duty or uncontrolable circumstances shall be allowed to infringe . Situated as you generally are , you can not say you have not leisure for this . You can hardly say that you have not six or eight hours in the twentyfour , which hang heavily upon you . Let one half of your reading be accomplished in the morning , and the other half in company with that bosom-friend , whose presence may give increasing interest to the pages , while she partakes in the improvement they afford ; and whose convenience you will , therefore , consult , in respect to the hours to be assigned to this purpose . Pursue this plan for a few years , and apply the rest of your time in a judicious manner to the private and social pursuits , which , in their turn , may claim attention , and I venture to predict , that both you and your family will enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fair one . Your children now vex you with their noise , because they have nothing else to do ; nothing but noise to enjoy . Their minds are vacant ; their taste for durable pleasures // unformed . It is in your power to aid them unspeakably in tracing out those sources of enjoyment , which , though flowing beside their path , they have never yet seen . Furnish them with books suited to their age and condition . Read those books yourself . Mark the more interesting parts . Make it an amusement every day to talk of them , to hear your children read them ; to hear their remarks , and enter into their feelings . A few hu*tdred dollars are a matter of little consideration with you . Subscribe , among other things , for Audubon 's Ornithol%y . This would 1 ) e a perpetual source of entertainment , which may be resorted to for a day or an hour , as the case may require ,  --  . which will introduce them to one of the most beautiful kingdoms of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects around them , to regard either wind or storm . 1k . Uden . I thank you , Mr. Macario , for your advice . I have no doubt of your sincerity . It appears in every look and accent . Sometimes I am convinced and almost persuaded ; but there is something mysterious in the matter . It is wonderful what tItings some will contrive to make happiness of . There is Mrs. Mayo , who , if we may judge by appearance , finds a paradise in the confinement of a parlor for a whole winter . I have been there when the snow was flying enough to stop one 's breath , and seen the mantel-piece and the corners of the room set off with roses and hyacinths in blossom , on which she was doting with the greatest fondness . I can not doubt she was happy in looking at them , and in snuffing the little fragrance they afforded but still it seems to me there is something whimsical , something unnatural , in this enjoyment . Why attempt to reverse the great laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Mayo had better pay that attention to her husband and children , which she spends in watering her plants , and rescuing them from the rightful dominion of the season . Mr. Macaria . I shall never justify any lady in devoting that time or care to flowers , which is required for the faithful discharge of conjugal and parental duties , or any kind office of social life ; but , from my acquaintance with Mrs. Mayo , neither her children nor husband will charge her with any neglect . On the contrary , they carry with them , wherever they go , the most indubitable evidence of her attention ,  --  neat apparel and cheerful faces . Besides , Mr. Mayo is a man of such refined taste , that he sympathizes in all the labors and feelings of his wife , with respect to her plants and flowers . In all the varueties of important business , which employ ten or twelve hours , he finds leisure every day to notice the progress of every flower and every bud . Nor do I conceive that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , nature does not produce her flowery landscapes amid the snows of winter ; but it is equally true , that , if we let nature take her course in every thing , we must abandon a multitude of other gratifications ,  --  yea , many things which we have been accustomed to regard as necessaries of life . We do not find roasted turkies running about in readiness for the table . Our vegetables , as they come from the hand of nature , are neither boiled nor baked . Our boots , our coats , our hats , do not grow in the form in which we wear them . We do not dig our time-pieces from the mine , and immediately put them into our pockets . All these things , and ten thousand more , must // be discarded as unnatural , if the objection be admitted against the cultivation of domestic flowers in winter . Besides , a taste for the beauty and fracrance of the summer garden , is confessedly natural ; and it is equally natural for us to desire a supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons , which are most deficient . To all this we may add , that , for our personal comfort , we naturally wisb to have our parlors sufficiently warm , to keep the tenderest plant from freezlug . What , then , becomes of this objection against one of the most commendable amusements of our wives and daughters ? Air . Uden . I believe , 1*lr . Macario , I must give up this point ; but what . do you think of Mr. Low ? He *vears the appearance of a happy man ; but he seems to make it out of nothing ,  --  or rather , out of such things as would makc other men wretched . He scarcely sees the news once a week . He has not , perhaps , a dozen books in his house ; and if lie had a thousand , he would have no time to read them . Summer and winter , fair weather and foul , he and his boys are perpetually delving ; nor has he any thing better in prospect for himself or his children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they live , and that for a bare subsistence . Yet , this man is always the same ,  --  amid the flames of a meridian sun , amid the chills of a bitter east wind , amid a blustering snow or ( Irenching rain , I have heard him sing or whistle , as if all things were just as he would have them . Must he not be very insensible ? Can he be capable of real en-joyrnent ? Air . Iifacario . I have recommended books to you. , Mr. Uden , and I would now particularly su*gest , that one of those books should be a simple treatise on logic ; for your argunients seem to be taken up at random . The case of Mr. Low is precisely to my purpose ,  --  proving , as far as any one example can prove , that happiness depends more on ourselves than it does on fortune , or any concurrence of outward events , lie is , indeed , a laborious man ; but from early and invariable habit , his labor has becot e rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dawn , and pursuing from hour to hour a well-digested plan , he is never in haste , and never goes beyond his strength ; but , while he does more than other men , the evening finds him almost as vigorous and fresh as the morning . With all the vicissitudes of weather and season , too , he has been familiar from his childhood ,  --  with wet and drought , wind and calm , heat and cold . These , however , he is so far from regarding as interfering with his comfort , that he is rather disposed to hail them , as old and tried friends , who , in all their seeming severity , have given a firmness to his nerves and muscles , and a fortitude to his mind , which not only exempt him from all imaginary woes , but render him superior to many real troubles , endured by others . His books , though not so few as you may think , would doubtless be thought undeserving of the name of a library ; still they are good books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , not only by the honest farmer , but by the proudest scholar in the land . You mistake , too , in supposing he has so little time for reading . In the judicious application of his timhe and strength , he finds several hours every day for the exercise and improvement of the mind ; and one day in seven he gives up more entirely to these noble employnients , than he devotes any other day to manual labor . With // all his apparent roughness , he has an active mind and a feeling heart . I have seen his cheek instantly color on the slightest reflection upon his integrity ; I have seen him shed the tear of sympathy over the sufferings of those , with whom he had no immediate connexion ; and I have seen his eye brighten with joy at the prosperity of those , of whom he had nothing to ask nor expect . In a word , Mr. Low is just such a man , as I should suppose would be happy ; and , if we may trust the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I find , Mr. Macario , I can not defend myself against your arguments . I will consider what you have said , and I think it will have an effect on my future course ; but I had almost forgotten the object of my call . Will you take a short ramble with me this fine morning , and entertain yourself with your musket ? Mr. Macario . What game do you expect to find ? lift . Uden . Now and then a squirrel , perhaps ; and , doubtless , a plenty of birds . Mr. Macario . I keep no such instrument in my house , and through my whole life I never discharged one at a living object . Air . Uden . That is xvonderful , indeed , for a man who has been thirty years in the world . Air . Aiacario . Yes , too wonderful , or at least too rare . A/jr . Uden . In two or three hours last week , I killed ten sparrows , five bob-a*links , and seven robins . Mr. Aiacario . Enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was your motive ? Mr. Uden . I never thought much about motives . I suppose my principal inducement was to exercise and improve myself in sharpshootin* . Air . Macario . And what benefit will result from that ? Ak . Uden . Why , you know it is considered a manly accomplishment . In addition to this , it would give me a great advantage , if ever I should be obliged to fight a duel , or engage in the battles of my con ritry . Air . Aiacario . As to wars and duels , they are subjects of too great moment to be discussed for the present ; but , supposing these things to be ever so justifiable and important , why may you not acquire the art , which is the immediate object , by shooting at something which is incapable of pleasure or pain ? Air . Uden. 0 ! there would be no interest in firing at what is already dead . Air . iacario . Arid do you feel no pain in giving pain ? no regret in destroying the happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you mean to call me a brute ? a quadruped , or a bird ? Air . iacario . Certainly not ; I meant no reproach . I do not blush to own myself a fellow-creature to any thing , which feels , whether beast , bird , or insect . All are members of one great family ; perpetual objects of the same parental care . The same wisdom and beneficence , which made me what I am , formed also the sparrow and the squirrel ; and we have no better title to any thing we call our own , than they have to the life and happiness the God of nature has given them . The same Almighty Power is the guarantee of both . Besides // all this , a great proportion of every civilized community participate in the joys and pains of inferior creatures , and especially in those , which are expressed by clear indications . You hear the robin sing on that tree . it is one of a family which , for these four summers , have made those branches their happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any one , who would not abuse him , than have those birds destroyed or frightened away . I love my books ; and still I would sooner give up , for three months , my whole library , with the single exception of the Bible , than forego the music , the sports , and the entertaining labors of those birds . I love my cherries , and other small fruits ; but not so well as the songs they procure me from many a feathered minstrel . I love the harmony of human voices ; but it does not penetrate my heart like those notes of the robin , which mingle with the fragrance and the smiling beams of the dawn , and seem to be inspired by the immediate breath of heaven . Mir . Uden . Depend on it , Mr. Macario , I shall not kill your birds , nor any that are 14e1y to visit your grounds , or greet you in your common walks , or rides . I suppose , however , you will not object to my killing mischievous animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hr . Macaria . You must be cautious that , in taking this latitude , you kill no mischievous men , wGmen , or children but to be serious , it is no very easy thing to determine what birds , on the whole , are injurious to man . Some of our most observing gardeners contend , that those , which appear most obnoxious , do much more good than harm , in destroying those vermin , which might otherwise devour the tender fruits of the earth . However this may be , the apology will not extend to the inhabitants of the forest , which derive their support from the immediate hand of nature , and not from the labor of man . 15Th . Uden . I have another argument to urge . You were just recommending to me Mr. Audubon 's Ornithology. is this consistent with all you have said ? Mr. Audubon , you know , is one of the greatest fowlers of the age ; and , as I understand , a great part if not the whole of his draughts and descriptions are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you put these things together ? iJir . Macaria . It is true , Mr. Audubon has killed a great variety of birds . lie has traversed with his musket , the most extensive wilds in many different countries ; but he has levied no wanton war on the feathered tribes . He limits the ork of destruction to his particular object , which is perfectly consistent with the tenderest sympathies . Those , who are familiar with his representations , will probably be among the last to sport with the lives of those interesting creatures ; and probably the sacrifice of a few m y become the means of preserving thousands and millions . Ir . Uden . Well , you will not deny that we may destroy animal life for the purpose of food . I suppose you feed every day on beef , mutton , or some other kind of meat , and you will find it difficult to prove , that the life or h*ippiness of a bird is more sacred than that of an ox or a sheep . Ir . Macaria . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without painful regret , that any creature should suffer the agonies of death for the gratification of my palate , or the maintenance of my health and strength . I see no difficulty , however , in making several // important distinctions , which will be much to my purpose . In the first place , our flocks and herds are indebted to us for much of their comfort , their support , their very lives . Without our care and protection they would not be so numerous ; nor would they have those regular supplies of food , which save them in many instances from agonizing hunger , and a variety of other sufferings . 1-Jence we have reason to believe that , when all things are considered , they must be acknowledged to gain more than they lose by their subjection to our disposal . It is not so with the fowls of the air . Few or none of them receive any thing from us , for which their vital blood is a bare compensation . Secondly , there is not , so far as I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys a greater amount of happiness in any given time , than a robin or a lark ; if not , to obtain the same quantity of food that would be supplied by an ox of a thousand weight , we must annihilate three or four thousand times the amount of happiness , by feeding on those birds to the same extent . Again , I should forbear converting into food the robins , who regale me with their songs , on the same principle , which would withhold me from burning the most valuable furniture for common fuel ; because they would contribute unspeakably more to my happiness in another way . Mr. Uden . I will say no more , and I think I shall do no more about fowling or hunting ; but I have been fond of angling . Do the same objections lie against that ? I do not often quote from books , nor have I read many with sufficient attention , to reme . *ber what they say ; but I do recollect , that Thomson describes , with apparent satisfaction , the sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as inculcating good morals . Mr. iliacario . This , perhaps , may be the only exception . The general character of that book is deservedly high . Among other things , it contains the strongest animadversions against the abuse of domestic animals , and other inhabitants of fields and forests ; but , in the instance you refer to , seems to forget that fishes have feeling . This inconsistency in a poet like Thomson is to be regretted . Some , indeed , there are , who profess to believe that the extinction of life in the finny tribes occasions little pain , and many seem to act on this principle . Whether man , beast , or fish , s*mffers most in the approach of death and dissolution , we have no means of determining ; but , to every observing eye , the last presents strong indications of anguish , and it is a general principle , that nature will not lie ; that she has language in the mutest of her creatures , which may safely be trusted . Mr. Uden . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I knew something of your character before ; but , in this conversation , I have learned much more . From several hints , I have no doubt you have an order in the distribution of your time , which I have interrupted , and I beg your pardon for the unseasonable interruption . Mr. Macario . I can easily excuse you , Mr. Uden . It is true , I have an assignment for the first seven hours of the day ; an order , to which I always adhere , so far as it depends on my own choice , and I think no person in ordinary health can be happy , who does not generally devote the forenoon , at least , to some useful employment . I would farther observe , that as society generally agree in devoting the former part of the day to business or study , and that is unquestionably the // best suited to these pursuits , it seems desirable , that , with some unavoidable exceptions , the rule should be sacredly regarded . I have been gratified , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure you , sir , that the interruption will be remembered with pleasure ; and , if you are disposed to indulge the frankness of my conversation , I should be happy to see you at any hour you may think proper . W.H.@@183068726.txt IT seems to be the fate of sciences , of recent origin , to receive the same general treatment bestowed on recent articles of news . When first presented to the public mind , they create a lively interest in that curiosity ,  --  not peculiar to the Athenians ,  --  which finds its gratification in the " hearing and telling of new things , " and this interest is , for a while , sustained by the excitement of sympathy and the zest of opposition . But the impression , on the great majority of minds , lasts hardly longer than the novelty which is its cause . Very few do more than obtain some general , common-place notions on the subject , whatever it may be , so that they can talk , and laugh , and contend about it , e'nough for their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more obvious relations in the case , to the deeper ones of cause and effect . That is to say , among all the speakers , with which this world is filled , there are very few thinkers , very few philosophers . Thus has it been with Phrenology  --  a science whose doctrines it is our present purpose to subject to a dispassionate examination . We think it important that the claims of Phrenology should be considered , and that this , like every other subject of real concern , after it has moved across the public eye , over the busy stage of this world 's action , *and is hastening away , should be recalled to exhibit itself anew and to a closer attention . The first full exposition of Phrenological doctrines in this country , from a man of distinguished mental powers , and remarkable for that happy facility in lecturing , with which he combined the strength and sternness of argument with an easy and beautiful play of wit , and a fund of historical illustration , almost incredibly rich and diversified , finely ' exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement is nearly gone , yet we think it a question which should now be full of seriousness to every mind - Is Phrenology true ? Is it more than a subject for sport ? The claims of this " doctrine of the mind " ' can not be laughed out of existence , and the worst is our own , if they be laughed out of mind . We are neither Phrenologists nor anti-Phrenologists , and shall not , therefore , make a sl ) ecial plea for or against the science , but shall justify or condemn , as we think calm conscience and sober truth direct . We shall thus , probably , offend those , if any there be , who think a whole case should be made of it , and approbation or censure be bestowed in the mass . But we have nothing to say to men , who hold that a thing must be worthy of all praise , or deserving of no praise ,  --  for the truth lies so much the other way , that there can be no full examination and description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ,  --  unpopular as this word is in these days of downright asseveration . But to our subject . It is well known that , in the autumn of 1832 , Dr. Spurzheim began courses of lectures , in establishment of the truth of Phrenology , in Boston and Cambridge . We were so fortunate as to listen to his instructions while he lived , and , since his departure , we have read , with exceeding interest , the works by which , " though dead , he yet speaketh . " Dr. Spurzheim maintained that the brain is the organ of the mind ; that the several parts or convolu- ' tions of the brain are organs of the several powers and dispositions of the mind ; that the strength of the power or disposition depends mainly on the size of the convolution , and the particular temperament of body , with which it is connected ; and so that , to the Phrenologist , it is a mere work of observation to determine the character of any roan 's mind , his weak and prevailing propensities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doctrine , he applies the principles of Phrenology to education , taking the word in its most extensive meaning , as embracing every thing that can act on the physical or mental constitution , even from the moment of the infant 's conception to the day of its death . On his phrenological observations Dr. Spurzheim builds a new theory of mental philosophy , which sets aside all other theories as founded on wrong and delusive processes of generalization , while it pretends itself to rest on a firm basis of fact , and to be necessarily true and undeniable . In view of thes*4*irns , we ask , and propose also to answer , the following questions - What is the nature of the argument hich establishes Phrenology ? In what sense is Phrenology a science of observation ? Is its theory built on observation in a way in which other systems of the mind 's philosophy are not built on observation ? What results and evidences in relation to Phrenology did Dr. Spurzheim exhibit ? How are these results and evidences rightly accounted for ? How far did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it contain truth ? What are the errors of its theory , and the difficulties of its application ? These questions open a // Phrenology. broader field than we can minutely survey ; yet we hope , in brief space , to reach some satisfactory conclusions . The Phrenologist says , My science can not , from the nature of the case , be disputed . It has its direct and impregnable support in undeniable facts . It would surely be a mark of insanity to deny the plain , bold , and honest evidence of the senses , which evidence claims for my philosophy priority to all other philosophies , because no other is built on observation of and induction from , facts . How is this now ? The Phrenologist notices a certain configuration of skull ; - he infers , by physiological reasoning , that , beneath it , the brain conforms to that configuration-and he concludes , from accurate study of the individual mind , that it comprises dispositions and powers , which correspond in strength to such a development . He goes through with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of every disposition and power is indicated by the size of the brain and the temperament of the body . Having observed hundreds of cases , with particular reference to a single faculty , and , in all these cases verified his principle , he announces it , as true of all the millions of the human race that the strength of the faculty does , and must invariably , and by a natural law , correspond to the decisions , which the application of this principle makes . Here , then , we have the observation of the senses , physiological argument , and metaphysical reasoning , all comprised in this observation of facts We have thought that Phrenologists , while they must admit the necessity of all this process , studiously keep a part of it out of view . But how do you make it out that there is metaphysical reasoning ? We reply that one of the elements in our reasoning , before we can come to a single phrenological conclusion , is our opinion of the strength of a certain mental quality-an opinion furnished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion is , or should be , the result of a probable metaphysical argument , requiring a generalization of direct notices of a person 's mental character ; and the phrenological argument is valid no farther than it agrees with this previous opinion , which is based upon purely moral grounds . This is not only a moral or metaphysical argument , but it comes first ; it lies beneath the observation of the senses , and is the essential basis of the argument from facts . This matter needs no elaboration to make it plain ; but the simplest things are oftentimes those least noticed . In the argument for Phrenology , we do then make a generalization of opinions , formed in the common way , respecting particular minds . And why may not other metaphysicians generalize opinions , formed in the same way , of the mental qualities of different individuals ? We by no means deny to the Phrenologist the benefit of such reasoning ; hut why should he deny to others that privilege of argument , which he virtually claims for himself ? The reasoning is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like every body else , has a right to use it ; but we also have a right to point out , in his case , as in that of others , how much of uncertainty is , by the use of it , thrown over his general doctrines . In a purely physical science the case is far different . Certain substances , brought together under known circumstances , produce determinate results . The magnetized steel attracts that which is unmagnetized . The whole process and result of the experiment is visible or tangible . Now the circumstance , which we have mentioned as marking and beginning the process of phrenological reasoning , causes great liability to , if not a certainty of , deception . There is great danger that the Phrenologist will adapt the head to the character , and the character to the head ; that , in support of his favorite theory , he will , unintentionally , perhaps , exaggerate or depreciate facts , which he learns by moral dbservation , so as to suit them to mechanical developments . His imagination will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take from the size of what is already larger than it should be , till his principles are justified . He will observe objects , as suits his convenience , through either end of the telescope . And he will be the more likely to do this , because he compares what is visible with what is invisible . He is bound , after measurement , to regard a material object as of a certain size . He is under no such necessity when judging of an invisible power of the mind with which his fancy may play all sorts of pranks . In judging of the active manifestutions of the mind , he will easily be led to strain and bend facts to his purpose ; for the degree of those manifestations is not measured by the same callipers which give the most exact results as to the skull , and he will be led to make a wrong application of the rule that opinion must mould itself so as to consort with established truth . There is , then , danger and uncertainty , even in the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemn these principles ? By no // Phrenology. means . Neither should he condemn them in other men while he practises them in his owr* person . " Wherein thou judgest another , thou condemnest thyself : for thou , that judgest , doest the same things . " The Phrenologist seems disposed to regard observation , which is the great source of evidence , in a quite contracted view . He would confine it to observation of the senses . But a man may observe with his mind as well as with his eyes ,  --  or rather he observes with his mind always , observing through his eyes sometimes , not with them , and sometimes observing without them . He may observe what passes within him , as well as what passes without him . He may make successive observations within himself respecting the same thing . He has a right to generalize those observations and to form a theory based uponfacts ; for there are facts in a person 's own mind as truly as there are facts in the external world . He has a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have transpired within their own internal experience . From his ow.n observations respectirig himself , and the observations of others respecting themselves , he has a right to construct a system of philosophy . We do not say there is no danger of mistake or error in this kind of observation ; but what do we not owe to it ? Take away the truth it has discovered , and where are we left ? But , much as it has done vastly more remains for it to accomplish . Self-observation , in its highest sense , is a work of great difficulty , demanding far more - effort than is required to range over the whole surface of the earth , and through all the flowery walks of scientific knowledge . But we are come to another question . How are we to account for Dr. Spurzbeim 's judgements as to characters ? Where lay the cause of his wonderfbl skill in deciding as to the mental qualities of those with whom he met ? - for a *vonderful skill , it must be acknowledged , he did possess . Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Was Phrenology the only instrument he used in making up his decisions : ? If in all cases we should reason back from the result t-o -theobvious*cause , without care and scinatiny , many a circumstance should - we invest with  --  a mere fancied efficiency , while the real energy might be hidden from - our eye . Neither is it safe to let any man have the exclusive privilege of reasoning - for ns in regard to his own actions , and passively to receive  --  the causes he may assign , as unquestionab-ly the right ones . A person says to us , I perform such actions ; and bring about such results , by certain means . lie may , in thus saying , deceive us , and yet be honest . He may have been - in such a constant , habitual use - of other means , as to be almost unconscious he does use them ; or , if sensible of this , unconscious how much he relies upon them . To a close observer it may appear , far more evidently than to the operator himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He may , perhaps , have the idea , that the numerous incidental *neasishe uses are only those common means which are within every body 's reach , and which are used on all occasions . - Still , if he has , more than - any other person , stixlied and practised them ; if he alone has reached the farthest limit of their capacity and use ; if this be - true , we must take - distinct notice of it - as being true , and we must judge how far it limits or modifies the peculiar claims of the person before us . Now - we think it rsiust , - in the - first place , - be allowed that Dr. Spuraheim had an altogether unusual power in judging of character . By what knowledge , or by the use of what means , - did he possess and exercise this unusual power ? What was the situation and character of the man himself ? He had devoted himself throughout life , to the study of man 's whole - intellectual and physical nature , with a constant and particular reference to the single point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through a long course of years , to pursue this subject with unremitted assiduity during the day , and to meditate upon it during the night-watches . Every person , on whom his eye rested , was looked at in  --  the same aspect , and ith the same purpose . Every habit he-could form , that would aid his great object , was formed ,  --  not only habits of appli ation , perseverance , and self-sacrifice ; but a thousand different habits of observation . Observation to him was not ene single , unvarying , mechanical , thing ; but it was itself a science , with almost numberless divisions and applications , having reference to  --  a great many distinct classes of facts , and leaving out of view not the most trivial , incidental , and , as other men might think , insignificant , showings-forth of the interior spirit . All ages , all conditions in life , all kinds and degrees of health and sickness , all states of society , all human institutions , all local or general customs , prejudices , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // human and divine ,  --  the whole race of men in its broad general characteristics , every nation and tribe in its specific peculiarities ) every genus and variety of individual minds ,  --  all these means , by the power of Spuraheim 's mind , were made to serve one purpose , to converge to one point , that of mental manifestations in their connection with mental oualities . Such a course could not but furnish him with numerous principles of jrocedure and rules of judgement , the combination of all which might give him ) even without the peculiar phrenological doctrine , a power of determining character from appearance , ( using the word in its broad sense , ) never possessed before . But we do nut see that this combination could have given him the power which he actually possessed and displayed . We think it necessary to place among these means the knowledge which Dr. Spurzheim had of the connection between cerebral development and mental power . But this knowledge was not all , and very far indeed from being all . How could it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which Dr. Spurzheim had disciplined himself ? Indeed , one of his own works is on Physiognomy ,  --  and how great skill must his keen and observant eye have gained in piercing through the expressions of countenance to the mind beneath ? How familiar must lie have been with the countless varieties of expression that are met with in the world , so that , at length , he could , in any given case , connect the physical appearance of the person with the real condition of the mind . How many states , in the aspect of the countenance , must to him have been deeply significant , which to others were meaningless , as the eye of a body no longer informed and possessed by the spirit . What delicate perception and discrimination must he have had in analysing that changeful vers Aility of look in which varied light and shade are ever appearing , mingling with each other , and vanishing . The feeling with which he looked upon the face of man must have been as different from the common feeling , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanders carelessly through the sparkling firmament , from that of the Astronomer , as , with an eye full of instructic . he reaches into the " upper deep . " We do not , therefore , at - all wonder , that novices in the science have never applied it with sign-al success . They have not only been unable to understand Phrenology itself , so well as did Dr. Spurzheim , but they have failed principally , perhaps , from their great ignorance of that obser ation which was to him a science in itself , and from that almost entire want of that general knowledge , shill , and sagacity in judging of human - nature , - which he possessed . We hesitate not to declare it as our opinion that , had they been able to make the more accurate application of the strictly phrenological principles , yet , without his other knowledge and skill , they would have made perpetual mistakes . Still , we admit that Dr. Spurzheim was materially assisted in his judgements by Phrenology , properly so - called . We - believe it to be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , the organ of the mind , and that differences of character are connected with differences of brain . But we also believe that the observations of Phrenologists themselves prove that they have been in doubt and in error as te particular parts of the brain . We believe the science to be imperfect , defective , and sometimes positively wrong . And we shall now proceed to state the reasons of our belief . - it furnishes very strong presumption that the nomenclature of powers , which Phrenology presents , may be incomplete , when we consider the simple fact that a material substance is made the index and representative of the mind , and a correspondence asserted between the divisions of the spiritual nature and those of a bodily organ . There is no end to the parts , into which matter may be separated , and , as we suppose the Phrenologist maintains no such doctrine as that each of the numberless variety of mental experiences has some particular one out of the equally numberless fibres of the brain for its organ and its expression ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of mental manifestations to particular fundamental powers , which powers he connects with certain main divisions in the great nervous mass . The question then comes-Is he sure of the number and boundaries of these main divisions ? He says , indeed , that the convolutions , though they can not each be included within mathematical lines , and do imperceptibly slide into each other , are vet sufficiently distinct for all practical purposes ,  - -  so distinct that one can not be confounded with another . Why than does he mark upon his bust two portions of brain as uncertain ? Why does he hesitate to call them oraans of the mind , whispering something indistinctly about the probability or possibility of there being in the mind such principles as Alimentiveness and Vitativeness , each with its corresponding organic apparatus ? If his pretence , // that the organs can be so well distinguished from each other , be true , how can he be in doubt whether these portions are in fact the organs of special powers of the mind ? Why did Dr. Sporzheim himself admit that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of particular ( lispositions , may be hereafter divided into two ? Why are Dr. Spurzheim and Mr. Combe at variance as to the extent of the organ of Ideality ? that organ , as marked in the bust of the latter , running far into the region of Acquisitiveness , as delineated in the bust of the former . Mr .. Combe 's organ of Acquisitiveness lies below his organ of Ideality , and very near , , nay , partly on common round with , 1 ) r . Spurzheim 's organ of Secretiveness . Moreover , Mr. Combe considers the organ as including two dispositions ,  --  the anterior portion , in his view , indicating the taste for the beautiful , the posterior expressing the passion for the sublime . We have not only a difference as to the dispositions connected with different parts of the brain , but also in the lines of separation established between the different organs that make up the whole brain .. Still it is said the organs can be easily distinguished . Who shall decide in this disagreement of the doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is easy to distinguish the particular organs of the mind , by their own dissension , . they confute. * One of the most boasted excellencies of the Phrenological system is , that it gives a just , full , and scientific analysis of the mind . We think this praise must undergo serious abatement . As has already been remarked , we can take distinct notice , and obtain a sure knowledge , of many facts which exist in connection with the activity of the interior spirit . Now we shall presume to lay down the principle that , any of these undeniable facts being inconsistent with any one of the Phrenological doctrines , that doctrine must be set aside . We shall confine ourselves to the most important point made out against Phrenology by this principle . We think no person , who has not allied himself to a system of pure necessity , will gainsay us , when we affirm that internal self-observation brings us to a knowledge of the freedom of the will . The Phrenological philosophy does not contain this principle . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any distinct sense , a part of the mind , and preserve any appearance of consistency . For , at the outset , it describes the whole mind as being composed of certain affective and intellectual powers which it names . It admits but these two kinds of principles . Every thing is either a blind propensity or a faculty of the understanding- The intellectual powers it distinguishes into those for acquiring knowledge , and those for arranging , comparing , and reasoning upon , the knowledge acquired . Thus the whole man is made to consist of a bundle of powers , whose nature is defined , whose scope is determined , and from whose individual ' and simultaneous action and mutual influence and sympathy , comes every thing in the wide variety and range of mental manifestations . Now in all this we find no such distinct principle as a free-will . There is no place for such a principle in the catalogue . Here , then , is this Will " a stumbling-block and rock of offence " in the way of the Phrenologist . It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reasoned out of the possession of this principle than they will be reasoned out of their existence . As it is allowed no distinct independent place in the mind , it must , if it be permitted ' to exist at all , be in some way manufactured from the other received principles of human nature . And , we apprehend , the Phrenologist might quite as well have admitted that he can give no account whatev&amp;r of the matter , as present the explanation he has presented . * Nor is this the only case of difference of'opinion between these great expounders and advocates of Phrenological principles . There is another which we wish to mention here , as it may serve to throw some light on the question as to the absolute conclusiveness of that mode of argumentation by which Phrenology is estahtished . Spnrzheim calls a particular portion of the brain the organ of Inhabitiveness , rhe disposition being that by which each species of animals has a " propensity to live in some partictitar local situation . " Dr. Gall , before him , had called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Mr. Combo , after him , call , the mann portion the organ of Concentrativeness !  --  the object of the disposition connected with which be defines to be , " to maintain o or more powers in simultaneous and combined activity , so that they may be directed towards one object . " Thus the same cerebral part is proved ' to be the organ of three widely different propensities , by that sure instrument for ascertaining trmtth ,  --  Observation ! To be sure Mr. Combe remarks that " there appears to be nothing in the notions of Dr. Spurzheim concerning Inhabitiveness inconsistent with the mon extensive views now taken of the functions of the faculty ' . " We do not know what Mr. Combe means by the word irmconsisteney ,  --  we only beg leave to say that two , or rather three , distinct faculties of the nmind can never be one , and that it is rather strange if the same organ can furnish a sphere of action to a number of propensities that have imothing in common with each other . Conmmon-sense people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove , by observation , the most diverse conclusions as to t e same thing , they mhy sometimes be wrong when they agree . // Phrenology. lie would thus have been spared the vain labor of attempting to create something out of nothing . But let us consider , for a moment , the phrenological view . Dr. Spuraheim defines Will to he the decision of the understanding , adopted according to motives  --  the understanding having been previously defined , as consisting of the perceptive powers and the reflective faculties of Causality and Comparison . The motives " result principally from the propensities and sentiments , and sonictimes from the perceptive taculties ; hence they are as numerous and energetic as these , and the animal which has many and powerful faculties , has many and vigorous motives , and freedom in proportion . " In natural consequence from his views of the mental analysis , Dr. Spurzheim goes on to maintain that the principle of Causation , the relation nif cause and effect , obtains , with equal rigidness , in the physical , intellectual , and moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every motion in the external universe , results finns the operatiun of some necessary and uncontrolable cause . We do not see how , on this principle , merit or demerit can be possible . Volition , choice , is made an effect as truly and in the same sense as pulsation of the heart is an effect . Our power of free choice is , indeed , an effect irs being the creation and gift of the Almighty , and in being every moment preserved to us by his power . Our free-choosing exists in cousequence of our power to choose freely . Dr. Spurzheim says , and says rightly , that one of the conditions to free-will is a plurality of motives . To adopt the phraseoJogy of the courts , this is not a " causa causans " but a " causa sine qua non . " Another condition , which he states , is obviously necessary , namely , the influence of the will upon the instruments by which the actions are performed . His only other condition in order to free-will is the Will itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will ? It is , in Isis view , the decision of the understanding . It is the conclusion arrived at by the faculties of Comparison and Causality , which , as they are more or less clear and vigorous , decide more or less correctly as to the value of the motives presented , and whose decision determines the action performed , amid is , indeed , identical with volition . Where , then , do we find , after all , any thing like freedom , any thing like worthiness or guilt ? We have nothing to say as to the character of the minds given us ; we have nothing to say as to the character of the impressions that shall act upon those minds ; we have nothing to say in reference to the decisions the intellect shall make as to the motions that shall succeed those impressions , and nothing to do but to render a necessary obedience to those decisions . There is no central point in our nature ; - it is completely spread apart from its junction , and one part of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom . The con ' scious single individual is destroyed . We maintain ' that volition is not an operation of the reasoning power ,  --  nor an effect of the reasoning power con* sidered as a cause . It is in itself the immediately efficient cause of action . After all other influences have been set in motion ,  --  after any operations that may have taken place in the intellect , or in the feelings , and whatever virtue may belong to these influences and operations , there is still wanting the direct cause of action-there is yet ' a call for the movensent of the Will . We may be requested to explain circumstances in reference to the Will , which are beyond the mind 's power ' o'f explanation ; but we have , every moment , the self-consciousness that we can do or not do certain things according to our will . I walk over a magazine of gun-powder , with a red-hot iron in my hand . My feelings and my intellectual powers are in actnon ,  --  weighty motives of various kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mnay be , I feel that I have the power of exploding or not exploding the inflammable material beneath me , as I will , and that , in the course which I choose to take , I may resist all the motives that can be accumulated upon me . According to Dr. Spurzheim 's views , Will ; exists in very different degrees in different . mnen ,  --  being proportionate to their intellectual power . His own language is ,  --  " Now , by caihina Will the mental operation which ' appreciates the value of the desires , and chooses among them , it is evident that it depends on , and is proportionate to , intellect . " We must believe that the Phrenological system makes no real acknowledgement of the doctrine of Free-Will , and that it makes all our actions the result of something very nearly analogous to mechanical necessity . It matters little whether the machinery be usore or less complicated . The motion of a chronometer 's index , is as much the efl*ct of material pressure as the motion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Phrenologist should struggle somewhat to get rid of this conclusi n . Thus , Dr. Spurzheim says be does not believe in necessity as irresistibility . But , immediately a'fter this profession of belief , he goes on to show how our actions // 473 are irresistible , which , we think , will satisfactorily appear , to the careful and candid reader , to be the tendency of the reasoning pursued in the section on " Free-Will , or Liberty and Responsibility . " It matters not to the point under discussion , that we have a plurality of motives , if there is no choosing power farther than the decision of the mere reasoning faculty . If that which is deemed the stronger motive , by the faculties which are limited to the tracing of causes and the comparing of relations , must inevitably overcome that which these faculties esteem the weaker motive , our actions are , to all intents and purposes , of a moral kind , as irresistible as if we had but a single propensity , and were under the influence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives . Phrenology does not , as we have already remarked , bring man 's nature to a point . There is no singleness ,  --  no self ,  --  the mind is regarded as in the condition of a bundle of shafts bound together by a leathern thong . In speeking of that condition to Free Will which consists in a plurality of motives , Dr. Spurzheim asks- " Who does not feel a wish for something , or an inclination to do some act , which he combats by other motives ? " He combats . If all that is meant here be , that certain motives spring up , and , by their own energy , overpower the motives previously acting , and determine one 's course of conduct independently of his will , the language is extremely deceptive . We are inclined to construe it differently , and consider it as an involuntary acknowledgement of what we regard , and have stated as the truth on this subject . We have here an illustration of the often-observed fact , that a truth will frequently , by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who , on account of his love of a system , neither perceives , it clearly nor admits it freely . We do , and must , in our language , every moment imply the freedom of the Will . Dr. Spurzheim seems to have been confirmed in what we must call his erroneous doctrine of the Will , by th ' undoubted fact , that motives operate upon , and , influ- ' ence , the Will , and thus must have an ulterior effect on the conduct . Thus , in treating of that kind of necessity in which he professes his belief , he says- " Motives are proposed whenever we wish to produce actions* " " The principle of causation in the moral world . is expressed by the connection between motives and actions . " " Pt reality , man is subjected to the law of causation like the rest of nature . " We admit the existence , the necessity , the power of motives . But that we may , in any proper sense be moral beings , we affirm also the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resist , as well as to obey , motives . We admit gladly the doctrine that a man may combat motives ,  --  that I combat , that " he combats " them . But by what ? By that voluntary d*termina'tion-that freedom of Will , which consists in ' being able to do or not do an action , to which our inclinations may strongly move us ,  --  to pursue or not pursue a course of conduct to which powerful motives incite us . The peculiar action which motives have on the Will we can not , *of course , entirely comprehend . It is certainly a very sweeping conclusion that , because they have some power over its operations , they must be all-influential . We can not look so clearly and piercingly into the mind as to trace , with exactness , all its actions and re-actions , all its modifications of external and ' internal influences . The interior spirit does not perform its nice and varied evolutions surrounded by a transparent medium , through which it may be observed . Itself can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave this point . The great rule of judgement which Phrenology proposes at the outset , is , that the strength of any disposition is proportionate to the size of its organ and the activity of the bodily temperament . But it afterwards deviates seriously from this rule , coming into ' a sort of inconsistency with , or desertion of , itself . To express clearly and at once what we mean , we will take an example in one of its modes of deviation . The Phrenologist enumerates in his catalogue the organ of Tune , which he affirms to have been large in all eminent musical composers , as in Weber , 1-landel , Haydn , Mozart , &amp;c. and which , when large , always indicates a fondness or ' passion for music . Now , in order to ascertain which of two persons has the most of this fondness , we must compare their respective organs of Tune , as to size , and ' their temperaments , as to activity . This is a very intelligible direction , and we proceed , as well as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bet now the Phrenologist brings to view another principle , altogether inconsistent with a full and confident reliance on those already mentioned . He tells us that the effect of exercise ' upon the organ of Tune is not proportionately to increase its size , but to give greater facility of action to its fibres . Thus the power of the organ , and , consequently , the strength ' of the mental disposition , depends partly upon the facility with which ' the nervous fibres move . Bat what means does Phrenology // Phrenology. give for ascertaining the degree of facility which exercise has given ? None at all . The facts in the case are entirely out of the reach of any external observation . A superiority of size in the organ of one person over that of the same organ in a second person might be atoned for , in the organ of the latter , by a greater facility of action . Still further , if we have not , in our conversations with Phrenologists , entirely misapprehended their meaning , they understand that , apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions and organs , and apart also from the particular temperament of the body , the particular constitution of the brain itself is of importance in any given case , in determining the strength of the affective and intellectual powers . We do not know that this principle is laid down , though it is strongly hinted at , in the works of those who are regarded as authorities . And l ) erhal ) s it is used as a principle , by the advocates of the science , more frequently to elude the grasp of objections that are made , and to save Phrenology from the shock of its own evidently false conclusions in particular cases-false , we meau , if its more common or inciples of every-day use and judgement are alone considered , than for any other purpose . Thus , if the rise of any particular organ in any person 's brain , in connection with the temperament of his body , do not give any thing like a satisfactory account of the degree in which the power exists , we are told that there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same size , indicates greater mental power . Now , we ask , how are we to come at the condition of the brain as to this particular of compactness . We can not look through the skull , as through a transparent vase . Still Phrenology itself forbids us to judge wholly ( so fbi as we judge by the character of the brain itself ) of the power of a disposition by its size . We must judge by a test which neither hand nor eye can reach-we must modify our conclusions by a principle which we can not use . rhe* may be cases of comparison in which greater compactness , like that greater facility of action in the cerebral fibres of which we just spoke , may compensate for lesser size , of brain , and we be none the wiser for it . Once more - it is said that one brain may have a greater fineness of texture than another . But , again , we ask , how are we to know any thing about , or allow any thing for , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the common principles of Phrenology are shown to be seriously at fault , to have these ulterior ones to resort to ,  - -  and when a man has a smaller organ and yet a stronger disposition , to say it is probable he has a more active , compact , or finely wrought and constructed brain . This division of principles , into what may be called the exoterie and esoteric , may preserve the science from downright refutation , may give it a character for recantatiorm and non-committal ; but can not save it from a general distru t , and a cold , uncertain , and uncordial reception . But , perhaps , the difficulties of which we have been speaking , are not essential difficulties , inherent in the science , and ineradicable from it , but are incident to its gradual development . The analogy of all sciences , shows that such difficulties must be expected to exist . Perhaps post-mortem and other examinations may , hereafter , establish such correspondencies and relations between the various parts of the animal system , that the character of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertained in particular respects , we shall thence be able to infer , with strong probability of correctness , the character of those which are not seen . The present doctrine of Temperaments may have a connection with such correspondencies and relations . If this should take place , external observation might determine , ultimately , though not directly , the respects of facility of action , compactness of material , and fineness of texture . But , at present , we can form no accurate opinion on these matters , unless some miracle should introduce us into the " penetralia " of the mind , where we can feel of the brain and see how hard it is , and examine it thoroughly with finger and eye , as we do broadcloth , to ascertain its texture , and , with watch in hand , note the rapidity with which its fibres move . If the degrees of difference , in the particulars under consideration , are great in different brains , Phrenology now loses much of the proof that might be adduced in support of its general doctrines ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to take an instance relating to one of the points ,  --  . that the fibres in this man 's brain can dance with a gay rapidity , while , in that of another , they shall have a movement which is painful , sluggish , sloth-like . But there is another point , which , perhaps , may properly be noticed in connection with those already mentioned . The doctrine of the Phrenologist is , not that the brain constitutes the mind , but that it is the material organ by which the mind acts . His idea is , that there is something immaterial , beneath the cerebral // 4 organization , which does constitute the mind , the spirit of man ; but that this spirit needs the nervous contexture , by which it is surrounded in order to its manifestations in this life . Such , if we understand his language , is the doctrine maintained by Dr. Spurzheim . In replying to the charge of Materialism , brought against Phrenology , he says , " The expression organ designates an instrument by means of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the organs of voluntary motion , but they are not the moving power : the eyes are the omgan of sight , hut they are not the faculty of seem * . We separate the faculties of the soul or of the mind from the organs , and consider the cerebral parts as the instruments by means of which they manifest themselves . ' We do not , at present , intend to examine how far this is consistent with some other phraseology about the dependence of the mind on the brain ; but how it affects the conclusions drawn from the application of the common principles of Phrenology . The mind is here allowed , then , to be something distijact from matter , and , primarily , to contain in itself all the powers and qualities which it manifests by means of an organic apparatus . It is allowed to possess in itself , for instance , the power of Causality , the power of Comparison , &amp;c. while it is enabled to manifest these powers by means of the organs of causality and comparison . T*ow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence must possess , intrinsically , powers more or less vi orous and soaring ? Is it not a conclusion , established by all antecedent l ) robabilities , that the mind of one man must posse.s , inherently , more energetic powers than that of another ? Is it not as likely that that crder , which is " I-leaven 's first law , ' should obtain among the spiritual natures that make up a part of his creation , as among any other class of things ? We should certainly suppose , that while all irieri are endowed witla facialties , the same in number , and the same in kind , these faculties would be found existing with all degrees of essential energy . Well ,  --  it is mind acting upon and usino material organs that gives rise to mental manifestations , and , according to the energy of action in these or , ans , will be the energy of the manifestations . The orgamas must derive the energy of their mental action , so to speak , from the mind itself ; and , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this action will depend on the vi or of the faculties inherent in the mind . It must depend greatly on the power of the mind , as to the sum of mental energy , which tlan organ. , a it were , make visible . Now , suppose the organization in two cases to be equally good , but , in one of the cases , there is a far greater intrinsic mental energy than in the other . The more vigorous mind will require its organization to give a fitting token of its power . The organization will be pressed to the utmost limit of its capacity , and a far greater degree of vigor will be mon&amp;*ested in this case than is expressed in the other , when no purely phrenological examanatmon can detect the reason . Thus we see that the Phrenologist 's own definition makes the various parts of the mind only the tools by which it is enabled , in this world , to perform the work " given it to do . " To make the point in qmaestion clear , by a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a set of tools equally good in all respects , Irat one of the men fain ' exceeds the other in strength of muscle and in skill , and is thns able to effect double the labor in the same period of time . Here we see the character of the agent himself is of great importance , as well as the character of the instruments he uses . The application of this to the mind is obvious . There must , it is evident , in consequence of the superiority of the inner spirit , be anore of fullness and energy in the manifestations of the naind ,  --  just as water , in the familiar experiment of Natural Philosophy , is forced through a series of apertures , with more velocity , and in greater abundance , accordino to the oreater force of the central pressure . XVe doubt whether the Phrenologist would like to have the question of the immnateriality and inherent energy of the mind pressed strongly upoaa him , and whether , if it were so pressed , he would not be obliged to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines , or taking refuge in pure Materialism . And whenever the mind shall be identified within the brain , and every thiiig be brought under the power of mechanical influences and causes , then we may bid adieu to every thin spiritoal and noble ; we may despair of ever seeing the soul arise to a consciousness of its capacities and destiny ; we may hope no longer to witness any exhibitions of lineroic virtue ; then we shall no longer laear , even in the high places of the earth-on the eminences of religion - of self-fore self-denial , self-devotion , and self-martyrdom , in every glorious cause ; but the Arch-fiend , Satan , may address this woild , which , even now , is a world of very dubioina ly mingled light and gloom , as be once addressed the w id of darknes. // J*/sreno1o*y. " flail , horrors hail , Infernal world ! and thou , profoundest hell , Receive thy new possessor ! " 0 ! never may many tongues repeat the language of an English lecturer , ( we mean Lawrence ) in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances the doctrine that the mind is annihilated at the death of the body . It may be in consequence of the different exercise of the will in different cases , and the difficulty of which we have spoken , that Phrenology , with so many happy decisions as to character , so frequently finds its practical judgements entirely at fault , and meets with so many cases , with which it can do nothing , which are beyond its comprehension , and at strife with its previous experience ,  --  with so many cases that are like the ocean 's tenth-wave dasbings on the shore . Two men with the same developments , may have very different essential powers of mind , and here is one source of the difficulty and error to which Phrenology is exposed . Two men may have habitually willed irs widely different directions , and here is another liability which the science incurs of going astray . A person wills for a long course of years to discipline his intellectual powers , to expand , and purify , and elevate his affections , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which " war against the soul " into rightful sabservience . This is the strong and persevered-in purpose of life . Another person wills to suffer all his powers and affections to run a loose and careless course , to indulge excessively his meaner passions , to be " earthly , sensual , devilish . " And here is the purpose of his life . The former is a good man , and the latter a bad one . And how vast the difference made by being good or had , by willing rightly or wrongly , in the character of any mind , not only in the richness and purity of the affections , but also in the rigor and acuteness of the understanding ! We must mention here another difficulty , in addition to those already noticed ,  --  a difficulty arising from the importance of relation and mutual influence among the powers . Dr. Spurzheiin 's ideas , as to what is called the principle of Association , take their peculiar character from his general doctrines . He says that " faculties whose organs are situated near each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will readily excite each other . " Now it is important to have a correct idea of the power exerted by these actions and re-actions from one organ to another . One organ may be excited by another to an - energy which is far from being inherent in itself . Now to judge what Associations will be most frequent and powerful , is a work which requires accurate knowledge of his peculiar circumstances , as well as the greatest skill in discrimination ,  --  yes , metaphysical discrimination and abstract argument , which Dr. Spurzheim seemed to hold in so slight esteem . This doctrine of Association furnishes one of the numerous " cities of refuge , " to which Phrenology may retreat from the sword of argumentative discomfiture . If ho can not , in a given case , account for the strength of a particular power hy the size of the corresponding organ , and can not relieve himself from his difficulty by any of those probable considerations which be has collected , in so large abundance , in the spirit of a far-sighted caution against emergencies , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mutual excitement which subsists among the organs . Take an illustration to this point Suppose two persons studying the pure mathematics . One of them far excels the other . The Phrenologist examines their heads , and says - No wonder there should be this difference , when the first has an organ of Calculation so much larger and finer than the second . Who can resist , he exclaitns , such a confirmation of Phrenology ? But anon we find another case . There are two persons , - one of whom has - an organ of Calculation considerably smaller than that of the other , but still exhibits greater mathematical skill , and - makes more rapid progress . But the Phrenologist , nothing daunted , busies himself in ascertaining the - condition of the other organs ,  --  and lo ! again he makes out his case , for he finds that , t-hough the person in question has a smaller organ of Calculation , he has a larger organ of Approbativeness , or Love of Approbation . This latter organ , i-n - his view , urges the former to the utmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it can - be forced to accomplish . But , even though the operator should fail here , he does not completely lose his footing , but finds the cause of this - unexpected superiority of power in a greater development of Conscientiousness , urging a man to do his whole duty in the study pursued , or in the greater - fullness of Benevolence , inciting him to severe efforts , by which he may hope to benefit his fellow-men . Thus the Phrenologist is armed at all points , and shielded on all skles ,  --  he is covered all over with plated steel , in which there is not an aperture large enough to admit even a lady 's hod*. // 477 kin . Take another case , somewhat different . A person gives evidence of extraordinary mental vigor , but has a small head . Ah cries the Phrenologist , only observe how admirably proportioned it is in its several parts . flow perfectly fine the adjustment of the various organs to each other , rendering this head as much superior to some others , which exceed it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a machine , which , though small , has a perfect harmony of parts , is snore excellent than a large one which is coarse , ill-jointed , and self-discordant . . IV'ow the Phrenologist finds the cause of general superiority of understanding in the largeness of the intellectual portion compared with the animal region . . /lnon he accounts for the same thing by the strength of the animal passions , which urge the intellect to greater efforts , and ( lying behind it in the head ) act as a compressed force , pressing the intellect forward to greater exertions , as the inflamed powder imparts , unseen , velocity and force to the ball of the cannon . We now proceed to make a few remarks on the difficulties which perplex us in the actual process of applying phrenological principles to real life . And , first , we would inquire , with the immense varieties of disposition , and the vast disparities of power , which exist in the world , do we find equal and correspondent varieties of cerebral development ? Do not persons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most marked distinctions of intellectual and moral character ? The Phrenologist would answer the first question affirmatively , and the latter negatively . He can decide for himself in this matter ; but let other men decide for themselves , and we doubt whether there will be a unanimity of belief . But how great are the differences which actually exist ? A half inch in length , from the orifice of the ear , in the organ of Causality , makes the difference between him who can account for hardly any thing and him who can account for all things . Now between these two characters lie a long series of individuals , with an equally long scale of power differently graduated to . each , and for all this range from higher to lower capacity , in the brain we are to traverse through the distance of half an iiich ! But there is great *lifficulty in aseertaining correctly those differences of brain that actually exist . There is hardly one man out of ten who can tell which head of two is the largest , unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find it very great . The size of the body , of the face , and the great difference of shape in heads , create difficulty . The size*of the head , considered as an object by itself , it requires a very nice judgement to determine , bounded as it is by such complicated curvilinear lines . There are iso points about it to which we can adapt the mind . It is so " smooth-rubbed ' that we-can get hold of it at no place . If we begin to measure by a cautious survey of the whole periphery , we find our eye sinking into hollows , and traveling up hills , and often stumbling on account of unexpected falls and rises , in the common phrase . And , after it has got through its journey , it can tell but little of what it has seen . It must travel the same route again and again before it can form an opinion . The object , of which it is to judge , is so much " sni generis , " being neither cubical nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , t taking from every shape , and mid its selections from all form , havinu* itself hardly any form at all , is very difficult to be comprehended . We should be inclined to call it shapeless did we not recollect heine ' once corrected for rendering that passage in Virgil 's description of the Scythian winter , " Sed jacet aggeribus riveis informis , " with " but ( the earth ) lies shapeless with drifts of snow , " and told that nothing is shapeless . But , in truth , this is a serious matter . A person finds himself deceived , again and again , without remedy , after having seen the causes of previous mistakes . He finds his judgement still at fault , after having corrected it of almost numberless false courses . At the very moment he congratulates himself that he is no longer deceived by a large face , he is led into error by a narrow forehead ; while he believes that a high sincipital region is the prime quality of all cerebral expansion , and practises on his belief he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that there is little volume of brain where the head is a mere cone with a pointed apex ; but a broad-topped head looks much like a flat head , and no one would be ambitious of the developments of a Carib . At first we go on the idea that an ample front is the unfailing mark of strong and noble intellect ; but , afte raIl , we find it a very deceitful one , for a man 's forehead may be broad without being deep , as we meet with some showy thinkers who are the farthest possible from being profound . We are perplexed and confounded by all the varieties of long heads and short ones , broad and narrow , high and low , and are at length ready to despair of ever being able to judge with any accuracy on the subject . It umay be thought that much of the reasoning we have , in the course of the previous remarks , presented , only goes to show an uncertainty in the application // Phrenology. of phrenological principles , without denying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reply may he made to such reasoning that Phrenology does not pretend to decide with minute accuracy , hut only to determine the inherent stren , th of particular powers , upon the force of tendencies , which may or may not r suIt in certain precise actions . We have a number of remarks to make on this very point . We say , first , that notwithstanding the suggestion mentioned , it is still true that we must judge of powers hy actions , and argue as to the presence or absence of a particular talent in the mind itself from the presence or absence of the manifestations of that talent . We can not see the mind of a friend ; there is no immediate contact of spirit with spirit , hut the results of spiritual action m ' st flow out into the material organization , and from thence into our enses , so as to he carried as proofs to our minds . And , secondly , we say the Phrenologist is peculiarly confined to this mode of judgement , as he restricts himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , observe in our own minds a faculty or talent which has not yet appeared to other minds in any outward act . But the Phrenologist is unwilling to depend on this at all , as a means of advancing mental philosophy . Observation of what is external is his decisive criterion . And thus , though he is not justly required to show that , in consequence of the possession of a particular power , certain acts , which shall have been in all respects defined beforehand , will take place ; yet it is required that particular actions be performed , displaying that power in the exact degree in which it is said to exist ,  --  otherwise , the very proof on which rests the existence of the power falls to the ground . And , thirdly , we have to s* y that we are by no means thorough opposers of Phrenology ; and , if we shomald pretend to be so , it might easily be shown , by comparing some remarks , that have fallen from us duriorm this discussion , with the strictures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been playing at cross purposes . But any such remarks have not slipped carelessly from our pen . Though we regard Phrenology , as it now exists , as liable to many objections , yet we are perTectly persuaded that there is in nature a broad and strong foundation for such a science . Phrenology exposes itself to strong objection from pretending to give a full analysis of the mind , and a just account of the will . And in general we think it is too exhorbitant in its claims . Yet we do not assert , we do not believe , that Doctors Gall and Spurzheim have labored in vain . They are great benefactors to the human race ,  --  how great , time has yet to reveal . Like its other benefactors , they have bequeathed a legacy of truth mingled with errors ; errors from which the first discoverers could not in this case , as they can not in any such case , free the principles that have just seen the light , and which benefactors future to them must remove . The ore is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , but it is encumbered with dross and polluted by baser metals . All it needs for its purification is to be subjected to a proper heat in the furnace of truth-seeking minds . - As Phrenology exists , it is not so much a science , already established , infallible in its principles , and sure in its particular decisions , as a vast and magnificent process Lfrom which such a science is to result . It has already brought to view numerous and important relations between the mind and the body . it has made an opening in a new direction from which a long vista leads the mental eye to the prospect of a new and glorious system of truth ; but that truth is as yet only halfrevealed , and does not appear in its distinct splendor and beauty . And we are not of the number of those , who so much dread innovation as to tlmink that no new discoveries can be made in the vast world of Human Nature , and no Columbus bring to light new continents in that wide sea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring us round to the point from which we started , who are willing to believe that the old chart is perfectly correct , that no fictitious description is to be blotted from it , and no new and beautiful region of reality drawn . It is easy to think as we always have thought , and do as we always have done ; but Truth at least must be permnitted to break up the fountains of erroneous thought in the great deep *f the Human Mind , and to disturb the erroneous practices of human life . For ourselves , we shall feel amply rewarded for having instituted this examination of sonae difficulties in Phrenology , if it shall do any thing to induce others to examine the systemn , to labor in freeiner it from error , in limiting its pretensions to their just extent , in consolidating its various parts , and advancimmg and perfecting whatever of troth it muly contain . Sciences are not freed fromn difficulty by miracles which , like the lightning , do their work in a moment , but by the rerious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phrenology , as in that of other systems of partial truth , there must be much of argo- // 479 ment and controversy ; but we lament the bitterness and rancor that have been exhibited , and would roost earnestly deprecate their future recurrence . We must regard it as very dangerous for any mind to receive Phrenology , in its present state , as a system of perfect truth . But what wonder that it should now be liable to serious objection ? What are thirty years for the establishment and perfection of such a science ? What are they but the period of its feeble infancy and doubtful existence ? We believe , then , that Phrenology is to advance , not by being at once extended over the world , and received , as uniningled truth , into all minds , but , as prelinimary to that , by its own purification . A system must be pure before it can become universal . The God of truth never suffers all his creatures to be deluded by a false philosophy . He never suffers the errors , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend as poisonous mildew on the broad surface of the common rriind . But how and by whom is Phrenology to be purified and perfected ? By being examined in the spirit of truth , by being defended in the spirit of truth , and by being opposed in the spirit of truth . By those who shall study it with honesty , and speak of it with candor . It is to be carried forward even by being disbelieved , and opposed , and rejected . We " speak the words of truth and soberness . ' There is a work for honest opposition to do in strengthening every system of truth , and in giving to it an immortal existence in the mind . And , as we believe Phrenolo y will live , so we believe the name of Spurzheim will not die . His fame shall shine brightly into distant times , and remote generations shall rise up and " call him blessed . " And those will not forget him who gazed at his speaking countenance , in whose expression the most enchanting benevolence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thoughts were pictured ere his broken English named them , and who drank in the sincere , earnest , almost supplicating , and yet independent , and manly , tones of his eloquence . None will forget him , who were within the sphere of his personal moral power and moral sympathy ,  --  a power and sympathy that gathered round him a multitude of ardent friends , that made many a foot swift to do him good , that called forth from many a heart heaven-ward volitions for blessings to his spirit ,  --  that cast a veil of sadness upon every face , when Death , like the blood-thirsty soldier bursting in upon Archimedes , dealt his sudden and unrelenting blow  --  and collected thousands of heaving breasts and weeping eyes around his lifeless remains , to express grief in solemn silence , while the funeral word was*said over them and to follow , in slow procession , the benevolent stranger to his tomb .

No situation in life can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . rrhe vicious all along act upon this supposition , and therefore the children of this world are , in their generation , not only wiser , but more successful , than the children of light . Good men are too apt to suppose , that virtuous intentions alone are a sufficient rule and guide of action . Hence* their undertakings constantly fall through , and the cause of virtue is rendered feeble and ridiculous in the eyes of the world . If there ever was a good man , Rev. J. R- was one . Fe*v excelled him as a scholar , , and no one , who knew him , could for a moment question the purity and integrity of his heart . But he lacked discretion , and because he had not the wisdom of the serpent , f*rvent piety and conscientious exactness in the performance of duty , could not preserve him harmless as the dove . He was settled over a frank , hospitable , intelligent and united people , and for a time lived happily and usefuily among them . They were not a suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence . Little acts of indiscretion they gladly suffered to pass by ; and even more important matters they were willing to overlook , in consequence of his piety and talents . rhus when he married a wife wholly unsuited to himself and his duties ,  --  a matter of no small concern to the peace and happiness of his people , ,  --  they lamented it as a misfortune , but never suffered it to diminish their respect for his character . So , too , when at a considerably later period , during the stormy and exciting times which succeeded the French Revolution , they saw him taking a decided and almost violent part in the political disputes of the day , they were willing to attribute it to the earnest , open-hearted disposition which led him to the unceremonious discharge of all his duties . They , therefore , found little fault , when. , amid the effervescence of high political excitement , he , in the most pointed manner publicly baptized a son with the name , John Adams . Every man has a right to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mother assents . All this was tolerable . But a few weeks afterwards , an honest member of the church presented a child for baptism , and whispered in his ear. , Thomas Jefferson . He at once refused to perform the rite , unless another name should be given . This was more than could be borne . The aggrieved party loudly and bitterly complained of the hardship , and many a child , who might otherwise have had the prosaic name of his father recorded in the family bible , and inscribed upon his grave-stone , was , out of *spite to the minister , obliged to bear through life the more noted name of the great republican champion , Thomas Jefferson . Instead of changing his conduct , upon consideration , and apologizing for the heated feelings of the moment , subsequent reflection only confirmed our pastor in his course , and on the following sabbath he relieved his mind and hoped to restore peace by a full statement of the reasons upon which he had acted . He believed the religious , moral and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could not , without violence to his conscience , // do anything which could by any means be construed into an approval of his conduct ; as he might thereby promote the cause of bad government , bad morals , and bad religion . He gave to his parishioners full credit for right motives ; he thought them , in their hearts , religious men ; it was through ignorance that they were doing this thing ; and it was his duty to watch over their ignorance , and preserve them fiom harm . He respected their motives , but pitied their error , and would never consent to aid , or in any way be accessory to their misconduct . This , of course , increased the difficulty tenfold . Some men can bear to be reproached with wickedness ; hut he must be a saint indeed , who can forgive the man that pities his ignorance . We often know that we are not so honest as we might be ; but never harbor a suspicion that we are fools . Great commotion was , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , still kept together . The desire of union was too strong to be easily broken . Those , who had so long met together in the same house for the purpose of religious worship , could not at once be brought to bear the thought of wrangling and divisions . The pastor was willing to do all that he could , in conscience , to calm the troubled waters . With this object , he proposed getting up a library , arid forming a literary society for mutual improvement . Here , at least , he thought , there would be no room for dispute , and hi continued acts of reciprocal kindness and good will , minds at variance on some points might be brought to unity of feeling , if not of sentiment and thought . For a time there was a prospect that these expectations might be realized . All doubtful questions in politics and religion , were studiously avoided . But at last , in one of their meetings , a prominent man. , who had formerly been among the disaffected , made use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rebuke to the opposite party . Forthwith the clergyman arose , and said that he considered himself and his friends insulted ; that he cared nothing about himself , but that he could not sit quiet while his friends were abused , and their honest opinions attacked . He had taken great pains to get up and to sustain the society , with the hope that it might restore peace , where discord had raged with quite too much violence ; but now , since that object was perverted ,  --  so lamentably perverted ,  --  he had no desire to continue in the society longer . He wished , therefore , to have his name at once wkhdrawn from the list of members . The offending member arose and stated , that nothing was farther from his thoughts , than to attack any one 's opinions , or hurt any one 's feelings ; and he was sure that none but a morbidly sensitive mind could so understand him . If all were as testy as the Reverend gentleman , they micrht as well walk on the bosom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of a powder magazine , as meet together for any social purpose . The Clergyman replied , that Christian feelings and the dignity of the clerical profession would allow him to make no answer to such a speech . The meeting was , accordingly , broken up in a disorderly manner ; and the society , which was established to produce kindness of feeling , did more than almost any thing else to embitter and exasperate men 's minds . Awkward attempts were made to bring about a reconciliation ; but the feelings of the people had been so repeatedly wounded , that each successive reconciliation was more difficult and // less perfect than the preceding . The pastor 's warmest friends were not insensible to his failings , and while they had the highest confidence in his goodness and learning , they were always trembling , lest some rash act should still further impair his weakened influence . Through fear of what might happen , they failed to profit by his best instructions ; and the spirit of discord had become so much a familiar spirit among them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved . He one day preached upon the sin of Sabbath-breaking . For many Sabbaths after he missed from church one of his most constant and attentive hearers . Upon inquiry , he learned that this man thought the sermon intended for him personally , and he did not choose to go to meeting to be shot at ; and it was no easy matter to convince him that the preacher could not possibly have reference to him , as the sermon had been written several years . On another occasion , Korah , Dathan , ' and Abiram were the subject of his discourse , when three of the most active leaders , who had opposed him , took it all to themselves , and their wrath was kindled to sevenfold rage ; although it had not once occurred to the composer of the sermon that his remarks were applicable to them more than to many others of his parish . At other times , his indiscretion was apparently greater , though his motives were not less pure . The town had long claimed a right to a species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivocal manner . The heirs to the estate in question had disputed this right , and it had become a fertile source of heart-burnings and contentions , not only between the parties at issue , but also between the inhabitants of the town , some being strongly in favor of litigation , and others desiring an amicable adjustment of the whole business . At last , after a violent dispute among the citizens , a vote was passed , by which the town surrendered all its claims for a trifling compensation . The next Sabbath the subject of the sermon was Esau 's selling his birthright for a mess of pottage , which of course greatly aggravated the - angry excitement that had previously existed . Yet it had not occurred to the preacher that any such use could be made of the sermon . On the Sabbath after the death of one of the leading men who had long been opposed to him , he preached from the words of Balaam , Let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish with the character that expressed it . It so happened that the last words of his deceased parishioner , bore some resemblance to this text . But of this the preacher was ignorant . Indeed , the sermon was written a few days before the death took place , and not the least allusion to any particular individual was ever thought of by the writer . Still not only the disaffected , but many of his steadfast friends , supposed that it was prepared for the occasion , and could not too strongly testify their displeasure against one , who had prostituted the pulpit to the unholy purpose of vilifying the dead , and wounding the feelings of the afflicted mourners . Nor was it in public alone that he was thus unfortunate in his expressions . A committee was at one time deputed to remonstrate with him upon his imprudence . He received them with all Christian humility and politeness . " How many gentlemen have been appointed on this committee ? " " Seven , " was the reply . " Ah ! yes-as many as // were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a careless way , and meant only for a jest , but several of the committee could never forgive it . But it were useless to particularize farther . Suffice it to say that by indiscretions like these his usefulness was ruined . his parish7 which he found frank , hospitable , and united , became petulant , uncharitable , and divided . One after another they left him ; new societies were formed ; his once large congregation dwindled down to a handful , and they , after long deliberation , came to the conclusion , that they must dismiss the pastor who had grown old among them ,  --  who had buried their fathers , and baptized their children . lie was thus thrown off , without support , in his old age ; for his domestic affairs we*e in a yet more deplorable state . Once , in attending a funeral , he fastened his horse to a stand on which were placed several bee-hives . The horse , growing weary , shook the stand ; a few of the bees thus unceremoniously disturbed came out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , threw down the stand , and was immediately covered and stung to death by the enraged insects . This was but a fair sample of the good man 's prudence ; and the conduct and sufferings of his horse were but too faithful an exhibition of his own conduct and sufferings through life . " I know not how it is , " said he , a few days before his death , " but never have I set my heart upon any project which has not fallen through . For a time , perhaps , all things would go well , and cheer me with the promise of success . But some unlooked-for mishap , some unlucky word , from this quarter or from that , never failed to baffle my efforts and deceive my hopes . Some unfortunate confusion of tongues invariably frustrated the work that I was building to lead men up to heaven . God will bear witness to the purity and sincerity of my motives ; and , at this trying hour , when flesh and heart are failing , His approbation administers no doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would send an additional gleam of li , , ht through the valley of the shadow of death , could I look back upon a life of successful exertion in the high calling I have chosen .

But for me , I have been wholly an unprofitable servant . Yet His will be done . " It is but a few weeks since I visited the hill on which this good man 's church once stood . It has long been removed , and no vestige of its existence can be traced ; - as if the elements had conspired with man to remove all marks of a once united people .

I-low many pillows of sickness and agony has her own hand smoothed ? Over how many beds of death has she watched , relieving sorrow by her sympathy , alluring to heaven by her persuasions , assuaging even the agonies of death by her kindness and consolation ? The notice of Sarah Smith , who was born at Hanover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affectionate and admiring respect . The following account of Mrs. Scott can not , to Americans , be uninteresting . She died in 1828 . Dorothy Scott , the daughter of Edmund Quincy , the second of that name distinguished in the annals of Massachusetts , was born about the year 1750 , and was married in 1774 , to John Hancock , afterwards President of Congress , whose name is affixed to the Declaration of Independence . She was with him at Concord , when the British made their attack at Lexington and Coiicord , April 19th , and fled with him to an adjacent town , Woburn . Hancock was eager to get into the fight , but was restrained by the advice of Samuel Adams , who knew the value of such a man as Hancock , in the contest then commenced , and which he saw would not suddenly be closed . Mrs. Hancock had moved in the first circles of taste and fashion , and gratified her liusbanil 's ambition , in presiding with so much elet*ance at his table and by leading the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics in which all would agree . Hancock was sorely afflicted with the gout , and , naturally irritable , it required , at times , all her blandishments to keep him from outraging all around him ; but she never tired in her exertions , but acted the dutiful , kind wife at all times , without retort or peevishness . They had no children ,  - -  those careful comforts of wedded life , who , if they add to our labors in providing for them , fill up many a void , felt in the existence of the wisest who have no offspring . From her husband 's character and situation in life , she was in a perpetual round of company , until the death of Governor Hancock , which happened in 1793 . He supposed that he had left his widow a splendid fortune , but it turned out , in the way it was managed , only a fair competency . Several years after the decease of Mr. Hancock , she intermarried with Captain Scott , with whom she enjoyed as much happiness as with her former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second husband many years , and retained her niental faculties in great brightness when turned of seventy . She had been weB educated , and had fine talents , and loved admiration and notice just enough to make her fluent in conversation , united with pride and good sense sufficient to make her careful in her communications . In the latter part of her life , she lived retired and in seclusion . He was most honored who received an invitation to her little supper table . Two or three friends only would be found there . She supported her share of the conversation with wonderful ease and sprightliness . No bitterness upon the decay of good society , the almost perpetual theme of those who were once fashionable , and have by time , or change of circumstances , passed , as out of date , was ever heard iii her house . She spoke of other days with cheerfulness , without a sigh that they had gone . She had treasured up many anecdotes of the days previous and durimig the revolution , and told them as one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorable scenes . There was not an officer in the British army , quartered in Boston , whose personal appearance , habits , and manners , she could not give with accuracy and graphic effect . Her favorite was Earl Percy ; for his forces encamped on Boston common during the winter of 1774-5 ; and this nobleman , accustomed to all the luxuries of high born Britons , slept among huis regiment in a tent , no more protected from the cold than those of his private soldiers . It is not a little remarkable that the traces of those tents are still to he seen on the common when the grass is just springing out of the ground , after the vernal showers . he circles around the tents are as distinct as ever . At the dawn of the morning , Mrs. Scott says , that Earl Percy 's voice was heard drilling his men on the comumon . This lady had an opportunity , after the capture of Burgoyne , of extending her courtesies to the ladies of his army , while at Cambridge , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Lafayette was here , during his last visit , he made an early call on his old friend Mrs. Scott , formerly // Madame Hancock . Those who witnessed the interview , speak of it with admiration . The once youthful chevalier and the splendid belle met , as if only a season had passed since they had danced together in the halls of the assembly . While they both were contemplating the changes time had produced , they smiled in each other 's faces ; but no word was uttered , bearing upon such an ungallant subject . She was not always so silent on this subject . One of her young friends coml ) liinented her on her good looks . She laughingly said , " What you have said is more than half a hundred years old ; my ears remember it ; but what were dimples once are wrinkles now . " Those who wish for more exciting incidents to attract their attention , will find them in the notices of many distinguished foreign ladies , as well as of some who belonged to our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Ramsay , an ( l Mrs. Rowson . But the great beauty of the work is the importance which it attaches to the quiet duties of life , and the charm which it attributes to female intelligence and virtue , when employed in silent deeds of charity and affection . What more beautiful instance of female influence than this , which is told of Mrs. Phillips , of Andover , whose husband was one of the founders of Phillips Andover Academy ? A lad , seeing from her window a wretched lookingman , going to the whippingpost to receive corporeal punishment for a petty larceny , sentenced by a justice of the peace to this ignominy , strove to conceal a tear , but this excellent woman observed it . With one starting in her own eye , she emphatically said to him , " When you become a law-maker , examine the subject of corporal punishment , and see if it is not unnatural , vindictive , and productive of much evil . " In early manhood he became a legislator , and remembering the words which made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the assembly to the subject , and in the course of a short time , had the satisfaction of announcing to her , that the statute book had been expurgated , in this respect , and that there was , in future , to be no more corporal punisbment for any offence less than capital . This is the true way in which woman is to act ; not by engaging in public disputes , or endeavoring to stem the torrent of public opinion , but by forming the character of the young ; by those silent lessons , which , though unheeded and unknown by the world , sink deeply in the youthful mind , mould the private character , and eventually change the public institutions of society . The changes , which are thus imperceptibly brought about , in the disposition of men , in the forms of government , and the final destiny of nations , are incomparably more important to the welfare of man , than all the violent revolutions and distracting convulsions which have agitated the globe , in consequence of the direct agency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of history . The names of these unceasing benefactors are not known . Their ' own children may rise up and call them blessed ; or their influence may have been so unpretending and unseen , that those , most favored , may be ignorant whence the generous principles which guide their conduct , were derived . Still more must the community be ignorant of their acts , and they may themselves go down to the grave without a consciousness of the great work in which they were engaged , and the great results which are to spring from their actions . Still we would not have it otherwise . We would not have their meritorious deeds more public . We can not agree with our author , that " it is grievous to think , that while here and there one noble mother is mentioned , as it were on the margin of a leaf in history , thousands pass away without a memorial . " Does not the // charm of these excellent mothers rest in no small measure upon their retirement ? Each example acts in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its influence felt . And these countless examples , acting , each in its own sphere , in its own home , with the powerful aid of a mother 's love , thus separately accomplish the great purpose for which they were designed . If , beyond this , an example here and there happens to be picked up and preserved for more extensive and more permanent usefulness , we receive the gift with all gratitude . But this is all we ask or desire . The caverns of the earth may have unnumbered gems ; but if they were strown like pebbles on the surface , how much of their present value would they retain ? It is because only " here and there one noble mother is mentioned , as it were on the margin of a leaf in history , " that the recorded example has such an influence upon our minds and hearts . If more numerous , they would attract less attention , and be less prized . Public examples , whether of virtue or vice , of reward or punishment , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , as they act in private life , upon the private character , acquire new influence from repetition ; for , in their course , they gain auxiliaries which no public acts can gain . In woman , Those thousand decencies , that daily flow From all her words and actions , mixed with love , so far from losing their power by being repeated or multiplied , coma , at each succeeding time , with additional claims and charms . A mother 's devotion or a sister 's love becomes more effective by each new manifestation . They claim and they receive a corresponding love and devotion . They claim and they receive sympathy , gratitude , and confidence . They win the heart . They take possession of the soul . And the longer and more frequently they are exerted , the greater is their power , and the more ready and cheerful the acquiescence in their claim . Such is their private influence upon the objects which call them forth . But once draw them from their retirement , and they become public agents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples will produce more effect than a host . The mind is distracted by a multiplicity of objects , and , because they are common , loses its interest in all . The heart becomes , as it were , a turnpike , over which innumerahle objects pass , while no one makes a lasting impression , and the general effort is to produce uniform hardness . Besides , there is another consideration , which should not escape us . Why is it that examples of self-denying virtue in private life speak so powerfully to the heart , while even greater sacrifices , made in the presence of  --  the world , so little excite our sympathy ? Is it not because we feel that public actions are recompensed by public applause ? No mother , with all a mother 's devotion , ever endured more in the performance of duties appropriate to her station , than warriors and statesmen , courtiers a-nd monarch-s have endnred i-n their several careers ? Why then do we look - upon them with such difference of feeling ? Because we see that the latter have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crowns-poor. perhaps , but , in their eyes , adequate rewards-are held out before them ; if they gain the prize their labor is not vain ; and if they gain it not , they began with a Lull knowledge of // the chances that opposed them . But the mother , from her very situation , can have no such object . If depth and strength of affection are not the motives , which prompt her to action and to suffering , we know not what are . Woman , in watching over the tender scions of her own household , in hearing up under the weight of a hard fortune , and forgetting her own sorrows and privations while striving to allay the anguish of those with whom her destiny is united , visiting the abodes of wretchedness , and curtailing her own narrow income that she may minister to starving want and pennyless ignorance , when there is no prosl ) ect that her actions will ever reach the ears of the world ,  --  if she has not a pure heart and a right spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hemlock from a desire of posthumous fame ; the primitive martyrs may have stood firm in their integrity , because conscious that they were a spectacle to men and angels ; and Howard may have gauged the depth of suffering iu stagnant prisons , and finally sacrificed his life in the cause , knowing that the meed of praise would at length be accorded him : by the world ; yet the women who stood by the cross , when the disciples , all , save one , had fled , could hope for no worldly recompense but reproach and insult ; and the wife of the philanthropist , when she gave up a promised journey , that the money might be given to the poor , could have had no thought that the fame of her action would have been trumpeted abroad . Or , to take an instance yet more appropriate , when Aria , the Roman matron , in order to excite her husband to meet his fate firmly , plunged the dagger into her breast , and then presented it to him with the memorable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pnetus , it is not painful , " she had the prospect of immortal glory before her eyes to encourage and support her . But in the noblest act of her life she had no suc:h consolation . Her husband , and his son , a youth riot less endeared to his parents by his virtues than by the ties of affection were at the same time attacked with a dangerous illness , of which the son died . She concealed his death from her husband , waited upon him and answered his inquiries with cheerfulness , and , if at any time she could no longer restrain her feelings , and the tears were gushing out , she would leave the room , and , having given vent to her passion , return again with dry eyes , as if she had dismissed every sentiment of sorrow at her entrance . lathe former case she migh't have been sustained by the *prospect of fame ; but was it not something much greater ( we are but repeating Pliny 's question ) without the view of such powerful motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cheerfully seem the mother when she was so no more ? * But would not the admiring and sympathizing feelings , with which we now view this deed , be in aught diminished , if we had but a suspicion that it was done for exhibition , or for fame ? Yet , if actions of this kind are all to be brought before the garish eye of the world , what security can we have in any case that they are not performed with a view to the public eye ? And , if we have not that security , the charm at once vanishes . lie who , admiring the domestic virtues of woman , regrets that they are so seldom made public , forgets that the very circumstance , which gives to * We are sorry to see that while Mr. Knapp , in his notice of Aria , has mentioned her heroic death , he has omitted this , which Dugald Stewart , with great justice , considers " one of the most beautiful anecdotes recorded in the annals of our species . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , would be thus removed . He , who admires the beauty and laments the humble station of the violet , forgets how much its beauty owes to the lowliness of its station ; and he , who , attracted by the sweetness , laments the obscurity of the mayflower , forgets that the same dry leaves which conceal , also protect the timid plant . Once let them be removed , and the flower disappears . Or , to use language , which , like Corporal Trim 's , has a good meaning , though we confess there is something in the comparison that is not quite to our taste , he , who regrets that so many admirable examples of domestic virtue are suffered to remain in obscurity , is , in this respect , not unlike the village inn-keeper , who , being almost ruined by com*etitors , wished that he were the only person in the world , and then he could keep tavern without opposition ; or like the little school.girl , who , being reproved for indulging a propensity natural to herself and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could be in school alone , for then she might whisper as much as she chose . But we beg pardon for our levity , and assure our readers , that upon this subject , however grating it may be to their feelings , it is yet more so to ours . We will , therefore , return more immediately to our author . We noticed a few unpleasant instances of carelessness in style , as p. 105 , " In viewing the place where she *vrote * * ; and in contemplating the melancholy loss of her infant , give a more than ordinary interest to the pure thoughts which abound in her poetry . " We look in vain here for a nominative case to the verb , which stands as desolate as the bereaved mother to which it relates . Though not a connoisseur in such matters , we noticed a few mis-statements of facts ; as , for instance , p. 69 ,  --  " the wife of William Allen , D. D. late President of Bowdoin College . " He is still President of Bowdoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office were suspended . " William Taylor , Esq . known by his exquisite Iphgenia in Tauris , ' from the German , his Leonara , ' from Burger . " With the exception of typographical errors , there is not verbally a mis-statement here ; but , from the manner in which " German " and " Burger " are mentioned , a school-girl , with more tact than information , would be very likely to infer , that Burger was not a German ; and , most assuredly , the language would justify the inference . A few other unimportant strictures , we were ahout to make ; but they have escaped us , and we have already said enough to establish our impartiality . Our first impression was , that the author had been more liberal than judicious , in bestowing praise ; but a more careful examination has partly removed the impression . A good deal of discrimination has been used , though with great lenity towards failings . For illustration of our remark , we would refer particularly to the notice of Mrs. Knox , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her love of ceremony and of power ,  --  which last , Chaucer makes the ruling passion of women ,  --  are , to be sure , all touched upon but in such a way that they escape almost unnoticed , except by one acquainted with her character . " She never forgot her military life , and no one could forget that she had been with those accustomed to command . " If the latter clause of this sentence had been printed in capitals , the idea intended would have been exactly // expressed . With this we find no fault . But in one or two instances , we were startled by extravagant expressions . She yet lives , the ornament of her age . " Who " yet lives , the ornament of her age ? " A lady , in the same state with whom it was our good fortune ( we speak in our individual capacity , ) to live some twenty years , and yet so ignorant were we , that her existence was hardly known- to us . She may be , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior mind and of deep reflection , as well as of exemplary life and conversation ; " but as to being the ornament of her age , that is a different matter . In conclusion , we would recommend the work upon which we have been engaged , as a good Biographical Dictionary , especially of American women ; as an excellent school-hook for young ladies ; and as an interesting work for all who would extend their acquaintance with the most interesting portion of our race . It is for the most part written in an easy and natural style , and can not fail- to make a good moral impression . We have not been able to find one objectionable passage , on the score of morality ; while it is full of examples which can not fail to awaken virtuous desires , and confirm virtuous resolutions.
