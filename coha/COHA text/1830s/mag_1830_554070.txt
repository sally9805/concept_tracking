txt Mr. Villemain , the author of the work before us , is one of the most distinguished and popular of the living writers of France . He is the Professor of Eloquence in the University ; and his lectures are regularly attended by thousands of intelligent and fashionable auditors . We can not too highly commend the liberality , which renders these lectures accessible to all . It is most honorable to the French , that their treasures of literature and science are not , like those of some other nations , secured by bolts and bars , which nothing but the magical application of silver can remove . A field of action is thrown open by this liberality to eloquence and talent , which reminds us of the glorious days of ancient Greece . The influence of intellectual ability is visible and felt ; operating as it does , not through the comparatively cold and lifeless medium of books , but with all the vigor and effect of oratory , conscious of its power , and consecrated to the most exalted purposes . This may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imparting profound instruction ; but besides communicating extensive information to many , who would not otherwise acquire it , or whose attention would be devoted to nothing better than the ephemeral literature of the hour , it produces an elevated tone of public taste and sentiment , on which much of the character and advancement of society depend . The time , we hope , is not far distant , when courses of instruction , conducted upon similar principles , will become universal in this country , or at least in our larger towns and cities ; where there is surely no deficiency in the eloquence and learning , which are essential for their success . It is much to be regretted , that the valuable lectures of professors in our literary institutions , are in general delivered before audiences , composed of students only ; when , by a change of plan , they might be rendered very useful and instructive to the public at large . The evil may in some degree be remedied by institutions like the Boston Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge ; giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not probably at present permit , better opportunity to the lecturers for the more complete investigation of their subjects , and rendering the privilege of admission to the lectures more general and free . // The first article in this miscellany is an elegant and animated eulogy on I'Vlontaigne . After this follows a discourse upon the benefits and disadvantages of criticism ; a subject which , in the emphatic language of the day , comes home to our own busimiess and bosoms ; and which is treated with eloquence and spirit , and with a more abundant measure of candor , than is commonly to be found in similar productions . The author is obviously not of the number of those deluded and misjudging persons , who are fond of representing critics as the inveterate and natural enemies of promising talent , in the same manner as the ministers of the law are sometimes held up as a brotherhood of rogues , and the professors of the healing art denounced as habitual violators of the sixth commandment . Still , in speaking of the origin of criticism , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurpation ; although he admits , for the purposes of argument at least , that it has been rendered legitimate , if not equitable , by prescription . As to the manner in which this questionable power has been exercised , we think we can perceive a disposition on his part , which we should hardly have expected in a writer so judicious , to look upon the unfavorable side . We are not unfrequently told elsewhere , of the rancor with which contemporary criticism pursued Cervantes ; of the thousand attempts made in his own time to destroy the reputation of Tasso ; of the envy and malice which hurried Racine into seclusion at the very noontide of his powers ; and of the bitterness which brought Keats immaturely to the grave . We are not without our doubts in regard to the authenticity of this last example . The potion , though sufficiently unpalatable , is rarely if ever mortal ; though we are far from attempting to justify or palliate the heartless malignity , which some modern critics of no small distinction , actuated by personal or party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . But it should not be forgotten , that mt*ich of what passes under the name of criticism , is only the jealousy and envy , which are sometimes tempted to assume the lion 's skin , the better to accomplish an unworthy or degrading purpose . We might easily produce examples , on the other hand , in which coals of fire have been literally heaped upon the head of the unlucky critic ; indeed , we are inclined to believe , that upon a fair settlement of the accounts between authors and reviewers , the former will be found to be by no means in ar // rear . The fate of Dennis is not yet forgotten ; the two hundred volumes aimed by Fr6ron at the head of Voltaire , were answered by missiles less ponderous , but somewhat more effective ; and the world has hardly yet ceased to applaud the vigor , with which Lord Byron flung hack the sarcasms of the Edinburgh Review . The truth is , that by selecting particular examples , the office of the critic may be made at pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The argument against it is drawn from its abuses ; and this is at once the least philosophical and the least conclusive of all arguments . It would hardly become us to enumerate the qualifications which the task of the critic requires . They consist , according to Mr. Villemain , in perfect impartiality , in earnest wishes to promote the success of others , in a union of correct principles with exalted sentiments , and in delicate and unperverted taste . But it is no more reasonable to expect angels in the form of critics , than in that of rulers ; and acting as we do , with a full consciousness of our infirmities , that task is neither light nor easy . If we could for a moment suppose ourselves to be endued with all these attributes , we should still be haunted by apprehensions , that authors would continue to take it ill , when they are told , that their works are poor things , and that they are not themselves much better . Our author believes that the raillery which wounds self-love is what renders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made acquainted with their faults in a grave and argumentative way , they would receive the information with unaffected pleasure . But it is not easy for reviewers , from the public nature of their occupation , to deal with an erring brother according to the injunctions of religion ; and if this were practicable , it would not , in all probability , remove the difficulty . Rousseau tried the experiment with the curate of Mont-Chauvet , when he assured him , in a transport of benevolence , that nothing could be more worthless than his tragedy ; and thus made his reverenoe an enemy for life . Our faculties , we flatter ourselves , will be borne too meekly to render us justly liable to railing accusations , by frequent acts of injustice ; but if our hope shall be ill founded , we must console ourselves with the reflection , so balmy always to courts of limited jurisdiction , that the great appellate tribunal of the public will remedy the evil , by overthrowing our decisions . The discourse is concluded with the following remarks . // As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early essays are too unimportant to excite attention , let us not be too forward to delude ourselves with the idea , that we shall deserve to become objects of envy . In violation of the ordinary rule , it is possible , that we may be indifferent writers , and yet severely criticised : but before we accuse others of injustice , let us learn to distrust our own vanity . The love of letters is like every other passion . It blinds , it misleads , it deludes us both with regard to ourselves and others : it mistakes the ardor of its aspirations for the measure of its strength : it is impatient of every obstacle , while it often requires to be arrested in its progress . Talent is rare , vanity credulous , and glory seductive . ' The discourse upon criticism is followed by a eulogy upon Montesquien ; for which , with the two discourses already mentioned , prizes of eloquence were awarded to the author by the University of France . It is impossible , in examining a work like the one before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a particular account of each . We can offer only a short extract from a discourse delivered by Mr. Villemain before the Academy , upon his succeeding to the place left vacant by the death of Mr. de Fontanes ; in which his eloquence appears to be animated by a deep sense of personal obligation , and the recollections of early and disinterested friendship . I call to mind involuntarily that Roman usage , which , at the death of some distinguished citizen , some generous patron of youth , allowed one of his clients , one of his pupils , to express from the tribune the public sorrow for the loss : with no other title to the honor than that which gratitude confers , and no other recommendation than the friendship of the departed . I can not recollect the poor essays , which have acquired for me the honor of a place among you : I can not look back upon the early stages of my short and humble career , without being at the same time reminded of the kind and liberal friendship of Mr. de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my departure from the public schools , and devoted me at an early age to the occupations of a teacher : it was that which encouraged my earliest essays , and watched over them amidst the trials of that literary competition , which have sometimes attracted towards me your attention : it protected those essays ; for a long time it protected me ; it honored me always . ' We next turn to an essay upon the funeral oration , in which the French are generally admitted to have excelled all other modern nations . The object of this kind of eloquence is noble // and elevated ; for it is no other than that of bestowing just honors upon exalted virtue , and of holding it up as an example for the world to admire and imitate . Mr. Villemain discovers one of its earliest specimens in the lamentation of David for those who fell upon the mountain of Gilboa . He enters into an examination of the most remarkable funeral orations of antiquity ; from that which Thucydides has ascrihed to Pericles , to the discourse of Hyperides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restore the liberties of Greece , a few years after the dishoaest victory of Chmcronea . ' The inspiration of the Greek orators was derived from patriotism and freedom ; but with all their sublimity and power , they were destitute of that superior dignity , which springs from the rewards and promises of the Christian faith . In the republic of Rome , the custom of thus honoring those who fell in battle , was altogether unknown . The funeral oration was stately and formal ; for the patrician orators had scarcely any other task to perform , than that of the English king-at-arms upon the occasion of a royal funeral , when he proclaims the rank and titles of the dead . At a later period , the power of impassioned eloquence was occasionally exhibited in public eulogies on distinguished favorites of the people : a memorable example of which is presented in the funeral oration pronounced hy Antony over the body of C*esar . But it is easy to conceive , what the character of these discourses must have become , when the eulogy on each departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Claudius were celebrated by Nero . Mr. Villemain notices with high commendation the funeral discourses of some of the early Christian fathers ; the merit of which appears the more remarkable , when we remember , that they were written at the period of the decline of letters , and the corruption of taste . It is sufficient evidence of their superior excellence , that they were imitated hy Bossuet  --  the absolute and unrivalled monarch in this high department of eloquencewho is placed hy the just admiration of our author , far above all his illustrious contemporaries . Since the Augustan age of French literature , this , its peculiar glory , has departed ; and the academic eulogy affords but a very inadequate compensation for the loss . No allusion is made in this essay to the funeral orations of any modern nation , but France ; and we are rather surprised upon reflection , to find how few attempts have been // made in England to attain superior excellence in this departruent . One of the finest examples , which occur at present to our recollection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commons upon his friend , the Duke of Bedford ; which presents us also with a striking illustration of the peculiar character of English eloquence in general , as compared with that of France . We find in it no flights of energy or passion , no enthusiastic appeal to our sympathies . Its tone throughout is subdued and calm ; and the feelings of private friendship and personal gratitude are pleaded as an apology for an exhibition of sorrow , xviiich , in the view of a Frenchman , would constitute the principal charm , and should be the most prominent characteristic of the eulogy . In fact , the difference to which we have alluded , appears to be the result of a very marked diversity of temperament and taste . An Englishman is rather apt to regard any public display of excited feeling as unbecoming and unmanly ; and he will generally labor to conceal it where it exists , instead of attempting to awaken the sympathy of others by the exhibition of his own grief . One of the most obvious traits in his character is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catiline ; his wisdom is superior to his eloquence . A Frenchman , on the other hand , can perceive no reason why any emotions should be hidden from the public view ; if a man may reasonably feel , he may with the same propriety express them ; and in conformity with the rule of Horace , if he wishes to make others weep , he begins the process by shedding tears himself . In this respect , our countrymen , perhaps , bear less resemblance to the French , than to their English brethren . There is among us as much regret and veneration for departed worth , as much affectionate rememhrance of lost excellence and virtue , as in any other country ; and there is no less of what Adam Smith calls sympathy with the dead . It is only differently exhibited : with little of the public show and parade of sorrow . The tastes of nations , like those of individuals , do not admit of controversy . If those of England and our own country have been fairly represented , it is plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be altogether pleas*g to English or American audiences . Some desperate attempts have at times been made to copy the most remarkable passages of Bossuet ; but all direct imitation has proved wholly unsuccessful , for the reasons we have already mentioned . Our // associations with our last change are grave , chastened , and severe . We have little disposition to throw the illusions of poetical imagination over its awful realities ; we have few of those offerings of flowers and other tributes , which are consecrated by affection elsewhere to the memory of the dead ; so that we are apt to fall into exaggeration , when we overstep the limits prescribed to us , by our ordinary habits of thought and feeling upon this subject . Cotton iMather , a man of talent as well as of great and various attainments , has given us several specimens of the funeral eulogy , which are probably among the most extraordinary monuments of perverted taste that were ever erected hy the ingenuity of man . His laudatory notice of the pious XJr . Partridge , is composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this appropriate epitaph , He has flown ! ' We learn from the elaborate Pentade of President Alden , who has decyphered tomb-stones and investigated our sepulchral literature with all the zeal and industry of Chainpollion and Old Mortality , how common this exaggeration was , at an early period . Sometimes , as in the case of a worthy clergyman who delivered a public eulogy upon his wife , plain prose was altogether inadequate to the expression of sorrow , and grief broke out into a paroxysm of poetry . And the same extravagance appears occasionally in ohituary notices at the present time . All this is neither a result , nor an evidence of our ordinary taste ; and its absurdity arises from the attempt to express what we do not feel , or , at least , what our habitual mode of feeling forbids us to express in such a manner . To be adapted to our prevailing taste , all such notices should be modest and unobtrusive . When , however , some great calamity , the loss of some eminent public servant , or of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very unusual degree , the funeral oration will be found to assume a corresponding character of dignity and power . It is praise sufficient , and at the same time well-merited , to say , that many of the discourses delivered upon the occasion of the death of Washington , were in all respects worthy of their venerated subject ; and who has forgotten the affecting eulogy in which Fisher Ames poured out his heart in sorrow for the loss of an illustrious and kindred spirit ? When two of our most eminent civil fathers were , a few years since , together called from their earthly labors , the deep and universal feeling of regret and admiration was expressed in many beautiful and impressive // eulogies , which would not have dishonored the literature or the eloquence of any age or country . The funeral orations of France , as we have already remarked , might not be perfectly adapted to our ordinary taste ; but the effect of some of the discourses to which we have alluded , was produced by the judicious union of their impassioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and a very beautiful example of this union is afforded by a discourse of the late Mr. Buckminster upon the death of Mr. Bowdoin , a part of which only has yet been published , and which was probably considered as too occasional in its character , to be inserted in the collection of his works . We pass over the introductory discourse of Mr. Villemain 's course of lectures upon French eloquence , in order to come to an essay , which contains a short biographical notice of Milton , together with a critical examination of his works . The criticism is not , in general , uncandid nor unjust ; hut there are some points , in which we are far from according in opinion with our author . In one particular , we feel compelled to make , what was denominated by one of his countrymen , a reply to his silence . We do not find , that he has honored Milton 's sonnets with even the cold tribute of a passing glance ; and yet , notwithstanding the contemptuous intimations of Johnson , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a species of composition , better suited , perhaps , to the taste of Italy , from which it was borrowed , than to ours , but in which Shak*speare and Sydney did not disdain to labor , and of which Drummond has left us some examples of uncommon elegance and beauty . He is also wholly at a loss to discover the contrast between the Allegro and the Penseroso , which the names seem naturally to imply . The former appears to him , as Master Hudson 's pleasure-party appeared to Rip Van Winkle on the Catskill mountains , a rather melancholy affair ; hut the difficulty vanishes , when it is considered simply as expressive of a state of mind denominated cheerfulness ; with which Johnson , who had previously expressed a similar apprehension , was not particularly conversant , and which certainly bears little resemblance to what a Frenchman would call gaiety . The Comus also , in the opinion of our author , displays less gaiety than sadness ; and considered as an imitation , it may perhaps be liable to censure : but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciating Milton 's genius , should he insensible to that deep harmony , which enforces attention like the tongues // of dying men , to the grace and richness of the language , and the elevated dignity of the sentiments of that unrivalled production ; where genius breaks from the cloud , in which the imitation of inferior models seems at first to shroud it , and stands forth like Eneas , in all the pride of manly and almost celestial beauty . We have no room to follow Mr. Villemain at length in his remarks upon the Paradise Lost ; hut we are glad to see that he is willing to do justice to the language of that immortal song : which , if occasionally disfigured hy foreign idioms , is still the inimitable , and we had almost said , the native dialect of surpassing genius ; and that he treats with deserved contempt the idea , that the merit of the poet is diminished by his having borrowed the first suggestion of his great work , as Voltaire will have it , from some Italian drama upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other high authorities , however , be seems to consider only a few of the first books of the Paradise Lost , as remarkable for their sublimity . It may he so ; but who would choose to part with the delightful images of the innocence and purity of paradise , the magnificent description of the rising world , or the vision of the future revealed by the archangel to the father of our race ? To us , the poet appears like the spirit in his progress through the realms of chaos ; who , though he may occasionally approach some inferior orbs , is still pursuing his majestic flight toward the garden of God . It is not without regret , that we see our author giving the sanction of his authority in confirmation of the justice of that censure , which has often been bestowed upon the controversial works of Milton . Mr. Villemain is understood to he the friend and advocate of liberal principles ; and he has experienced something of the severity by which arbitrary power would subdue the firm hearts and eloquent tongues that refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to pardon something to the great defender of liberty , fallen on evil days and evil tongues . It should not he forgotten , that Milton was ready to devote all that he possessed or hoped for , to this high and holy cause ; that he went forth to battle against principalities and powers , armed with that irresistible enthusiasm which shrinks from no peril , despises every ohstacle , and cheerfully encounters all sacrifices ; that , like the apostle of the Gentiles , he finished his course , he kept the faith , even in the midst of the sorrow and darkness and privation of his later years . For ourselves , we // look with reverence upon such an intellect , engaged in such a cause , and supported only by a prophetic anticipation of the glories which were about to be revealed . It is painful to see liberal and accomplished minds visiting with relentless severity of censure those occasional violations of propriety and correct taste , which are found in the controversial writings of Milton ; as if the stern old warrior , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to wield his battle-axe with all the graces of a courtier . Is the tone of religious or political controversy at this day so elevated , that we are entitled thus to condemn its spirit in former times ? Has much been gained to the cause of morals or religion , when refined calumny and well-mannered rancor are substituted for the old-fashioned blunt , and undisguised expression of enmity or hatred , or when the war-club of Beauvais is laid aside for the treacherous kiss of Joab ? However this may be , it is plainly impossible to form a fair judgment in regard to the spirit of these writings , without taking into consideration at tbe same time the spirit of the age in which they were written . It was in the century immediately preceding , that the rage of controversy appeared to reach the highest possible degree of intensity and bitterness ; when the mildest terms of reproach which Luther could find it in his heart to apply to the royal vindicator of the seven sacraments , were those of liar and blasphemer . Nor was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England . Cavaliers , round-heads , fifthmonarchy men , agitators , and a host of others , were mingled together in one vast limbo-paradise of controversy ; and all the resources of ridicule and libel that memory or learning could supply , or ingenuity devise , were lavished with boundless prodigality by each upon all the rest . Such , in truth , was the fashion of the day . An instance occurs to us , which shows that the same spirit was then exhibited in a quarter , in which we should not commonly , perhaps , expect to witness it . The General Court of Massachusetts , in reply to certain unlucky petitioners , published a formal manifesto ; in which short , but very distinct and far from flattering sketches were given of the characters of the prominent applicants : and which was concluded with the remark , that a head so unsavory was not to be seasoned with a world of salt . In short , we believe that the faults of Milton , like those of Shakspeare , were the faults of his age ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of Lascaris , our author has attempted to combine // the deep interest of fiction with real characters and incidents ; and it is principally remarkable for its rich poetical coloring , and the flowing beauty of the style . It refers to that memorable period , when Constantinople  --  the asylum of all that was valuable in philosophy and science , or beautiful in art-became the prey of those wild barbarians , whose iron despotism is at length hastening to its merited doom . Some young and noble Italians , among whom was a son of Cosmo de Medici , are supposed to be travelling in Sicily ; which they find , not as it is at present , almost a barren waste , but still opulent and flourishing , though far inferior to their own delightful land . One day , while the travellers are watching the reflection of the fires of *tna from the bosom of the tranquil sea , a boat is seen to approach the shore . They knew that Constantinople was invested by Mahomet II . with a formidable army ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , indeed , they felt little interest in the fortunes of those who refused to acknowledge the authority of the Latin church . A stranger , of dignified mien and majestic stature , stepping forth from the boat , announces the destruction of that noble city , and informs them that a wretched remnant of the Greeks were wandering with him to find an asylum in that Christian Europe , which had refused to avert their ruin . The stranger was Lascaris ; who relates to the travellers the story of his country 's desolation ; and tells them , that , as the Trojans carried with them in their flight the sacred fire of Vesta , so he and his companions were bearing to Italy the noble relics of the arts and genius of their unhappy country . They are hospitably received by the Sicilians , who forget their heresy in compassion for their misfortunes . Italy had already begun to admire and imitate the arts of Greece ; and the travellers are anxious to converse with Lascaris upon the subject . Our great poet , Petrarch , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homer , lamented that so rich a treasure should remain useless in his hands . His friend Boccaccio instructed him in the language of Greece , and gladly became for him the interpreter of that immortal song . ' Oh , that its suhlime strains might resound throughout the world ! ' exclaimed Lascaris : it is the imagination and philosophy of Greece , her poets and orators , that shall enchant and reanimate Italy at some future day , and shall pass thence into those other parts of Europe , which you now regard as ohscure and barharous . Beneath the skies of Greece there dwelt a race , blest with the most delightful climate , // and the most exalted freedom . Patriotism was the parent of their inspiration ; and glory elevated the soul to those noble deeds , which are the secret type of all the beautiful arts . Homer invented the beautiful in poetry ; Plato introduced it into ethics ; and reason became sublimer than enthusiasm . Under auspices like these , arose a long succession of orators and poets , whose writings we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Italy . Never did the vanquished take with them in their flight a richer treasure ; never will hospitality receive a return more noble . Among us , these models of the grand and beautiful might be faithfully preserved , but they would no longer find imitators ; they might enrich our archives , but they could never more impart inspiration . Our minds would rest inactive in a narrow sphere , as our empire was limited at last to the walls of Byzantium . But when these models shall have found a home in Italy , and the barbarous nations of the West , a new and glorious age shall dawn upon Europe . You , Italians , with your liberal ideas , your pacific sovereignties , and your republican cities , will be the first to witness the revival of the spirit of ancient Greece ; and the arts , in their progress from land to land , will at length resemble those fiery signals of which iEschylus has told us , blazing in quick succession from the summit of Ida to the mountain-tops of Mycena* , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by intelligence , that another company of Greeks have landed near Messina , and are anxious to rejoin their countrymen . The most distinguished of this new party is Gemistus Pletho who has ahandoned a brilliant and successful political career , to dwell in obscurity at Athens , amidst the ruins of ancient Greece . He was the friend of Cardinal Bessarion , who , anticipating his country 's fate , had for many years adhered to the Latin Church ; but upon whom , notwithstanding his apostacy , much of the hope of his countrymen still rested . The haughty air of Gernistus , and his majestic stature , impress the Italian travellers with respect and awe . Unlike Lascaris , in whom all hope appears to be extinguished , he looks forward with unxvavering confidence to the restoration of Greece . He declines the ur* , ent invitation of Medici to accompany Lascaris to Italy , and resolves to await the result of an application which he had already made to Cardinal Bessarion . This result is soon made known by letters from the Cardinal , who urges Gemistus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informing them at the same time , that the Pope had prepared an armament for the // relief of the Greeks ; and to shew the anxiety of Nicholas V. for the welfare of those Christians in the East who still adhered to the Roman Church , the letters are accompanied with a bull , n favor of the King of Cyprus . This paper was among the earliest examples of the art of printing , then recently discovered ; and the admiration of Lascaris , who is now for the first time made acquainted with the discovery , is thus expressed Happy effort of human invention , source of new truths , immortal safeguard of truths already known ! All the treasures of intellect which we have rescued from the flames are henceforward in security , even from the ravages of time . They shall be multiplied without number , they shall penetrate into every quarter of the globe ; and they shall carry into all the name and the genius of my country . Here , in the midst of my accumulated sufferings , I hail the dawning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letters are received at the same time from Cosmo de Medici ; who declares , that no confidence can be placed in the exertions of Christian Princes for the relief of Greece , and directs his son to invite all the wanderers of that unhappy nation to repair to Florence . The anxiety of Lascaris to depart is increased by the hostility which the Sicilians begin to show to the ceremonies of the Greek Church . At this period the bishop of Ephesus arrives ; whose zeal for his faith is in no degree diminished by the severest trials , and who determines publicly to perform its sacred rites . The description of this ceremony , which takes place by torch-light , beneath the chestnut of a hundred knights , ' is highly animated and beautiful . Arrayed in the long white robe of the Greek pontiffs , his head encircled with a crown , the bishop commenced the sacred rites with the same religious dignity and care , with which he could have celebrated them in Ephesus or Byzantium . The Greeks standing around him , with their heads covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , the hymn of the oriental church : Holy , Mighty , Immortal God , have mercy upon us ! ' At the moment when , according to the ritual of his church , the bishop addresses himself to the assembled people , he exclaimed : Almighty God ! Christian Greece is not yet destroyed , since in this desert place , beneath this wild shelter , we adore Thee still . Mahomet has indeed profaned Thy temple , he has broken the images of Thy saints : but our pure and spiritual worship depends not upon these perishable symbols . Condescend , 0 Most High , to sustain the faith of my brethren amidst the trials of captivity , and the // temptations of misfortune ! Preserve our holy religion from the cruelty and the protection of Mahomet ; forgive those prelates who bow to the authority of an impious master , and deprive theta not , unworthy as they are , of power to consecrate the people by Thy divine word ! ' The tree under which these rites are performed , had been consecrated to St. Agatha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon witnessing what they deem its profanation . The Greeks are protected from the effects of their rage by the intervention of Medici and his friends , and the Spanish governor of Catanea ; and are lodged in the fortress of that city during the remainder of the night . The next morning they proceed tinder an escort of Spanish soldiery , still accompanied by the Italian travellers , to the court of Alphonso-of Arragon , King of the Two Sicilies . An opportunity is afforded by the narrative of their journey , for a vivid description of the country through which they pass . Amidst the ruins of Selinonte , tbey perceive a venerable figure kneeling before the image of our Savior , near which a taper is burning , according to the rites of the Greek church . This person proves to be Nicephorus , bishop of Heraclea , the most distinguished Greek prelate who adhered to the Church of Rome ; and between whom , and his brother in misfortune , the bishop of Ephesus , a reconciliation is easily effected . The company at length arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This monarch , who is represented as combining a taste for letters with military talent , is anxious to retain them in his dominions ; but in compliance with their earnest wishes , reluctantly permits them to depart for Italy . Then bursts forth the full light of that memorable epoch , the dawn of which , a very few years earlier , began to purple the east . ' Then was accomplished that great revolution , to which most of the social improvements of succeeding years point backward , as their acknowledged source . But the affections of the Greeks still clung to their own oppressed and suffering land ; and the residue of the story , the whole of which is written with unusual grace and beauty , is occupied with the relation of their efforts to excite the sovereigns of Christendom in its behalf , of the repeated disappointment of all their hopes , and finally , of the later years and death of . some of the most eminent of their number . The old man ( Lascaris ) did not long survive . His death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imparted the idea of // superior civilisation and of a better life . But his disciples were spread abroad throughout Europe , carrying with them the memory of his dying words , and those delightful traditions of his own land , which he had so long and fondly cherished . A monument of white marble was for a long time preserved in Messina , which had been erected in memory of Lascaris by the first inhabitants of that city ; but the neglect of succeeding generations has suffered every trace of the memorial to pe*rish . Indifference is a destroyer rriore fatal than time ; and no vestige remains of him to whom Europe is still so much indebted , of the savior of the arts of Greece , but a few scattered traditions of his disciples , which we have here attempted to collect and to preserve . ' Mr. Villemain , in common with most of the distinguished scholars of Europe , felt a deep interest in the fortunes of the Greeks , during their late eventful struggle . This sentiment appears to have induced him to write the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , to the period , when they first became subject to the dominion of the Turks ; and which is followed by a historical sketch of the condition of Greece from the time of its subjugation to the year 1814 . This sketch , though very short , is yet valuable and interesting ; for it describes that condition during a period , which has not before been made the subject of a connected history ; and it shews also , that the sternest oppression , though it may subdue , has no power entirely to destroy the spirit of a gallant people . We find in it some traces of that energy and valor , which have been within a few years so signally displayed ; and the persevering courage of the Suhiotes in defending their native mountains against the force and treachery of Ali Pacha , is not surpassed in self-devotion by any other ancient or modern example . In a short essay upon the life and writings of Pope , our author displays his usual discernment , not wholly free , however , from national partiality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /lrt Po*tique of Boileau : considers the Lutrirt as in every respect superior to the Rape of the Lock ; and the satire .7/ mon Esprit as worth the whole Dunciad . But he has no sympathy with those modern censors , who , not content with assailing the poet 's private character , have labored to cast down his statue from the elevated place , which the world has been contented to assign to it for near a century . There is indeed something strange and almost peculiar , in the fate of // his poetical reputation . He was invested by the fond admira-* tion of his contemporaries , and the succeeding age , with almost despotic authority in the literary world ; but within a few years1 a new definition of poetry has been set up , with as much ceremony as a certain statue was anciently erected on the plain of Dura  --  a definition , which limits the domain of poetry to the world of nature , to the entire exclusion of the world of art , as if art were not itself one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be in some respects regarded as the poet of social life ; but it is far from being true , that his poetry is wholly the result of it , or that be never opened the windows of his saloon to behold the green fields ; ' and even if it had been so , we should still hesitate to adopt a definition , which would cashier nearly all poets , past , present , and to come . The controversy with respect to Pope 's title to the name has been carried on as fiercely as the battle raged of old over the dead body of Patroclus . From the warmth and vigor of the combatants , one would have thought , that instead of relating to the merits of a writer of the early part of the last century , it must have involved at the very least , some vexed problem of political economy , or some novel measure of taxation . We have neither rooni nor inclination to engage in this controversy at present ; more particularly , as the approbation of our own age appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have no disposition to doubt the correctness of the decision . In one particular , however , the world at large appears to be in some degree forgetful of its real obligations . We admit , that the poetry of Pope displays little of the infinite variety of Shakspeare , or the sublimity of Milton ; that it is inferior in power to that of Dryden ; but it must still be his unquestioned praise , that he carried the sustained harmony and sweetness of English versification to a degree of excellence unknown before . It is difficult , indeed , to detect much of the dulcet and harmonious in the earlier English poets . The rhymes of Chaucer form no exception to this remark ; those of Sydney would be very unlikely to ravish the ears of modern beauty ; the music as well as the dialect of Dr. Donne , might well enough have been pillaged from his bricklayers of Babel ; ' and even the good genius of Shakspeare , although it be as bright and beautiful as the Ariel of his own enchanter , appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he occasionally does , to the shackles of rhyme ; while Pope , on the contrary , wears the // chain with perfect grace and ease . We do not deny , that specimens of versification , equal if not superior to his , are to be found in the writings of some of the poets of the seventeenth century ; but we know no other example of uniform and unbroken perfection in this department of the art , before the time of Pope . Dryden 's translation of the ineid is superior in certain parts to any portion of Pope 's version of the Iliad ; but we think we hazard little in saying , that it is decidedly inferior in point of versification , considered as a whole . Now unless poetry should resemble the sort of music which the clown in Shakspeare declared to be most agreeable to his masternamely , that which can not be heard-it is really of some slight consequence , that it should not be too chromatic ; that it should not grate too harshly on the ear ; and we are far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have attempted to render their versilication more attractive , by making it resemble the pirates ' song in the Corsair , which seemed a song only to ears as rugged as the rocks that sent back its echo . With whatever other defects the little nightingale , ' as Pope was called in his youth , may be justly chargeable , we are inclined on the whole to consider it as by no means the smallest of his merits , that his claim to the poetical character is not founded on discordant harshness of versification . We take our leave of Mr. Villemain 's work , regretting that it is not in our power to give our readers a more adequate idea of its merits , and more numerous specimens of his pure and beautiful style . We can assure those who may be inclined to examine it , that it will abundantly reward the labor of perusal.
