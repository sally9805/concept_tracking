Davis , in the Clerk 's Office of the District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvanis PREFASE . Sum of the folks telld me that a prefase was of no use in this edishon of my letters , but I gues a book without a prefase is like a man without a head , and if a man wanted the head , every one knows what his boddy wud be wurth . But I want tu tell the folks jist this  --  There is a consarnt deal of letters publisht in my name that arnt ginuin ; so I 've resolved tu print my rale ones , and lave out the counterfeits . I kinder feel tho , that so many attempts to imitate my letters is complimentary , as every one likes to rite letters in my name , and the nearer they cum to the likeness the better they are . This is a sartan sine that I am popular , and that my day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have agreed tu publish this in Filadelfy , that I may have a chance to be more extensively known in the Key-stone-State where , I 'm told they have nominated me , and where they are rale whalers of fellers for Dimocrasy and the Gineral , who never change a bit but remaines true Jacksonmen , in spite of all Jackson can do . In this edishon I have put in my last letters . I wont tu sho that there 's one man in the nation who is n't afeard tu spake his mind . I wont tu let the peeple see that I 'm honest and that if I 'm elected , they will have a man , who never deals in Orakles , or abstroos metafisiks , sich as my opposer little Martin does , to sho his larnin and make folks scratch their heads whil readin tu understand him . I wont tu let them see tu , that I have ritin qualifikashons for a President , that I 'm the rale stuff , and no slouch . If I 'm tu be President , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able tu fine out all my mistakes , bekase I 'm a good republikin , and do nt wont tu go rong any further than I can help ; and when the peeple are knowin they will keep a good look out , tu see if I go rong and tell me . I do nt wont tu have all my own way , except'n the vetoe , which is a consarnt good thing , as it keeps the Congress from duin foolish things , and I cant see what use the rite tu veto was put in the constitushon , if it was n't tu use it on all okasions , and jest tu let the peeple see and feel the thority of the President . It is a kinder pulse , tu try by how far a President can go his own gate , and the peeple still cry hoorra . This edishon has sum advantages over every other . It is selected with keer , and contains many important letters on the great consarns of the nashon , sent to the Portland Currier , and my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far , the best Edishon yet publisht .

From the New York Daily Advertiser . The Downings.  --  The celebrity of Major Jack Downing has created an intense and very natural curiosity in the public mind to know something of his origin and ancestry . Hoping that some of the down-east antiquaries and genealogists will favour the world with the information desired , I submit to your disposal the following imperfect notice of Sir George Downing , one of the Major 's ancestors , which I have drawn from an interesting and learned work now in a course of publication , in numbers , entitled Memorial of the Graduates of Harvard University , in Cambridge , Mass . Commencing with the first class , 1642 . By John Farmer , Cor . Sec. of the N. H. Hist . Society . ' George Downing was born in London in 1624 , and accompanied his parents to this country when about thirteen years of age . His father , Emanual Downing , a great friend of New England , was brother-in-law to John Winthrop , one of the principal founders and first governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About 1646 he returned to England , when he was soon brought into notice , being , as Gov . Winthrop says , a very able scholar , and of ready wit and fluent utterance . ' He was appointed chaplain in the regiment of Col. John Okey , in the army of Lord Fairfax , who had command of the Parliament forces in the north . In 1653 he was commissary general , and about the same time scout-master-general of the English army in Scotland . In the same year he was employed in negotiations with the Duke of Savoy . He seems to have been fitted by nature for scenes of political manoeuvering ; and his principles were of such flexible character , that he could easily accommodate them to any service which the times required . In 1655 he visited the French king on public business , and communicated his instructions in Latin . In 1657 he was appointed minister to Holland . In March , 1662 , while in that country , in order to show his zeal and love for his majesty , he procured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barkstead , three of the Judges who had condemned to death Charles I , and sent them to England for trial . Okey had been the friend of Downing , who served in his regiment as chaplain . With the other two , he had co-operated in the cause of the Parliament . His conduct , therefore , in this transaction was justly reprobated . He also spake of Cromwell as a traitor and rebel . In 1663 , he was created a baronet . He informed Pepys that , when in Holland , he had so good spys , that he hath had the keys taken out of De Witt 's ( the Dutch minister ) pocket when he was abed , and his closet opened and papers brought to him and left in his hands for an hour , and carried back and laid in the place again , and the keys put into his pocket . He says he hath had their most private debates , that have been between but two or three of them , brought to him , and in an hour after that hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was again sent to Holland , but returning before he had executed the business of his mission to the satisfaction of the king , was imprisoned in the tower . He was afterwards restored to royal favour . In the difficulties which the New England colonies had with Charles II , from 1669 , Mr. Downing was represented as having been very friendly to Massachusetts . He died in 1684 at the age of 60 . Major Jack Downing , of Downingville , seems to have inherited his distinguished ancestor 's talents for war , business , and diplomacy , and , like him , to possess ready wit and fluent utterance , and to bask in the sunshine of royal favour . Whether he resembles him in other respects , time must disclose . LETTER II . Argument Mr. Downing describes the method of making a Speaker . Letter - Monday , Jan. 18 , 1830. - To Cousin Ephraim Downing up in Downingville Dear Cousin Ephraim.  --  I now take my pen in hand to let you know that I am well , hoping these few lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down to Portland I did n't think o ' staying more than three or four days , if I could sell my load of ax handles , and mother 's cheese , and cousin Nabby 's bundle of footings ; but when I got here I found uncle Nat was gone a freighting down to Quoddy , and ant Sally said as how I should n't stir a step home till he came back agin , which wont be this month . So here I am , loitering about this great town , as lazy as an ox . Ax handles do nt fetch nothing , I could n't hardly give ' em away . Tell cousin Nabby I sold her footings for nine-pence a pair , and took it all in cotton cloth . Mother 's cheese come to five-and-sixpence ; I got her a pound of shushon , and two ounces of snuff , and the rest in sugar . When uncle Nat comes home I shall put my ax handles aboard of him , and let him take ' em to Boston next time he goes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd fetch a good price there . I 've been here now a whole fortnight , and if I could tell ye one half I 've seen , I guess you 'd stare worse than if you 'd seen a catamount . I 've been to meeting , and to the museum , and to both Legislaters , the one they call the House , and the one they call the Sinnet . I spose uncle Joshua is in a great hurry to hear something about these Legislaters ; for you know he 's always reading newspapers , and talking politics , when he can get any body to talk with him . I 've seen him , when he had five tons of hay in the field well made , and a heavy shower coming up , stand two hours disputing with squire W. about Adams and Jackson , one calling Adams a tory and a fed , and the other saying Jackson was a murderer and a fool ; so they kept it up , till the rain began to pour down , and about spoilt all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the bushel of corn that he bet long with the post-master , that Mr. Ruggles would be Speaker of that Legislater , they call the House ; for he ' s lost it , slick as a whistle . As I had n't much to do , I ' ve been there every day since they ' ve been a setting . A Mr. White of Monmouth was the Speaker the two first days ; and I cant see why they did n't keep him in all the time ; for he seemed to be a very clever good-natured sort of man , and he had such a smooth pleasant way with him , that I could n't help feeling sorry when they turned him out and put in another . But some said he was n't put in hardly fair ; and I do nt know as he was , for the first day when they were all coming in and crowding round , there was a large fat man , with a round , full , jolly sort of face , I suppose he was the captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , and then he told this Mr. White to whip into the chair quicker than you could say Jack Robinson . Some of'em scolded about it , and I heard some , in a little room they called the lobby , say ' t was a mean trick ; but I could n't see why , for I thought Mr. White made a capital Speaker , and when our company turns out you know the captain always has a right to do as he 's a mind to . They kept disputing most all the time the two first days about a poor Mr. Roberts from Waterborough.  --  Some said he should n't have a seat , because he adjourned the town meeting , and was n't fairly elected .  --  Others said it was no such thing , and that he was elected as fairly as any of ' em . And Mr. Roberts himself said he was , and said he could bring men that would swear to it , and good men too . But notwithstanding all this , when they came to vote , they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . And I thought it a needless piece of cruelty , for they want crowded , and there was a number of seats empty . But they would have it so , and the poor man had to go and stand up in the lobby . Then they disputed awhile about a Mr. Fowler 's having a seat . Some said he should n't have a seat , because when he was elected some of his votes were given for his father . But they were more kind to him than they were to Mr. Roberts ; for they voted that he should have a seat ; and I suppose it was because they thought he had a lawful right to inherit whatever was his father 's . They all declared there was no party politics about it , and I do nt think there was ; for I noticed that all who voted that Mr. Roberts should have a seat , voted that Mr. Fowler should not ; and all who voted that Mr. Roberts should not have a seat , voted that Mr. Fowler should . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted as their consciences told them , and I do nt see how there could be any party about it . It ' s a pity they could n't be allowed to have two speakers , for they seemed to be very anxious to choose Mr. Ruggles and Mr. Goodenow . They two had every vote , except one , and if they had had that , I believe they would both have been chosen ; as it was , however , they both came within a humbird 's eye of it . Whether it was Mr. Ruggles that voted for Mr. Goodenow , or Mr. Goodedow for Mr. Ruggles , I cant exactly tell ; but I rather guess it was Mr. Ruggles voted for Mr. Goodenow , for he appeared to be very glad that Mr. Goodenow was elected , and went up to him soon after Mr. Goodenow took the chair , and shook hands with him as good-natured as could be . I would have given half my load of ax handles , it they could both have been elected and set up there together , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have but one speaker at a time , and as Mr. Goodenow appears to understand the business very well , it is not likely Mr. Ruggles will be speaker any this winter . So uncle Joshua will have to shell out his bushel of corn , and I hope it will learn him better than to bet about politics again . If he had not been a goose , he might have known he would loose it , even if he had been ever so sure of getting it ; for in these politics there 's never any telling which way the cat will jump . You know , before the last September election , some of the papers that came to our town had found out that Mr. Hunton would have five thousand majority of the votes . And some of the other papers had found out that Mr. Smith would have five thousand majority . But the cat jumped ' tother way to both of ' em ; for I cant find yet as either of ' em got any majority . Some say Mr. Hunton has got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I am from home . And as for Mr. Smith , they do nt think he has any majority at all . You remember , too , before I came from home , some of the papers said how there was a majority of ten or fifteen national republicans in the Legislater , and the other papers said there was a pretty clever little majority of democratic republicans . Well , now every body says it has turned out jest as that queer little paper , called the Daily Courier , said ' t would . That paper said it was such a close rub , it could n't hardly tell which side would beat . And it ' s jst so , for they 've been here now most a fortnight acting jest like two boys playin see-saw on a rail . First one goes up , then ' tother ; but I reckon one of the boys is rather heaviest , for once in awhile he comes down chuck , and throws the other up into the air as though he would pitch him head over heels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been some of the drollest carryins on that you ever heard of . If I can get time I 'll write you something about it , pretty soon . So I subscribe myself , in haste , your loving cousin till death . JACK DOWNING . LETTER III . Uncle Joshua 's visit to Boston , and dines with the Gineral Court Dear Neffu ,  --  I left home just after your letter to your cousin Ephraim got there , and I did n't get a sight of your letter to me that you put in the Courier at Portland , until I saw it in the Daily Advertiser in Boston , and I guess Mr. Hale is the only person in Boston who takes that are little Courier , so you was pretty safe about the letter not being seen , as the printer promised you .  --  How I happened to see it here , you will find out before I have got through with this letter . I guess you wont be a little struck up when you find out that I 'm in Boston  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall get thro ' quicker . After seeing your letter to Ephraim as I said before , I concluded it would'nt be a bad scheme to tackle up and take a load of turkies , some apple-sauce , and other notions that the neighbors wanted to get to market , and as your uncle Nat would be in Boston with the ax handles , we all thought best to try our luck there . Nothing happened worth mentioning on the road , nor till next morning after I got here and put up in Elm street . I then got off my watch pretty curiously , as you shall be informed . I was down in the bar room , and tho't it well enough to look pretty considerable smart , and now and then compared my watch with the clock in the bar and found it as near right as ever it was  --  when a feller stept up to me and ask't how I 'd trade ? and says I , for what ? and says he for your watch  --  and says I , any way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll give you my watch and five dollarn  --  Says I , its done ! He gave me the five dollars , and I gave him my watch . Now , says I , give me your watch  --  and says he , with a loud laugh , I ha n't got none  --  and that kind aturn 'd the laugh on me . Thinks I , let them laugh that lose . Soon as the laugh was well over , the feller thought he 'd try the watch to his ear  --  why , says he , it do nt go  --  no , says I , not without its carried  --  then I began to laugh  --  he tried to open it and could'nt start it a hair , and broke his thumb nail into the bargain . Wo n't she open , says he ? Not 's I know on , says I  --  and then the laugh seemed to take onother turn . Do n't you think I got off the old Brittannia pretty well , considerin ? And then I thought I 'd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I expected to have gone all over town to sell my load , but Mr. Doolittle told me if I 'd go down to the new market , I should find folks enough to buy all I had at once . So down I goes , and a likely kind of a feller , with an eye like a hawk and quick as a steeltrap for a trade , ( they called him a 4th staller , ) came up to the wagon , and before you could say Jack Robinson , we struck a bargain for the whole cargo  --  and come to weigh and reckon up , I found I should get as much as 10s6d more than any of us calculated before I left home , and had the apple-sauce left besides . So I thought I 'd jist see how this 4th staller worked his card to be able to give us so good a price for the turkies , and I went inside the market-house , and a grander sight I never expect to see ! But it was the 3d staller instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looking so much better that I hardly should know ' em . Pretty soon , a gentleman asked the 3d staller what he asked for turkies ? Why , says he , if you want something better than you ever saw before , there 's some ' t was killed last night purpose for you . You may take ' em at 9d , being it 's you . I 'll give you 12 cents , said the gentleman , as I 've got some of the General Court to dine with me , and must treat well . I shant stand for half a cent with an old customer , says he . And so they traded ; and in about the space of half an hour or more , all my turkies went into baskets at that rate . The 4th staller gave me 6d a pound , and I began to think I 'd been a little too much in a hurry for trade  --  but 's no use to cry for spilt milk . Then I went up to the State House to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get off my apple-sauce on my way  --  and seeing a sign of old clothes bartered , I stepped in and made a trade , and which did n't cost much I guess , at home . ) Accordingly I rigged myself up in the new suit , and you 'd hardly known me . I did n't like the set of the shoulders , they were so dreadful puckery ; but the man said that was all right . I guess he 'll find the apple-sauce full as puckery when he gets down into it  --  but that 's between ourselves . Well , when I got up to the State House I found them at work on the rail road  --  busy enough I can tell you  --  they got a part of it made already . I found most all the folks kept their hats on except the man who was talking out loud and the man he was talking to  --  all the rest seemed to be busy about their own consarns . As I did n't see any body to talk to I kept my hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what was going on . I had n't been setting long before I saw a slick-headed , sharp-eyed little man , who seemed to have the principal management of the folks , looking at me pretty sharp , as much as to say who are you ? but I said nothing and looked tother way  --  at last he touched me on the shoulder  --  I thought he was feeling of the puckers . Are you a member ? says he  --  sartin says I  --  how long have you taken your seat ? says he . About ten minutes , says I. Are you qualified ? says he . I guess not , says I. And then he left me . I did n't know exactly what this old gentleman was after  --  but soon he returned and said it was proper for me to be qualified before I took a seat , and I must go before the governor ! By Jing ! I never felt so before in oll my born days . As good luck would have it , he was beckoned to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back was turned I give him the slip . Jest as I was going off , the gentleman who bought my turkies of the 4th staller took hold of my arm , and I was afraid at first that he was going to carry me to the Governor  --  but he began to talk as sociable as if we had been old acquaintances . How long have you been in the house , Mr. Smith , says he . My name is Downing , said I. I beg your pardon , says he  --  I mean Downing . It 's no offence , says I , I hav'nt been here long . Then says he in a very pleasant way , a few of your brother members are to take pot-luck with me to-day , and I should be very happy to have you join them . What 's pot-luck said I. O , a family dinner , says he  --  no ceremony . I thought by this time I was well qualified for that without going to the Governor . So says I , yes , and thank ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I. At 3 o'clock , says he , and gave me a piece of paste board with his name on it  --  and the name of the street , and the number of his house , and said that would show me the way . Well , says I , I do nt know of nothing that will keep me away , And then we parted . I took considerable liking to him . After strolling round and seeing a great many things about the State House and the marble image of Gin . Washington , standing on a stump in the Porch , I went out into the street they call Bacon street , and my stars ! what swarms of women folks I saw all drest up as if they were going to meetin . You can tell cousin Polly Sandburn , who you know is no slimster , that she need n't take on so about being genteel in her shapes  --  for the genteelest ladies here beat her as to size all hollow . I do nt believe one of ' em could get into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't want better measure for a bushel of meal than one of their sleeves could hold . I shant shell out the bushel of corn you say I 've lost on Speaker Ruggles at that rate . But this puts me in mind of the dinner which Mr.  --  wants I should help the Gineral Court eat . So I took out the piece of paste board , and began to inquire my way and got along completely , and found the number the first time  --  but the door was locked , and there was no knocker , and I I thumpt with my whip handle , but nobody come . And says I to a man going by , do nt nobody live here ? and says he yes . Well , how do you get in ? Why , says he , ring ; and says I , ring what ? And says he , the bell . And says I where 's the rope ? And says he , pull that little brass nub : and so I gave it a twitch , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think opened the door with a white apron afore him ? You could n't guess for a week a Sundays  --  so I 'll tell you . It was Stephen Furlong , who kept our district school last winter , for 5 dollars a month , and kept bachelor 's hall , and helped tend for Gineral Coombs a training days , and make out muster rolls . We was considerably struck up at first , both of us ; and when he found I was going to eat dinner with Mr.  --  and Gineral Court , he thought it queer kind of doings  --  but says he , I guess it will be as well for both of us not to know each other a bit more than we can help . And says I , with a wink , you 're half right , and in I went . There was nobody in the room but Mr.  --  and his wife , and not a sign of any dinner to be seen any where  --  though I thought now and then when a side door opened , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be puzzled enough to know what to say , but I had n't my thoughts long to myself . Mr.  --  has about as nimble a tongue as you ever heard , and could say ten words to my one , and I had nothing to do in the way of making talk . Just then I heard a ringing , and Stephen was busy in opening the door and letting in the Gineral Court . who all had their hats off , and looking pretty scrumptious , you may depend . I did'nt see but I could stand along side of ' em without disparagement , except to my boots , which had just got a lick of beeswax and tallow  --  not a mite of dinner yet , and I began to feel as if ' t was nearer supper time than dinner time  --  when all at once two doors flew away from each other right into the wall , and what did I see but one of the grandest thanksgiving dinners you ever laid your eyes on  --  and lights on the table , and silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed  --  I guess more than one of us stared at first , but we soon found the way to our mouths  --  I made Stephen tend out for me pretty sharp , and he got my plate filled three or four times with soup , which beat all I ever tasted . I sha n't go through the whole dinner agian to you  --  but I am mistaken if it cost me much for victuals this week , if I pay by the meal at Mr. Doolittle 's , who comes pretty near up to a thanksgiving every day . There was considerable talk about stock and manufactories , and lier bilities , and rimidies , and a great loss on stock . I thought this a good chance for me to put in a word  --  for I calculated I knew as much about raising stock and keeping over as any of ' em . Says I to Mr.  --  , there 's one thing I 've always observed in my experience in stock  --  just as sure as you try to keep over more stock than you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will die on your hands , to a sartinty  --  and there 's no remedy for it  --  I 've tried it out and out , and there 's no law that can make a ton of hay keep over ten cows , unless you have more carrots and potatoes than you can throw a stick at . This made some of the folks stare who did n't know much about stock  --  and Steve give me a jog , as much as to say , keep quiet . He thought I was getting into a quog-mire , and soon after , giving me a wink , opened the door and got me out of the room into the entry . After we had got out of hearing , says I to Steve , how are you getting on in the world  --  should you like to come back to keep our school if I could get a vote for you !  --  not by two chalks , says Steve  --  I know which side my bread is buttered better than all that  --  I get 12 dollars a month and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is better than keeping school at 5 dollars and find myself , and work out my highway tax besides  --  then turning up the cape of my new coat , says he , I guess I 've dusted that afore now  --  most likely , says I , but not in our district school . And this brings to mind to tell you how I got a sight of your letter . They tell me here that every body reads the Boston Daily Advertiser , because there is no knowing but what they may find out something to their advantage , so I thought I would be as wise as the rest of them , and before I got half through with it , what should I find mixed up among the news but your letter that you put into that little paper down in Portland , and I knew it was your writing before I had read ten lines of it . I hope I 've answered it to your satisfaction . Your respected uncle , JOSHUA DOWNING . P. S. Mr. Topliff says your uncle Nat is telegraphed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to much  --  I find the Boston folks made a handle of most any thing they can lay hold of , and just as like as not they 'll make a handle of our private letters , if they should see them . N. B. You spell dreadful bad , according to my notion  --  and this proves what I always said , that our district has been going down hill ever since Stephen Furlong left it . LETTER IV . Argument Mr. Downing relates the scrape the legislature got into , in trying to make a number of governors . Letter - Feb. 1 , 1830. - To Cousin Ephraim Downing up in Downingville Dear Cousin Ephraim.  --  I spose you expected me to write to you agin long afore now and tell you something more about these legislaters , and I meant to , but I could n't very well ; for I 'll tell you jest how twas.  --  Some days , when the legislater would get into a plaguy hobble , I would think to myself , well , soon as they get out of this snarl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about it ; but before they got fairly out of that , they 'd be right into another ; and if I waited till next day to see how that ended , my keesers ! before night they 'd all be higgeldy piggle in a worse hobble than they 'd ever been in afore . So if I wait to tell you how it comes out , I believe I shall have to wait till haying time . Another thing I 've been waiting for , was to tell you who was Governor . But , O dear , I cant find out half so much about it now , here in this great city of Portland , where all the Governors live , as I could six months ago among the bear traps and log houses in our town , way back into the woods . Last August , you know , according to the papers we were going to have two Governors right off , sure as rates ; Mr. Hunton and Mr. Smith . Well now its got to be the first of February , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had four or five under way for a month past , some think it very doubtful whether they will get one done so as to be fit to use this year . There 's Mr. Hunton , and Mr. Smith , and Mr. Culter , and Mr. Goodenow , and Mr. Hall , have all been partly made into Governors ; but when in all creation any of ' em will be finished , I guess it would puzzle a Philadelphy lawyer to tell . I stated in my letter to uncle Joshua , that there were two very clever parties in the legislater , the democratic republikans and the national republikans ; and they are so , and very industrious , and try to make things go on right ; and I really believe , if the confounded Jacksonites and Huntonites did n't bother ' em so , they 'd make us a Governor , as quick as I could make an ax handle . It is enough to do any body 's heart good to see how kind and obliging these democratic republikans and national republikans are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other along ; and its enough to make any body 's blood boil to see the Jacksonites and Huntonites , jest like the dog in the manger , because they cant eat the hay themselves , snap at these two clever parties the moment either of ' em sets out to take a mouthful . I 'll jest give you an instance of the kindness that these two clever parties show to each other . You know the constitution says when we have n't any Governor the President of the Sinnet must be Governor , and when we have n't any President of the Sinnet , the Speaker of the House must be Governor . So when Governor Lincoln died Mr. Cutler was Governor for awhile , because he was last year President of the Sinnet . Mr. Goodenow is a national republikan , and when he was elected Speaker of the House , the democratic republikans told him as there was no President of the Sinnet elected yet , it belonged to him to be Governor , and tried as hard as though he had belonged to their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council chamber and do the governor 's business . But the national republikans did n't dare to let him go , for he was elected by only one majority , and they said if he should leave the chair , it would n't be five minutes before a Jacksonite would be whisked into it , and then the two clever parties would all be up a tree . Well , jest so t was in the Sinnet after Elder Hall was elected president , only the bread was buttered on tother side . Elder Hall is a democrat republikan , and there was a great deal tougher scrabble to elect him , than there was to choose the Speaker of the House . But as soon as he was elected , the national republikans went to him very kindly , and said , Elder Hall , by the provisions of the constitution you are now fairly Governor of the State till another governor is qualified . Do nt be bashful about it , but please to walk right into the Council chamber , and do the governor 's business . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for if he should , the Sinnet Board would be capsized in an instant and the Huntonites would rule the roast . So there was a pair of Governors spoilt when they were more than half made , jest by the michief of the Jacksonites and Huntonites . And the consequence is , that Mr. Cutler has to keep doing the Governor 's business yet , whether he wants to or not , and whether it is right for him to , or not . They say the poor man is a good deal distressed about it , and has sent to the great Judges of the Supreme Court to know whether it 's right for him to be Governor any longer or not . If the Judges should say he mus ' nt be Governor any longer , we shall be in a dreadful pickle . Only think , no Governor , and no laws , but every body do jest as they 're a mind to . Well , if that should be the case , I know one thing , that is , Bill Johnson will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coward last summer ; I 've longed to give it to him ever since ; and if the Legislater do n't make a governor this winter , I shall come right home , and Bill must look out . What a pity ' t is they should waste so much time trying to make so many governors ; for , if they should make a dozen , we should n't want to use but one this year ; and it is thought if they had all clapt to and worked upon one instead of working upon so many , they might have had him done more than three weeks ago . Your lovin cuzen til death , JACK DOWNING . LETTER V. Argument Mr. Downing describes the predicament in which the house of Representatives got into . Letter - Tuesday , Feb. 2 , 1830 . Dear Cousin Ephraim ,  --  I have just time to write you a short postscript to a letter that I shall send you in a day or two . We have had a dreadful time here to-day . You know the wheels of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they all clapt their shoulders under to-day , and give ' em a lift ; and they started so hard , that as true as you 're alive , they split both Legislaters right in tu . Some say they are split so bad , they ca n't mend ' em again , but I hope they can though ; I shall tell you all about how ' t was done , in a day or two . I 've been expecting a letter from you , or some of the folks , sometime . As I 've got prerty short of money , I wish you would send ' em in the Daily Courier , so I shant have to pay the postage . Your hearty cousin , JACK DOWNING . LETTER VI . Argument In which things look brighter . Letter - Feb. 3 , 1830 . Cousin Ephraim ,  --  I thought I would jest write you another little postscript to my letter that I was going to send you in a day or tu , and let you know that the legislaters want split so bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em both mended again , so that they set ' em agoing to day afore noon . But in the arternoon , that legislater they call the Sinnet , got struck , and in trying to make it go , it rather seemed to crack a little ; so they stopt short till to-morrow . Its been jostled about so , and got so weak an ' rickety , some are afraid it will give out yet , or split in tu again . JACK DOWNING . LETTER VII . Argument An account of the trigging of the wheels of government . Letter - Thursday Feb. 11 , 1831 . Dear Cousin Ephraim.  --  I 've wrote you three postscripts since I wrote you a letter , and the reason is , these Legislaters have been carryin on so like all possest , and I 've been in looking at ' em so much , I could n't get time to write more than three lines at once , for fear I should be out of the way , and should miss seeing some of the fun . But thinkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the printer to send my letter yesterday ; but he told me right up and down he could n't . I told him he must , for I ought to sent before now .  --  But he said he could n't and would n't , and that was the upshot of the matter , for the paper was chock full , and more tu , of the Governor 's message . Bless my stars , says I , and have we got a Governor done enough so he can speak a message ? Yes , indeed we have , says he , thanks be to the two great republikin parties , who have saved the State from the anarkee of the Jacksonites and Huntonites ; the Governor is done , and is jest a going into the Lesislater , and if you ' ll go right up there , you can see him . So I pushed in among the crowd , and I got a pretty good squeezin tu ; but I got a good place , for I could elbow it as well as any on ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly , before we had a Governor sure enough ; and a good stout , genteel looking sort of a man he was tu , as you would see in a whole regiment , taking in captains and all .  --  Nobody disputed that he was finished pretty workman-like ; and he ought to be , for they ' d been long enough about it . So they concluded to swear him in , as they call it , and he took a great oath to behave like a Governor a whole year . Some say the wheels of government will go along smooth and easy now , as a wheelbarrow across a brick yard ; but some shake their heads , and say the wheels will be jolting over rocks and stumps all winter yet ; and I do nt know but they will , for the Governor had n't hardly turned his back upon ' em and gone out , before they went right to disputing agin as hard as ever . I was a good mind to run out and call the Governor back to still ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , so they got clear of a drubbing that time . I know he ' d a gin it to ' em if he ' d been there ; for what do you think was the first thing they went to disputing about ? It was how many Governor 's speeches they should print this winter ; jest as if the Governor could n't tell that himself . Some wanted three hundred , and some five hundred , and some seven or eight hundred . Finally they concluded to print five hundred ; and I should think that was enough in all conscience , if they are all going to be as long as that one they printed in the Courier yesterday . In the next place , they took up that everlasting dispute about Mr. Roberts ' having a seat ; for if you ' ll believe me , they 've kept that poor man standing there till this time . I 'll tell you how t is , Cousin Ephraim , we must contrive some way or other to keep these Jacksonites and Huntonites out of the Legislater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they make pesky bad work , triging the wheels of government . They ' ve triged ' em so much that they say it has cost the State about fifteen thousand dollars a'ready , more than ' t would , if they had gone along straight without stopping . So you may tell uncle Joshua that besides that bushel of corn he lost in betting about the Speaker , he 'll have to shell out as much as two bushels more to pay the cost of triging the wheels . Jingoe ! sometimes when I 've seen the wheels chocked with a little trig not bigger than a cat 's head , and the whole legislater trying with all their might two or three days , and could n't start it a hair , how I 've longed to hitch on my little speckled four-year-olds , and give ' em a pull ; if they would n't make the wheels fly over the trigs in a jiffy , I wont guess agin . ' Tother day in a great convention , when both Legislaters met together to chuse some Counsellors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain how ' t was the wheels of government were trig 'd so much . Mr. Boutelle , as I have told you a-fore , is a national republican , and Mr. Smith is a democratic republican .  --  They differed a little in their opinion . Mr. Boutelle seemed to think the trigs were all put under by one class of politicians , and from what he said , I took it he meant the Jacksonites . He said ever since the Legislater began , the moment they started the wheels , that class of politicians would throw under a chock and stop ' em ; and which ever way they turned , that class of politicians would meet ' em at every corner and bring ' em up all standin . Mr. Smith seemed to think another class of politicians had the greatest hand in it , and it was pretty clear he meant the Huntonites . He said when they first got here , that class of politicians sot the wheels of government rolling the wrong way ; they put the big wheels forward , and the Legislater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobster . And the Huntonites not only trig 'd the wheels , whenever they begun to roll the right way ; but as soon as the blessed Governor ' was done they trig 'd him tu ; and though he had been done four days , they would'nt let him come into the Legislater so that their eyes could be blest with the sight of him . So from what I can find out , the Jacksonites and Huntonites both , are a troublesome contrary set , and there must be some way contrived to keep ' em out of the Legislater in future . It seems soon after you got my first letter , uncle Joshua tackled up , and started off to Boston with a load of turkeys and apple-sauce . I had a letter from him t' other day , as long as all out doors , in the Boston Advertiser . He says he got more for the turkeys than he expected tu ; but I think its a plaguy pity he did'nt bring ' em to Portland . I know he 'd got more than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderfully , on account of these Legislaters being likely to stay here all winter ; and some think the 'll be here half the summer tu . And then there 's sich a cloud of what they call lobby members and office hunters , that the butchers have got frightened , and gone to buying up all the beef and pork they can get hold on far and near for they are afraid a famine will be upon us next . Howsomever , uncle Joshua did well to carry his puckery apple-sauce ' to Boston . He could n't get a cent for't here ; for every body 's puckery and soar enough here now . Give my love to father and mother and cousin Nabby . I shall answer their letters as soon as I can . Your lovin Cousin , JACK DOWNING . LETTER VIII . Argument Mr. Downing advises his uncle Joshua to hold on to his bushel of corn as the legislature had undertaken " to rip up their duins . " Letter - Friday , Feb. 12 , 1830 . Postscript to uncle Joshua . THIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have'nt paid over that are bushel of corn yet , that you lost when you bet Mr. Ruggles would be Speaker , hold on to it for your life , till you hear from me agin , for I ai nt so clear but you may save it yet . They 've gone to rippin up their duins here , and there 's no knowing but they may go clear back to the beginning and have another tug about Speaker . At any rate , if your bushel of corn is'nt gone out of your crib yet , I advise you by all means to keep it there . Tell ' squire N. the question is'nt settled yet ; and you wont shell out a single kernel till it is fairly nailed and clinched , so it ca n't be ript up agin . I 'll tell you what ' t is , uncle Josh , the Supreme Court beats the Jacksonites and Huntonites all hollow for trigging the wheels . You know after they had such a tussle for about a week to chose Elder Hall President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow , for they said he had a majority of eight out of sixteen , they went on then two or three weeks nicely , duin business tie and tie , hard as they could . Then up steps the Judges of the Supreme Court and tells Mr. Hall he was governor , and ought to go into the Council Chamber . They seemed to be a little bit thunder struck at first . But they soon come to agin , and Elder Hall got out of the chair and Mr. Kingsbury got into it , and they jogged along another week , duin business as hard as ever . They said all the chairs round the table ought to be filled , so they changed works with the House and made four more Sinneters . So having four good fresh hands come in , they took hold in good earnest and turned off more business in two days , than they had done in a month before . Then up steps the Supreme Court agin and tells ' em their cake is all dough ; for they had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dreadful touse . They went right to work rippin up and tarrin away what they 'd been duin ; and before nine o'clock in the evening they turned out the four new Sinneters , out of their chairs and appointed a committee to begin to make four more . They took hold so hash about it , I spose some the rest of the Sinneters begun to be afraid they should be ript up tu ; so they clear 'd out , I guess near about half on ' em , and have n't been seen nor heard of to day . Some of ' em that had more courage went in and tried to do business ; but there was n't enough of ' em to start an inch . They sent a man all around town in the forenoon and afternoon to tell ' m to come in and go to work , but he could n't find hide nor hair of one of ' em . Elder Hall said he guessed they must be somewhere in a convention . Some say they 'll rip up the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Sinneters helpt make em all . But there 's one comfort left for us , let the cat jump which way ' twill ; if Mr. Hunton is n't a constitutional Governor , Elder Hall is ; the Judges have nailed that fast . So think Bill Johnson will get off with a whole skin , for I shant dare to flog him this year . If they go clear back to the Speaker , and decide it in favor of your bushel of corn , I shall let you know as soon as possible . Your lovin neffu , JACK DOWNING . LETTER IX . Argument The queer duins of the senate described . Letter - To Cousin Ephraim Downing up in Downingville - Wednesday , Feb. 17 , 1830 . Dear Cousin Ephraim ,  --  Here I am yet , and have n't much else to du , so I might as well keep writin to you ; for I spose uncle Joshua ' s in a peck of trouble about his bushel of corn . I 'm pesky fraid he 'll lose it yet ; for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first night they begun . The truth was they took hold rather tu hash that night ; and rippin up them are four new Sinneters so quick , they scart away four or five more old ones , so they did n't dare to come in again for tu days . And that threw ' em all into the suds , head and ears . It was worse than triging the wheels , for it broke the Sinnet wheel right in tu , and left it so flat , that all Job 's oxen never could start it , if they had n't got it mended again . They tried , to keep duin something , but they could n't du the leastest thing . One time they tried to du something with a little bit of a message that was sent to ' em on a piece of paper from the House . The President took it in his hand , and held it up , and asked ' em what best to du with it . Some of ' em motioned that they 'd lay it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found they could n't according to the constitution , without there was more of ' em to help . They said they could n't lay it on the table , nor du nothin at all with it . I was afraid the poor old gentleman would have to stand there and hold it till they got the wheel mended agin . But I believe he finally let it drop on the table ; and I spose there was nothin in the constitution against that . They got the wheel mended Monday about eleven er clock , so they could start along a little . But them are four new Sinneters that they ript up Thursday night , come right back agin Monday , and sot down to the great round table ; and stood tu it through thick and thin , that they want rip up , and no sich thing . Well , this kicked up a kind of a bobbery among ' em , so they thought they 'd try to journ . The President counted ' em , and said they were journed and might go out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count right , and they want journed a bit ; and they must set still and have an overhauling about it . So they set down agin , all but four or five that put on their hats and great coats and stood backside of the room . The room was chock full of folks looking on , and the President told ' em the Sinnet was journed and they might as well go out , but they did seem to keer tu , and they put their hats on and began to laugh like fun . The President sot still in his cheer , for I spose he thought if he left it , some of them are roguish fellers would be gettin into it . The man that keeps order , told the folks they must take their hats off when they were in the Sinnet ; but they said they would n't , cause the Sinnet was adjourned . Then the man went and asked the President if the Sinnet was all adjourned , and the President said ' t was , and there was no doubt about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could wear their hats when the Sinneters were setting round the great table , that they kind of whistled a little bit all over the room . Finally , after settin about half an hour , another man got up and motioned to ajourn , and the President got up and put it to vote agin . He told ' em if they wanted to ajourn , they must say ah , and they all said ah this time , and cleared out in five minutes . But about this rippin up business ; instead of rippin up the councillors , as some thought they would , both legislaters met together to-day , and called in four of the councillors , and nailed ' em down harder with an oath . They 've sot the committees to work like fun now , and its thought they 'll turn off business hand over hand ; for you know its almost March , and then the great Supreme Court meets here . And they say they have a grand jury that picks up all disorderly and mischievous folk , and carries ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail . These legislaters have been cuttin up such rigs here all winter , that they begin to look pretty shy when any thing is said about the first of March , and I do nt believe the grand jury ' ll be able to find a single mother 's son of ' em when the court gets here .

Dear Cousin .  --  As soon as you get this , I want you to load up tho old lumber-box with them are long slick bean-poles , that I got out last summer .

You know when we went to the court there was a man sot up in a box , that they called a Sheriff , and held a long white pole in his hand . Well I heard somebody say other day that there was more than a hundred folks here that wanted to get a Sheriff 's pole ; and I happened to think that them are bean poles would make cute ones . But you must get ' em afore the Governor makes his appintments , or it 'll be gone goose with us , about it , for we could'nt sell more than half a dozen after that . From your Cousin , JACK DOWNING . LETTER XI . Argument Cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1830 . Dear Jack .  --  Here I am , about half way to Portland , with one shu of the old lumber box broke down , and tother one putty rickety . Its about half the way bare ground , and the old hoss begins to be ruther wheezy . But you know I do n't give up for trifles , when there 's a chance to make a spec . Soon as I got your letter about the bean poles , I made business fly . Mother put me up a box of beef and dough nuts , and I fed old grey , and tackled up , and all loaded and ready to start in tu hours ; and if I live I shall get the bean poles there at some rate or other fore long ; but I 'm fraid I may be late . If you know the Governor , I wish you 'd just ask him to keep his appointments back a little while ; he shant loose nothing by it if the poles sell well . I shall have to go the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if you can hire one of the government wheels and come and meet me , for the plaguy fellers here wont trust me with their wheels till I get back . Besides if I could get one of the wheels of government , I 'm thinking I could get along a good deal faster ; for I met a man jest now from Portland that said they 've got them are wheels going now like a buz . He said there was no wheels in the country that could go half so fast ; and he thinks they work a good deal better for being split up and mended so much . Grandfather said they would want as many cockades as Sheriff polls ; and so he put in his old continental one , that he had in the revolution . P. S. I hope you 'll get the government wheels to come after the poles , for I want some that are putty easy trig 'd , cause the hills are ruther slippery . Your Cusin , JACK DOWNING . LETTER XII . Argument A tug at the wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - To Cousin Ephraim Downing , stuck by the way You sent word to me in your letter t' other day , that you had got to bare ground , and broke down one shu of the lumber box , and wanted me to get the wheels of Government and come up after the poles . I tried to get ' em , but they would n't let ' em go ; and they said ' twould'nt be any use if I did ; for I could'nt get more than ten rods before the wheels would be trig 'd . They were expecting of ' em to be trig 'd every day , they said ; for the Judges had sent a monstrous great trig to the Governor , and told him if they went to start the wheels forward any , he must clap it under ; for they must'nt go forward a bit more , and must roll the wheels back a good ways , till they find the right road . Well , sure enough , on Tuesday , when they was goin along a little easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it brought ' em up with a dreadful jolt . And then , my stars , if the Sinneters did n't go at it tie and tie , like smoke . The national republicans pulled one way , and the democratic republicans ' tother , with all their might , jest as you and I used to set down and brace our feet against each other , and take hold of a stick to see which could pull tother up . They pulled and grinned all day , but nary side could n't pull up tother . The national republicans said they would n't stop for that little trig , nor no notiou of it ; and they pulled the wheels forward as hard as they could . The democratic republicans braced their feet tother way , and said the wheels should n't move another inch forward ; they had got on to a wrong road , and the Judges had put that trig there to keep ' em all from goin to destruction ; and they tried all day as hard as they could to roll the wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little tu year olds all day , but I could n't see as they started the wheels backwards or forwards a single hair . This morning they hitched on and took another jest sich a pull . The national republicans said they knew the road as well as the Judges did , and they were goin right and would n't touch to go back ; the road was a good plain smooth road , and there was'nt a mite of danger in goin on . The democratic republicans said they could hear some pretty heavy thundering along that road , and tney 'd not go another step that way ; but they stood tu they want afraid of the thunder . The national republicans said they 'd heard thunder before now , and seen dreadful black clouds all over the sky , and they 'd seen a fair afternoon and a bright rainbow after all that . So they pulled and disputed , and disputed and pulled , till most noon , and then they concluded to stop and breath upon it till to-morrow , when I spose they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin as hard as ever . I hope youl 'll make haste and get the poles along ; if you cant get any wheels up there , you better tie up a couple of bundles of ' em and swing ' em across the old horse , saddle-bag fashion . You 'll get well paid for it , if you get ' em here in season . Your cousin , JACK DOWNING . LETTER XIII . Argument Mr. Downing tells what setting up a candidate for affice means . Letter - Tuesday , March 16 , 1830. - To Uncle Joshua Downing , up in Downingville Dear Uncle Joshua  --  I guess by this time , its so long since I writ home , you almost begin to think Jack is sick or dead , or gone down to Quoddy long with uncle Nat , or somewhere else . But you need n't think any sich thing , for here I am sticking to Portland like wax , and I guess I shant pull up stakes agin this one while . The more I stay to Portland the better I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things enough here for any body to see all their life time . I guess I shall tell you something about ' em before summer 's out . These Legislaters hav n't done nothin scarcely worth telling about this most a fortnight . I 've been in most every day jest to take a squint at ' em . There was n't hardly a bit of a quarrel to be heard of from one day 's end to another . They were all as good natured and loving as a family of brothers , that had been living out all summer , and had jest got home together at thanksgiving time . They kept to work as busy as bees upon pieces of paper that they called Bills . Sometimes they voted to read ' em once , sometimes twice , and sometimes three times . At last the sun begun to shine so warm , that it made ' em think of planting time , and at it they went , passing Bills by the gross , probably a mistake for to be engrossed  --  editor , till they settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before a barnful of boys and gals . And they 've got so near the bottom of the heap , they say they shall brush out the floors in a day or two more , and start off home . I spose they wont mind it much if they do brush out some of the ears without husking ; they 've had their frolic and their husking supper , and I guess that 's the most they come for . It seems to me , uncle Joshua , it costs our farmers a great deal more to husk out their law-corn every winter than it need tu . They let tu many noisy talking fellers come to the husking . I 've always minded , when I went to a husking , that these noisy kind of chaps seems to care a good deal more about what they can get to eat and drink , than they du about the corn ; and them are that do n't make much fuss , are apt to husk the most and make the cleanest work . O dear , uncle , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it . I 'm afraid there is going to be a worse scrabble next summer to see who shall go to the great State husking than there was last . The Huntonites and Smithites are determined to have each of ' em a governor agin next year . They 've sot up their candidates on both sides ; and who in all the world should you guess they are ? The Huntonites have sot up Mr. Hunton , and the Smithites have sot up Mr. Smith . You understand what it means , I spose , to set up a candidate . It means the same that it does at a shooting match to set up a goose or a turkey to be fired at . The rule of the game is that the Smithites are to fire at Mr. Hunton , and the Huntonites are to fire at Mr. Smith . They think it will take a pretty hard battle to get them both in . But both parties say they 've got the constitution on their side , so I think likely they 'll both beat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this winter , enough to keep ' em firing all summer ; and I guess it wont be long before you see the smoke rising all over the State , wherever there 's a newspaper . I think these newspapers are dreadful smoky things ; they are enough to blind any body 's eyes any time . I mean all except the Daily Courier and Family Reader , that I send my letters in ; I never see much smoke in them . But take the rest of the papers , that talk about politics , and patriotism , and republicanism , and federalism , and Jacksonism , and Hartford Conventionism , and let any body read in one of ' em half an hour , and his eyes will be so full of smoke he ca n't see better than an owl in the sunshine ; he would't be able to tell the difference between a corn stalk and the biggest oak tree in our pasture . You know , uncle , these Legislaters have had some dreadful quarrels this winter about a book they call the constitution : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it to ' em . They made such a fuss about it I thought it must be a mighty great book , as big agin as grandfather 's great bible . But one day I see one of the Sinneters have one , and my stars , it was n't so big as my old spelling book . Thinks I to myself , if ax handles will buy one , I 'll have one and see if I cant read it myself . So I went into a store where they had a nation sight of books , and asked ' em for a constitution . They showed me some nice little ones , that they asked a quarter of a dollar a piece for . I was out of money , so I told the mon I 'd give him four good white oak ax handles , well finished , for one : and he said , being ' t was me , I might have it . So now I 've got a constitution of my own , and if I find I can read it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a great while . Your neffu , JACK DOWNING . LETTER XIV . Argument Mr. Downing informs his Uncle Joshua that he has a prospect of being nominated for Governor . Letter - To Uncle Joshua Downing up in Downingville - April 14 , 1830 . Uncle Joshua ,  --  I spose you remember that are story about the two dogs , that uncle Joe Downing used to tell ; how they got to fighting , and snapped and bit , till they eat each other up , all but jest the tip ends of their tails . Now I never could exactly see through that story , enough to know how it was done , till lately . I almost thought it was a kind of tough yarn , that had been stretched a good deal . But fact , uncle , I begin to think it 's true , every word o n't ; for there 's something going on here as much like it as two peas in a pod . The Portland Argus and the Portland Advertiser , have fell afowl of each other and gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they keep on as they 've began , I guess before summer is out , the 'll not only eat each other all up , tails and all , but I believe they are going to devour them are tu outragenous wicked parties , that plagued the legislature so all winter ; I mean the Jacksonites and the Huntonites . They 've only been at it a week or two , and they 've made quite a hole into ' em aready . The Advertiser eats the Jacksonites , and the Argus eats the Huntonites , and they are thinning of ' em off pretty fast . This will be a great comfort to the State , as it will give the two republican parties a chance to do something another winter . The Advertiser has eat up the Jacksonites in some places away down East , such as Eastport and so on , and away up t' other way in Limerick , and Waterborough , and Fryeburgh . And the Augus has caten up the Huntonites in Newfield , and Sanford , and Berwick , and Vinalhaven , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have good fair republican majorities . I spose about by the middle of next August they ' ll get ' em all killed off , so there wont be the skin of a Jacksonite or Huntonite left to be sent to the next legislature . I hope uncle Joshua , you will be more careful about meddling with politicks ; for so sure as you get hitched on the Jackson party or the Hunton party , these barking , deep-mouthed creatures will fix their teeth upon you , and you 'll be munched down before you know it . There 's one thing , uncle , that seems to wear pretty hard upon my mind , and plagues me a good deal ; I havn n't slept but little this tu three nights about it . I wish you would n't say any thing about it up there amongst our folks , for if it should all prove a fudge , they 'd be laughing at me . But I tell it to you , because I want your advice , as you 've always read the papers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , I do n't spose any one knows much more about politics by reading the papers , after all . But what I was going to tell you , is  --  now , uncle , do n't twist your tobacco chaw over to t' other corner of your mouth and leer over your spectacles , and say Jack 's a fool  --  what I was going to tell you , is this : I see by a paper printed down to Brunswick , that they talk of nominating me for Governor to run down Smith and Hunton . Think of that , uncle ; your poor neffu Jack , that last summer was hoeing about among the potatoes , and chopping wood , and making stone walls , like enough before another summer comes about , will be Governor of the State . I shall have a better chance to flog Bill Johnson then , than I should last winter , if we had n't had no Governor nor no laws ; for I spose a Governor has a right to flog any body he ' s a mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle ; I want your serious advice . If they nominate me , had I better accept ? Sometimes I ' m half afraid I should n't understand very well how to du the business ; for I never had a chance to see any governor business done , only what I see Elder Hall du in the Sinnet chamber last winter . Poor man , that makes me think what a time he had going home . I wrote to you before that he went by water , and that the vessel got trig 'd by an unconstitutional wind the first day and had to come back again . And he must have found a good many hard trigs after that , for he did n't get home til 2d day of April . Where he was , in that dreadful storm the 26th of March I have n't heard . But I should think after standing the racket he did last winter in the legislater , and then this ere storm at sea , he never need to fear any thing on land or water again in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about my being a candidate for Governor , and whether you think I could get along with the business . Considerable part of the business I should n't be a mite afraid but what I could du ; that is , the turning out and putting in . I know every crook and turn of that business ; for I do nt believe there 's a boy in our county , though I say it myself , that ' s turned out and tied up more cattle than I have . And they say a Governor has a good deal of this sort of work to du . No more at present from your loving neffu , JACK DOWNING . LETTER XV . Argument Mr. Downing 's opinion about Newspapers . Letter - March 30 , 1830 . Dear Uncle Jack  --  In my last letter to Ephraim , I said I should write to you pretty soon something about the Portland Town Meeting . As you 've been sleekman and survare a good many years , I suppose you 'd like to hear about such kind of things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other things tu , that you do n't have much time to know about away there ; and aunt Sally says I ought to ; for she says I have a great many advantages living here in Portland , that folks ca n't have up in the country , and if I should write to some of you once or twice a week , she thinks it would be time well spent . So I shall spend part of my evenings , after I get my day 's work done , in writing letters . I do n't know but I forgot to tell you that I had hired out here this summer . I get eight dollars a month and board , and have the evenings to myself . I go to school three evenings in a week , and aunt Solly says that she can begin to see that I spell better already . The printer of the Courier and the Family Reader , that sends my letters for me , is very kind ; he does'nt ask any thing for sending my letters , and he gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . So I spend one evening in the week reading newspapers , and set up pretty late that evening tu . And besides I get a chance to read awhile most every morning before the rest of the folks are up ; for these Portland folks are done of your starters in the morning . I 've known my father many a time , before the rhumatiz took the poor old gentleman , to mow down an acre of stout grass in the morning , and get done by that time one half the Portland folks leave off snoring . Sometimes I think I better be up in the country tu , mowing or hoeing potatoes , or something else , instead of reading newspapers . Its true they are bewitching kind of things , and like well enough to read ' em , but jest between you and me , they are the worst things to bother a feller 's head about that you ever see . In one of my letters you know , I said newspapers were dreadful smoky things , and any body could n't read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so full of smoke they could n't tell a pig-sty from a meeting-house . But I 'm thinking after all they are more like rum than smoke . You know rum will sometimes set quite peaceable folks together by the ears , and make them quarrel like mad dogs  --  so do the newspapers . Rum makes folks actvery silly  --  so do the newapepers . Rum makes folks see double  --  so do the newspapers . Sometimes rum gets folks so they ca n't see at all  --  so do the newspapers . Rum , if they take tu much of it , makes folks sick to the stomach  --  so do the newspapers . Rum makes folks go rather crooked , reeling from one side of the road to tother  --  and the newspapers make one half the politicians cross their path as often as any drunkard you ever see . It was the newspapers , uncle Joshua , that made you bet about the Speaker last summer , and lose your bushel of corn . Remember that , uncle , and do nt believe any thing you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Daily Courier or Family Reader ; and do nt you believe them neither if ever you see them smoke like the rest of the papers . As I was a saying about my evenings , I spend one evening a week reading that little book called the constitution , that kept our legislators quarrelling all winter . You know I bought one for four ax-handles ; I find I can read it considerable easy , most all of it without spelling , and when I get through I shall tell you something about it . A queer thought , uncle , has just popt into my head : I guess I should make a capital member of Congress  --  for this letter is just like one of the Congress speeches . It begun about the town meeting , but not a bit of a word is there in it from beginning to end about the town meeting , after you get over the text . But I find by reading the papers that when a Congress man speaks all day without touching his subject , he makes a motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . So I believe I must say good night to you now , and try it again the next leisure evening . Your loving neffu , JACK DOWNING . LETERR XVI . Argument The distinction between political parties described . Letter - June 9 , 1830 . Uncle Joshua ,  --  Did you ever see tu dogs get to quarrelling about one bone ? How they will snap and snarl about it , especially if they are hungry . Sometimes one will get it into his mouth and took it away like smoke , and t' other after him full chisel . And when he overtakes him they 'll have another scratch , and drop the bone , and then t' other one ' ll get it , and off he goes like a shot . And sometimes they both get hold together , one at one end and one at t' other , and then sich a tugging and growlin you never see . Well now , when they act so , they act just like the Portland Argus and Portland Advertiser ; two great big growlers , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see which will have it . If the Advertiser says any thing about his republikin , the Argus snaps at it , and says ' t is n't your republikin , its mine . You no business to be a republikin , you are a Federalist . And when the Argus says any thing about his republikin , the Advertiser flies up , and says , you no business to be a republikin , you 're a Jacksonite . And so they have it up hill and down , bark , bark , and tug , tug , and which ' ll get the republikin at last I cant tell . Sometimes they get so mad , seems as though they 'll tear each other all to pieces , and there 's forty thousand folks setting of ' em on and hollering stooboy . Now there was n't any need of all this quarrel , for each of ' em had a republikin last winter ; the Argus had a democratic one , and the Advertiser had a national one , and they got ' em mixed by leaving off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphy lawyer to tell ' em apart without their names , for their republikins are as much alike as tu peas in a pod . The Advertiser never should say republikin alone , but national republikin , and the Argus never should say republikin alone , but democratic republican . And then it seems as though each one might know his own bone , and knaw it without quarrelling . I thought , uncle , I 'd jest tell you a little about this ere business , because I know you always want to find out all the kinks about politiks . Your neffu , JACK DOWNING . P. S. I do nt hear any thing yet about the convention up there that you promised to make to nominate me for Governor . I think it is time it was out , for I am afraid Mr. Hunton and Mr. Smith will get the start of me , if I ai nt under way soon . J. D. LETTER XVII . Proceedings of the Great Caucus at Downingville . From the Portland Courier of July 21 , 1830 . THE LONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this paper something beyond the usual hour of publication in order to lay before our readers the important intelligence received yesterday from Downingville.  --  This we have been able to accomplish , tho ' not without extraordinary exertions and extra help . But the crisis is important , we had almost said appalling , and demands of every patriotic citizen of Maine the highest sacrifices in his power to make . The important proceedings of the grand convention at Downingville reached here , by express , yesterday about a quarter before 8 o'clock , P. M. having travelled the whole distance notwithstanding the extreme high temperature of the weather , at the rate of thirteen and a half miles an hour . And but for an unfortunate occurrence , it would undoubtedly have reached here at least three hours earlier Capt . Jehu Downing , who with his characteristic magnanimity and patriotism volunteered to bring the express the whole way , having taken a high spirited steed for the first ten miles , was unfortunately thrown to the ground in attempting to leap a barrier which lay across the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his right arm so badly fractured that it is feared amputation must be resorted to , besides several other severe contusions on various parts of the body . We are happy to hear however that Doctor Zachariah Downing , who on hearing the melancholy intelligence very promptly repaired to the spot to offer his professional services , pronounces the Captain out of danger , and also that the Captain bears his misfortune with his accustomed fortitude , expressly declaring that the only regret he feels on the occasion is the delay of the express . Here is patriotism , a devotedness to the welfare of the country , and to genuine democratic republican principles , worthy of the days of the revolution . Lieut . Timothy Downing forwarded the express the remainder of the way with the utmost despatch , having run down three horses , one of which died on the road .  --  But we keep our readers too long from the gratifying intelligence received . Great Democratic National Republican Convention . Downingville , Monday , July 19 , 1830 . At a large and respectable meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state , convened this day at the centre school house , the meeting was called to order by the venerable and silver-haired patriarch , old Mr. Zebedee Downing , who had not been out to a political meeting before for the last twenty-five years . The venerable old gentleman stated in a few feeling remarks the object of the meeting ; that he had not meddled with politics since the days of Jefferson : but that know in view of the awful calamities which threatened to involve our country in total ruin , he felt it his duty the little remaining time he might be spared from the grave , to lift up his voice and his example before his children , grand children , and great grand children whom he saw gathered around him , and encourage them to save the country for which he had fought and bled in his younger years . After the enthusiastic applause elicited by these remarks , the old gentleman called for the nomination of a chairman , and Joshua Downing , Esquire was unanimously called to the chair , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downing , voted , that a committee of five be appointed to draft resolutions to lay before this meeting . Whereupon , Jotham Downing . Ichabob Downing , Zenas Downing , Levi Downing , and Isaiah Downing , were appointed said committee , and after retiring about five minutes they returned and reported the following preamble and resolutions . Whereas an awful crisis has arrived in the political affairs of our country , our public men all having turned traitors , and resolved to ruin the country , and make us and our children all slaves forever ; and whereas our ship of state and our ship of the United States , are both driven with tremendous violence before the fury of the political tempest , and are just upon the point of being dashed upon the breakers of political destruction ; and whereas , nothing short of the most prompt and vigorous exertions of the patriotic democratic national republicans of this state and of the United States can avert the impending danger . And whereas , the Jacksonites , and Adamsites , and Huntonites , and Smithites , have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pass , that our liberties are unquestionably about to receive their doom forever : Therefore Resolved , that it is the highest and most sacred duty of every patriotic Democratic National Republican in the State , to arouse himself and buckle on his political armour , and make one last , one mighty effort to save the state and the country , and place the constitution once more upon a safe and firm foundation . Resolved , that the awful crisis of affairs in this State requires a firm devoted patriot , a high-minded and gifted statesman , and a uniform unwavering Democratic National Republican , for chief magistrate . Resolved , that in this awful crisis , we believe the eyes of all true patriots are turned upon THE HON. JACK DOWNING , late of Downingville , but since last winter a resident in Portland , the capital of the State . Resolved , that we have the fullest confidence in the talents , integrity , moral worth , tried patriotism , and unwavering and unchangeable sterling Democratic National Republicanism of the Hon. Jack Downing , and that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing else , can save the State from total , unutterable , and irretrievable ruin . Resolved therefore , that we recommed him to the electors of this State as a candidate for said office , and that we will use all fair and honourable means , and , if necessary , will not stick at some a little dis-honourable , to secure his election . Resolved , that we disapprove of personal crimination and re-crimination in political contests , and therefore will only say of our opponents , that we think them no better than they should be , and that they unquestionably mean to destroy the land we live in . Resolved , that it be recommended to all the patriotic democratic national republicans throughout the State , to be up and doing ; to call county meetings , town meetings , school district meetings , and village and bar-room meetings , and proceed to organise the party as fast as possible , by appointing standing committees , and central committees , and corresponding committees , and bearers and distributors of handbills ; and in short by doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation of the country requires . Resolved , conditionally , that in case General Jackson should be likely to be re-elected , we highly and cordially approve of his administration , and believe him to be second to none but Washington ; but in case he should stand no chance of re-election , we resolve him to be the ignorant tool of a corrupt faction , plotting to destroy the liberties of the country . Resolved , that the thanks of this convention be presented to Miss Abigail Downing , for the use of her school room this afternoon , she having with a generous patriotism dismissed her school for that purpose . Resolved , that the proceedings of this convention , signed by the chairman and secretary , be published in the Portland Daily Courier , and the Family Reeder , the official organs of the Hon. Jack Downing 's correspondence , and any other genuine Democratic National Republican papers in the State . JOSHUA DOWNING , Chairman . Attest : Ephraim Downing , Secretary . We are assured by Lieutenant Timothy Downing , with whom we had a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not a dissenting voice was heard , and all the resolutions passed unanimously . We add an extract or two from private letters . From Ephraim Downing , to the Hon. Jack Downing . " Well , Jack , if you do n't acknowledge we 've done the thing up in style , you 're no gentleman and not fit for Governor . I wish you to be very particular to keep the Sheriffs office for me.  --  Father says cousin Jeremiah has thrown out some hints that he shall have the Sheriffs office . But butter my ristbands , if you do give it to him you 'll go out of office again next year , that 's positive . Jere 's a clear factionist , you may rely upon that . No , no , stick to your old friends , and they 'll stick to you . I 'm going to start to-morrow morning on an electioneering cruise . I shall drum ' em up about right . You only keep a stiff upper lip , and you 'll come in all hollow . " From Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dear Jack , things look well here ; with proper exertions I think you may rely upon suceess . I am in great haste , and write this jest to tell you to be sure and not promise a single office to any mortal living , till I see you . These things must be managed very prudently , and you will stand in need of the counsel of your old uncle . I think I could do as much good to the state by being appointed Land Agent , as any way ; but I 'll determine upon that when I see you . N. B. Make no promises . Your affectionate uncle , JOSHUA . LETTER XVIII . Argument Particulars and Returns of the Caucus . Letter - To the Hon. Jack Downing , Portland - Monday Eve , September 13 , 1830 . Dear Jack ,  --  I have just returned , puffing and blowing , from town-meeting , and have only time to tell you that we gave you a confounded good run here . If your friends in the rest of the State have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vote in this town for governor stood as follows :  --  Table : 1Kb Capt . Jehu Downing is elected representative ; it was thought to be due to him by the party for his magnanimous exertions in carrying the express to Portland at the time you were nominated by our grand convention . In great haste , your uncle , JOSHUA DOWNING . LETTER XIX . Argument Mr. Downing 's ingenious scheme to get an office . Letter - Dec. 13 , 1830 . Dear Uncle Joshua :  --  I am tired of hard work , and I mean to have an office some how or other yet . Its true I and all our family got rather dished in the governor business ; if I 'd only got in , they should every soul of ' em had an office , down to the forty-ninth cousin . But its no use to cry for spilt milk . I 've got another plan in my head ; I find the United States offices are the things to make money in , and if I can get hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thanksgiving up there in Downingville , and throw by your work every one of you as long as you live . I want you to set me up for member of Congress up there , and get me elected as soon as you can , for if I can get on to Washington I believe I can work it so as to get an office somehow or other .  --  I want you to be particular to put me up as a Tariff man . I was agoing to take sides against the tariff so as to please Gineral Jackson and all his party , for they deal out the offices now a days , and you know they 've been mad enough with the tariff to eat it up . But the Portland Advertiser has been blowin away lately and praising up the tariff and telling what a fine thing t is , and fact , it has brought the old gineral round . His great long message to Congress has just got along here , and the old gentleman says the tariff wants a little mendin , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we must n't give it up . Your lovin neffu , JACK DOWNING . LETTER XX . Argument Cousin Nabby describes the Temperance of Downingville . Letter - Jinerwary , 20 , 1831. - To Cousin Sarah Downing , at School down to Portland I should like to know , cousin Sarah , if you have heard down there to Portland any thing about a temperance society . If you have just write and tell me what it means . You know father wants to know the meaning of every thing , and so I walked tu miles over to the school-master 's to borry Mr. Walker 's dictionary to see what it meant ; and after all I want no wiser than I was afore , for there was n't one word in it about temperance societies . Tother day father sot in the shop door , wondering if Jack would go to the Congress or not , when a proper great fat redfaced man came in , and opened a long paper with more names on it than I could read in a week ,  --  and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name to this paper . Father took hold of the paper with one hand , and run tother up under his hat , jest as he always does when he tries to think ; and , my friend , says he , I do nt know as I quite understand what this ere means . Why , says he , by putting your name down , you promise not to drink any rum yourself , nor to let any of your family . My conscience , father understood it then , I can tell you , he hopped rite out of his chair , and I guess the temperance man was gone in no time . Well , after father had time to consider a little he began to feel afraid he had n't used the man exactly right ; for , said he , may be all places ai nt like Downingville . I remember reading in the newspaper of some places where they drink rum as we do water , and get so drunk that they tumble about on the ground . And may be the man did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was trying to do good he was n't so much to blame after all . Indeed , Sam , said he , for Mr. Josslyn came in while he was talking , I 've been told there are shop keepers who retale rum by the half jill , to men who drink it at their counters , and some can actually bare that enormous quantity two and three times in a day . I never see Sam 's eyes so big , Sarah ; he look 'd as if he wanted to say , that 's a whacker , Mr. Downing ; and so thinks I , I will write to Sarah , and she ' ll tell me all about it . Your loving cousin , NABBY . P.S. I tried to tell what father said in his own words , cause you always like to hear him talk . Sam says Sarah do nt understand such things ; the libry is only fit for folks like her and the schoolmaster . A farmer ort to stick to his ox bows and goard sticks . And I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt believe you are so happy for trying to no so much ; ever since you took to study , I see you do nt laugh half so hearty as you used to , and you look sober three times as often . I ' m afraid you will be a spoilt girl for the country , Sarah ; you ' d better leave your hard words and come up here and sing at your wheel all day , churn butter and milk the cows , go to slay rides and quiltings , and be as good and happy as you used to be . I love you , Sarah , and always shall , and I believe Sam would like you as well as he duz me , if twant for your learnin . There , I wont say another word , for I 'm half cryin now . N. LETTER XXI . Argument Mr. Downing 's account of the dreadful tussle in which the Jacksonites in the legislature attempt to pour a " healing act " down the Huntonite 's throats . Letter - Feb. 4 , 1831 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this letter that I sent you yesterday , I spose you wont sleep nor eat much till you hear something more about it . So I thought I 'd try to send you a little bit of a letter to-day . O dear , uncle , there ' s terrible times here again , and I 'm half afraid it 's agoing to be worse than it was last winter . The Legislater ' s been all in the wind this two or three days , pulling and hauling and fighting like smoke . The wheels of governments are all stopt ; I can say as they are trigged , as they used to be last winter , but they are fairly stopped , because nobody do nt pull ' em along ; for when the members are all pulling each other 's caps , how can they pull the wheels of government ? They seemed to get along very well ever since they 've been here till now , and I thought they most all belonged to them are two clever parties that tried so hard to save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national republicans . But some how or other this week a quarrelsome gang of Jacksonites and Huntonites has got into the Legislater and kicked up such a bobbery , it seems as though they 'd tare the State all to pieces . My heart ' s been up in my mouth a dozen times for fear the State would go to ruin before I could get out of it ; and I 've scratched round and picked up what few bean-poles and ax-handles I had left , and got all ready to sail to Boston , for I'me determined to be off before the State goes to rack . And I advise you and all our friends at Downingville to pack up as soon as you get this letter , and be all ready as soon as you hear a cracking down this way to fly for your lives away back into New-Hampshire or Vermont . The trouble as near as I could understand it begun in this way . The Jacksonites said the Huntonites worked so hard last winter in trying to trig the wheels of government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sick , dreadful sick , and had n't got well yet ; and it was time to do something to try to cure ' em ; for their sickness was so catching that all the State would be taken down with it in a little while , if they want cured . But the Huntonites said they want sick a bit ; they never was better in their lives ; and moreover , it was false that they had tried to trig the wheels of government last winter , or tear a single leaf out of the constitution ; if any thing of that kind was done , they said the Jacksonites did it , and as for taking doctor 's stuff they 'd no notion of it . But the Jacksonites said ' t was no use , the Huntonites were all sick , and they must take some doctor stuff , and if they would n't take it willingly they must be made to take it . So they went to work and fixed a dose that they called a healing act , that they said would cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sickness of ' em . The Huntonites declared ' t was no use for ' em to fix it , they never would take it as long as they lived , that 's what they would n't ; they were as well as any body , and they 'd fight it out till next June before they 'd take it . Howsomever , the Jacksonites got their dose ready , and yesterday they carried it into the House of Representatives and told the Huntonites they must take it , and ' t would do ' em good . As soon as the Huntonites smelt of it , they turned up their noses , and said no , before they 'd take that are plaguy dirty stuff they 'd fight ' em all over the State , inch by inch . But the Jacksonites said ' t was no use , they might sniff as much as they pleased , it was the only thing that would cure ' em , and they must take it , and more than all that , they was the strongest and they should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' they were a little grain frightened , and some of them looked red as though they were mad as a March hair . And some of ' em begun to talk to the Jacksonites and tell ' em how unreasonable it was to make ' em take doctor stuff when they want sick . They were well now , and like as not if they should take it , ' t would make ' em all sick . One of ' em , that talked like a very clever man got up and coaxed ' em to ask the Judges of the great Court if they thought there was any need of their taking sich a dose , or if it would do ' em any good if they did take it . But the Jacksonites said no , they should n't ask no sich questions . They understood the business well enough , they knew the Huntonites were sick , and they knew this would cure ' em , and swallow it they should . Well , the Huntonites see how ' t was gone goose with ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their hands over their mouths and fight and kick and scrabble with all their might and keep it out of their throats as long as they could . Still they tried to talk and reason with the Jacksonites about it . They asked ' em to let them have time to examine the medicine carefully and see what it was made of , or that they would tell ' em what it was made of , or that they would tell ' em what it was made of , or why they thought it would do any good to take it . But the Jacksonites said they should n't tell ' em any thing about it , it would be casting pearls before swine , ' and the good book said they must n't do so . The men who had fixed the dose knew what they were about , they had fixed it right , and the Huntonites must open their mouths and take it , and not parley any more about it . And now the rale tussle and the hard fight begun . The House seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't but a few republicans left . And I could n't help minding that the Jacksonites took the seats of the democratic republicans , and the Huntonites took the seats of the national republicans . Well , the Jacksonites took the dose in one hand , and grab 'd the Huntonites with the other , and tipped their heads back , and were jest agoing to pour it down their throats , when the Huntonites fetched a spring and kicked it away to the fourth day of April . But the Jacksonites run after it and got it back again in about half an hour , and clinched ' em again , and got all ready to pour it down ; but jest as they got it almost to their lips , the Huntonites fetched another spring and kicked it away to the fourth of March . Away went the Jacksonites after it again , and brought it back , and clinched the Huntonites in the same manner as before , and they kicked it away again , but they did n't kick this time quite to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forenoon , but every time the Huntonites kick 'd the bitter dose away , it did n't go so far as it did the last time before . I spose they begun to grow tired and could n't kick so hard . Well , then they tried to adjourn so as to get some dinner , but the Jacksonites would n't let ' em . And they kept ' em there till four o'clock in the afternoon without any dinner , and I do nt know but they thought the Huntonites would get so hungry after a while that they would swallow it down without much fuss . But it all would n't do , the nearer it come to ' em , the tighter the Huntonites gritted their teeth together , and I guess they 'd a starved before they would take it . Well after the Jacksonites had tried nearly twenty times to pour down the bitter dose , and the Huntonites had kicked it away as many times , both parties seemed to be nearly tired out , and so they finally agreed to adjourn till nine o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once got out , would cut and run home and get clear of the plaguy stuff . But instead of that they all come in again this morning , and they 've been at it again all day , hammer and tongs , the Jacksonites trying to pour it down , and the Huntonites fighting against it , tooth and nail . How it ' ll come out I cant tell . Whether the State will be ruined if they do nt take it , I cant tell ; or whether it will cure them if they do take it , I ca n't tell . But I can assure you , dear uncle , there 's a greater fuss here , than there was when the little boy said he run and jumped over a fence and tore his trowses as if the heavens and earth were coming to pieces . If we live through it , I shall let you know something more about it . Your lovin neffu , JACK DOWNING . LETTER XXII . Argument An account of the manner in which the " healing act " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday , March 5 , 1831 . Dear Uncle Joshua ,  --  I ai nt dead , but I spose you begin to feel kind of uneasy about me , bein I have n't writ home so long . Well , I 'll tell you ' t was ; I 've had this ere cold and one thing or another , so bad , I did n't feel hardly smart enough to write . And besides I got so skeer 'd that night the Jacksonites poured their doctor stuff , what they call the healing plaster down the throates of the Huntonites , that I did n't dare to go nigh ' em again for a good while for fear they 'd pour some of their pesky stuff down my throat . But I'am sorry I did n't write afore , for I 've let it alone so long now , that my work has got desputly behindhand . When I writ to you before , the Jacksonites were holding the Huntonites by the hair of the head with one hand and trying to cram the healing plaster down their throats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrambling , and gritting their teeth together with all their might , and doubling up their fists and stamping , and declaring up hill and down , that they would never take it . And they were so obstropulous about it for a while . I did n't know as they ever would swallow it . But the Jacksonites were the stoutest , and held on to ' em like a dog to a root , and kept ' em there all the day and all the evening till about midnight , and then the poor Huntonites seemed to be a most dragged out . I tairly pitied ' em . Along in the first of it they threatened pretty stoutly , and declared by every thing that 's black and blue , if they had to take this dirty dose and should happen to be strongest next year , they 'd make the Jacksonites take a dose worth two of this . But all the threatening did n't do any good ; and then they fell to begging and coaxing , and that did n't do any good nother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they should take it that night before they slept . At last they got their hands and feet tied , and kept bringin it up a little nearer and little nearer to their mouths , and the Huntonites got so they could n't do nothing but spit . But the Jacksonites did n't mind the spitting , for you know it is n't for the doctor to stand about being spit upon a little , when he 's giving medicine . Just before the last ont , the poor Huntonites rolled their eyes dreadfully , and I believe some on ' em lost their senses a little ; one of ' em took a notion that they were going to make him swallow a whole live goose , feathers and all , and he begged of ' em , if they would n't take out the gizzard and t' other inside things , that they 'd jest pull out the pin feathers , so that it would n't scratch his throat going down . But they did n't pay no attention to him , and just before the clock struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pried their mouths open , and poured it in . The Huntonites guggled a little , but they had to swallow it . A day or two afterwards they made some of the Sinneters take it in the same way . They had a considerable tussle for it , but not quite so bad as they had in the House . Some thought this healing dose would make the Huntonites worse , and some thought it would make ' em better . I 've watch 'd ' em ever since they took it whenever I dared to go near the Legislater , and I ca n't see much alteration in ' m . But that , or something else , has kicked up a monstrous dust amongst other folks all over the world amost . I 've been looking over the newspapers a little , and I never see the world in such a terrible hubbub before in all my life . Every body seems to be running mad ; and jest ready to eat each other up . There 's Russia snapping her teeth like a great bear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean Ephraim 's bean poles , but all the folks that live in Poland ; not that are Poland up there where Mr. Dunn lives , but that great Poland over alongside of Russia . And there 's the Dutch trying to eat up Holland , and the Belgians are trying to eat up the Dutch , and ther 's five great powers ' trying to pour a healing dose down the throat of the king of the Netherlands , and there 's Mr. O'Connell trying to make the king of England and Parliament take a healing dose , and there 's Ireland jest ready to eat up Mr. O'Connell , and all the kings of Europe are trying to eat up the people , and the people are all trying to eat up the kings . And our great folks in this country too , away off there to Washington , have got into such a snarl , I guess it would puzzle a Philadelphy lawyer to get ' em out of it . There 's the President and Mr. Calhoun and Mr. Van Buren and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em , all together by the ears ; but which of ' em will eat up the rest I do n't know . I have heard a good many guess that Mr. Van Buren would eat up the whole toat of ' em ; for they say although he is a small man , there is n't another man in the country , that can eat his way through a political pudding so slick as he can . These are dreadful times , uncle ; I do n't know what ' ll become of the world , if I do nt get an office pretty soon . It seems to me there must be something out of the way to make so much confusion in the world ; and I hope the Legislater before they adjourn will pass a general healing act to cure all these difficulties . They ' ve been talking about passing a healing act to cure our State House up to Augusta , for they say its two small , and they intend to bring it down here to Portland to cure it . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they say the Kennebeckers are master fellers to hold on . They had a kind of flusteration here to-day in the Legislater . The Speaker ' s cleared out , and left ' em , because the Governor said he 'd taken his turn sitting in the Chair long enough , and he must go and sit on the Bench awhile now . And then they went to work and chose that good natured man from Monmouth for Speaker . I meant to a told you about them are two great meetings they ' ve had here to make Governors and Presidents and one thing another : but I have n't time to-day . One of ' m made Mr. Smith Governor for next year and Gineral Jackson President ; and t' other made Mr. Sprague governor , and kind of put Mr. Clay a brewing for President . If you think its best for me to run again for governor another year I wish you 'd call our friends together up there and have me nominated , for there 's nothing like starting in season in these matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argument Mr. Downing 's Poetical dream . Letter - Saturday , April 2 , 1831 . Dear Cousin Nabby ,  --  I do nt hardly know whether to send this letter to you , or uncle Joshua . You know I always send all the the politics and Legislaters to uncle ; but this ere one 's most all poetry , and they say that stuff belongs to the ladies . So I believe on the whole I shall send it to you . Do nt you be skeer 'd now because I ' ve made some poetry , for I do nt think it ' ll hurt me ; I do nt feel crazy for nothing . But I 'll just tell you how it happened . Last night I was in the Legislater and they sot out to make a law to tax old bachelors . They tried pretty hard to make it , and I thought one spell they ' d get it . I felt kind of bad about it because I knew it would bear so hard upon cousin Obediah . Well , I went home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the matter was , but I had a kind of a queer night of it ; and when I got up in the morning there was a soft sort of sickish stuff kept running off of my tongue , jest like a stream of chalk . Pray tell me what you think of it : here it is . I dreamed a dream in the midst of my slumbers , And , as fast as I dream 'd , it was coined into numbers , My thoughts ran along in such beautiful metre , I'am sure I ne'er saw any poetry sweeter . It seem 'd that a law had been recently made , That a tax on old bachelors ' pates should be laid . And in order to make them all willing to marry , The tax was as large as a man could well carry . The Bachelors grumbled , and said ' t were no use , ' T was cruel injustice and horrid abuse , And declar 'd that to save their own heart 's blood from spilling , Of such a vile tax they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scheme to pursue , So they set all the bachelors up at vendue . A crier was sent thro ' the town to and fro , To rattle his bell , and his trumpet to blow , And to bawl out at all he might meet in the way , " Ho ! forty old bachelors sold here to day , " And presently all the old maids in the town , Each one in her very best bonnet and gown , From thirty to sixty , fair , plain , red and pale , Of every description , all flocked to the sale . The auctioneer then in his labors began , And called out aloud , as he held up a man , " How much for a bachelor ? who wants to buy ? " In a twink every maiden responded  --  " I  --  I. " In short , at a hugely extravagant price , The bachelors all were sold off in a trice ; And forty old maidens , some younger , some older , Each lugged an old bachelor home on her shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Jackson 's first Cabinet puts a new kink into Mr. Downing 's head , and the result . Letter - April 26 , 1831 . Dear Uncle Joshua ,  --  I 'm in considerable of a kind of a flusteration to-day , because I 've got a new sceme in my head . New ideas , you know , are always apt to give me the agitations a little ; so you must n't wonder if my letter this time does have some rather odd things in it . I do n't know when I 've had such a great scheme in my head afore . But you know I was always determined to make something in the world , and if my friends ' ll only jest stick by me , I shall make common folks stare yet . Some thought it was a pretty bold push my trying to get in to be governor last year ; and some have laughed at me , and said I come out at the little end of the horn about it , and that I 'd better staid up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an office and not get any more votes than I did . But they ca n't see through a millstone so fur as I can . Altho ' I did n't get in to be governor , its made me known in the world , and made considerable of a great man of me , so that I shall stand a much better chance to get an office if I try again . But I must make haste and tell you what I am at , for I am in a great hurry . I guess you 'll stare when I tell you the next letter you 'll get from me will be dated at Washington , or else somewhere on the road between here and there . O , uncle , we have had some great news here from Washington ; every body 's up in arms about it , and ca n't hardly tell what to think of it . They say the President 's four great Secretaries have all resigned ; only think of that , uncle . And they say their salaries were six thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six thousand dollars a year . Why , a governor 's salary is a fool to it . On the whole , I 'm glad I did n't get the governor 's office . I shall start for Washington to-morrow morning ; or I do n't know but I shall start to-night , if I can get ready , and travel all night . Its best to be in season in such things , and I shall have to go rather slow , for I 've got pretty considerable short of money , and expect I shall have to foot it part way . I shall get there in about a fortnight , and I 'm in hopes to be in season to get one of them are offices . I think it 's the duty of all true republicans that have the good of the country at heart , to take hold and help the President along in these trying difficulties .  --  For my part , I am perfectly willing to take one of the offices , and I hope some other good men will come right forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that them are Secretaries should all clear out , and leave the poor old General to do all the work alone . Why , uncle , they 'd no more patriotism than your old hoss . But I must n't stop to parley about it now ; what I want to say is , I wish you to write a recommendation to the President for me to have one of his offices , and go round as quick as you can and get all our friends at Downingville to sign it , and send it on to Washington as fast as possible ; for it would be no more than right that I should show the President some kind of recommendation before he gives me the office . I want you to tell the President that I 've always been one of his strongest friends ; and you know I always have spoke well of him , and in fact he is the best President we ever had . It might be well for you to quote this last sentence as an extract from a letter of the Hon. Jack Downing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friendship , and the Hon. ' would convince him that I am a man of some standing in the State . Now you keep up a good heart , uncle ; you have always had to delve hard all your days up there on the old farm , and you 've done considerable to boost me up into an office , and if I get hold of these six thousand dollars a year , you shall have a slice out of it that will make your old heels felt light again . I have n't named it to a single soul here except cousin Sally , and I want it to be kept a profound secret till I get the office , so as to make them are chaps that have been a sneering at me here , stare like an owl in a thunder shower . And , besides , if it should leak out that I was going , I 'm afraid somebody else might get the start of me , for there are always enough that have their mouth open when it rains such rich porrage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll blab it out before I get half way there . And you need n't think strange , if you see some of the Boston or New York papers in a few days saying , The Hon. Jack Downing passed through this city yesterday , on his way to Washington . It is rumoured , that he is to be called upon to fill one of the vacant offices . '  --  But I must stop , for it is time I was picking up my duds for a start . Sally has been darning my stockings all the morning . Love to Aunt and Cousin Nabby , and all of ' em . Good by . Your loving neffu , JACK DOWNING . LETTER XXV . Argument Mr. Downing on his way to assist Jackson , at Washington , stops at Boston  --  his conversation with the Boston Editors . Letter - May 4 , 1831 . Dear Uncle Joshua ,  --  I have got so fur at last , and a pretty hard run I 've had of it to get here , I can tell ye . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes I think there ai nt much profit in it after all , any more than there is in buying lottery tickets , where you pay a dollar and sometimes get four shillings back , and sometimes nothing . Howsomever I do nt mean to be discouraged yet , for if I should give out now and go back again , them are sassy chaps in Portland would laff at me worse than they did afore .  --  What makes me feel kind of down hearted about it , is because I 've seen in the newspapers that tu of them are good offices at Washington are gone aready . One Mr. Livingston ' s got one of ' em , and Mr. Woodbury that lives up in New Hampshire ' s got tother , and I 'm considerable afraid the others will be gone before I get there . I want you to be sure and get my recommendation into the post office as soon as you can , so it may get there as soon as I do . It 's a week to-day since I started from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hopes to get there in about a week more . Any how , I shall worry along as fast as I can . I have to foot it more than three-quarters of the way , because the stage folks ask so much to ride , and my money 's pretty near gone . But if I can only jest get there before the offices are gone I think I shall get one of ' em , for I got a good string of recommendations in Boston as I come along . I never thought of getting any recommendations of strangers , till a man I was travelling with , kind of talked round and round , and found out what I was after . And then says he , if you want to make out , you must get the newspaper folks to give you a lift , for they manage these matters . And he told me I better get some of the Boston Editors to recommend me , or it would be no use for me to go . I thought the man was more than half right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the editors .  --  They all seemed very glad to see me , when I told ' em who I was ; and I never see a better set of true republicans any where in the State of Maine . And when I told ' em that I was always a true republican , and my father and grand father were republicans before me , they all talked so cleaver about patriotism , and our republican institutions , and the good of the people , that I could n't help thinking it was a plaguy shame there should be any such wicked parties as Federalists , or Huntonites , or Jacksonites , to try to tare the country to pieces and plague the republicans so . This do nt include President Jackson . He is n't a Jacksonite , you know ; he ' s a true republican as there is in Downingville . I had a talk with the Boston Patriot man first . He said he would give me a recommendation with a good deal of pleasure ; and when I got my office at Washington I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and if all true republicans were only faithful to the country , Henry Clay , the republican candidate , will come in all hollow . He 'll be next President , says he , jest as sure as your name is Jack Downing . Then I went to see the editor of the Boston Gazette . He said he certainly should be very happy to give me a recommendation ; and he trusted when I got to Washington where I should have considerable influence , I should look well to the interests of the republican party . He said there was an immense sight of intrigue and underhand work going on by the enemies of the country to ruin Mr. Calhoun , the republican candidate for President . But he said they would'nt make out ; Mr. Calhoun had found out their tricks , and the republicans of old Virginny and South Carolina were all up in arms about it , and if we republicans of the northern states would only take hold and fight for the good cause , Mr. Calhoun would be elected as true as the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the editor of the Boston Statesman . He seemed to be a little shy of me at first , and was afraid I want a true republican ; and wanted to know if I did n't run against Governor Smith last year down there in Maine . I told him I had seen Governor Smith a number of times in Portland , but I was sure I never run against him in my life , and did n't think I ever came within a rod of him . Well he wanted to know if I was n't a candidate for Governor in opposition to Mr. Smith . I told him no , I was a candidate on the same side . Was n't you , said he , looking mighty sharp at me , was ' nt you one of the federal candidates for governor ? My stars , uncle Joshua , I never felt my hair curl quicker than it did then . My hand kind of draw 'd back and my fingers clinched as if I was jest agoing to up fist and knock him down To think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too much for flesh and blood to bear . But I cooled down as quick as I could , for fear it might hurt me about getting my office . I told him I never was a federal candidate , and there never was a drop of federal blood in me ; and I would run from a federalist if I should meet one as quick as I would from poison . That 's right , says he , I like that , that 's good stuff , and he catched hold of my hand and give it such a shake , I did n't know but he 'd a pull 'd it off . He said he would give me the best recommendation he could write , and when I got to Washington I must stick to the old Gineral like the tooth ach , for the federalists were intriguing dreadfully to root him out of his office and upset the republican party . If the republicans could only be kept together , he said President Jackson , the republican candidate , could be elected as easy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered ourselves to be divided it would be gone goose with us , and the country would be ruined . So you must stick to the re-election of Gineral Jackson , said he , at all events ; and then he kind of whispered in my ear , and says he , in case any thing should happen , if Gineral Jackson should be sick or any thing , you must remember that Mr. Van Buren is the republican candidate . I told him he never need to fear me ; I should stick to the republican party thro ' thick and thin . So I took my recommendation and trudged along . I hav n't time to-day to tell you how I got along with the rest of the editors , and a thousand other things that I met with along by the way , and all the fine things in this great city , and so on . But I shall write to you again soon . Your loving neffu , JACK DOWNING . - To Uncle Joshua Downing , Downingville , State of Maine LETTER XXVI . Argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he arrived there . Letter - May 30 , 1831. - Dear Uncle Josh ,  --  I 've got here at last , to this great city where they make offices , and I 'm determined not to leave it till I get one . It is n ' t sich a great city after all as New York , though they do a great deal more business here than they do at New York . I do nt mean vessel business and trade , for there 's no end to that in New York , but in making offices and sich like ; and they say its the most profitable business in the country . If a man can get hold of a pretty good office , he can get rich enough by it in three or four years , and not have to work very hard neither . I tell you what , uncle , if I make out to my mind here , I shall come back again one of these days in a rather guess way than what I come on . I do nt have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess poor cousin Sally wont have to set up all night to mend my coat and darn my stockings . You ' ll see me coming dressed up like a lawyer , with a fine carriage and three or four hosses . And then them are chaps in Portland that used to laugh at me so about being Governor , may sneeze at me if they dare to , and if they do nt keep out of my way I 'll ride right over ' em . I had a pretty tuff time coming on here . Its a long tiresome road through the Jarseys . I had to stop twice to get my shoes tapt , and once to get an old lady to sow up a rip in my coat while I chopped wood for her at the door to pay for it . But I shant mind all the hard work I 've had of it , if I can make out to come home rich . I got a pretty good boost in Boston , as I writ you in my last , by the editors giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly to what I got in New York , for they gave me a public dinner there . I cant think what 's the matter that it has n't been published yet . Major Noah promised me he 'd have it all put into the New York Courier and Enquirer the very next day after I left New York , so that it should get to Washington as soon as I did ; and now I 've been here about a week and it has n't come yet . If it does'nt come soon , I shall write an account of the dinner myself , and send it home and get it put in the Portland Courier . It was a most capital dinner , uncle ; I do nt know as I ever eat heartier in my life , for being pretty short of money I had pinched rather close a day or two , and to tell the truth I was as hungry as a bear . We had toasts and speeches and a great many good things . I do nt mean sich toast as they put butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do nt exactly drink ' em neither ; but they drink the punch and speak the toasts . I cant think Major Noah meant to deceive me about publishing the proceedings of the dinner , for he appeared to be a very clever man , though he was the funniest chap that ever I see . There was n't a man in New York that befriended me more than he did ; and he talked to me very candidly , and advised me all about how to get an office . In the first place , says he , Mr. Downing , you cant get any kind of an office at Washington , unless you are a true blue ginuin democratic republican . I told him I had recommendations coming to prove that I was all that . They are very strict , says he , in regard to that at Washington . If James Madison should apply for an office at Washington , says he , he could n't get it . What , says I , him that was President ! for it kind of startled me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get an office . It 's true , says he , if James Madison should apply for an office he could n't get it .  --  Why not , says I ? Because , says he , he has turned federalist . It 's melancholy to think , says he , how many good old republicans at the south are turning federalists lately . He said he was afraid there was n't more than one true ginuin old democratic republican left in Virginny , and that was old Mr. Ritchie of the Richmond Enquirer ; and even he seemed to be a little wavering since Mr. Calhoun and some others had gone over . Well there 's Mr. Clay , says I , of Kentucky , I do nt think he 'll ever flinch from the republican cause . Henry Clay , says he , turning up his nose , why he ' s been a federalist this six years .

I told him I never had sich a thought in my life ; I always belonged to the republican party , and always ment to . He looked rather good natured again when he heard that ; and says he , do you know what the true republican doctrine is ? I told him I had always had some kind of an idea of it , but I did n't know as I could explain it exactly . Well , says he , I 'll tell you ; it is to support General Jackson for re-election , through thick and thin . That is the only thing that will save the country from ruin . And if General Jackson should be unwell or any thing jest before election , so he could not be a candidate , the true republican doctrine is to support Mr. Van Buren . I told him , very well , he might depend upon my sticking to the republican party , all weathers . Upon that he set down and wrote me a recommendation to the President for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what a master substantial ginuin republican he made me . I had a number more capital recommendations at New York , but I hav n't time to tell you about them in this letter . Some were to Mr. Clay , and some to Mr. Van Buren , and some to Mr. Calhoun . I took ' em all , for I thought it was kind of uncertain whose hands I might fall into hereafter , and it might be well enough to have two or three strings to my bow . I hav n't called on the President yet , though I 've been here about a week . My clothes had got so shabby , I thought I better hire out a few days and get slicked up a little . Three of the offices that I come after are gone slick enough , and the other one 's been given away to a Mr. White , but he would n't take it ; so I ' m in hopes I shall be able to get it . And if I do nt get that , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , for they had a great Jackson meeting here ' tother day , and they kicked Mr. Calhoun right out doors , and said they would n't have him for Vice President no longer . Now some say they think I shall get it , and some think Mr. Van Buren ' ll get it . Howsomever , I feel pretty safe , for Maj. Noah told me if I could n't get any thing else , the President could easily make a foreign mission for me . I shall call on the good old Gineral in two or three days and find out what my luck is , and then I shall let you know . Give my love to ant and cousin Nabby , and all of ' em .

They carry on so like the old smoker , I do nt hardly know what to make of it . If I had n't said I would n't leave Washington till I got an office , I do nt know but I should come back to Downingville and go to planting potatoes . Them are Huntonites and Jacksonites down there in Maine last winter were pretty clever sort of folks to what these chaps are here . Cause down there if they get ever so mad , they did n't do nothing but talk and jaw one another ; but here if any body does n't do to suit ' m , fact they ' ll up and shoot him in a minute . I did n't think getting an office was such dangerous kind of business , or I do nt know as I should have tried it . Howsomever , it 's neck or nothing with me now , and I must do something to try to get some money here , for I about as lieves die as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State of Maine . And as the folks have to go armed here , I want you to put my old fowling piece into the stage and send it on here as quick as possible . I hope you 'll be as quick as you can about it , for if I get an office I shant dare to take it till I get my gun . They come pretty near naving a shooting scrape here yesterday . The Telegraph paper said something about Mr. Eaton 's wife . It was nothing that I should think they need to make such a fuss about ; it only said that some of the ladies here refused to visit her . But some how or other it made Mr. Eaton as mad as a March hair . He declared he 'd fight somebody , he did n't care who . The first man he happened to come at was Mr. Ingham . So he dared Mr. Ingham out to fight . Not to box , as they do sometimes up in Downingville , but to stand and shoot at each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he was crazy . That made Mr. Eaton ten times more mad than he was before ; and he declared he 'd flog him any how , whether he was willing or not . So he got a gang of gentlemen yesterday to go with him to the Treasury office where Mr. Ingham does his writing , and waited there and in a grog shop close by as much as two hours for a chance to catch him and give it to him . Mr. Ingham was out a visiting in the city , and when he got home his folks told him what was going on , and begged him not to go to the office for he would certainly be killed . Poh , says he , do you think I 'm afraid of them are blustering chaps ? There 's more smoke than fire there , I can tell ye ; give me my pistols , it is time for me to go to the office . Some of the ladies cried , and some almost fainted away . But he pacified ' em as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and three or four men went with him , and I guess they carried something under their arms that would make daylight shine through a feller pretty quick . And I guess the gang of gentlemen waiting for him begun to smell a rat , for they cleared out pretty soon and never touched him . But their courage came again in the evening , and this same gang of gentlemen turned out to Mr. Ingham 's house , and threatened to burst the doors open and drag him out by the hair of the head and skin him alive . I thought this was carrying the joke rather too far , so I tho't I 'd put in my oar ; for when I see any body run too hard I cant help taking their part . So I stepped on to Mr. Ingham 's front door steps , and threw my hat down , and rolled up my sleeves , and spit on my hands ; and by that time the chaps began to href= " http : **52;1867;TOOLONG ? i d=eaf378 &image=378-083.jpg"; name=f378-083Page image - Page 068. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , Major Eaton , this is quite too bad . A man 's house is his castle . Here 's Mr. Ingham in his house as peaceable as a lamb ; he is n't a meddling with nobody , and you need n't think to drag him out here to-night , I can tell ye . If you really want to take a bit of a box , just throw away your powder and ball , and here 's the boy for you . I 'll take a fist or two with you and glad of the chance . You impudent scoundrel , says he , who are you ? what business is it to you what I done ? Clear out , or I 'll send you where you ought to be long ago . Well , then , you 'll send me into some good office , says I , for there 's where I ought to have been more than two years ago .

My stars , when they heard that , they dropt their heads as quick as though they had been cut off , for they did n't know who I was before . Major Eaton and the whole gang of gentlemen with him turned right about and marched away as still a pack of whipped puppies . They were afraid I should have ' em all up before the President to-day , and have ' em turned out of office ; for it 's got whispered round the city that the President sets a great deal by me , and that I have a good deal of influence with him . This morning Mr. Ingham started for Philadelphy . Before he left , he thanked me a thousand times for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a letter to the President , telling him all about the scrape . I went a piece with him to see him safe out of the city on the great road towards Baltimore . About my prospects for an office , I cant tell you yet how I shall come out . I 've been in to see the President a number of times , and he talks very favorable . I have some chance to get in to be Secretary of War , if old Judge White do nt take it ; and if I do nt get that the President says he ' ll do the best he can for me . I never had to be so strict a republican before in my life as I 've had to be since I 've been here in order to get the right side of the President . I 'll tell you something about it in my next , and about my visits to the President , and a good many other famous things here . P. S.

Letter - the 20th day of Oct. 1831. - Dear Uncle Josh ,  --  I 've got it at last as true as you 're alive , and now I do nt keer a snap for the fattest of ' em . I 'll teach them are young chaps down to Portland that used to poke fun at me so because I did n't get in to be Governor , that they must carry a better tongue in their heads , or they ' ll find out who they are talking to . I guess they ' ll find out by and by it wont be healthy for ' em to poke fun at an officer of my rank . And as for Jemime Parsons that married the school master winter before last , when she had promised as fair as could be that she would have me , she may go to grass for what I keer ; I would n't have her now no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess when she comes to see me with my regimentals on she ' ll feel sorry enough and wish her cake was dough again . Now she 's tied down to that clodpole of a school master , that was n't fit for a schoolmaster neither , for he has had to go to hoeing potatoes for a living , and much as ever he can get potatoes-enough to keep ' em from starving , when if she had only done as she had promised , she might now be the wife of Captain Jack Downing of the United States Army . But let her go ; as I said afore , I do nt care a snap for her or all old White 's cattle . I 'll tell you what ' t is uncle , I feel about right now . It seems to me I could foot it home in two days , for my feet never felt half so light before . There 's nothing like trying , in this world , uncle ; any body that tries can be something or other , if he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , you know , I expected to get one of the great Secretaries ' offices ; but the good old President told me they had got him into such a hobble about them are offices that he could n't give me one of ' em if he was to die . But he treated me like a gentleman , and I shall always vote for him as long as I live , and I told him so . And when he found out that I was a true ginuin republican , says he , Mr. Downing , you must be patient , and I 'll bear you in mind , and do something for you the very first chance . And you may depend upon it Mr. Downing , he added with a good deal of earnestness , I never desert my friends , let that lying Stephen Simpson of Philadelphy say what he will about it , a good for nothing ungrateful dog . And he fetched a stomp with his foot and his eyes kind of flashed so fiery , that I could n't help starting back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock me over . But he look 'd pleasant again in a minute , and took me my the hand , and now , says he , Mr. Downing , I give you my honour that I 'll do something for you as soon as I possibly can . I told him I hoped he would be as spry as he could about it , for I had but jest nine-pence left , and I did n't know how I should get along very well , in a strange place too . But he told me never to mind that at all ; I might come and eat my meals at his house whenever I 'd a mind to , or he would be bondsman for my board where I put up . So I 've worked along from that time to this , nearly for months , as well as I could , sometimes getting a little job of garden-work , and sometimes getting a little wood to saw , and so on , nearly enough to pay my expenses . I used to call and see the President once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be patient and keep up a good heart , the world was n't made in one day , and something would turn up for me by and by . But fact , after digging , and sawing , and waiting four months , my patience got most wore out , and I was jest upon the point of giving up the chase , and starting off for Downingville with the intention of retiring to private life ; when last night , about seven o'clock , as I sot eating a bowl of bread and milk for my supper , a boy knocked at the door and wanted to see Mr. Downing . So they brought him into the room where I was , and says he , Mr. Downing , the President wants to see you for something very particular , right away this evening . My heart almost jump 'd right up in my mouth . My spoon dropt out of my hand , and to eat another mouthful I could n't if I was to starve . I flew round , and washed my face and hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could , and should have looked tolerable spruce if it had n't been for an unlucky hole in the knee of my trowsers . What to do I did not know . It made me feel bad enough I can tell you . The woman where I boarded said she would mend them for me if I would take them off , but it would take her till about nine o'clock , and the President was waiting for me , and there ' t was . Such a hobble I never was in before . But this woman is a kind good creature as ever was ; she boards me for four and sixpence a week , considering that I split wood for her , and bring water , and do all sich kind of chores . And she always had some contrivance to get out of every difficulty ; and so she handed me a neat little pocket handkerchief and told me to tie that round my knee . Being thus rigged out at last , I started off as fast as I could go for the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old gentleman was setting by a table with his spectacles on , and two great lamps burning before him , and a bundle of letters and papers in his hand . He started up and took me by the hand , and says he , good evening Mr. Downing , I 'm very glad to see you ; you are the very man I want now , above all others in the world . But how is this , said he ? looking at my knee . Not lame , I hope ? That would be a most unfortunate thing in this critical moment . It would knock my plan in the head at once . I felt kind of blue , and I guess I blushed a little ; but I turned it off as well as I could ; I told him I was n't lame at all , it was nothing but a slight scratch , and by to-morrow morning I should be as well as ever I was in my life . Well then says he , Mr. Downing , set down here and see what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself back in his chair and pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and held up the letter in his hand , and says he , Mr. Downing , here is a letter from Governor Smith of Maine , and now Sir , I 've got something for you to do . You see now that I was sincere when I told you if you would be patient and stick to the republican text , I would look out for you one of these days . I 'm always true to my friends ; that lying Stephen Simpson might have had an office before now if he had behaved himself . Well , dear sir , said I , for I felt in such a pucker to know what I was going to get that I could n't stand it any longer , so says I , what sort of business is it you ' ve got for me to do ? Says he , Mr. Downing , I take it you are a man of courage ; I have always thought so ever since you faced Mr. Eaton so boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sorry your courage was not displayed in a better cause , for that Ingham is a rascal after all . I told him as for courage I believed I had some of the stuff about me when there was any occasion for it , and that I never would stand by and see any body abused . Well , says he , we must come to the point , for the business requires haste . Governor Smith writes me that there are four of your fellow citizens of Maine in a British jail at Frederiction , who have been taken from their farms by British constables and sheriffs and other officers and carried off by force to prison . By this time my very hair begun to curl , I felt so mad , and I could n't help jumping up and smiting my fists together , and saying pretty hard things about the British Well , says the President , I like your spunk Mr. Downing ; you 're jest the man I want in this business . I 'm going to give you a captain 's commission in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there and set that business right at Madawaska . You must go to Maine and raise a company of volunteers as quick as possible , tell ' em I ' ll see ' em paid , and you must march down to Fredericton and demand the prisoners , and if they are not given up you must force the jail , and if the British make any resistance you must fire upon them and bring the prisoners off at some rate or other . Then write me and let me know how affairs stand , and I ' ll give you further orders . At any rate you must see that the rights of Maine are well protected , for that state has come round so in my favor since last year I 'm determined to do every thing I can for them ; I tell you Mr. Downing , I never desert my friends . So after he gave me the rest of my orders , and my commission , and a pocket full of money , and told me to be brave and if I wanted any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I went home . But I could n't sleep a wink all night . I was up before day light this morning , and I ' ve got two women to work for me to day fixing up my clothes , and I shall be ready to start to morrow morning . I want you to keep this matter pretty still till I get there , except that you may let cousin Ephraim know it and get him to volunteer some of the Downingville boys for my company . I want to get them pretty much all there if I can , for I know what sort of stuff the Downingville boys are made of , and shall know what I ' ve got to depend upon . In haste , your loving neffu , CAPT . JACK DOWNING . LETTER XXIX . Argument First military report of Capt . Downing to the president . Letter - Nov. 8 , 1831. - To the Editor of the Portland Courier My dear old Friend , you .  --  I got home to Downingville last night after an absence of nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come on from Washington , but some how or other , I got into the wrong stage somewhere in New Hampshire , and come the upper road before I knew it . So the first thing I knew , when I thought I had got almost to Portland , I found myself plump in Downingville . But the dear folks were all so glad to see me , I did n't feel much sorry . Cousin Nabby hopped right up and down , like a mouse treed in a flour barrel ; and Ephraim snapped his thumb and finger , and spit on his hands as though he had a cord of wood to chop ; and poor ant Keziah set down and cried as much as two hours steady . Uncle Joshua catched down his pipe , and made the smoke roll out well ; I never saw him smoke so fast before in my life ; he finished two pipes full of tobacco in less than five minutes . I felt almost like a fool myself , and had to keep winking and swallowing , or I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you know it would n't do for a captain to cry , especially when he was going to enlisting soldiers . Well , I must hurry along with my letter , for I have n't got much time to write to-day . I have been round among the folks in Downingville this forenoon to see how they felt about the Madawaska business , and whether any of ' em would go a sogering down there with me . I find some of ' em are right up about it , and ready to shoulder their guns and march to-morrow if I say the word , and others are a little offish . I guess I shall get about half enough for a company here pretty easy , and if I find it hard dragging to pick up the rest , I shall come right down to Portland to fill up my company there . For uncle Joshua tells me he has had some letters from Portland within a few days , and he says there are a number of chaps down there as warm as mustard about going to war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good chance to list , and some of ' em he thinks will make capital sargents and corporals . I should be glad if you would send me word whether you think I could pick up some good lusty fellows there in case I should want ' em . I pay a month 's wages cash down . But there is one subject that I feel rather uneasy about , and that is the greatest reason of my writing you to-day , to see if you can tell me any thing about it . Last night uncle Joshua and I sot up talking politicks pretty late , after all the rest of the folks had gone to bed . I told him all about one thing or another at Washington , and then we talked about the affairs of this State . I found uncle Joshua did't stand jest where he used to . You know once he was a little mite in favor of Mr. Hunton ; and then , when I was up for Governor , he was altogether in favour of me ; and then he was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now , when I come to talk with him , I found he was all plump over on the democratic republican side . You know I 've been leaning that way tu , ever since I got in to be good friends long with President Jackson . So says I , Well , uncle , our party is strong enough now to carry all afore ' em in this State . I guess governor Smith will have more than three quarters of the votes next time . At which uncle turned round towards me , and rolled up his great eyes over his spectacles , and took his pipe out of his mouth and put on a mighty knowing look , and says he , Jack , jest between you and me , a much better man and a much greater republican than Gov . Smith , will be Governor of the State of Maine after another election . I was kind of struck with a dunderment . I sot and looked at him as much as two minutes , and he all the time looked as knowing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you mean ? Did n't all the democratic republican papers in the State , when Gov . Smith was elected , say he was the very best republican there was in the State for Governor . Well , well , Jack , said he , mark my words , that 's all . But , said I , uncle , what makes you think so ? O , said he , I have read the Argus and the Bangor Republican , and I have had a letter from a man that knows all about it , and when the time comes you ' ll see . And that was all I could get out of him . Now I wish you would let me know what this mystery means . And I remain your old friend , CAPT . JACK DOWNING . LETTER XXX . Argument The first military report of Capt . Downing to the President . Letter - Nov. 15 , 1831. - To his Excellency , Gineral Jackson , President of the United States , &c; My good old Sir .  --  The prisoners are out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the British a most terrible battle , if they had n't let ' em out . I guess I should made ' em think old Bonapart had got back among ' em again , for a keener set o fellows than my company is made up of never shouldered a musket or trod shoe-leather . I was pesky sorry they let'em out quite as soon , for I really longed to have a brush with ' em ; and how they come to let ' em go I do nt know , unless it was because they heard I was coming . And I expect that was the case , for the prisoners told me the British Misnister at Washington , sent on some kind of word to Governor Campbell , and I suppose he told him how I had got a commission , and was coming down upon New Brunswick like a hurrycane . If I could only got down there a little sooner and fite sich a great battle as you did at New Orleans , my fortune would have been made for this world . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , one of these days . And that 's as high as ever I should want to get . I got home to Downingville in little more than a week after I left you at Washington , for having a pretty good pocket full of money , and knowing that my business was very important , I rid in the stage most all the way . I spose I need n't stop to tell you how tickled all my folks were to see me . I did n't know for awhile but they 'd eat me up . But I spose that 's neither here nor there in making military reports , so I 'll go on . I found no difficulty in getting volunteers . I believe I could have got nearly half the State of Maine to march if I had wanted ' em . But as I only had orders to list one good stout company , I took ' em all in Downingville , for I rather trust myself with one hundred ginuin Downingville boys , than five hundred of your common run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangor . The editor of the Bangor Republican was so zealous to go , and said he 'd fight so to the last drop of his blood , that I could n't help taking him , so I appointed him supernumerary corporal . Poor fellow , he was so disappointed when he found the prisoners were out that he fairly cried for vexation . He 's for having me go right on now and give all New Bruaswick a real thrashing . But I know what belongs to gineralship better than that ; I have n't had my orders yet . Well , after we left Bangor we had a dreadful rough and tumble sort of a journey , over rocks and mountains and rivers and swamps and bogs and meadows , and through long pieces of woods that I did n't know as we should find the way out . But we got through at last , and arrived here at Madawaska day before yesterday . I thought I better come this way and make a little stop at Madawaska to see if the prisoners ' wives and little ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fredericton and blow the British ski high . When our company first came out in sight in Madawaska , they thought it was the British coming to catch some more of ' em ; and such a scattering and scampering I guess you never see . The men flew into the woods like a flock of sheep with forty dogs after ' em , and the women catched their babies up in their arms and run from one house to another screeching and screaming enough to make the woods ring again . But when they found out we were United States troops come to help ' em , you never see any body so glad .  --  They all cried for joy then . The women run into the woods and called to their husbands to come back again , for there was nobody there that would hurt them , and back they came and treated us with the best they had in their houses . And while we sot chatting , before the women hardly got their tears wiped up , one of ' em looked up towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned pale a little , thinking it might be their ghost , but in a minute in they come , as good flesh and blood as any of us , and then the women had another good crying spell . I asked one of the prisoners how they got away , for I thought you would want to know all about it ; and says he we come away on our legs . Did you break out of jail , said I ? I guess there was no need of that , said he , for we want locked in half the time . Did you knock down the guard , said I , and fight your way out ?  --  Humph ! said he , I guess we might have hunted one while before we could find a guard to knock down . Nobody seemed to take any care of us , if we wanted a drop of grog we had to go out and buy it ourselves .  --  Well but , said I , it you were left in such a loose state as that , why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shrugging up his shoulders , I guess we knew what we were about ; the longer we staid there the more land the state of Maine would give us to pay us for being put in jail , but when they turned us out of jail , and would n't keep us any longer , we thought we might as well come home . And now , my good old sir , since matters are as they are , I shall take up my head quarters here at Madawaska for the present , and wait for further orders . I shall take good care of the people here , and keep every thing in good order , and not allow a single New Brunswicker to come any where within gun-shot . As for that Leftenant Governor , Mr. Archibald Campbell , he better keep himself scarce ; if he shows his head here again , I shall jest put him into a meal bag and send him to Washington . I shall expect to hear from you soon , and as I shall have to be here sometime , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more money .

Argument The Captain 's second visit to the Maine Legislature . Letter - Jan. 4 , 1832. - To the Editor of the Portland Courier My dear old Friend ,  --  Here I am right among the Legislater folks , jest as I used to be down there to Portland . I got here last night after a pretty hard journey from Madawaska , rather lame , and my feet and ears froze pretty bad . I hope I shant lose any of ' m , for if I should lose my feet I should n't stand much of a fag with the British down there to Fredericton in case we should have a brush with ' em . And all my hopes about ever being President of the United States depends on the woful whipping I 'm going to give the British . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should lose my ears , for a President without ears would cut rather a sorry figure there to Washington . I sent on to the old President to see if he would let me have a furlough to come up to Augusta , while the Legislaters were here , for I thought I could n't stan it without being here to see how they get along . The President said he did n't think there would be any fighting down to Madawaska before the spring opens , so he did n't care if I went . I jest hobbled into the Legislater to-day to see ' em chuse officers ; but I have n't any time to tell you what a great fine house they ' ve got into . I believe it ' s vastly better than the one they had to Portland though . And I guess there ' ll be no stopping the wheels of government this year , for I believe they have got the house fixed so as to carry the wheels by steam . They got the steam up before I went in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the wheels might go like a buzz . They told me there was a good many new members , and a good many more of ' em , than there was last year ; so I did n't know as I should see hardly any body that I knew . But I never was more agreeably disappointed in my life than I was by the first voice I heard calling the members to order . I knew it as quick as I could tell the fife and drum of my own company at Madawaska . And if I should hear the fife and drum this very minute it would n't give a pleasanter thrill to my feelings . I look 'd round and sure enough there was the sandy honest look , and the large fleshy figure , of my old friend Mr. Knowlton of Montville , holding a broad brimmed hat in his hand , and calling upon the great jam of folks to come to order . I could n't hardly help crowding right in among ' em to shake hands with him , I was so glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobby member I tho't it would n't do . But I ' ll tell you what ' it is , you may depend upon the business going off glibb here this winter ; for having a building go by steam and Mr. Knowlton here to drive it , it ai nt all the Jacksonites and Huntonites in the state that can stop it . And besides I cant find out as yet that there is any more than one party here ; it there should be hereafter , I ' ll let you know . I was glad they chose Mr. White to be speaker , for he 's always so good natured and uses every body so well , I cant help liking him . I have n't been in the Sinnet yet , but they say Mr. Dunlap is President . I was in hopes to see Elder Hall here this winter , but I believe he has n't come . Your old Friend , CAPT .

Letter - Jan. 19 , 1832. - To the Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I could n't write to you once in a while , I do n't know but I should die . When any thing has kept me from writing two or three weeks , I get in such a taking it seems as though I should split , and the only way I can get relief is to take my pen and go at it . The reason why you have n't heard from me this fortnight past , is this dreadful furenza . We 've all got it here , and it 's nothing but cough , cough , the whole time . If a member gets up to speak , they all cough at him . If he says any thing that they like , they cough at it ; and if he says any thing that they do nt like , they cough at it So let him say what he will they keep a steady stream of coughing . I 've been amost sick for a week . Some days I want hardly able to set up . But I 'm getting cleverly now , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me once or twice a week during the session . The wheels of government go pretty well this winter . Some say that some folks have tried to trig ' em two or three times , but I do nt hardly think that is the case , for they hav n't been stopt once . And , as I said in my last letter , if my friend Mr. Knowlton stands as foreman , and keeps his broad shoulders to the wheels , I do nt believe they will stop this winter . By the way , I made a little small mistake about Mr. Knowlton 's hat . I should n't have thought it worth while to mention it again , if the Augusta Courier of this morning had n't spoke of it as though I did n't mean to tell the truth . Now you know Mr. Editor , I would n't be guilty of telling a falsehood for my right hand . When Mr. Knowlton called the members to order the first day of the session , I certainly thought I saw him holding in his hand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering how he used to look , or it might possibly be the hat of the member standing by the side of him , for I was a good ways off . I 'm pesky fraid the general government may settle that hash down there to Madawaska as Mr. Netherlands that they left out to , recommended . If they should I 'm afraid my jig would be up about fighting a battle very soon , or getting in to be President . Our party 's got into a dreadful kind of a stew here about who shall be next Senator to Congress and one thing or another . We 've got into such a snarl about it , I 'm afraid we never shall get unravelled again without cutting off the tangles , and that would divide us so we never could hold together in the world . I wrote to the Argus yesterday , to be sure not to reply to the Age for its ungentlemanly remarks about Judge Preble , and hope it will be prudent enough to follow my recommendation . We must try to hush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of the party . I 've had a serious talk with friend Ruggles , and am in hopes he 'll put his hand over the Thomaston paper and not let it belch out any thing that our enemies can make a handle of . And I guess we shall have a caucus and try to put a cooler on the Bangor Republican and the Age . The Legislaters like Augusta considerable well , if it did n't cost ' em so much more than it did in Portland for a living . Such as had to pay two dollars and a half in Portland for board have to pay three and four dollars here . When I was in Portland , I used to get boarded for seven and sixpence a week , and here the cheapest I could get boarded any where , was ten and sixpence . The Augusta Courier last week said something about the folks here giving me a public dinner . I should like it pretty well , for I have rather slim dinners where I board . If you see cousin Sally , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and after school , if she 'll knit me a pair of footings and send ' em up by the stage-driver , for mine have got pretty full of holes , and I have n't any body here to mend ' em . Your old friend , CAPT . JACK DOWNING . LETTER XXXIII . Argument The captain suddenly called to his post at Madawaska . Letter - Jan. 23 , 1832. - To the Editor of the Portland Courier , again Dear Friend ,  --  The more I write to you , it seems to me the better I like you . I believe there is n't but one person that I set so much by , and that is Gineral Jackson , who was so kind as to give me a commission , and let me have spending money besides . I ' m pretty much out of money now , and the man that I board with keeps dunning me for pay ; so I wish you would be so kind as to send me four or five dollars till I get some more from the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I shall get it in a few days . I told you in my last letter , if I got over the furenza , you should hear from me pretty often . I ' m getting nicely again now . I do nt cough more than once in five minutes or so , and my toes and ears that were froze so bad coming up from Madawaska are nearly healed over . All I have to do to ' em now is jest to grease ' em a little when I go to bed at night and in the morning when I get up . I have to keep a handkerchief over my ears yet when I go out , but my toes are so well I do nt limp hardly a mite . As to our legislater business we get along middling well , but not quite so fast as I thought we should considerin it goes by steam . One reason I suppose is because Mr. Knowlton has been a good deal unwell and could n't take hold and drive it right in end as he used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope the wheels will begin to buzz again . About the quarrel that our party 's got into , I ' m pesky fraid it ' ll blow us up yet ; and I do n't know what we shall do to stop it . We ' ve had a caucus as I told you we should in my last letter , and tried to hush matters up as well as we could . But some of ' em are so grouty , I expect nothing but what they ' ll belch out again . I was glad the Argus took my advice and kept back the reply to the Age . We had a little bit of a tussle here to see who should be appointed agent to go to Washington to tell the president to hold on to the territory down to Madawaska . Mr. Preble and Mr. Deane and I were the three principal candidates . Some thought Mr. Preble ought to go because it would be for the interest of the republican party ; and some thought Mr. Deane ought to go because he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madawaska country ; and some thought I ought to go because I had been down there the last of any body , and because I was such good friends with the President I should be likely to do better than any body else could . I thought my claims were the strongest , and the Governor said he thought so too . But he said as affairs now stood it would n't do to appoint any body but Mr. Preble . And besides I do nt know as I ought to go off jest now , for I had a letter yesterday from one of my subalterns down to Madawaska , that there ' s some trouble with my company there : some of the Sarjeants been breaking orders , &c.,; and I do nt know but I shall have to go down and Court Martial ' em . Your friend , CAPT . JACK DOWNING LETTER XXXIV . Argument His return o Augusta  --  is saved from being frozen to death by a bear 's skin . Letter - Feb. 8 , 1832. - To the Editor of the Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right back on the old spot , poking about the Legislater to see what 's going on , and to help take care the interests of our party . I got down there to Madawaska jest in the nick of time ; for I got a hoss and rid day and night ; and it was well I did , for Sargant Joel had got so outrageous mad , I raly believe if I had n't got there the day I did , he would have strung one or two of ' em right up by the neck . But I quashed matters at once and sot ' em to studyin that are little court martial book , and told ' em when they had any more fuss , they must try all their cases by that , and they would n't find any law for hanging in it . It ' s dreadful cold down there to Madawaska , I froze my toes and ears agin , a little , but not so bad as I did afore , for I took care to rop up in a great bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing a law to kill off all the bears and wolves and sich kind of critters . I do nt know whether that 's a good plan or not .  --  There 's a good deal might be said on both sides .  --  Them are bears are pesky mischievous . I heard a story while I was gone , but I do nt know how true it is , how a great bear chased the Councillor that the Governor sent down to Frederickton , to carry provisions to our prisoners in jail there . Some reckoned the bear smelt the bread and cheese that he had in his saddle bags , and so took after him to get some of it . However , the Councillor got back safe . But I think this is a great argument in favour of killing off all the bears . And on the other hand , I believe the bear skin was all that kept me from freezing to death going to Madawaska t' other day . So it seems we ought not to kill ' em quite all off , but raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose my life would be worth as much to the State as the Councillor 's . I feel a little put out with Dr. Burnham for an unhandsome running he gave me t' other day in the Senate . He called me an old rogue . ' I cant swallow that very well ; for that 's a character I never bore in Downingville , nor Washington nor any where else . He was disputing about paying Mr. Deane and Mr. Cawano for going to Madawaska . He said they had n't ought to pay so much , for if they went on at this rate , next thing that old rogue , Capt . Jack Downing , would be sending in his bill . But he need n't trouble himself about that , for as long as I have President Jackson to look to for paymaster , I do nt care a snap about sending in my bills to to Legislater . But as for being called an old rogue , I wont . I do nt mean to make a great fuss about it in the papers , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break up the harmony of the republican party . But if Dr. Burnham do nt give me satisfaction , I 'll call a caucus of the party and have him over the coals and du him over . Your loving friend , CAPT . JACK DOWNING . LETTER XXXV . Argument The Captain describes the manner in which the Legislature makes Lawyers . Letter - March 1st , 1832. - To the Editor of the Portland Courier My Dear Old Friend ,  --  I begin to feel as uneasy as a fish out of water , because I hav n't writ to you for most two weeks . Now , old March has come , and found us digging here yet ; and sometimes I 'm most afraid we shall be found digging here , when we ought to be at home digging potatoes , or planting of ' em at least . I 've been waiting now above a week for the Legislater to do something , that I could write to you about ; but they do nt seem to get along very smart lately . Sometimes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along a little ways and then drag again . I do nt think we shall get through before sometime next week , if we do before week after . These secret sessions take up a good deal of time . I do nt see what in natur they have so many of ' em for . I tried to get into some of ' em , but they would n't let me ; they said lobby members had no business there , and shut the door right in my face . There 's one kind of business though that they carry on here pretty brisk lately , and that is making lawyers . Some days they make ' em almost as fast as uncle Ephraim used to make saptroughs ; and I 've known him to chop off and hew out two in fifteen minutes . But for all the Legislater can make ' em so fast , it is as much as ever they can get along with all that come and want to be made over into lawyers . And ' tother day , when the law committee got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand , a new batch come up , and Mr. Hall of your town moved to refer them to the committee on manufactures . This is a capital committee to make things , and I hav n't heard any complaint since , but what they can turn ' em out as fast as they come . It rather puzzled me at first to know what made every body want to be worked over into lawyers ; so I asked one of ' em that stood waiting round here a day or two , to be put into the hopper and ground over , what he wanted to be made into a lawyer for ? And he kind of looked up one side at me , and give me a knowing wink , and says he , do n't you know that the law yers get all the fat things of the land , and eat out the insides of the oisters , and give the shels to other folks ? And if a man wants to have any kind of an office , he ca n't get it unless he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislater , he ca n't be elected without he 's a lawyer : and if he wants to get to Congress , he cant go without he 's a lawyer ; and any man that do n't get made into a lawyer as fast as possible , I say , is a fool . The whole truth come across my mind then , as quick as a look , why it was that I spent two or three years trying to get an office , and could n't get one . It was because I was n't a lawyer . And do nt believe I should have got an office to this day , if my good friend President Jackson had n't found out I was a brave two fisted chap , and just the boy to go down to Madawaska and flog the British . We 've agreed unanimously to support Governor Smith for re-election ; and he 'll come in all hollow , let the Jacksonites and Huntonites say what they will about it . Our party know too well which side their bread is buttered , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write you more to day , but I feel so kind of agitated about these secret sessions , that I cant hardly hold my pen still . I 'm a little afraid they are intriguing to send on to the President to take my commission away from me . It has been thrown out to me that I ought to be down to Madawaska , instead of being here all winter . Some have hinted to me that Mr. Clifford has taken a miff against me , because the other day when he was chosen Speaker pro . tem. one of my friends voted for me ; and he thinks I was a rival candidate , and means to have me turned out of office if he can . I am your loving friend , CAPT . JACK DOWNING . LETTER XXXVI . Argument The Major 's troubles on learning that the Legislatures ' resolution to sell Madawaska to the general government , to be bargained to the British , calculates by figures its price  --  the rage of his men on learning that they would have no fighting before parting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the Editor of the Portland Courier  --  this with care and speed My dear old friend ,  --  I cleared out from Augusta in such a kind of a whirlwind , that I had n't time to write you a single word before I left . And I feel so kind of crazy now , I do nt know hardly which end I stand upon . I 've had a good many head-flaws and worriments in my life time , and been in a great many hobbles , but I never , in all my born days , met with any thing that puzzled me quite so bad as this ere selling out down here . I fite in the I egislater as long as fighting would do any good , that is , I mean in the caucus , for they would n't let me go right into the Legislater in the day time and talk to ' em there , because I was only a lobby member . But jest let them know it , lobby members can do as much as any on ' em on sich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em in the caucus as well as I could . I asked ' em if they did n't think I should look like a pretty fool , after marching my company down there , and standing ready all winter to flog the whole British nation the moment any on ' em set a foot on to our land , if I should now have to march back again and give up the land , and all , without flogging a single son-of-a-gun of ' em . But they said it was no use , it could n't be helped , Mr. Netherlands had given away the land to the British , and the President had agreed to do jest as Mr. Netherlands said about it , and all we could do now was to get as much pay for it as we could . So I set down and figured it up a little to see how much it would come to , for I used to cypher to the rule of three when I went to school , and I found it would come to a pretty round sum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of acres of land . This , considerin the timber there was on it , would certainly be worth a dollar an acre , and that would be two millions of dollars . Then there was two or three thousand inhabitants , say twenty-five hundred ; we must be paid for them too , and how much are they worth ? I 've read in the newspapers that black slaves at the south , sell for three or four hundred dollars apiece . I should think , then , that white ones , ought to fetch eight hundred . This , according to the rule of three , would be two hundred thousand dollars . Then , there 's the pretty little town of Madawaska that our Legislater made last winter , already cut and dried with town officers all chosen , and every thing ready for the British to use without any more trouble . We ought to have pay for this too , and I should think it was worth ten thousand dollars . And then the town of Madawaska has chosen Mr. Lizote to be a representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him right into the Parliament without choosing him over again , they ought to pay us for that too . Now I have read in the newspapers that it sometimes costs , in England , two hundred thousand dollars to choose a representative to Parliament , reckoning all the grog they drink and all the money they pay for votes . But I would n't be screwing about it , so I put Mr. Lizote down at one hundred thousand dollars . And then I footed up , and found it to be ,  --  Table : 1Kb This was a pretty round sum , and I begun to think , come to divide it out , it would be a slice a-piece worth having ; especially if we did't give the Feds any of it , and I supposed we should n't as there was n't any of ' em there in the caucus to help to see about it . In this view of the subject , ' I almost made up my mind that we ought to be patriotic enough to give it up , and help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I was jest a-going to get up and make a speech and tell ' em so , when Mr. McCrate of Nobleborough , and Capt . Smith of Westbrook , two of the best fellers in our party , came along and see what I was figuring about , and , says they , Capt . Downing , are you going to sell your country ? In a minute I felt something rise up in my throat , that felt as big as an ox-yoke . As soon as I got so I could speak , says I. No , never , while my name is Jack Downing , or my old rifle can carry a bullet . They declared too , that they would n't sell out to the general government , nor the British , nor nobody else . And we stuck it out most of the evening , till we found out how it was going , and then we cleared out , and as soon as the matter was fairly settled , I started off for Madawaska ; for I was afraid if my company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make a blow up among ' em , and I should have to court-martial ' em . When I first told ' em how the jig was up with us , that the British were going to have the land , without any fighting about it , I never see fellows so mad before in my life , unless it was Major Eaton at Washington when he sot out to flog Mr. Ingham . They said if they could only have had one good battle , they would n't care a snap about it , but to be played tom-fool with in this way they would n't bear it . They were so mad , they hopped right up and down , and declared they never would go back till they had been over to Fredericton and pulled the jail down , or thrashed some of the New Brunswick boys . But ; after a while , I pacified ' em by telling ' em if we did n't get a chance to fight here , I rather thought we might away off to Georgia , for there was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should want troops to go on there , I was very sure my company would be one of the first he would send for . So here we are , lying upon our arms , not knowing what to do . I have written to the President , and hope to hear from him soon . If the land is to go , I want to know it in season to get off before it 's all over ; for I 'll be hanged if ever I 'll belong to the British . Your distrest friend , CAPT . JACK DOWNING . LETTER XXXVII . Argument The office of Mayor of Portland offered to Capt . Downing and declined . Letter Portland , State of Maine , April 10 , 1832. - To the citizens of Portland When I arrived in this city , last night , from Madawaska , jest after the hubbub was over about the election , I was informed some of my friends in Ward No.7 , had voted for me for Mayor . I believe the votes are put in the papers long with the scattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Now the upshot ont is , I cant take that are office , I 've got so much other business to attend to . And so I take this opportunity to declare that I absolutely decline being a candidate . I have a great regard for the citizens of Portland , for it was they that first gave me a boost up towards an office , and I should be very glad to do any thing for ' em that I could ; but I must beg to be excused from being Mayor this year . I am with respect , CAPT . JACK DOWNING . LETTER XXXVIII . Argument The Captain 's account of a confidential conversation with President Jackson , while travelling to Tennessee . Letter - October 20 , 1832. - To the Editor of the Portland Courier , away down east in the State of Maine:O dear , seems to me I never shall get there again My dear old friend ,  --  I have n't done any thing this three months that seemed so natural as to set down and write to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sperits right up . I makes me feel as if I was again talking with you , and uncle Joshua , and cousin Ephraim , and cousin Nabby , and ant Sally , and all of ' em . I and President Jackson got back here yesterday from Tennessee , where we 've been gone most all summer . And a long journey we 've had of it too . I thought that from here to Portland was a dreadful ways , but it 's a great deal further to Tennessee . I did n't think before that our country was half so large as I find it is . It seems as if there was no end to it ; for when we got clear to Tennessee the President said we want half way acrost it . I could n't hardly believe him , but he stood tu it we want . Why , says he , Jack , I 've got the largest country in the world , and the hardest to govern tu . Say what you will of free governments , where folks will act pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardest work to administer it that ever I did . I had rather fight forty New Orleans battles than to govern this everlasting great country one year . There are so many , you see , want to have a finger in the pye , it 's the most difficult business you can imagine . You thought you had a tough time of it , Jack , to take care of them are small matters down to Madawaska last winter , with your brave company of Downingville boys . But that 's no more than a drop in the bucket to being President one month . I tell you , Jack , there is n't a monarch in Europe who has so hard a time of it as I have . There are so many cooks , the broth most always comes out rather bad . If I have to write a message , one must put in a sentence , and another a sentence , and another , till it gets so at last I ca n't hardly tell whether I 've written any of it myself or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the fire and say nothing at all . But then again that wont do , for since I 've undertaken to be President , I must go through with it . And then there was such a pulling and hauling for offices along in the outset , it seemed as though they would pull me to pieces . If I gave an office to one , Mr. Ingham or Mr. Branch would be mad , and if I gave it to another Mr. Van Buren would n't like it , and if I gave it to another , perhaps Mrs. Eaton would make a plaguy fuss about it . One wanted me to do this thing and another wanted me to do that : and it was nothing but quarrel the whole time . At last Mr. Van Buren said he 'd resign , if I would turn the rest out . So I made a scattering among ' em and turned ' em all out in a heap . All but Mr. Lewis and Mr. Kendall who staid to give me their friendly advice and help me through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slandered as I have been in the papers , it is enough to wear the patience of Job out . And if I got a little angry at the contrariness of the Senate , they must needs call me a roaring lion , ' the rascals . But that Senate did use me shamefully . The very best nominations I made , they always rejected . To think the stupid heads should reject Mr. Van Buren , decidedly the greatest man in the country , it was too provoking . Yes , Mr. Van Buren is the first man in this country , and jest between you and me , Jack , he 's the only man in it that is well qualified to succeed me in the government of this great nation of twenty-four republics . And he must come in too , or the country wont be worth a stiver , much longer . There 's Clay , he would make pretty work of it , if he should come in . Why , Jack , he would gamble one half of the country away in two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail-roads ; and when the funds in the Treasury failed he would go to the United States Bank and get more . Calhoun would break the Union to pieces in three months if he was President . He 's trying all he can now to tear off something of a slice from it at the south . And as for Wirt , he 's a fiddling away with the Anti-masons . Letting Anti-masonry alone , he 's a pretty good sort of a man ; but he has n't energy enough to steer our crazy ship of state in these stormy times . I would sooner trust it in the hands of Mrs. Eaton than him . There 's no one fit for it but Mr. Van Buren ; and if it was not for getting him in I would n't have consented to stand for another term . But , my dear friend , by stopping to tell you some of the conversation I and the President had along the road , I have almost forgot to tell you any thing about myself and the thousand things I met with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to-day . I expect to start from here on Monday on my way to Portland . You may hear from me a few times before I get there , as I shall stop along by the way some to see how matters go in Pennsylvany and New York . If you have a chance , send my love to all my folks up at Downingville , and tell ' em old Jack is alive and hearty . I remain your loving friend , CAPT . JACK DOWNING . LETTER XXXIX . Argument The Captain 's account of his having run express from Baltimore to Washington , with news from Pennsylvania , His interruptions by Gales and Duff Green , and his reception of and protection by the President . Letter - Nov. 5 , 1832. - My dear old Friend .  --  Here I am back again to Washington , though I 've been as far as Baltimore on my way down east to see you and the rest of my uncles and aunts and couzins . And what do you think I posted back to Washington for ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met an express coming on full chisel from Philadelphy , to carry the news to Washington that Pennsylvania had gone all hollow for old Hickory 's second election . The poor fellow that was carrying it had got out of breath , that he declared he could n't go no further if the Presidient never heard of it . Well , thinks I , it will be worth a journey back to Washington , jest to see the old gineral 's eyes strike fire when he hears of it . So says I , I 'll take it and carry it on for you if you are a mind to . He kind of hesitated at first , and was afraid I might play a trick upon him ; but when he found out my name was Jack Downing , he jumped off his horse quick enough ; I 'll trust it with you , says he , as quick as I would with the President himself . So I jumped on and whipped up . And sure enough , as true as you are alive , I did get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go it in , and its nearly forty miles . It was the smartest horse that ever I backed , except one that belongs to the President . But , poor fellow , he 's so done tu I guess he 'll never run another express . Jest before I got to Washington , say about two miles from the city , the poor fellow keeled up and could n't go another step . I had lost my hat on the way and was too much in a hurry to pick it up , and he had thrown me off twice and torn my coat pretty bad , so that I did n't look very trig to go through the city or to the President 's house . But notwithstanding , I knew the President would overlook it , considerin the business I was coming upon , so I catched the express and pulled foot , right through Pennsylvania Avenue , without any hat , and torn coat sleeves and coat tail flying . The stage offered to carry me , but I thought I would n't stop for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green . Says he , Capt . Downing , what 's the matter ? I held up the express and shook it at him , but never answered him a word , and pulled on . He turned and walked as fast as he could without running , and followed me . Pretty soon I met Mr. Gales of the Intelligence. , and says he , for mercy sake , Captain Downing , what 's the matter ? Have you been chased by a wolf , or Governor Houston , or have you got news from Pennsylvania ?  --  I did n't turn to the right nor left , but shook the express at him and run like wild-fire . When I came up to the President 's house , the old gentleman was standing in the door . He stepped quicker than I ever see him before , and met me at the gate . Says he , my dear friend Downing , what 's the matter ? Has the United States Bank been trying to bribe you , and you are trying to run away from ' em ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I knew if they touched you they would get the wrong pig by the ear . As he said this , Duff Green hove in sight , puffing and blowing , full speed . Oh , said the President , Duff Green wants to have a lick at you , does he ? Well do nt retreat another step , Mr. Downing , I 'll stand between you and harm . Upon that he called his boy and told him to bring his pistols in a moment . By this time I made out to get breath enough jest to say Pennsylvany , and to shake the express at him . The old man 's colour changed in a minute . Says he , come in , Mr. Downing , come in , set down , do nt say a word to Duff . So in we went , and shut the door . Now , says the President , looking as though he would rout a regiment in five minutes , now speak and let me know whether I am a dead man or alive . Gineral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a word of it , says he , stomping his foot . His eyes flashed fire , so that I trembled and almost fell backwards . But I see he did n't understand me . Dear gineral , says I , its all over with Clay and the Bank  --  at that he clapt his hands and jumped up like a boy . I never see the President jump before , as much as I 've been acquainted with him . In less than a minute he looked entirely like another man . His eyes were as calm and as bright as the moon jest coming out from behind a black thunder cloud . He clenched my hand and gave it such a shake I did n't know but he would pull it off . Says he , Jack , I knew Pennsylvany never would desert me , and if she has gone for me I 'm safe . And now if I do nt make them are Bank chaps hug it , my name is n't Andrew Jackson . And after all , Jack , I ai nt so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I am for the country and Mr. Van Buren 's account ; and we shall get him in now to be President after me . And you know , Jack , that he 's the only man after me , that 's fit to govern this country . The President has made me promise to stop and spend the night with him , and help him rejoice over the victory . But I have n't time to write any more before the mail goes .

Letter - Dec. 8 , 1832. - My dear old Friend .  --  I believe the last time I wrote to you , was when I come back with the express from Baltimore , and Duff Green chased me so through the street to find out what I was bringing , and the President thought he was running to get a lick at me , and called for his pistols to stand between me and harm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about again after I had made the old gentleman 's heart jump up by telling him that he had got Pennsylvany and would be elected as sure as eggs was bacon , and make the best of my way towards Portland . For you cant think how I long to see you and uncle Joshua and ant Kesiah and cousin Ephraim and cousin Nabby and all the rest of the dear souls up in Downingville . It seems as though it was six years instead of six months since I left that part of the country , and when I shall be able to get back again is more than I can tell now ; for I find when a man once gets into public life he never can say his time is his own ; he must always stand ready to go where his country calls . The long and the short of it is , the President has got so many other fish for me to fry , it 's no use for me to think of going home yet . That evening after I got back with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pennsylvany with a glass of wine . I am sure , said he , Capt . Downing , you will have no objection to take a glass with me on this joyful occasion . I told him , as for that matter , I supposed I could take a glass of wine upon a pinch , even if the occasion was not half so joyful . So he had two or three bottles full brought in , and filled up the glasses . And now , says the president , I will give you a toast . The state of Pennsylvania , the most patriotic state in the Union ; for though I go against all her great public interests , still she votes for me by an overwhelming majority . He then called for my toast . And what could I give but my near native Downingville ; the most ginuin unwavering democratic republican town in New England . Good , said the president ; and that Downingville has never been rewarded yet . You shall have a post office established there , and name to me which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shall be appointed . The president then gave his second toast ; Martin Van Buren , the next president of the United States , and the only man in the country that is fit for it . Capt . Downing , your toast if you please . So I gave Uncle Joshua Downing , the most thorough going republican in Downingville . Good , said the president , I understand you , Captain Downing ; your uncle Joshua shall have the post office . His third toast was the editor of the Washington Globe ; and mine was the editor of the Portland Courier . But I told him he must n't ask me for any more toasts , for that was as fur as I could go . The president toasted several more of his friends , sich as Major Eaton , and Mr. Kendall , and Mr. Lewis , and the Hon. Isaac Hill , and so on , till it got to be pretty late in the evening , and I told the president I would be glad it he would excuse me , for I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East , and I thought I should feel better if I could get a little nap first . And besides I had got to go and get the old lady that used to do my washing and mending , to patch up my coat that got such a terrible shipwreck by being thrown off the horse with the express . Start down East to-morrow morning , Capt . Downing , said he , you must not think of it . I have an important and delicate job on hand which I cant get along with very well without your assistance . There 's that miserable ambitious Calhoun has been trying this dozen years to be president of the United States ; but he ca n't make out , so now he is determined to lop off a few of the southern states and make himself president of them . But if he do n't find himself mistaken my name is n't Andrew Jackson . As he said this he started up on his feet , and begun to march across the floor with a very soldier-like step , and his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downing , he must wait till somebody else is president besides me before he can do that . Let him move an inch by force in this business , if he dares . I ' ll chase him as far as beyond Tennessee as it is from here there , but what I 'll catch him and string him up by the neck to the first tree I can find . I must send some troops out there to South Caroli a to reconnoitre and keep matters strait , and your gallant defence of Madawaska last winter points you out as the most suitable man to take the command . I shall give you a major 's commission to-morrow , and wish you to enlist two or three companies of brave volunteers and hold yourself in readiness to obey orders . In case we should have to come to a real brush , said the president , shall take command myself , and make you lieutenant-general . But I wish you to bear in mind , let what will come , never to shoot that Calhoun . Shooting is too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rope round his neck . As for your coat , Capt . Downing , do nt trouble the old lady with it . It looks as though it had seen service enough already . I 'll give you one of mine to wear till you have time to get a suit of regimentals made . I told him I felt a little uneasy about taking the command among strangers , unless I could have my Downingville company with me . Send for them , said the president , by all means , send for them . There are no troops equal to them except it is some of the boys from Tennessee . So I shall forthwith send orders to Sargeant Joel to march ' em on here . As I am to have my commission to-morrow , I shall venture to subscribe myself your friend , MAJOR JACK DOWNING . LETTER XLI . Argument Uncle Joshua 's account of the tussle at Downingville in endeavouring to keep the Federalists from pruising the president 's anti-nullifying Proclamation . Letter - Dec. 27 , 1832. - My dear Neffu ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been gone so long , before we got your letter in the Portland Courier telling how you had been away to Tennessee along with President Jackson . Your poor mother had pined away so that she had nothing left , seemingly , but skin and bones , and your cousin Nabby had cried her eyes half out of her head , poor girl . But when the Portland Courier came bringing that are letter of yourn , Downingville was in a complete uproar all day . Sargent Joel had come home from Madawaska and dismissed your company , and gone to work in the woods chopping wood . But as soon as he heard your letter had come , he dropped his ax , and I do nt think he 's touched it since ; and he put on his regimentals and scoured up the old piece of a scythe that he used to have for a sword , and stuck it into his waistband , and strutted about as big as a major gineral Your mother begun to pick up her crums immediately , and has been growing fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house like a crazy bed-bug , telling ' em Jack was alive and was agoing to build up Downingville and make something of it yet . We got your last letter and the President 's Proclamation both together , though I see your letter was written two days first . That proclamation is a capital thing . You know I 've made politics my study for forty years , and I must say it 's the most ginuin republican thing I ever come acrost . But what was most provoking about it , was , all the old federalists in town undertook to praise it tu . Squire Dudley , you know , was always a federalist , and an Adams man tu . I met him the next day after the Proclamation come , and he was chock full of the matter . Says he , Mr. Downing , that Proclamation is jest the thing . It 's the true constitutional doctrine . We all support the President in this business through thick and thin . My dander began to rise , and I could n't hold in any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I 'll knock your clam-shells together pretty quick ' It 's got to be a pretty time of day indeed , if , after we 've worked so hard , to get President Jackson in , you Federalists are going to undertake to praise his proclamation , as much as though he was your own President .  --  You 've a right to grumble and find fault with it as much as you like ; but do nt let me hear you say another word in favor of it , if you do I 'll make daylight shine through you . The old man hauled in his horns and marched off looking shamed enough . The next day we concluded to have a public meeting to pass resolutions in favor of the Proclamation . I was appointed chairman . The federal party all come flocking round and wanted to come in and help praise the President . We told ' em no ; it was our President , and our Proclamation , and they must keep their distance . So we shut the doors and went on with our resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jackson outside the house . At that I told Sargent Joel and your cousin Ephraim and two or three more of the young democrats to go out and clear the coast of them are fellers . And they went out and Sargent Joel drew his piece of a scythe and went at ' em and the Federalists run like a flock of sheep with a dog after ' em . So we finished our resolutions without getting a drop of federalism mixed with ' em , and sent ' em on to the President by Sargent Joel . He got his company together last week , and they filled their knapsacks with bread and sasages and doe-nuts , and started for Washington according to your orders . I was glad to see that hint in your letter about a post office here . We need one very much . And if the President should think I ought to have it , being I 've always been such a good friend to him , why you know , Jack , I 'm always ready to serve my country . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President should n't say any thing more about the post office , I think you had better name it to him again before you go to South Carolina ; for if any thing should happen to you there , he might never do any more about it . LETTER XLII . Argument Sargent Joel with his company arrives at Washington . His account of Gen. Blair 's fraca with Duff Green . Letter - Jan. 4 , 1833. - Dear Cousin ,  --  Sargent Joel got here day before yesterday , with my hearty old company of Downingville boys , that went down to Madawaska with me last winter . They cut rather a curious figure marching through Pennsylvany Avenu . One half of ' em had worn their shoes out so that their toes stuck out like the heads of so many young turkles , and t' other half had holes through their knees or elbows , and Sargent Joel marched ahead of ' em swinging his piece of an old scythe for a sword , and inquiring of every one he met for Major Jack Downing . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's house , which was the biggest house in the city except the Congress house , and there he would find me . I and the President were setting by the window in the great east room , looking out , and talking about Mr. Calhoun and so on , when the President began to stare as though he saw a catamount . He started upon his feet , and says he , Major Downing , if my eyes do nt deceive me there 's Nullification now coming up Pennsylvany Avenu . He begun to call for his pistols , and to tell his men to fasten up the doors when I looked out , and I knew Joel 's strut in a minit . Says I , dear Gineral that 's no nullification , but it 's what 'll put a stopper on nullification pretty quick if it once gets to South Carolina . It 's my Downingville Company commanded by Sargent Joel . At that the President looked more pleased than I 've seen him before since he got the news of the vote of Pennsylvany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave ' em as much as they could eat and drink of the best the house affords . He has found quarters for ' em in the neighbourhood , and says we must be ready to march for South Carolina whenever he says the word . But I 'll tell you what ' t is , cousin Ephraim , I begin to grow a little kind of wamble cropt about going to South Carolina , after all . If they 've got many such fellers there as one Gineral Blair there is here , from that State , I 'd sooner take my chance in the woods forty miles above Downingville , fighting bears and wolves and catamounts , than come within gun-shot of one of these Carolina giants . He 's a whaler of a feller , as big as any two men in Downingville . They say he weighs over three hundred pounds . About a week ago he met Gineral Duff Green in the street and he fell afoul of him with a great club and knocked him down , and broke his arm and beat him almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green said in his paper . And what makes me feel more skittish about getting into the hands of such chaps , is , because he says he could n't help it . He says all his friends persuaded him not to meddle with Gineral Green , and he tried as hard as he could to let him alone , but he found himself unequal to the effort . ' So Green like to got killed . The folks here sot out to carry him to court bout it , but he said he would n't go , and so he armed himself with four pistols and two dirks and a great knife , and said he ' d shoot the first man that touched him . Last night he went to the Theatre with all his arms and coutrements about him . And after he sot there a spell , and all the folks were looking to see the play go on , he draws out one of his pistols and fires it at the players . Then there was a dreadful uproar . They told him he must clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd let him alone he ' d behave like a gentleman . So they went on with the play again . By and by he draws out another pistol and points it towards the players . At that there was a whole parcel of ' em seized him and dragged him out into another room , big as he was . But pretty soon he got upon his feet , and begun to rave like a mad ox . He pulled off his coat and threw it down , and declared he ' d fight the whole boodle of ' em . The constables were all so frightened they cut and run , and nobody dared to go a near him , till he got cooled down a little , when some of his friends coaxed him away to a tavern . Now as for going to South Carolina to fight such chaps as these , I 'd sooner let nullification go to grass and eat mullen . Sargent Joel told me when he left Downingville you had jest got loaded up with apples and one thing another to go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was a going to stay there while the Legislater folks were there . So I thought it would be a good plan for you and I to write to one another about once a week or so , how matters get along . Give my love to the folks up in Downingville whenever you see ' em . So I remain your loving Cousin , MAJOR JACK DOWNING . LETTER XLIII . Argument The Major 's opinion about Nullification , and his singular illustration of it . Letter - Jan. 17 , 1833. - My kind and dear old Friend ,  --  The President 's Message to Congress makes cracking work here . Mr. Calhoun shows his teeth like a lion . Mr. McDuffie is cool as a cowcumber , though they say he 's got a terrible tempest inside of him , that he ' ll let out before long . For my part I think the President 's Message is about right . I was setting with the President in the east room last night , chatting about one thing and another , and the President says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sent to Congress to day . I told him I had n't . Well , says he , I should like to have you read it and give me your opinion upon it . So he handed it to me and I sot down and read it through . And when I got through , now says I Gineral I 'll tell you jest what I think of this ere business . When I was a youngster some of us Downingville boys used to go down to Sebago Pond every spring and hire out a month or two rafting logs across the Pond . And one time I and cousin Ephraim , and Joel , and Bill Johnson , and two or three more of us had each a whapping great log to carry across the Pond . It was rather a windy day and the waves kept the logs bobbing up and down pretty considerable bad , so we agreed to bring ' em along side and side and lash ' em together and drive some thole-pins in the outermost logs and row ' em over together . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by and by Bill Johnson begun to complain . He was always an uneasy harumscarum sort of a chap . Always thought every body else had an easier time than he had , and when he was a boy , always used to be complaining that the other boys had more butter on their bread than he had . Well , Bill was rowing on the leward side , and he begun to fret and said his side went the hardest , and he would n't give us any peace till one of us changed sides with him . Well Bill had n't rowed but a little ways on the windward side before he began to fret again , and declared that side went harder than ' tother , and he would n't touch to row on that side any longer . We told him he had his choice , and he should n't keep changing so . But he only fretted the more and begun to get mad . At last he declared if we did n't change with him in five minutes , he 'd cut the lashings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had hardly time to turn round , he declared the five minutes were out , and up hatchet and cut the lashiugs , and away went Bill on his own log , bobbing and rolling about , and dancing like a monkey to try to keep on the upper side . The rest of us scrabbled to as well as we could , and fastened our logs together again , though we had a tuff match for it , the wind blew so hard . Bill had n't gone but a little ways before his log begun to role more and more , and by and by in he went splash , head and ears . He came up puffing and blowing , and got hold of the log and tried to climb up on to it , but the more he tried the more the log rolled ; and finding it would be gone goose with him pretty soon if he staid there , he begun to sing out like a loon for us to come and take him . We asked him which side he would row if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O , says Bill , I 'll row on either side or both sides if you want me to , if you 'll only come and help me before I sink . But , said the President , I hope you did n't help the foolish rascal out till he got a pretty good soaking . He got soaked enough before we got to him , says I , for he was jest ready to sink for the last time , and our logs come pesky near getting scattered , and if they had , we should all gone to the bottom together . And now Gineral , this is jest what I think : if you let South Carolina cut the lashings you 'll see such a log-rolling in this country as you never see yet . The old Gineral started up and marched across the floor like a boy . Says he , Major Downing , she sha'nt cut the lashings while my name is Andrew Jackson . Tell Sargent Joel to have his company sleep on their arms every night . I told him they should be ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jest give cousin Ephraim up to Augusta a jog to know why he do nt write to me and let me know how the Legislater is getting along . I remain your loving friend , MAJOR JACK DOWNING . LETTER XLIV . Argument Major Downing 's account of political promises , and their peculiar value . Letter - Jan. 30 , 1833. - - To Major Jack Downing Dear cousin Jack ,  --  I got your letter some time ago , but I had n't time to answer it afore now , because I had to go back up to Downingville to get another load of apples . These Legislater folks cronch apples down by the wholesale between speeches , and sometimes in the middle of speeches tu . That arternoon that Mr. Clark spoke all day , I guess I sold nigh upon a half a bushel for cash , and trusted out most three pecks besides . The folks up to Downingville are all pretty well , only your poor old mother ; she 's got the reumatics pretty bad this winter . She says she wishes with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going to South Carolina . Ever since she heard about Gineral Blair she cant hardly sleep nights , she 's so afraid you ' ll get shot . I tell her there 's no danger of you as long as you have President Jackson one side of you and Sergent Joel ' tother . The Legislater is jogging along here pretty well ; I guess they 'll get through about the first of March , if they do nt have too many boundary questions come along . We made some Major Ginerals here ' tother day , and I tried to get you elected . Not because I thought you cared much about the office now , but jest for the honor of Downingville . I tried most all the members , and thought to be sure you would come in as slick as greese . For about forty of ' em told me they thought it belonged to you . They said it was against their principles to pledge their votes to any body ; but they whispered in my ear that they would do what they could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be elected . Sixty eight of ' em told me you was the best man for it , and would undoubtedly be chosen as a matter of course . And twentyfive of ' em promised me right up and down by the crook of the elbow , that they would vote for you . Well Jack , after all this , you did n't get but two vote by that time I begun to think it was n't so strange that it took two years heard fishing before you could get an office . This is the most democratic Legislater that they have ever had in this state yet . They are most all real ginuin democrats , and they give Mr Holmes and Mr Sprague a terrible basting for being federlists , and they have turned Mr Holmes out and put Mr. Shepley in . The Legislater is talking of moving the seat of government back to Portland again . They say it will be better all round . They wont have to go so fur through the snow-drifts to their boarding houses , and wont have to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  And here they have to pay four pence apiece every time they are shaved ; but in Portland they can get shaved by the half dozen for three cents apiece . I hope they will go , for I can get more for my apples in Portland than I can here . P. S. Bill Johnson was married last week , and he quarrelled with his wife the very next day . So you see he is the same old sixpence he used to be . He says he ' ll send a petition to the Legislater to be divorced , and he declares if they dont't grant it , he ' ll cut the lashings as he did once on the raft on Sebago Pond , sink or swim . N. B. Uncle Joshua wished me to ask you to ask the President about that post office again , as his commission has n't come yet . I remain your loving Cousin , EPHRAIM DOWNING . LETTER XLV . Argument The Major ascends to the top of Congress house and listens to see if he can hear the guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper slanders . Letter - Feb. 1 , 1833. - My Dear Friend .  --  This is nullification day , and it 's most night , and I ai nt dead yet , and hant been shot at once to-day . I got up this morning as soon as it was light , and went out and looked away towards South Carolina , and listened as hard as I could to see if I could hear the guns crackin and the cannons roarin . But it was all still as a mouse . And I 've been up top the Congress house five or six times to-day , and listened and listened , but all the firing I could hear was inside the Congress house itself , where the members were shooting their speeches at each other . I had my company all ready this morning with their dinners in their napsacks , to start as quick as we heard a single gun . We shant go till we hear something from these nullifiers , for the president says he ai nt agoing to begin the scrape , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Yesterday a friend handed me a couple of papers printed at Hallowell away down pretty near to Augusta in the state of Maine , called the American Advocate , and I found something in ' em that made me as mad as March hair . The first one mentioned that Capt . Dow was chosen mayor of Portland , and then said , he is the reputed author of the Jack Downing letters that have been published in the Portland Courier . The other paper that was printed two or three days afterwards , said Mr. Dow the mayor of Portland is not the author of Jack Downing 's letters ; they are written by Mr. Seba Smith , the Editor of the Portland Courier . Now , Mr. Editor , my good old friend , is n't this too bad ? I have n't come acrost any thing that made me feel so wamblecropt this good while . Jest as if Major Jack Downing could n't write his own letters . I 've been to school , put it altogether , off and on , more than six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always used to be called the best scholar among the boys in Downingville , and most always used to stand at the head of my class . I 'd been through Webster 's spelling-book before I was fifteen , and before I was twenty I could cypher to the rule of three . And now to have it said that I do nt write my own letters , is too bad . It 's what I call a rascally shame . I was so boiling over with it last night , that I could n't hold in ; and so I took the papers and went in and showed them to the president . I always go to the president when I have any difficulty , and when he has any he comes to me ; so we help one another along as well as we can . When the president had read it , says he , Major Downing , it 's strange to see how this world is given to lying . The public papers are beginning to slander you jest as they always do me . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , but what it 's been laid off to Mr. Van Buren , or Mr. McLane , or Mr. Livingston , or Mr. Taney , or somebody or other . And how to help this slanderous business I do nt know . But it 's too provoking , Major , that 's certain . Sometimes I 've a good mind to make Congress pass a law that every editor who says I do nt write my proclamations and messages , or that you do nt write your letters , shall forfeit his press and types ; and if that do nt stop him , that he shall be strung up by the neck without judge or jury . And now , Mr. Editor , I wish you would jest give that Hallowell man a hint to mind his own p 's and q 's in future , and look out for his neck . And as you know very well that I do write my own letters , I would thank you jest to tell the public so . I remain your sincere and loving friend , MAJOR JACK DOWNING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land speculation . Letter - March , 4 , 1833. - To Major jack Downing , at President Jackson 's house in Washington City Dear Cousin Jack ,  --  The Legislater folks have all cleared out to-day one after t' other jest like a flock of sheep ; and some of ' em have left me in the lurch tu , for they cleared out without paying me for my apples . Some of ' em went off in my debt as much as twenty cents , and some ninepence , and a shilling , and so on . They all kept telling me when they got paid off , they 'd settle up with me . And so I waited with patience till they adjourned , and thought I was as sure of my money as though it was in the Bank . But , my patience , when they did adjourn , such a hubbub I guess you never see . They were flying about from one room to another , like so many pigeons shot in the head . They run into Mr. Harris ' room and clawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I brustled up to some of ' em , and tried to settle . I come to one man that owed me twelve cents , and he had a ninepence in change , but he would n't let me have that , because he should lose a half cent . So , while we were bothering about it , trying to get it changed , the first I knew the rest of ' em had got their money in their pockets and were off like a shot , some of ' em in stages , and some in sleighs , and some footing it . I out and followed after ' em , but ' t was no use ; I could n't catch one of ' em . And as for my money , and apples tu , I guess I shall have to whistle for ' em now . Its pesky hard , for I owe four and sixpence here yet for my board , and I 've paid away every cent I ' ve got for my apples , and do nt know but I shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses . Howsomever , you know uncle Joshua always told us never to cry for spilt milk , so I mean to hold my head up yet . I do nt know but I shall have to give up retailing apples , I meet with so many head-flaws about it . I was thinking that , soon as the Legislater adjourned , I 'd take a load of apples and apple-sass , and a few sassages , and come on to Washington , and go long with your company to South Carolina . But they say Mr. Clay has put a stopper on that nullification business , so that its ten chances to one you wont have to go . I do nt care so much about the apple business after all ; for I 've found out a way to get rich forty times as fast as I can by retailing apples , or as you can by hunting after an office . And I advise you to come right home , as quick as you can come . Here 's a business going on here that you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any office , even if you should get to be President . The President do nt have but twenty-five thousand dollars a year ; but in this ere business that 's goin on here , a man can make twenty-five thousand dollars in a week if he 's a mind to , and not work hard neither . I spose by this time you begin to feel rather in a pucker to know what this business is . I ' ll tell you : but you must keep it to yourself , for if all them are Washington folks and Congress folks should come on here and go to dipping into it , I 'm afraid they 'd cut us all out . But between you and me , its only jest buying and selling land . Why , Jack , its forty times more profitable than money digging , or any other business that you ever see . I knew a man here t' other day from Bangor , that made ten thousand dollars , and I guess he want more than an hour about it . Most all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got their fortunes made , and now we are beginning to take hold of it up in the country . They ' ve got a slice up in Downingville , and I missed it by being down here selling apples , or I should had a finger in the pie . Uncle Joshua Downing , you know he 's an old fox , and always knows where to jump ; well , he see how every body was getting rich , so he went and bought a piece of a township up back of Downingville , and give his note for a thousand dollars for it . And then he sold it to uncle Jacob and took his note for two thousand dollars ; and uncle Jacob sold it to uncle Zackary and took his note for three thousand dollars ; and uncle Zackary sold it to uncle Jim , and took his note for four thousand dollars ; and uncke Jim sold it to cousin Sam , and took his note for five thousand dollars ; and cousin Sam sold it to Bill Johnson , and took his note for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' em that want worth ninepence apiece before , have now got a thousand dollars apiece clear , when their notes are paid . And Bill Johnson 's going to logging off of it , and they say he ' ll make more than any of ' em . Come home , Jack , come home by all means , if you want to get rich . Give up your commission , and think no more about being President , or any thing else , but come home and buy land before its all gone . Your loving Cousin , EPHRAIM DOWNING . P.S. Did n't Mr. Holmes and Mr. Sprague look rather blue when they got the resolutions that our Legislater passed , giving them such a mortal whipping ? LETTER XLVII . Argument Major Downing 's account of the manner in which Mr. Clay put a stop to the fuss in South Carolina , and his pacification bill to hush up the quarrels of the nullifiers . Letter - March 10 , 1833. - Dear Cousin Ephraim ,  --  I got your letter this morning . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without paying you for your apples . But they are the worst folks about standing to their word that I know of . They ' ve promised me an office more than twenty times , but some how or other , come to the case in hand , their votes always went for somebody else . But I do nt care a fig for ' em as long as I ' ve got the President on my side , for his offices are as fat again as the Legislater offices are . The President 's offices will support a man pretty well if he does ' nt do any thing at all . As soon as Mr. Clay 's Tariff Bill passed , the President called me into his room , and says he , Major Downing , the nullification jig is up . There 'll be no fun for you in South Carolina now , and I guess you may as well let Sargent Joel march the company back to Downingville , and wait till somebody kicks up another bobbery some where and then I ' ll send for ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve seen since I went with my Tennessee rangers to New Orleans . And as for you Major Downing , you shall still hold your commission and be under half pay , holding yourself in readiness to march at a moment 's warning and to fight whenever called for . So you see , Cousin Ephraim , I am pretty well to live in the world , without any of your land speculations or apple selling down east . I cant seem to see how ' t is they all make money so fast in that land business down there that you tell about . How could all our folks and Bill Johnson and all of ' em there in Downingville make a thousand dollars a piece , jest a trading round among themselves , when there ai nt fifty dollars in money , put it all together , in the whole town . It rather puzzles me a little . As soon as I see ' em all get their thousand dollars cash in hand , I guess I ' ll give up my commission and come home and buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather have a bird in the hand than one in the bush . Our Congress folks here cleared out about the same time that your Legislater folks did , and I and the President have been rather lonesome a few days . The old gentleman says I must n't leave him on any account ; but I guess I shall start Joel and the company off for Downingville in a day or two . They ' ve got their clothes pretty much mended up , and they look quite tidy . I should n't feel ashamed to see'em marched through any city in the United States . It is n't likely I shall have any thing to do under my commission very soon . For some say there ' ll be no more fighting in the country while Mr. Clay lives , if it should be a thousand years . He 's got a master knack of pacifying folks and hushing up quarrels as you ever see . He 's stopt all that fuss in South Carolina , that you know was jest ready to blow the whole country sky high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em what sort of a Bill to pass , and they passed it without hardly any jaw about it . And South Carolina has hauled in her horns , and they say she 'll be as calm as a clock now . And that is n't the only quarrel Mr. Clay has stopt . Two of the Senators , Mr. Webster and Mr. Poindexter , got as mad as March hairs at each other . They called each other some pesky hard names , and looked cross enough for a week to bite a board nail off . Well , after Mr. Clay got through with South Carolina , he took them in hand . He jest talked to ' em about five minutes , and they got up and went and shook hands with each other , and looked as loving as two brothers . Then Mr. Holmes got up and went to Mr. Clay , and almost with tears in his eyes asked him if he would n't be so kind as to settle a little difficulty there was between him and his constituents , so they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other Senators asked for the same favor . So as there is likely , to be peace now all round the house for some time to come , I 'm in a kind of a quandary what course to steer this summer . The President talks of taking a journey down east this summer , and he wants me to go with him , because I ' m acquainted there , and can show him all about it . He has a great desire to go as fur as Downingville , and get acquainted with Uncle Joshua , who has always stuck by him in all weathers through thick and thin . The President thinks uncle Joshua is one of the republican pillars of New England , and says he shall always have the post office as long as he lives , and his children after him . I rather guess on the whole I shall come on that way this summer with the President . But wherever I go , I shall remain your loving cousin . MAJOR JACK DOWNING . LETTER XLVIII . Argument The Major 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether the Presiden shakes hands with the federalists , during his journey down East . Letter - April 20 , 1833. - My Dear Old Friend ,  --  Bein I hant writ to you for some time , I 'm afraid you and our folks up in Downingville will begin to feel a little uneasy by and by , so I ' ll jest write you a little if it ai nt but two lines , to let you know how we get on here . I and the President seem to enjoy ourselves pretty well together , though its getting to be a little lonesome since the Congress folks went off , and Sargent Joel cleared out with my Downingville Company , Poor souls , I wonder if they have got home yet ; I have n't heard a word from ' em since they left here . I wish you would send up word to Sargeant Joel to write to me and let me know how they got along . He can send his letter in your Currier , or get uncle Joshua to frank it ; either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it , I wish you would jest ask cousin Nabby to ask uncle Joshua to frank me on two or three pair of stockings , for mine have got terribly out at the heels . He can do it jest as well as not ; they make nothing here of franking a bushel basket full of great books to the western States . And they say some of the members of Congress used to frank their clothes home by mail to be washed . I and the President are getting ready to come on that way this summer . We shall come as far as Portland , and I expect we shall go up to Downingville ; for the President says he must shake hands with uncle Joshua before he comes back , that faithful old republican who has stood by him through thick and thin ever since he found he was going to be elected President . He will either go up to Downingville , or send for Uncle Joshua to meet him at Portland . There is some trouble amongst us here a little , to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come that way . They say the federalists in Massachusetts want to keep the President all to themselves when he comes there . But Mr. Van Buren says that ' ll never do ; he must stick to the democratic party ; he may shake hands with a federalist once in a while if the democrats do nt see him , but whenever there ' s any democrats round he must n't look at a federalist . Mr. McLane and Mr. Livingston advise him tother way .  --  They tell him he 'd better treat the federalists pretty civil , and shake hands with Mr. Webster as quick as he would with uncle Joshua Downing . And when they give this advice Mr. Lewis and Mr. Kendle hop right up as mad as march hairs , and tell him if he shakes hands with a single federalist while he is gone , the democratic party will be ruined . And then the President turns to me and asks me what he had better do . And I tell him I guess he better go straight ahead , and keep a stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind to . Mr. Van Buren staid with us awhile at the President 's , but he 's moved into a house now on Pennsylvany Avenue . He 's a fine slick man I can tell you , and the President says he 's the greatest man in America . He 's got the beat'em-est tongue that I ever see . If you had a black hat on , he could go to talking to you and in ten minutes he could make you think it was white . Give my love to our folks up in Downingville when you have a chance to send it to ' em , and believe me your old friend , MAJOR JACK DOWNING . LETTER XLIX . Argument Major Downing defends the President against the assaults of Lieut . Randolph , on board the Cygnet steam boat . Letter - May the 6th , 1833. - My dear old Friend .  --  We ' ve had a kind of a hurly burly time here to-day . I did n't know but we should burst the biler one spell ; and some of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , I and the president and a few more gentlemen got into the steam-boat this morning to go round into old Virginny to help lay the foundation of a monument , so they should n't forget who Washington 's mother was . When we got down along to Alexandria , the boat hauled up to the side of the wharf awhile to let some more folks get in , and while she lay there , I and the president and a few more of ' em sot in the cabin reading and chatting with one another . The president had jest got through reading a letter from uncle Joshua Downing , urging him very strongly to come up as fur as Downingville when he comes on that way . And says he , Major Downing , this uncle Joshua of yours is a real true blue republican as I know of any where . I would n't miss seeing him when I go down east for a whole year 's salary . Says I , your honor , Downingville is the most thorough going republican town there is any where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back till you have visited it . Jest as I said that there was a stranger came into the cabin and stept along up to the president , and begun to pull off his glove . I thought there was some mischief bruing , for his lips were kind of quivery , and I did n't like the looks of his eyes a bit . But the president thought he was trying to get his gloves off to shake hands with him , and the good old man is always ready to shake hands with a friend ; so he reached out his hand to him and smiled , and told him never to stand for the gloves , and the words want hardly out of his mouth when dab went one of the fellow 's hands slap into the president 's face . In a moment I levelled my umbrella at the villain 's head , and came pesky near fetching him to the floor . Two more gentlemen then clenched him by the collar and had him down as quick as ever you see a beef ox knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowd round him as thick as a swarm of bees . But , my stars , I wish you could have seen the president jest at that minute . If you ever see a lion lying down asleep and a man come along with a great club and hit him a plot with all his might , and then see that lion spring on his feet , and see the fire flash in his eyes , and hear him roar and gnash his teeth , you might give some sort of a guess what kind of a harrycane we had of it . The old Gineral no sooner felt the fellow 's paw in his face than he sprung like a steel-trap , and catched his cane and went at him . But there was such a crowd of men there in an instant , that it was as much impossible to get through ' em as it was for the British to get through his pile of cotton wool bags at New-Orleans . If it had n't been for that , I do nt think but he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two minutes . However , somehow or other the rascal got hussled out of the boat on to the wharf , and fled like a dog that had been stealing sheep . They have sent some officers after him , but where they will overtake him nobody knows . The president has got cleverly cooled down again , and we are going on to lay the foundation of the monument . My love to all the good folks up in Downingville . In haste your old friend , MAJOR JACK DOWNING . LETTER L. Argument Major Downing tells how he shook hands for the President while at Philadelphla. on his tour down East . Letter - - June 10 , 1833 . Dear Uncle Joshua ,  --  We are coming on full chisel . I 've been trying , ever since we started , to get a chance to write a little to you ; but when we 've been on the road I could n't catch my breath hardly long enough to write my name , we kept flying so fast ; and when we made any stop , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room enough for a miskeeter to turn round without knocking his wings off . I 'm most afraid now we shall get to Downingville before this letter does , so that we shall be likely to catch you all in the suds before you think of it . But I understand there is a fast mail goes on that way , and I mean to send it by that , so I 'm in hopes you 'll get it time enough to have the children 's faces washed and their heads combed , and the gals get on their clean gowns . And if Sargent Joel could have time enough to call out my old Downingville Company and get their uniform brushed up a little , and come down the road as fur as your new barn to meet us , there 's nothing that would please the President better . As for victuals , most any thing wont come amiss ; we are as hungry as bears after travelling a hundred miles a day . A little fried pork and eggs , or a pot of baked beans and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff they give us here in these great cities . The President would n't miss of seeing you for any thing in the world , and he will go to Downingville if he has legs and arms enough left when he goes to Portland to carry him there . But for fear any thing should happen that he should n't be able to come , you had better meet us in Portland , say about the 22d , and then you can go up to Downingville with us , you know . This travelling with the President is capital fun after all , if it was n't so plaguy tiresome . We come into Baltimore on a Rail Road , and we flew over the ground like a harrycane . There is n't a horse in this country that could keep up with us , if he should go upon the clean clip . When we got to Baltimore , the streets were filled with folks as thick as the spruce trees down in your swamp . There we found Black Hawk , a little , old , dried up Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the prophet about as much as they did me and the President . I gave the President a wink that this Indian fellow was taking the shine off of us a little , so we concluded we would n't have him in our company any more , and shall git on without him . I cant stop to tell you in this letter how we got along to Philadelphy , though we had a pretty easy time some of the way in the steam-boats . And I cant stop to tell you of half of the fine things I have seen here . They took us up into a great hall this morning as big as a meeting-house , and then the folks begun to pour in by thousands to shake hands with the President ; federalists and all , it made no difference . There was such a stream of ' em coming in that the hall was full in a few minutes , and it was so jammed up round the door that they could n't get out again if they were to die . So they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way . The President shook hands with all his might an hour or two , till he got so tired he could n't hardly stand it . I took hold and shook for him once in awhile to help him along , but at last he got so tired he had to lay down on a soft bench covered with cloth and shake as well as he could , and when he could n't shake he 'd nod to ' em as they come along . And at last he got so beat out , he could n't only wrinkle his forhead and wink . Then I kind of stood behind him and reached my arm round under his , and shook for him for about a half an hour as tight as I could spring . Then we concluded it was best to adjourn for to-day . And I 've made out to get away up into the garret in the tavern long enough to write this letter . We shall be off to-morrow or next day for York , and if I can possibly get breathing time enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my love to all the folks in Downingville , and believe me your loving neffu , MAJOR JACK DOWNING . LETTER LI . Argument Major Downing and the President 's narrow escape at the breaking down of the bridge extending from Castle Garden to the Battery at New York . Letter - - New York City Friday evening , June 14 , 1833 . Dear Uncle Joshua ,  --  Here we are amongst an ocean of folks , and cutting up capers as high as a cat 's back . I spose you will see by the papers how we all like to got drowned yesterday going acros a little bridge between the castle and the garden . It was a pesky narrow squeak for me and the President . He was riding over on a great fine hoss , and I was walking along by the side of him and trying to clear the way a little , for they crowded upon us so , there was no getting along , and hardly a chance to breathe . When we got under the arch we stopped a little bit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I heard something crack . Says I , Gineral you better go ahead , I 'm afraid there 's mischief bruing here . At that he give his hoss a lick and pushed through the crowd , but we had n't got more than a rod , before crash went the bridge behind us , all down in a heap , and two tollhouses on top of it and as many as a hundred folks splashed into the water , all mixed up together one top of ' tother . The President looked over his shoulder , and seeing I was safe behind him , called out for Mr. Van Buren , and asked me to run and see if he was hurt . I told him he had forgot himself , for Mr. Van Buren was n't in the company ; but Mr. Woodbury and Mr. Cass were in for it , for I could see them floundering about in the water now . Run , Major , said the President run and give them a lift . Take Mr. Woodbury first , you know I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcel of us took hold and went to hauling of ' em out of the water like so many drowned rats . But we got ' em all out alive , except a few young things they called dandies ; they looked so after they got wet all over that we could n't make out whether they were alive or dead . So we laid ' em up to dry and left ' em ; and I went on to help the President review the troops on the battery , as they call it ; and a grand place it is tu . I ' ve seen more fine shows here , it seems to me , than ever I see before in my life . Such a sight of folks , and fine ladies , and fine houses , and vessels , and steam-boats , and flags a flying , and cannons firing , and fire works a whisking about , I never see the beat of it . I did n't think there was so much fun in this world before , for all I 've been about so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I cant tell you much about it till we get there , for I cant find any time to write . I 've only cheated a few minutes this evening while the President is gone into Mr. Niblo 's garden . One of the master sights that I 've seen yet was that baloon that went up this afternoon , carrying a man with it . Poor fellow , I do nt much think he ' ll ever get back again , for he looked to me the last I see of him as though he would land in England , or the moon , or some other country . All these sights keep us back a little longer than we expected . I do nt think now we shall be in Portland before the 28th or 29th of this month . So I thought I 'd jest write you a line that you might be down there about that time . In haste your loving neffu , MAJOR JACK DOWNING LETTER LII .

Letter - Tuesday , June 25 , 1833. - To the Editor of the Portland Courier My Dear Old Friend ,  --  I ' m keeping house with the President to-day , and bein he 's getting considerable better , I thought I 'd catch a chance when he was taking a knap , and write a little to let you know how we get along . This ere sicknessof the President has been a bad pull-back to us . He has n't been able to go out since Sunday afternoon , and I 've been watchin with him this two nights , and if I was n't as tough as a halter , I should be half dead by this time . And if the President want tougher than a catamount , he 'd kick the bucket before he 'd been round to see one half the notions there is in Boston . Poor man , he has a hard time of it ; you 've no idea how much he has to go through . Its worse than being dragged through forty knot holes . To be bamboozled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain or shine , jammed into one great house to eat a breakfast , and into another great house to eat a dinner , and into another to eat supper , and into two or three others between meals , to eat cooliations , and to have to go out and review three or four rigiments of troops , and then to be jammed into Funnel Hall two hours , and shake hands with three or four thousand folks , and then to go into the State House and stand there two or thee hours and see all Boston streaming through it like a river through a sawmill , and then to ride about the city awhile in a fine painted covered waggon with four or five horses to draw it , and then ride awhile in one without any cover to it , finney-fined off to the top notch , and then get on to the horses and ride awhile a horseback , and then run into a great picture room and see more fine pictures than you could shake a stick at in a week , and then go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half an hour with a flock of ladies , and then after supper go and have a little still kind of a hubbub all alone with three or four hundred particular friends , and talk an hour or two , and take another cooliation , and then go home , and about midnight get ready to go to bed , and up again at four o'clock the next morning and at it .  --  If this ai nt enough to tucker a feller out I do nt know what is . The President would n't have stood it till this time if he had n't sent me and Mr. Van Buren and the rest of us to some of the parties , while he staid at home to rest . The President 's got so much better I think we shall be able to start for Salem to-morrow , for we must go through with it now we 've begun , as hard work as ' t is .

They are worse than the pick-pockets . I mean them are fellers that 's got to writing letters and putting my name to ' em , and sending of ' em to the printers . And I heard there was one sassy feller last Saturday down to Newburyport that got on to a horse and rid about town calling himself Major Jack Downing , and all the soldiers and the folks marched up and and shook hands with him , and thought it was me.  --  Now , my dear old friend , is n't this too bad ?

Major Downings nomination for the Presidency , with an elegant picture of his residence . NOMINATION FOR THE PRESIDENCY . From the National Intelligencer . We do not know whether it be necessary , in copying the subjoined effusion , to enter into a protest against misinterpretation of our motives . We should be sorry to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burlesque so serious an action as the choice of President of the United States . We copy the following for the sake of its moral , as well as its wit , and we do not like the moral the less for being taught with a smiling countenance . From the Mauch Chunk Courier . Our next President Many of the papers in the United States have already manifested a disposition to agitate the subject of the next Presidency , and several distinguished individuals have been informally named for that office , among whom are Mr. Van Buren , Mr. MLean , Mr. Cass , Mr. Clay and Mr. Webster . As we are opposed to a premature discussion of this ticklish question , we have not hitherto committed ourself in favour of either of these individuals . Indeed , we have considered it very imprudent in these times , for any one who wishes to be an orthodox politician , to " come out " for any body until he can ascertain who will be most likely to succeed . Accordingly we have stood upon our " reserved rights " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and see who would probably be the most popular candidate . Recent indications have satisfactorily convinced us on that point , and as we wish to be considered among the " originals "  --  the real Simon Pures , we would lose no time in nominating For President , MAJOR JACK DOWNING , Of Downingville . In recommending this distinguished personage to our fellow citizens , it will be scarcely necessary to enumerate his various claims to their suffrages . Suffice it to say , his military renown , his valuable public services in assisting President Jackson to put down the Nullifiers , especially in shaking hands with the Yankees " down east , " and last though not least , the fidelity with which he and his uncle Joshua stuck to the Old Hero after he found he was going to be President , eminently qualify him for that exalted station . LETTER LV . Argument The Major tells us about the President , being made Doctor of Laws . Letter - July 2 , 1833. - My Dear Friend .  --  We are driving back again full chisel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Rail Road between Washington and Baltimore . And we 've been drivin so fast on a round turn in all the places where we 've been , and have had so much shaking hands and eating and one thing another to do , that I could ' nt get time to write to you at half the places where I wanted to , so I thought I 'd set down now , while the President 's laid down to rest him awhile , and tell you something about Cambridge and Lowell . Ye see when we were at Boston they sent word to us to come out to Cambridge , for they wanted to make the President a Doctor of Laws . What upon arth a Doctor of Laws was , or why they wanted to make the President one , I could n't think . So when we come to go up to bed I asked the Gineral about it . And says I , Gineral , what is it they want to do to you out to Cambridge ? Says he they want to make a Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what good will that do ? Why , says he , you know Major Downing , there 's a pesky many of them are laws passed by Congress , that are rickety things . Some of ' em have very poor constitutions , and some of ' em have n't no constitutions at all . So that it is necessary to have somebody there to Doctor ' em up a little , and not let ' em go out into the world where they would stan a chance to catch cold and be sick , without they had good constitutions to bear it . You know , says he , I have had to doctor the Laws considerable ever since I 've been at Washington , although I was n't a regular bred Doctor . And I made out so well about it , that these Cambridge folks think I had better be mad into a regular Doctor at once , and then there ' ll be no grumbling and disputing about my practice . Says he , Major , what do you think of it ? I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if he did n't think they would be willing , bein I 'd been round in the military business considerable for a year or two past , to make me a Doctor of War . He said he did n't know , but he thought it would be no harm to try ' em . But says , he Major , I feel a little kind of streaked about it after all ; for they say they will go talking to me in Latin , and although I studied it a little once , I do nt know any more about it now than the man in the moon . And how I can get along in that case I do nt know . I told him my way , when any body talked to me in a lingo that I did n't understand , was jest to say nothing , but look as knowing as any of ' em , and then they thought I knew a pesky sight more than any of ' em . At that the Gineral fetched me a slap on the shoulder and haw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are the boy for me ; I do n't know how I should get along in this world if it was n't for you . So when we got ready we went right to Cambridge as bold as could be . And that are Cambridge is a real pretty place ; it seems to me I should like to live in them Colleges as well as any place I 've seen . We went into the Libry , and I guess I stared a little , for I did n't think before there was half so many books in the world I should think there was near about enough to fill a meetin house . I do nt believe they was ever all read or ever will be to all ages . When we come to go in to be made Doctors of , there was a terrible crowding round ; but they give us a good place , and then sure enough they did begin to talk in Latin or some other gibberish ; but whether they were talking to the Gineral , or who ' t was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little puzzled . But he never said a word , only once in a while bowed a little . And I spose he happened sometimes to put in the bows in the wrong place , for I could see some of the sassy students look up one side once a while , and snicker out of one corner of their mouths . Howsomever the Gineral stood it out like a hero , and got through very well . And when ' t was over , I stept up to Mr. Quincey and asked him if he would n't be so good as to make me a Doctor of War , and hinted to him a little about my services down to Madawaska and among the nullifiers . At that he made me a very polite bow , and says he , Major Downing , we should be very happy to oblige you if we could , but we never give any degrees of war here ; all our degrees are degrees of peace . So I find I shall have to practice war in the natural way , let nullification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over we went to Mr. Quincey 's and had a capital dinner . And on the whole had about as good a visit to Cambridge as most any where . I meant to a told you considerable about Lowell , but the steamboat goes so fast , I shant have time to . We went all over the Factories ; and there ! I wont try to say one word about ' em , for I 've been filled with such a wondermient ever since , that my ideas are all as big as hay stacks , and if I should try to get one of ' em out of my head , it would tear it all to pieces . It beat all that ever I heard of before , and the Gineral said it beat all that ever he heard of . But what made the Gineral hold his head up and feel more like a soldier , than he had before since he was at New Orleans , was when we marched along the street by them are five thousand gals , all dressed up and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched along as light as a boy , and seems to me I never see his eyes shine so bright afore . After we got along about to the middle of ' em , he whispered to me , and says he , Major Downing , is your Cousin Nabby here among ' em ; if she is , I must be introduced to her . I told him she was not ; as they were expecting us to come to Downingville , she staid to home to help get ready . Well , says he , if any thing should happen that we ca n't go to Downingville , you must send for your Cousin Nabby and Uncle Joshua to come on to Washington to see me . I will bear all the expenses , if they will only come , says he ; these northern gals are as much afore our southern and western gals as can be , and I 've thought of you Cousin Nabby a great deal lately  --  he looked as though he was going to say something more , but Mr. Van Buren and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it broke off , and had to go along .

We ai nt very apt to forget our best friends ; and you may depend upon it Jack Downing will never forget the editor of the Portland Courier any more than Andrew Jackson will forget Jack Downing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift into public life , and you ' ve been a boosting me along ever since . And jest between you and me I think I ' m getting into a way now where I shall be able by and by to do something to pay you for it . The reason that I have n't writ to you before , is , that we have had pretty serious business to attend to since we got back . But we ' ve jest got through with it , and Mr. Van Buren has cleared out and gone back about the quickest to New York , and I guess with a bed-bug in his ear . Now jest between you and me in confidence , I 'll tell you how ' t is ; but pray do nt let on about it to any body else for the world . Did n't you think plaguy strange what made us cut back so quick from Concord without going to Portland or Portsmouth or Downingville ? You know the papers have said it was because the president want very well , and the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters ; but it was no such thing . The president could a marched on foot twenty miles a day then , and only let him been at the head of my Downingville company and he ' d a whole British regiment scamper like a flock of sheep . But you see the trouble ont was , there was some difficulty between I and Mr. Van Buren . Some how or other Mr. Van Buren always looked kind of jealous at me all the time after he met us at New York ; and I could n't help minding every time the folks hollered hoorah for Major Downing ' he would turn as red as a blaze of fire . And wherever we stopped to take a bite or to have a chat , he would always work it , if he could , somehow or other so as to crowd in between me and the president . Well , ye see , I would n't mind much about it , but would jest step round ' tother side . And though I say it myself , the folks would look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ; and after they 'd cried hoorah for the president , they 'd most always sing out hoorah for Major Downing . ' Mr. Van Buren kept growing more and more fidgety till we got to Concord . And there we had a room full of sturdy old democrats of New Hampshire , and after they had all flocked round the old president and shook hands with him , he happened to introduce me to some of ' em before he did Mr. Van Buren . At that the fat was all in the fire . Mr. Van Buren wheeled about and marched out of the room looking as though he could bite a board nail off . The president had to send for him three times before he could get him back into the room again . And when he did come , he did n't speak to me for the whole evening . However we kept it from the company pretty much ; but when we come to go up to bed that night , we had a real quarrel . It was nothing but jaw , jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to pacify us all they could , but it was all in vain , we did n't one of us get a wink of sleep , and should n't if the night had lasted a fortnight . Mr. Van Buren said the president had dishonoured the country by placing a military major on half pay before the second officer of the government . The president begged him to consider that I was a very particular friend of his ; that I had been a great help to him at both ends of the country ; that I had kept the British out of Madawaska away down in Maine , and had marched my company clear from Downingville to Washington , on my way to South Carolina , to put down the nullifiers ; and he thought I was entitled to as much respect as any man in the country . This nettled Mr. Van Buren peskily . He said he thought it was a fine time of day if a raw jockey from an obscure village away down east , jest because he had a major 's commission , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the heads of departments into the back ground . At this my dander began to rise , and I stepped right up to him ; and says I , Mr. Van Buren , you are the last man that ought to call me a jockey . And if you ' ll go to Downingville and stand up before my company with Sargeant Joel at their head , and call Downingville an obscure village , I 'll let you use my head for a foot-ball as long as you live afterwards . For if they would n't blow you into ten thousand atoms , I 'll never guess again . We got so high at last that the old president hopt off the bed like a boy ; for he had laid down to rest him , bein it was near daylight , though he could n't get to sleep . And says he , Mr. Donaldson , set down and write Mr. Anderson at Portland , and my friend Joshua Downing at Downingville , that I ca n't come . I 'm going to start for Washington this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portsmouth and Exeter and round there ! I tell you , says the president , I 'm going to start for Washington this morning , and in three days I 'll be there . What , says Mr. Woodbury , and not go to Portland , where they have spent so much money to get ready for us ! I tell you , says the president , my foot is down : I go not a step further , but turn about this morning for Washington . What , says I , and not go to Downingville , what will Uncle Joshua say ? At this the president looked a little hurt ; and says he , Major Downing , I ca n't help it . As for going any further with such a din as this about my ears , I can not , and will not , and I am resolved not to budge another inch . And sure enough the president was as good as his word , and we were all packed up by sunrise , and in three days we were in Washington . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next presidency . Mr. Van Buren says the president promised it to him , and now he charges me and the president with a plot to work myself into it and leave him out . It 's true I 've been nominated in a good many papers , in the National Intelligencer , and in the Munch Chunk Courier printed away off among the coal diggers in Pennsylvany , and a good many more . And them are Pennsylvany chaps are real pealers for electing folks when they take hold ; and that 's what makes Mr. Van Buren so uneasy . The president tells him as he has promised to help him , he shall do what he can for him ; but if the folks will vote for me he ca n't help it . Mr. Van Buren wanted I should come out in the National Intelligencer and resign , and so be put up for vice president under him . But I told him no ; bein it had gone so fur I would n't do nothing about it . I had n't asked for the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to me I would n't refuse it . So after we had battled it about a fortnight , Mr. Van Buren found it was no use to try to dicker with me , and he 's cleared out and gone to New York to see what he can do there . I never thought of getting in to be president so soon , though I ' ve had a kind of bankering for it this two years . But now , seeing it 's turned out as it has , I 'm determined to make a bold push , and if I can get in by the free votes of the people , I mean to . The president says he 'd rather I should have it than any body else , and if he had n't promised Mr. Van Buren before hand , he would use his influence for me . I remember when I was a boy about a dozen years old , there was an old woman come to our house to tell fortunes . And after she ' d told the rest of ' em , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't told his fortunes yet , and I do nt spose it ' s worth a telling , for he ' s a real mutton-headed boy . At that the old woman catched hold of my hair , and pulled my head back and looked into my face , and I never shall forget how she looked right through me , as long as I live . At last , says she , and she gin me a shove that sent me almost through the side of the house , Jack will beat the whole of you . He ' ll be a famous climber in his day , and wherever he sets out to climb , you may depend upon it , he will go to the top of the ladder . Now , putting all these things together , and the nominations in the papers , and the hoorahs for Major Downing , ' I do nt know what it means , unless it means that I must be president . So , as I said afore , I 'm determined to make a bold push . I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the support of the western states , and his reply is , go ahead . ' I shall depend upon you and uncle Joshua to carry the state of Maine for me ; and , in order to secure the other states , I spose it will be necessary to publish my life and writings . President Jackson had his life published before he was elected , and when Mr. Clay was a candidate he had hisn published . I ' ve talked with the president about it , and he says , publish it by all means , and set the printer of the Portland Courier right about it . So I want you to go to work as soon as you get this , and pick up my letters , and begin to print ' em in a book ; and I ' ll set down and write a history of my life to put into it , and send it along as fast as I can get it done . But I want you to be very careful not to get any of them are confounded counterfeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printers , mixed in long with mine . It would be as bad as breaking a rotten egg in long with the good ones ; it would spile the whole puddin' . You can tell all my letters , for they were all sent to you first . The president says I must have a picter of me made and put into the book .  --  He says he had one put into his , and Mr. Clay had one put into his . So I believe I dozen years ago , were some as big republicans as there was any where about . Well , they got to be considerable old , and had been in office sometime , so the Argus took and clapt ' em right over on to the federal side . And you know there was Mr. Holmes , he was a whapping great republican . But he begun to grow old , and so the Argus put him over . And there was Mr. Sprague ; he was such a nice dimocrat every one said it was a pitty to put him over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Argus would n't hear a word , but shoved him right over . And this summer the Argus is putting of ' em over considerable younger on to the federal side . It has put Judge Preble over , and Judge Ware , and Mr. Mitchell the Post Master at Portland , and he is n't near so old as uncle Joshua , and it has put Mr. Megquier over , only think , such a young man as Mr. Megquier , that 's only been in the Sinnet three or four years . Now do nt you think , according to dimocratic usage , it is high time old uncle Joshua was put over . I wish you would jest write to the Argus and have it done , for I feel a good deal worried about it . And as soon as it comes out in the Argus that he is fairly over , I want you to tell the President that uncle Joshua is a federalist , and have him removed from the Post Office , for it would be an everlasting shame to have the Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle Joshua should be removed I wish you would use your influence to get the President to give the office to me ; for next to Uncle Joshua I spose I 've done more for the republican party than any man in Downingville . I can have a recommendation from Sargent Joel and all the company . By attending to this you will much oblige your friend and cousin , EPHRAIM DOWNING . LETTER LVIII . Argument The President commence a conversation about ME and Daniel . Letter - Sept. 14 , 1833. - My dear old Friend ,  --  Its got to be a pretty considerable long while now since I 've writ to you , for I never like to write , you know , without I have something to say .  --  But I 've got something on my mind now , that keeps me all the time a thinking so much that I cant hold in any longer . So jest between you and me I 'll tell you what ' t is . But I must begin a little ways beforehand , so you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ' t is as soon as I get along to it . You see I and the President has been down to the Rip Raps a few weeks to try to recruit up a little ; for that pesky tower away down East like to did the job for the old Gineral . So , after we got things pretty much to rights here , we jest stepped aboard the steamboat and and went down to the Rip Raps . That are Rip Raps is a capital place ; it is worth all the money we ever paid for it , if it was for nothing else only jest to recruit up the Government . It is one of the most coolest places in the summer time that you ever see . Let a feller be all worn out and wilted down as limpsy as a rag , so that the doctors would think he was jest ready to fly off the handle , and let him go down to the Rip Raps and stay there a fortnight , and he 'd come up again as smart as a steeltrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were down to the Rip Raps , that ever since we got back till two or three days ago , he has been as good natured and sociable as ever I should wish to see a body . And now I 'm coming , pretty soon , to what I was going to tell you about , that bears so heavy on my mind . Your see the President likes every morning after the breakfast is out of the way , to set down and read over the newspapers , and see what is going on in the country , and who 's elected and so on So when we 've done breakfast , we take the letters and papers that come from the Post-Office , and go away by ourselves into the great East Room where we can say jest what we 've a mind to , and nobody not hear us , and the President sets down in his great arm rocking-chair and smokes his segar , and I set down by the table and read to him . Last Monday morning , as I was reading over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania paper and opened it , and , says I , hullow , gineral , here 's a speech of Mr. Webster at Pittsburg , as large as life . Ah , said he ; well , let us hear what Daniel has been talking to them are Pennsylvany and Ohio chaps about . So I hitched back in my chair , and read on . And by and by I begun to get into the marrow of the story , where he told all about Nullification , and what a dark time we had of it last winter , and how the black clouds begun to rise and spread over the country , and the thunders of civil war begun to roll and rumble away off to the South , and by and by how the tempest was jest ready to burst over our heads and split the country all into shivers , and how , in the very nick of time , the President 's Proclamation came out and spread over the whole country like a rain-bow , and how every body then took courage and said the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President had started up on his feet , and walked back and forth across the room pretty quick , puffing away and making the smoke roll out of his mouth like a house a fire ; and by the time I had got through , he had thrown his segar out of the window , and come and sot down , leaning his elbow on the table and looking right in my face . I laid the paper down , and there he sot looking right at me as much as five minutes , and never said a word ; but he seemed to keep a thinking , as fast as a horse could run . At last , said he , Major Downing , were you ever told that you resembled Daniel Webster ? Why , Gineral , says I , how do you mean , in looks or what ? Why perhaps a little of both says he , but mostly in looks . Bless my stars , says I , Gineral , you do nt mean to say that I am quite so dark as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that sharp knowing look , as though you could see right through a millstone . I know , says he , that Mr. Webster is rather a dark looking man , but there is n't another man in this country that can throw so much light on a dark subject as he can . Why yes , says I , he has a remarkable faculty for that ; he can see through most any thing , and he can make other folks see through it too . I guess , says I , if he 'd been born in old Virginny he 'd stood next to most anybody . A leetle afore ' em , says the Gineral , in my own way of thinking . I 'll tell you what ' t is Major , I begin to think your New Englanders ai nt the worst sort of fellows in the world after all . Ah well says I , seeing is believing , and you ' ve been down that way now and can judge for yourself . But if you had only gone as fur as Downingville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em than you do now . Other folks may talk larger and bluster more , says I , but whenever you are in trouble , and want the real support in time of need , go to New England for it and you never need to be afraid but what it will come . I believe you are right , says the Gineral ; for notwithstanding all I could do with my proclamation against nullification , I believe I should have rubbed hard if there had been no such men in the country as Major Downing and Daniel Webster . But this nullification business is not killed yet . The tops are beat down , but the roots are alive as ever , and spreading under ground wider and wider , and one of these days when they begin to sprout up again there ' ll be a tougher scrabble to keep ' em down than there has been yet ; and I ' ve been thinking , says he , and he laid his hand on my shoulder and looked very anxious , I 've been thinking says he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in cometh Amos Kendle with a long letter from Mr Van Buren about the Bank and the safety fund and the Government deposits and I do nt know what all ; and the President 's brow was clouded in a minute ; for he always feels kind of pettish when they plague him about the safety fund . I have n't had any chance to talk with him since , there ' s so many of ' em round him ; and I ' m as uneasy as a fish out of water , I feel so anxious to know what the President was going to say about me and Daniel . I shall watch the first chance when I think it will do to talk with him , and find out what he was going to say . I cant hardly sleep a nights , I think so much about it . When I find out I 'll write to you again . Send my love to the folks up in Downingville when you have a chance . I remain your sincere friend , MAJOR JACK DOWNING . LETTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Letter - Sept. 30 , 1833. - My Dear Friend ,  --  Hav n't you been in a terrible kind of a pucker ever since my last letter to you , to know what the President was going to say about me and Daniel ? If you hav n't , I have . I never felt so uneasy for a fortnight hardly in my life . If I went to bed I could n't sleep , and I 've got up and walked the floor as much as half the night almost every night since .  --  I 've wished the Bank to Guinea more than fifty times , for there 's been such a hubbub here about the Bank this fortnight past , that I could n't get a moment 's chance to talk with the President about any thing else . We 'd have cabinet meetings once in awhile to see about moving the deposits , and Mr. Duane and Mr. Cass and Mr. McLane would talk up to the President so about it , that he 'd conclude to let ' em alone and do nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd amind to . And then we 'd go home and Mr. Kendle would come in and talk the matter over , and read some great long letters from Mr. Van Buren , and get the President so confused that he would lose all patience a most . But Mr. Kendle is the master feller to hang on that ever I see ; he 's equal to the tooth ache . And he talked and palavered with the President till he finally brought him over , and then the President put his foot down , and said the deposits should be moved whether or no . And then the botheration was to see who should move ' em . The President told Mr. Duane to do it ; but he said his conscience would n't let him . Then the President told Mr. Taney to take Mr. Duane 's place , and see if his conscience would let him . Mr. Taney tried it and found his conscience went easy enough , so Mr. Duane packed up and went home to Philadelphy . We were all dreadful sorry to loose Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see one in a thousand . It 's a pity he had such a stiff conscience ; he might have staid here in the Treasury jest as well as not , it it had n't been for that . But this storm about the Bank begins to blow over , and the President 's got in a manner cooled down again . This morning after breakfast we took the papers and letters jest as we used to , and went away into the east room to read the news and chat awhile ; and it really did my heart good to see the President set down once more looking so good natured in his great arm chair smoking his segar . After I had read over the news to him awhile , and got him in pretty good humour , I made bold to out with it , and says I Gineral , there 's one question I want to ask you .  --  And says he , you know Major , I always allow you to ask me any thing you 're a mind to , what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here about a fortnight ago , you begun to say something about me and Daniel ; and jest as you got into the middle of it , Mr. Kendle came in and broke it right off short as a pipe stem . It 's been running in my head ever since , and I 've been half crazy to know what it was you was going to say . Well , let us see , says the Gineral , where was it I felt off ; for this everlasting fuss about the Bank has kept my head so full I ca n't seem to remember much about it . Why says I , you was talking about nullification ; how the tops were beat down a little , but the roots were all running about under ground as live as ever , and it would n't be long before they 'd be sprouting up again all over the country , and there 'd be a tougher scrabble to keep ' em down than ever there had been yet ; and then you said if I and Daniel  --  and there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him now when I think of it , and broke it right off . Ah , now I remember , says the Gineral , how ' t was . Well , says he , Major Downing , it is a solemn fact , this country is to see a blacker storm of nullification before many years comes about than ever it has seen yet ; the clouds are beginning to gather now ; I 've seen ' em rolling over South Carolina , and hanging about Georgia , and edging along into old Virginny , and I see the storm 's a gathering ; it must come , and if there is n't somebody at the helm that knows how to steer pretty well , the old ship must go down . I ai nt afraid , says he , but what I can keep her up while I have the command , but I 'm getting to be old and must give up soon , and then what 'll become of her I do nt know . But what I was going to say was this ; I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would put your heads together and take charge of her till the storm has blown over , you might save her . And I do nt know who else can . But how do you mean , Gineral , says I ? Why to speak plain , says he , if nullification shows its head . Daniel must talk and you must fight . There 's nothing else will do the job for it that I know of . Daniel must go into the Presidential chair , and you must take command of the army , and then things will go straight . At this I was a little struck up ; and I looked him right in the eye . and , says I , Gineral , do you mean that Daniel Webster ought to be President after you give up ? Certainly , says he , if you want to keep the country out of the jaws of nullification . But , says I , Gineral , Daniel is a federalist , a Hartford Convention federalist , and I should like to know which is worst , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jaws of a fiddle-stick ! said the President , starting up and throwing his segar out of the window as much as two rods ; but how do you know , Major Downing , that Daniel is a federalist ? Because , says I , I 've heard him called so down east more than a hundred times . And that 's jest all you know about it , says he . Now I tell you how ' t is , Major Downing , Daniel is as thorough a republican as you be , or as I be , and has been ever since my Proclamation came out against nullification . As soon as that Proclamation came out Daniel came right over on to the republican ground and took it upon his shoulder and carried it through thick and thin where no other man in the country could have carried it . Says I , Gineral , is that a fact ? And says he yes , you may depend upon it , ' t is every word truth . Well says I , that alters the case a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor of the Portland Courier and see what they think of it , and if they think it 's best to have Daniel for President we 'll have him in , and I 'll take my turn afterwards : for seeing the people are bent upon having me for President I wont decline , though if it is thought best that I should wait a little while , I wont be particular about that . I 'm willing to do that which will be best for the country . So I remain your loving friend , MAJOR JACK DOWNING . LETTER LX .

Argument BANK REPORT . Letter To the Editor of the New York Daily Advertiser . Major Downing 's Official Report on the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1833 . Dear Sir ,  --  I have jest got here after examinin the Bank ; and it was the toughest job , ever I had in my life . The Gineral was so bent on my doing it , that I had to go ahead , ' or I 'd sneak 'd out the first day . I was nigh upon a week about it , figerin and siferin all the while . Mr. Biddle see quick enuf it was no fool 's journey I come on ; and I made some of his folks scratch their heads , I tell you . I gin ' em no notice of my comin , and I jump 'd right in the thickest on ' em there one day , when they were tumblin in and shellin out the munny like corn . Now , ' says I , my boys , I advise all on ye to brush up your multiplication tables , for I am down upon you with alligation , and the rule of three , and vulgar fractions ; and if I find a penny out of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green horn , nor member of Congress , nor Judge Clayton , nor Mr. Cambreleng , neither , ' says I. As soon as Mr. Biddle read the letter the Gineral sent by me , says he , Major , I m glad the Gineral has sent some one at last that knows something , and can give a strait account , ' and with that he called all the Bank folks , and tell 'd ' em to bring their books together . Now , ' says he , Major , which eend shall we begin at first . ' It makes no odds which , ' says I , all I care about is to see if both eends meet ; and if they do n't , Mr. Biddle , ' says I , it 's all over with you and the Bank  --  you 'll all go , hook and line , '  --  and then we off coats and went at it . I found some of them are fellers there plagy sharp at siferin . They 'd do a sum by a kinder short Dilworth quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes kinder natural to me ; and I chalk 'd her off there the first day and figur 'd out nigh upon 100 pretty considerable tuf sums . There was more than three cart load of books about us , and every one on ' em bigger than the Deacon 's family Bible . And sich an etarnal batch of figerin I never see , and there was n't a blot or scratch in the whole on ' em I put a good many questions to Mr. Biddle , for the Gineral gin me a long string on ' em ; and I thought some would stagger him , but he answered them all jest as glib as our boys in Downingville do the catakize , from the chief eend of man , ' clean through the petitions  --  and he did it all in a mighty civil way too , ther was only one he kinder tried to git round , and that was  --  how he came to have so few of the Gineral 's folks among the Directors until very lately ? Why , ' says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he got up and took a pinch of snuff and offered me one ) says he , Major , the Bank knows no party ; and in the first go off , you know , the Gineral 's friends were all above matters of so little importance as Banks and Banking . If we had but a branch in Downingville , ' says he . the Gineral would not have had occasion to ask such a question , ' and with that he made me a bow ; and I went home and took dinner with him . It is plagy curious to hear him talk about millions and thousands ; and I got as glib too at it as he is ; and how on earth I shall get back agin to ninepences and four-pence-happenies , I ca n't tell . Arter I had been figerin away there nigh upon a week , and used up four or five slate pencils , and spit my mouth as dry as a cob , rubbin out the sums as last as I did them , I writ to the Gineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find no mistake ; but so long as the Bank was at work , it was pretty much like counting a flock of sheep in a fall day when they are jest let into a new stubble , for it was all the while crossing and mixing , and the only way was , to lock up all the Banks , and as fast as you can count e 'm black their noses . Now , ' says I one day to Squire Biddle , I 'll jest a look at your moneys bags , for they tell the Gineral you han ' got stuff enuf in the Bank to make him a pair of spectacles ; none of your rags , ' says I , but the real grit ; ' and with that he call 'd two or three chaps in Quaker coats , and they opened a large place about as big as the east room ' and sich a sight I never see  --  boxes , bags and kags , all full , and should say nigh upon a hundred cord . Says I , Squire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I am stumped . ' O , ' says he , Major , ' that 's our Safety Fund . ' How you talk ! ' says I. Now , says I , is that all genwine ? ' Every dollar of it , ' says he . Will you count it , Major ? ' says he . Not to day , ' says I ; but as the Gineral wants me to be particular , I 'll jest hussle some ' em ; ' and at it I went , hammer and file . It raly did mo good , for I did not think there was so much real chink in all creation . So when I got tired , I set down on a pile , and took out my wallet , and begun to count over some of the safety fund ' notes I got shaved with on the grand tower . Here , ' says I , Squire Biddle , I have a small trifle I should like to barter with you ; it 's all " safety fund , " ' says I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of ' em . ' But as soon as he put his eye on ' em , he shook his head . I see he had his eye teeth cut . Well , ' says I , it 's no matter ; ' but it lifted my dander considerable . Now , ' says I , Mr. Biddle , I 've got one more question to put to you and then I 'm through . You say your bills are better than the hard dollars ; this puzzles me , and the Gineral too . Now , how is this ? ' Well , ' says he , Major , I 'll tell you : Suppose you had a bushel of potatoes at Downingville , and you wanted to send them to Washington , how much would it cost to get them there ? ' Well , says I , about two shillins lawful  --  for I sent a barrel there to the Gineral , last fall , and that cost me a dollar freight . ' Well , ' say , suppose I 've got potatoes in Washington jest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Downingville , and give you an order to receive a bushel of potatoes in Washington , would n't you save two shillins lawful by that ? We sometimes charge , ' says he , a trifle for drafts , when the places are distant , but never as much as it would cost to carry the dollars , ' and with that we looked into the accounts agin , and there it was . Says I , Squire Biddle , I see it now as clear as a whistle . ' When I got back to Washington , I found the Gineral off to the Rip Raps , ' and so I after him . One feller there tell 'd me I could'nt go to the Rip Raps  --  that the Gineral was there to keep off business ; but as soon as I told him who I was , he ordered a boat and I paddled off . The Gineral and I have talked over all the Bank business ; he says it is not the best to publish my report , as he wants it for the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agin in Wall Street . I made him stare when I tell 'd him about the dollars I saw there ; and once and awhile he would rinkle his face up like a ball of ravilins ; and when I tell 'd him Biddle would n't give me any of his Safety Fund ' for any of Mr. Van Buren 's that I had with me , the Gineral took out his wallet , and slung it more than five rods into the brakers . We are now purtty busy , fittin and jointin the beams and rafters of the message ; and if Mr. Van Buren do nt get back before we begin to shingle it , I guess that his Safety Fund will stand but a poor chance . The Gineral do n't care much about having his head for a sign board , but says he , Major , when they put my head on one eend of a Bank Bill , and Mr. Van Buren 's on tother eend , and " promise to pay Andrew Jackson , " and then blow up , it 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . ' The Gineral says , if he allows Amos Kendle to make his report about the State Banks , it is but fair to let me publish mine about Square Biddle 's Bank . So I am getting mine ready . We have a fine cool time here , and ai n't bothered with Office seekers ; we can see ' em in droves all along shore , waitin for a chance . One fellow swam off last night to get appointed to some office  --  the Gineral thinks of making him minister to the King of the Sandwich Islands , on account of their being all good swimmers there . Yours , J DOWNING . Major , Downingville Militia , 2d Brigade . LETTER LXII . Argument Giving some account of Peleg Bissel 's Churn . Letter - Aug , 17 , 1833. - To the Editor of the New York Daily Advertiser My Good Friend .  --  " The Government " will leave here on Saturday , so you must tell all our friends to stop sending any more letters here . We go strate to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and the Gineral have got things now pretty considerable ssnug ; and it is raly curious to see how much more easy and simple all the publick affairs go on than they did a spell ago , when Mr. Adams was President . If it warnt for Congress meetin we cou 'd jest go about pretty much where we pleased , and keep things strate too ; and I begin to think now with the Gineral , that ater all , there is no great shakes in managin the affairs of the nation . We have pretty much all on us been joggin about now since last grass ; and things are jest as strate and clear now as they was then . The Gineral has nigh upon made up his mind , that there is no use to have any more Congress . They only bothers  --  they wou 'd do more good to stay at home , and write letters to us tellin what is goin on among ' em at home . It would save a considerable sum of money too ; and I ' m also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages that do nt earn nothin . Howsoever , we are goin on makin things more simple every day , and we once and a while nock off a pretty considerable number of cogg wheels and trunnel heads . The Gineral says he likes things simple as a mouse trap . But what I like most is , he wont have no one about him who outranks me , so there is me and Major Barry , and Major Smith , and Major Earl , and Major Donaldson , and Major Lewis , and Major Eaton ;  --  and the major part of a purty considerable of a man to do the rinting and tell the folks where we be , and once and a while where the land sales and contracts be too . There is a enuff on us to do all that 's wanted . Every day jest after breakfast , the Gineral lights his pipe , and begins to think purty hard , and I and Major Donaldson begin to open letters for him ; and there is more than three bushels every day , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bushel a day ; and never trouble long ones , unless they come from Mr. Van Buren , or Mr. Kindle , or some other of our great folks . Then we sort ' em out , jest as Zekel Bigelow does the mackerel at his Packin Yard , for tho ' there are plagy many more sorts than he finds among fish , we only make three sorts , and keep three big baskets , one marked not red , ' another red , and worth nothin , ' and another red and to be answered . ' And then all the Gineral has to do is to say , Major , I reckon we best say so and so to that , ' and I say jest so , ' or not , as the notion takes me  --  and then we go at it . We keep all the Secretaries , and the Vice President , and some District Attorneys , and a good many more of our folks , and Amos Kindle , moving about ; and they tell us jest how the cat jumps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress meetin once a year , we 'd put the Government in a one horse wagon and go jest where we liked . The Gineral was amazingly tickled t' other day . Peleg Bissel  --  ( you know Peleg , who is all the while whitlin , and sawin , and makin clocks , and apple parers , and churns , and lives nigh Seth Sprague 's School house , down to Downingville , ) well Peleg sent the Gineral a new churn of his own invention ; and he calls it the Jackson Churn , ' he wants a patent for it . The cute critur says , in his letter to the Gineral , that that are churn is jest like his government  --  its only got one wheel , and a smasher ; and that it will make more butter than any other churn , and out of eny most any thing . The Gineral is so well pleased with it , he will set and turn it nearly all day . Says he , Major , I like this ere churn amazingly , that Bissel is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , it would have more than fifty wheels and springs , and make no more butter ater all . Major , ' says he , tell Peleg I thank him ; and send him a patent . ' And so I did ; and I telled him in the letter , that the Gineral would keep his churn in the hall of the white house , to let folks see that it did n't require as many cogwheels to make butter as they think on , and then when they come up chamber , in the Cabinet Room , and find ony me and the President , they 'll understand it the better . When the Gineral come to sign this letter , well , ' says he , Major , that 's just what I was thinkin on . We get every day an everlastin bach of letters from Mr. Van Buren and Amos Kindle , and they are so plagy jagged , that we cant make ' em fit exactly with some others , eny most as jagged , from the South and West , and all from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wants t' other . Some of our folks down South say , if the Bank is put down , we shall all be split up into splinters there . And jest so , ony t' other way , they say , we shant find in a week any of our folks north if the Bank is rechartered , and some talk of the Nullifiers in Georgia going for Mr. Van Buren , and that we must look out sharp , and not do nothin agin ' em . And some say that are tower of Mr. Webster away West , and his speeches , bother some on ' em plagily . I was a little stumped for a spell myself ; and I tell 'd the Gineral , says I , Gineral , if you expect me to satisfy all these folks , you 're mistaken , we cant do it , ' says I.  --  Well then , ' says he , we must send for Mr. Van Buren . ' This kinder nettled me , and says I , Gineral , you ha'nt forgot that are churnal ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll stick to that Major . ' Well then , ' says I do you think that Mr. Van Buren will use that are churn ? he keeps his bread buttered , ' says I , by more wheels than that are churn 's got . ' Well Major , ' says the Gineral , he is a plagy curious critter , ater all  --  he 'll make wheels turn sometimes right agin one another , yet he gits along  --  and when he lets his slice fall , or some one nocks it out of his hand , it always somehow falls butter side up '  --  well , ' says I , Gineral , do nt you know why ? ' not exactly , ' says he , Major '  --  well , ' says I ,  --  I 'll tell you  --  he butters both sides at once , ' says I. The Gineral drew his face all into a rumple for about a minute , and then he snorted right out . The Gineral talks of goin to the Hermitage next spring  --  he says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think so too  --  he says I may go along with him or stay and lend Mr. Van Buren a hand  --  we 'll say something about this in the Message . Yours as before , J. DOWNING , Major . Downingville Militia , 2d Brigade . LETTER LXIII . Argument The Public Crib at Washington . Letter - August 30 , 1833. - To Mr. Dwight  --  New York Daily Advertiser My good old Friend ,  --  Ever since we got the Government ' back here from the Rip Raps , we have been as busy as if we was all on us cocking hay jist afore a shower . I tell 'd you some time ago that I and the gineral was fittin and jointin the beams and rafters of the message , but almost every day some plaguy new motion comes in from Mr. Van Buren , and some other of our folks , and we have to chizzle new mortises , and run new braces and string pieces , so that I begin to think it will look curious enuf when its done . The gineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is determined to show a sharp corner to the nullifiers . We shall have a good deal to say about the Grand Tower ; there is nothin since the 8th of January at New Orleans tickles the gineral half so much . Every time we talk about it , the gineral gits right up , and says he , Major , I only wish I was fifty years younger , and then , ' says he , give me the yankees east of Horse Neck , and I 'd like no better sport than to have nullification all over the rest of creation . ' When things do nt go right , and the gineral gits a little wrathy , if I only tell him the yankees are ready to back him , he is as firm as granite . It would make you crawl all over to read that letter we writ to France , when we come to hear that the king there kinder suffled round that bill we drawed on him . He wont pay it , wont he ? ' Says he  --  Major , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' says I , Gineral , I think its a nasty mean action  --  and a rascally one too , ' says I. Well , ' says he , that 's enuff , '  --  and then we writ the letter ,  --  its jest like Zekel Bigelow 's speech  --  it cuts , shaves , and makes the hair fly  --  and if it do nt bring the money , I 'm mistaken . If Mr. Livingston had stayd one week longer in York , the gineral was for sendin me right out . The most curious part of the government ' here , is to manage the office seekers . You see , things ai nt now as they was afore Mr. Van Buren 's time , then it was kinder divided around among the departments . The post-master gineral appointed all the post-masters and their folks . The secretary of the treasury appointed all the folks in the custom-houses , and all folks who collected money . These two had an everlastin batch of fellers to appint , and made them feel pretty considerable big , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadets , and Ingen agents , and all the contracts was kinder sifted round among the departments ; and so by the time a new president was to be made , some of these secretaries was a leetle bigger than the president himself . Now this is the way they kinder jockied Mr. Adams , who got to be the smallest man at Washington , by lettin other folks plant his corn , and do his huskin ; and afore he knowd it , his own field was all in weeds  --  and theirs well howed , rich and clean as a whistle . But things ai nt so now , w 've got ony one crib , and that 's a whapping one too , and ony one door to it ; and when we shell out our corn , we take good care and know well who gets it , and where he is going to plant it ; and that ai nt all  --  we make ' em agree about the Huskin Frolic , for that 's the best ont after all . The longer I am in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must allow that of all the inventions I 've hearn on of Mr. Van Buren 's , this is about the slickest . There is ony one thing wantin , and that he is tryin for pretty hard  --  and that is the bank . If he can ony get that in the crib too , Virginy fences would n't stop our cattle . Ony think what an everlastin raft of fellows we should have  --  all the presidents and cashiers , and clerks , and money counters , about the crib , from Downingville to New Orleans !  --  and that ai nt the best ont ; we would have a branch alongside every postoffice to keep our postages safe . I should like this well enuf I was sartin I and the gineral and Mr. Van Buren was to be here all the while , to keep a good look out on the crib door . But the gineral talks of going hum to put the Hermitage to rights ; and I am in the notion that congress is a leetle too strong for the government ' when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . I am eny most fag 'd out myself , and I begin to think with the gineral , I have done enuf for the country . We are lookin for Amos Kindle now every hour . He writ the gineral tother day , and teld him my Bank Report ' war n't true , and that I must have got a loan of Squire Biddle . Now that 's jist the way with some folks . What they do nt know they guess at ; and it 's jest so with old Miss Crane , who keeps the tavern this side Downingville  --  jist as sure as any one goes by without stopping , the old critur says , There goes so and so , and has got no money , too , and he knows I would n't trust him . ' Howsumever , no one can make the gineral rathy with me . He knows I am the best friend about him ; whenever they gets things in any kind of a twist or a snarl , says he , Major , do you unravel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smasher , ' says he ; and then we jist give Peleg Bissel 's churn a turn or two and all is right . You do n't print my letters right  --  you git some words wrong and spell ' em bad . Jist so the printers sarved the gineral 's letters too ; and folks thought he did n't know nothin , till we got to Cambridge , where they made a doctor on him . Your friend , J. DOWNING . Major , Downingville Militia , 2d Brigade . Footnotes The major , we presume , means the elections , or Hustings , by this metaphor . LETTER LXIV . Argument Preparation of the Message . Letter - 2d Nov. 1833. - The Congressmen are jest beginnin to arrive here , and I suppose in a short time we shall have them here as thick as huckleberries ; and the Gineral is brushin round now , and says the Message must be finished and painted off hand , and we are all as busy as bees in gittin it dove tailed together ; and after next week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the first message I ever had any hand in ; and tho ' I say it , I guess you will say it is about as complete a thing as ever was sent express any where . I have been to work on it ever since we was at the Rip-Raps ; and tho ' it has been sometimes all pulled to bits , to git in some notions we did n't think on , yet it will look pritty slick , I tell you when it 's done ; and we will lay on paint enuf to kiver up all the cracks and seams . We shall give a pritty good lick at the Bank , and wo n't leave as much on ' t standing as would make a good sized oven . It is curius now to see how easy it is to build up , or nock all to bits , any thing on paper . Now jest see about the Bank . There it stands in Chestnut street , with its hundred cord of specie , and its cart load of books ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and full of clarks , and directors , and folks in Europe . and all about creation dealin with it ; and the brokers in Wall street all busy about it ; and Biddle 's bills goin about , and most folks thinkin they are better than hard dollars ; and all the old men and women holdin the stock , supposin it will go up agin as high as they paid for it ; and I and the Gineral , and Amos Kindle , and Mr. Van Buren , talkin over it ; and one line in the Message nocks it all into kindlin wood . For you see when The Government ' says a thing must be jest so ! there is no help for it . We ca n't stand to chat about trifles . The Gineral has smashed three pipes the last time we talked about it . Biddle and the Bank must be smashed , ' says he , Major ; '  --  and so smash they go , Congress or no Congress . The next thing was the Ingins . Here the Gineral is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I never did like an Ingin , and never can . The Cherokees give us a good deal of trouble in Georgia last year ; but the Gineral took sides with Georgia , because he had a good many friends there , and Mr. Van Buren had too ; for that State was the ony one that nominated him Vice President a spell ago ; and if he had got in there , and Mr. Crawford President , who was ailin all over with some plaguy appleplexy  --  I and the Gineral would never have been hearen on arterwards . But no matter .  --  The Gineral says he did n't make that treaty with the Cherokees ; and it was made so long ago , he has enymost forgot it : and treaties oughtent to last forever . But this treaty with the Creeks in Alabama he did make , and he knows all about it ; and he means to stand by it , and turn all the squatters off the land in Alabama , jest as they wanted him to do in Georgia ; but he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you ; and you do nt know nothing about it in York . But the Gineral is tickled to death about it ; and as soon as he saw the Proclamation of the Governor of Alabama , you never see a critur so spruced up as the Gineral was . Major , says he , we shall have another Nullification this Congress , after all . You need ' t say much about it , says he , in the Message ,  --  we 'll keep that for a Proclamation . Well , says I , Gineral , you are a master hand at gettin into trouble . But , says he , Major , ai nt I a master one in gittin out of one , says he ? We 've got an old trunk up chamber full of troubles  --  old Laws , and Treaties , and Contracts , and State Claims ; and whenever we want any powder , all we 've got to do is to open that , and look among old papers and get up a row in no time . The Gineral likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the labor falls on me , and the ony way I can git rid of it , is to make our folks down stairs do it , if I see it gives any of ' em a boost with his party  --  for I do nt care nothin about any thing here but the Gineral ; and if I can git him threw this Congress , its pretty much all I care about , and he too ; for after that I 'm goin with him to the Hermitage , for I expect by that time there wont be much more left of us than our beards and shoe strings .

Argument The Major 's account of the Hubbub at Washington about the Bank .  --  Some further particulars about the Major and Daniel .  --  And sundry matters respecting Nullification , and South Carolina . Letter From the Portland Courier of Saturday . - Sept. 30 , 1831. - My dear Friend ,  --  Have you n't been in a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , to know what the President was going to say about me and Daniel ? If you have n't , I have . I never felt so uneasy for a fortnight hardly in my life . If I went to bed I could n't sleep , and I 've got up and walked the floor as much as half the night almost every night since . I 've wished the Bank to Guinea more than fifty times , for there 's been such a hubbub here about the Bank this fortnight past , that I could n't get a moment 's chance to talk with the President about any thing else . We 'd have cabinet meetings once in awhile to see about moving the deposits , and Mr. Duane and Mr. Cass and Mr. MLean would talk up to the President so about it , that he 'd conclude to let ' em alone and doo nothing about it , and let Congress manage it jest as they 'd amind to . And then we 'd go home and Mr. Kendle would come in and talk the matter over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buren , and get the President so confused that he would lose all patience a most . But Mr. Kendle is the master feller to hang on that ever I see ; he 's equal to the tooth ache . And he talked and palaver 'd with the President till he finally brought him over , and then the President put his foot down and said the deposits should be moved whether or no . And then the botheration was to see who should move ' em . The President told Mr. Duane to do it ; but he said his conscience would n't him .  --  Then the President told Mr. Taney to take Mr. Duane 's place , and see if his conscience would let ' em . Mr. Taney tried it and found his conscience went easy enough , so Mr. Duane packed up and went home to Philadelphia . We were all dreadful sorry to lose Mr. Duane , for he was a nice man as you would see one in a thousand . It 's pity he had such a stiff conscience ; he might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had n't been for that . But this storm about the Bank begins to blow over , and the President 's got in a manner cooled down again . This morning after breakfast we took the papers and letters jest as we used to , and went away into the east room to read the news and chat awhile ; and it really did my heart good to see the President set down once more looking so good natured in his great arm chair , smoking his segar . After I had read over the news to him awhile , and got him in pretty good humor , I made bold to out with it , and says I , Gineral , there 's one question that I want to ask you . And says he , you know , Major , I always allow you to ask me any thing you 're a mind to , what is it ? Well , says I , when we had that talk here about a fortnight ago , you began to say something about me and Daniel ; and jest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kendle came in and broke it right off short as a pipe stem . It 's been running in my head ever since , and I 've been half crazy to know what it was you was going to say . Well , let us see , says the Gineral , where was it I left off ; for this everlasting fuss about the Bank has kept my head so full I ca n't seem to remember much about it . Why says I , was you talking about nullification ; how the tops were beat down a little , but the roots were all running about under ground as live as ever , and it would n't be long before they 'd be sprouting up again all over the country , and there 'd be a tougher scrabble to keep ' em down than ever there had been yet ; and then you said if I and Daniel  --  and there that plaguy Kendle came in , I 've no patience with him now when I think of it , and broke it right off . Ah , now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , says he , Major Downing , it is a solemn fact , this country is to see a blacker storm of nullification before many years comes about , than ever it has yet ; the clouds are beginning to gather now ; I 've seen ' em rolling over South Carolina , and hanging about Georgia , and edging along into old Virginny , and I see the storm 's a gathering ; it must come , and if there is n't somebody at the helm that knows how to steer pretty well , the old ship must go down . I ai nt afraid , says he , but what I can keep her up while I have the command , but I 'm getting to be old and must give up soon , and then what 'll become of her , I do n't know .  --  But what I was going to say was this ; I 've been thinking if you and Daniel , after I give up , would put your heads together and take charge of her till the storm has blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt know who else can . But how do you mean , Gineral , says I ? Why to speak plain , says he , if nullification shows its head , Daniel must talk and you must fight . There 's nothing else will do the job for it that I know of . Daniel must go into the Presidential chair , and you must take command of the army , and then things will go straight . At this I was a little struck up and I looked him right in the eye , and says I , Gineral , do you mean that Daniel Webster ought to be President after you give up ? Certainly , says he , if you want to keep the country out of the jaws of nullification . But , says I Gineral , Daniel is a federalist , a Hartford Convention federalist , and I should like to know which is worst , the jaws of nullification , or the jaws of federalism .  --  The jaws of a fiddle-stick ! says he ; but how do you know , Major Downing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've heard him called so down east more than a hundred times , over and over . And that 's jest all you know about it , says he . Now I tell you how ' t is , Major Downing , Daniel is as thorough a republican as you be , or as I be , and has been ever since my Proclamation came out against the nullification . As soon as that Proclamation came out Daniel came right over on to the republican ground and took it upon his shoulder and carried it through thick and thin where no other man in the country would have carried it . Says I , Gineral , is that a fact ? And says he yes , you may depend upon it , ' t is every word truth . Well says I , that alters the case a little , and I 'll write to Uncle Joshua and the editor of the Portland Courier and see what they think of it , and if they think it 's best to have Daniel for President we 'll have him in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people are bent upon having me for President I wont decline , though if it is thought best that I should wait a little while , I wont be particular about that . I 'm willing to do that which will be best for the country . So I remain your loving friend , MAJOR JACK DOWNING . LETTER LXVI. - 4th Dec. 1833. - My last letter tell 'd you that the Message I had been to work on for some time was jest finished  --  but the very next day we had to take it all to bits , and spring to and write enymost the hull of a new one , for we found we had gone too much into particulars , especially about the counts ; and letters from Mr. Van Buren , advised us to say as little about such matters as possible , for Congress would only make us tell pretty much the hull o n't over agin  --  and the best way was to say little at first , and trust to luck and chance afterwards . As soon as the Gineral came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must look out and keep in that latin about the Bank any how . ' So we kept that in , but it was plagy troublesome to make it work well with the rest o n't , for when you come to make English o n't , it reads that the Gineral would have taken the Bank by the throat right off , if he thought he could make that latin pill operate afore the charters expire  --  and then agin he says the Bank does wrong in bringing its business to a close so rapidly as it is now doing . There is one thing however that 's true enuf , for seein that Judge Marshall is a stubborn know nothin kind of critur , and would have a finger in givin the Bank that pill the Gineral speaks of it in latin , I do n't believe it would have operated before the charter expired , if it had 40 years more to run  --  so there is more wit and cunnin in what the Gineral says than folks think for . There was another thing puzzled us tu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it had no rale chink in it , the Gineral thought best to take the deposits away from it , but since I tell 'd the Gineral in my Bank report there was more than a hundred cords of the rale grit , we had to say in the Message they had too much The post office accounts was the next bother ; and that puzzled all on us peskily . But we got round that by very lucky discovery ; and you see by the Message there has been an error in keepin the counts in the post office ever since General Washington 's time , and every post master Gineral , up to Major Barry 's time , never found it out ; and it was so curious that he took nigh upon five years to git at it . But its all clear now , for he is an amazin shark fellow at siferin . We struck out all about the grand tower , for Clay has been over the same ground , and Mr. Van Buren thought it was best to say nothin about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nullifiers , for some of Mr. Van Buren 's friend 's in Georgia headid by Crawford are gettin up nullification there , worse than Calhoun 's last winter ; and it maks all the difference in the world when you come to see that ones own friends are doin what our enemies did afore . As soon as we sent the Message to Congress , we set about gittin up a supper for all our folks who had been to work out , and we had a grand time , all our Majors was there . The Gineral was so beat out , he did n't stay long ; but some on ' em kept it up all nigh day light . We had some rale good songs tu ; and one of our Majors is a plagy sharp singer . I got a copy of one on ' em ; but I haint got time now to send you the hull on o n't , so I 'll jest give you 3 verses only . Come comrades one and all Here assembled in the hall Let us sing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything at stake , And our fortunes yet to make , And the public good is now-a-days " a hum . " Times past have all gone by And old laws are " all my eye " The present and the future we are sure in When the Gineral 's time is up , We 'll fill again the cup , And drink to Amos Kindle and Van Buren . We have no one to thank For a discount at the Bank , Since we 've got the public money from Nick Biddle And as we alone have ernt it We 'll use it as we want it Security is now all fiddle diddle . I wish you would tell folks to stop callin me Jack Downing  --  t was well enuf when I wasnt quite as much up in the world a I now be , and it was jest so with Mr. Van Buren  --  folks would keep callin him " Mat ; " but it warnt right , and it ai nt good manners nuther . And there is another thing I do nt like ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai nt asham 'd of any letter I ever did write ) and that is printin in a Book all the Letters I first writ , and mixing up other Letters and Sam Patch , and callin some of my Letters to you counterfits . As soon as I get the Gineral threw this Congress , I 'll turn tu and get my Letters all together that I writ to you , beginnin with the grand tow'r . Major Earl is drawn my likeness , and the Gineral 's and Mr. Van Buren 's and the most of our folks for me . He is a master hand at it ; and Zekil Bigelow tells me if I 'll give him the copyright , he 'll new shingle our old barn for nothin . How comes on your book about the Hartford convention ? The Gineral wants you to send him a copy o n't as soon as it is done  --  he wants to see how nigh Yankee Nullification comes to Nullification now-a-days . Yours , &c.; J. DOWNING , Major , Downingville Militia , 2d Brigade . LETTER LXVII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of the Bank , the currency , his cabinet , the proclamation , Messrs . Clay , Taney , and other matters . Letter - Dec. 14 , 1833. - We have got business enuf now on our hands , I tell you ; and nigh upon every day we have a squall that brings all hands to the helm . We have had fair wind so long , that few on us know exactly how to steer now a days , when every wind comes right in our teeth . I hai n't had my coat off since congress met ; and the gineral says we must watch them fellows closely . " Keep a sharp look out , Major , " says he , " on Clay  --  he is a bold , independent fellow , and will speak out his notions if the devil stands at the door ; and if he had the people with him , " says the gineral , " as I have , there is no tellin what trouble he would give us ; make as good a gineral as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with power . " " Very well , " says I , " gineral  --  but plague o n't , " says I , " the critur some how keeps law on his side all the while . " " That 's true enuf , " says the gineral , " and therefore we must keep a sharper eye on him , and the time is come , now Major , when we must all on us try our popularity  --  for when the law is agin us , we sha n't have nothin else to stand on . There is nothin , " says the gineral , " like war times , Major  --  for then , when those troublesome fellows talk about law , I ' give ' em Martial Law , and that makes short work ont . " Just ater breakfast yesterday , I and the gineral had a high time together . I had been expectin every day to see the bank come out with a reply ; and I tell 'd the gineral , says I , Gineral , I 'm afraid we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will nock us all into kindlin wood . But he kept sayin there was no fear of that . Why , ' says he , Major you forgit that we first give the bank a most mortal weltin 3 years ago and left em no other defence than to print reports , and speeches ; and that show 'd they had n't much spunk ; and we have been criplin on em ever since . And when I see they began to stagger , I give em our hull battery , and opened upon em in flank , front , and rear our sharp shooters headed by that amazin cute little district attorney open 'd first on em . Then come my proclamation  --  and then my message  --  and then Mr. Tany 's report  --  and the globe all the while throwin shells and rockets . Why ' says the gineral  --  gittin up and taken his hickory , and givin it a whack on the floor  --  if the bank stands all that racket , Major , its tuffer than a pepperage log . " No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fear that the bank will ever say a word in reply  --  it 's as dead now , " says the gineral , " as a skin 'd racoon . " And the words want out of his mouth , afore in come a hull bundle of letters and newspapers , and the first thing I see among ' em was the " Bank reply . " " Now , " says I , " gineral , here 's trouble !  --  here 's the very thing , " says I , " I 've been afraid of all the while . ' The gineral laft a spell ; and says he , " Major , suppose you and I now jist take a bout , and you 'll see how easy I can nock that reply into nothin . " " Well , " says I , " Gineral , " its a bargain  --  " Now , " says I , let us sit down , and you may take , says I , the globe or our district attorney 's report , or your proclamation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on em ,  --  or , says I , come to think o n't , you may take ' em all together ,  --  for they are pretty much all one  --  and I 'll take this Bank reply , ' and then let 's see what kind of a fight it will turn out . Well , ' says the gineral , you are a man of spunk , Major , and I like you for it : if I make a prisoner on you , I 'll treat you like a brave soldier . ' And so will I you , Gineral , ' says I , and if you fall in the fight , ' says I , Gineral , I 'll bury you , ' says I , with the honors of war , and then we shook hands . Now , Major , says the gineral , as I am to begin the fight , do n't you fire till I fire , " and then we 'll go threw , shot by shot . " Well , says I , " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back your shot , if they miss me , and I can pick em up ? " " O , yes , " says the gineral , " that 's fair in war . Use the enemy 's shot and shells , and guns too , if you can , Major  --  that 's the true art of war . " The gineral all the while kept fixing his papers all in a string on one side the table . He put his own messages and proclamation in the middle , and flank 'd off with our district attorney and Mr. Tany 's reports ; and then he sifted the Globe about , and called them scouts and foragers  --  " There , " says he , " Major , I am now nearly ready ; and he took off his specks , and gin em a good rubbin , and put em on again . " Now , Major , " says he , " take your station . " And I went round tother side , and sat down . " Are you ready , " says the gineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it we went . The gineral , he open 'd his fire first , as agreed , and he fir 'd away from his first message  --  And then his 2d  --  then he took the Globe , and then the reports ,  --  and he blaz 'd away like all wrath , for an hour ; and as soon as he stop 'd to take breath . " Now , " says I , " its my time , "  --  and I read the reply a spell , and answered all he said in three minits . And I gin him a look ! The gineral twisted his face most shockin , and scratched his head too . But he went at it agin as spunky as ever ; for he is an amazin tuff critur in a fight , and hangs on like a snappin turtle when he gits hold . He banged away a spell agin like all natur ; and jest as he took his specs off to give em a rub , I gin him the reply agin . The gineral gin his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to fire agin . Says he , " Major , that 's a sharp piece you are firin with there . " " It 's a peeler , " says I , " Gineral , I tell you  --  but you haint got the best o n't yet  --  it 's gettin warm , " says I. " Major , " says the gineral , " suppose we change butteries  --  let me take that reply , and you take all these documents . I like to fight , " says the gineral , " when there is ten to one agin me . " " So do I , " says I , " Gineral , and so we 'd better fight it out as we sit . " The gineral looked a spell at his paper again ; and says he , " Major , I reckon we had better have a truce . " " Not now , " says I , " I 've got my hand in now , and want to see the fight out . " " Well , " says the gineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to drive the executive ; " and with that he got up , and took off his specks , and put em in his pocket , and put on his hat , and took his hickory , and fetched a whack on the table ,  --  " Veto , " says he , " that 's enuff , " says I , " Gineral . " And now , ' says the Gineral , let 's go and take a walk  --  and so we went . The Gineral did n't say nothin for more than a mile , and I nother . So , to rights , ' says he , Major , every body says Money is very scarce . ' That 's true enuf , ' says I , and it 's not got as scarce as it will be afore winter is over , '  --  and then I tell 'd the Gineral the cause o n't . Well , ' says the Gineral , I believe you are right ; and if the worst comes to the worst , ' says he , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty agin , wont it ? '  --  Yes , ' says I , I suppose so ; but we ca n't git a new bank , Gineral , fore this ones time is out , and that 's nigh three years yet ; and long afore that time , ' says I , there will be trouble enuf , as this one must all the while be collectin in its own money ; and folks will fail , and be bankrupt ; and then twenty new banks will do no good . ' I do n't see that , ' says the Gineral . If we could make a new bank now , ' says I , right off , and let it take up the business of the old one , it would n't make much odds . But the law wont allow that , you know , Gineral . ' And just then the Gineral got in a way he has of twitchin with his suspender buttons behind ; and to rights he broke one off .  --  There , ' says he , Major , here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I , that 's a small matter  --  here is a tailor 's shop ,  --  let 's go in and make him put it on  --  and so in we went . The tailor happened to be one of our party , and was tickled to death to see the President , and thought he was goin to git an office right off , and was plagily cut down when he come to find it was ony a button off ; and so he jumped back on his board , and sat down on his heels agin , and said if the Gineral would take off his pantaloons he 'd put it on in a few minutes . I looked at the Gineral , and he looked at me  --  and we both looked at the tailor . Why , ' says the Gineral , this is the worst thing , Major , I ever met  --  I 'm stump 'd completely ! It will never do to risk walking home with this button off ; for if ' other one comes off , it 's all over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fellow puts on a button , I 'll kitch my death of cold ! look here Major , says the Gineral , that other button is takin all the strain , and it will come off in less than five minutes  --  what is to be done ? It seems to me Major , said the Gineral , that no man is placed so often in such real trouble as I am '  --  yes , ' says I , Gineral , but its fortunate for you , you always have me with you . ' I know it . Major , ' says he , and I hope you will be as true a friend now as ever you have been  --  and with that says I to the tailor , ' ca n't you fix things now , so as to get over all this trouble ? ' There is only one way , ' says the tailor , and that I 've stated , and another thing , ' says he , the Gineral wants a new pair . ' You rascal , ' says the Gineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that fits me better , if you try a month  --  these pantaloons , said the Gineral , are better than a new pair ; and if they only had new buttons here they would last me to my dying day .  --  It takes me weeks and months to git a pair to sit easy . I wont have a new pair , ' says the Gineral , that I 'm determin 'd on . ' I see , ' says the Gineral , what you are after  --  you want a new job . ' Well , ' says I , Gineral , let me try  --  and with that I wax 'd a thread , and got a new button ; and whilst the Gineral stood up , I sot down behind him , and stitched on the button in 3 minits  --  the Gineral all the while shakin his hickory at the tailor , and tellin him that he had no more brains in his head than he had in his thimble . You are a pretty fellow to belong to my party , ' says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , if I had taken your advice , ' says the Gineral . ' Let me ever ketch you at the White House agin . ' So to rights , the tailor got mad too , and said he did n't belong to the Gineral 's party  --  he was a **32;1921;TOOLONG ; he knew which side his bread was butter 'd , and I looked plagy knowin too  --  it was jest as much as I could do to keep the Gineral from smashin him  --  so says I , come , Gineral , let 's be movin ; and we went home  --  the Gineral all the while talkin about his escape from an awful state , that tailor was about getting him in . Well , ' says I , Gineral , little things sometimes give us a kink , and a notion of bigger ones ; and now , ' says I , do you know , Gineral , we are in a scrape now pretty much like that one we jest got out on . ' How so ? ' says the Gineral . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , ' says I , jest like your pantaloons , better than new ;  --  and only wants a new button ; and some of these tailors about us here want us to set shiverin and shakin , and runnin the risk of gettin a rheumatiz that will last us our lives , jest for them to get the job of makin a new one . ' And now , ' says I , I guess you and I had better disappoint ' em , as we did the tailor jest now , stitch on a new button , and things will all go smooth agin '  --  The Gineral did n't say a word ; but he got thinkin piagey hard , till we got home agin , and he got his pipe , and I got mine , and just as we were lighten em , says he , Major , there are some fellows about us here that pester me most desperately  --  we must all go as a Unit , ' or I must blow ' em all up and get a new set . W'ell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that , we cock 'd our feet on the mantle tree , and in less than five minits you could'nt see no more on us than our toes . Your Friend , J. DOWNING , Major . Downingville Militia , 2d Brigade . LETTER LXVIII . Argument The Major and the President again holds an important conversation on the affairs of the nation and how things should be conducted . The President calls the cabinet together , and the Major prepares a paper to to read to it which he afterwards has printed for the good of the nation . Letter - You know I 've ben tellin you long about my fears of many troubles  --  well it 's bad enuf  --  and is goin to be worse yet or I know nothin . And the Gineral is beginnin to think so too . All our folks about us here do nt feel it for they have all got fat offices  --  but I know the people feel it who haint got fat offices  --  and until they will speak up , things will go worse and worse  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I tell 'd the Gineral tother day , says I , Gineral we must look into this matter now I tell you  --  why says he Major the government ai nt to blame  --  every man about me says it ai nt his fault . Well , says I , some one did it I 'm certain  --  things went smooth enuf , says I , till we got dablin and medlin in money matters and the Bank , and now its all heads and points , and when we say it ai nt our fault , says I , its pretty much like a man puttin a pole over a fence on a swivel  --  and after pullin one end round with a jerk , if he knocks over a dozen folks with the other end says it ai nt his fault  --  now its pretty much jist so with the Bank , says I , and if you ca n't see it , all I can say is , I can . Well Major , says the Gineral , something must be done any how , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt always work together . I 'll call all our folks together , says the Gineral , and we 'll have a full cabinet and look into this matter , and do you Major prepare yourself , for I 'm goin to turn over a new leaf , that I 'm determined on  --  and with that he issued orders for every man to be at the Cabinet Chamber the next day just after breakfast  --  and I went to work puttin down all my notions in writin , for I expected a rough time and a pretty sharp set of fellows to beat off , and thinks I as it is the fashion now-a-days to read papers to the Cabinet , I 'll give ' em one that will be worth readin , and I guess it will be the last one that the Senate will ask an official copy of in one while . It took nigh upon all night to write it out  --  and I sprung to it , for I think the time is come to let some folks see they haint got a green horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gineral had ' em all up in the Cabinet Chamber yesterday , and such an overhawlin . I never see  --  I sat all the while with one foot on the table , whitlin a piece of shingle  --  and the Gineral was walkin round among ' em , tellin about the troubles in money all about the country , and asking how we are to get out of the scrape  --  I kept an eye on most all on ' em , and both ears on pretty much the hull on ' em , and such a winzin and tangle I never see since the day all Downingville cum over to the Jackson side , and that was jist after his election  --  They thought I was determin 'd the first go off to say nothin  --  And to rights I heard one chap jist behind me tell the Gineral " there was one Major in the Cabinet who made pretty much all the trouble , and that he was writin letters that went all the while agin the rest on ' em  --  and if it war n't for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted  --  that it was his fault that the Cabinet was obliged to shift their ground about the Bank and cross tracks every day . If it had ' nt been for him the deposits would have been removed because there war n't no Safety Fund ' in the Bank , and the People been contented  --  and if it warn ' for him the government could make the people believe that Biddle was the sole cause of their bein no money now-a-days , " and so on . I jest stop 'd whitlin a minit and cast my eye over my left sholder , and the fellow dodg 'd behind the Gineral in a flash , and when I look 'd round the ring I found pretty much the hull on em lookin at me and there war n't a word said . And to rights the Gineral he walk 'd up to me and stop 'd right in front and look 'd me strait in the face , says he , Major you 've hearn all that is said  --  and I should like to know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this room says the Gineral till this trouble is cleared up  --  Major ' says the Gineral ( and his lip began to quiver I tell you ) Major , says he , it would take a good many men to convince me that you ai nt what I have always found you  --  an honest man and a true patriot  --  some folks about us have bin whisperin in my ear for a long while that you ai nt what I think you are  --  but Major says the Gineral  --  I am a soldier and so are you  --  and we are now all face to face  --  no more whisperin says the Gineral , and he gave his hickory a whack on the floor and look 'd round the hull ring  --  The country is in a trouble says he , and the time is come for every honest man to speak out  --  if there is error let it be corrected  --  if there is trick we must expose it  --  and now Major says the Gineral , do you set still  --  and if any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . When they are all done  --  you can answer them  --  and with that the Gineral pull 'd his own chair up to the other side of the table and laid his hickory and hat down before him , and all our folks began to nock noses in little groups here and there , and one ' em , no matter who , was as busy as a lap dog on a tranin day , smelling round from one to another to find the right man to speak first  --  but none on ' em seem 'd to like it .  --  The Gineral all the while sat blinkin and lookin round at ' em all , and rumplin his face once and a while most plagily . So to rights , this one of ' em come forward and bow 'd , and says he , Gineral , that " our sufferings is intolerable , " there is little doubt ; and the question is not how we got into our present condition , but how we can best git out of it . I believe , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for he is an amazin polite cratur , ) that is the true and only point now for discussing . " Not exactly , says I , but no matter . " " Well , says he , as regards the Major , far be it from me to make any charge against him ; he is decidedly the favorite of the people , and should be the favorite of every man in office who wishes to keep his office ; but I would say , that I wish the Major had a higher office . I wish he was an auditor of accounts  --  or a receiver of public money  --  or a minister abroad  --  or an Ingin agent , or any other office in the government ; but as he is now  --  there is no getting hold of either end of him ; we ca n't elevate him , which I sincerely desire  --  we ca n't put him down , which no man desires . There are things inall governments  --  and in this in particular , that requires cookin up before the should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the people raw and uncook 'd , and lets every man dress his own dinner  --  this is not right . And then , again , he is an enemy to party , and thinks that politicians should n't meddle in money matters , when we all know that none of us would now be here without office , and that office ai nt worth a fig without money ; and so it comes to this  --  we 've got a party , and a good strong one ; and that party must keep all the offices , and the control of all the money ; for , without money , the offices wont be good for nothin  --  and , without offices the party will be all scattered : look at my own state , see how things work there ; and just so they would hero . We must have the Bank  --  we ca n't do anything without it . It is all good enough enough if we could get Biddle and his friends out of it  --  but seein we have tried that and ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have a new one after our own fashin  --  unfortunately , some will suffer  --  because this one must , I suppose , collect its debts and wind up  --  but what is the sufferings of a few in trade compar 'd to the breaking up of a political party , now all hitched together , think of us all going back again to practice law  --  and you , Mr. Auditor , to keeping a school  --  and you , Mr. Secretary , to keeping a shop  --  and you to ploughing  --  and you to plantin corn , and you to digging potatoes  --  and you to printin newspapers .  --  " And you , Major , " says he , " what would become of you ? " I began to crawl all over , and was just goin to say something , but I thought I would n't tell he got through ; and he reeled it off for more than an hour pretty much in the same way about things in general , and Major Downing in particular  --  and as soon as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any body got nothin more to say ? No one said a word . Says I , is all that is said put in writin ?  --  for then there will be no mistake ; no turnin corners ; no dodgin afterwards . " O no , " says he , " there is no necessity to put any thing in writin of this nature  --  that ai n't my way , " says he . " I have always said I do n't like to get into the newspapers . " " Well , " says I , " that 's just where we differ  --  what I'am goin to say now , say I , is all in my pocket in black and white  --  and with the Gineral 's permission , says I , I 'll read it to the members of the Cabinet , and then I 'll git it printed , and then all on you can read it , and every man shall have a copy o n't except Clay and the rest of the Senate  --  for tho ' the law says they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no business with any paper read to the Cabinet  --  ai n't that law , says I , Gineral ? " The Gineral nodded his head , and that was enuf ; and says he , " Major , do you read that paper ; I know you well enuf to know it will be an honest view of things , and I do n't care whose toes you tread on . I have no interest in these matters further than to do my duty  --  if any fellows have misled me , I advise ' em to keep an eye on my hickory . " And then I took out my papers from my pocket and went at it ; and I did n't mince matters I tell you . The Gineral sat restin his elbows on the table with his chin in both hands and lookin straight in my face the hull time , ony once in a while he 'd take his hickory and whack it on the table when any one muttered and whispered ; and as soon as I got to the end o n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gineral got up and fetched another whack on the table with his hickory , enuf to loosen ones eye teeth . Now , says the Gineral , I 've hearn both sides , and the people will shortly hear it too . If they say the Major is right , I wont oppose them any longer ; if they say the Major is wrong , then we 'll go on as we now go ; and now , says he , Major , git that paper printed , and the only favor I ask of you is not to sent an official copy out to the Senate if they ask one ;  --  and with that , I and the Gineral bowed off the Cabinet , and the Majors , and the rest of the government ; and we turned to readin letters from all quarters , all full of money troubles and distress , enuf to give one the cholera morbus ; for as I said afore one is just about as bad as t' other . I 'll send you to-morrow or next day , the paper I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for you to print . It 's too long for this letter , and you can ask Zekel Bigelow , if he haint stop 'd payment , to pay for the expense of printen o n't , and tell him for me if his head is above water , its more than can be said of most folks  --  and he better hold on to all he 's got , and ride out the storm if he can . His last letters to me say things are shockin bad in Wall street , but the worst there ai nt as bad as things are away West and South , and they will be worse yet , if the people do n't decide pretty soon , as the Gineral says , whether I am right or wrong .  --  For its the people 's business now , and the Gineral is waiten for ' em .

Gineral  --  and Gentlemen of the Cabinet , and the rest on you here present , composin the Government  --  I speak to you as a man standin right between you and the people  --  what I am goin to say ai nt calculated to make any on you change your opinion , so much as to make you know mine  --  you have pretty much all on you had your turn , and now comes my turn  --  if any thing I say has sharp corners and scrapes the skin a leetle , it is because I haint had time to file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much as you ged bread from the Bakers , and leave you to slice it or chunk it as best suits you ; and every man can butter his own slice just to please his fancy  --  that ai nt my business so much as it is hisn . We are met here not only to fix on some plan to get the country out of trouble , but to see how it got into trouble ; and I am goin to say a little on both pints . When a chimbley smokes at the rong eend with the wind at the north east , some folks may content themselves with openin' windows and doors , to let the smoke out , but my notion is that the safest plan is to see into the cause o n't , and correct it  --  so that the chimbley will only smoke at the right eend , let the wind blow any way . Now there is a few things we must look into a little , and then we will know more about em , and I am goin to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States raly is . Whether its nature is to do good or evil to the country , and then wind up with Matters and things in general . Twenty years ago the country was in trouble , and fill 'd up with all kinds of bank paper  --  nigh upon as bad as old Continental  --  and a good deal was a little worse . If any body ai nt old enuf to remember that time , and wants to see what kind of money I mean , let him go to the Treasury , and Mr. Taney can show him nigh a million and a half of dollars , not worth the cost of the paper and ink used every year in makin a report o n't  --  but this is ony a drop compar 'd to what would be now there of the same kind of stuff if it had'nt been for the Bank of the United States . All our wise folks of that day said we must have a Bank of the United States , and a good big one . One strong enuf to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash  --  and so this Bank was made , and the first thing was , as there was a very little rale money in the country , the Bank , went and bo't a good jag o n't in Europe , and went to work here clearin away jest as we do our fields in the Spring . It was a pretty dirty job to do so I tell you , and the Bank did'nt get through with it without scratchin and smuttin its fingers pretty considerable ; and that war n't the worst o n't for the Bank . The Government made the Bank agree to pay fifteen hundred thousand dollars for the privilege of doing this work , and made it agree to take care of the people 's money in all parts of the country , and to pay it here and there wherever the Government told ' em to pay all the pensions , and to do every thing in the money way without chargin any thing for it to the Government . This was a pretty tuff bargain for the Bank  --  for all it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the Government did'nt want it the Bank might lend it out . It took a good many years afore the Bank got things to work smooth . It was like a whappin big waggon that wanted a good many horses to drag it , and as it had a valuable freight in it , it wanted none but the best kind of horses  --  real Conestogas  --  and it warnt every one who knew how to drive such a team . The owners of this waggon found that out  --  for some of the first that they got came plagy nigh oversetting it . So to rights they got Squire Biddle . I suppose they thought that seein that the folks in Pennsylvany have the best and strongest horses and the biggest waggons , they ought to know best how to guide ' em . Well , they made a pretty good guess that time  --  for ever since they told the Squire to take the lines , they haint lost a linchpin or broke a strap ; and there warnt no complaints made agin him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other waggoners liked the Squire amazingly , he was always ready to give ' em a lift when he found them in the mud , and whenever they got short of provender , the Squire never refused to turn out some of his to keep their horses from suffering . Every thing was goin on better and better , and every body said at home and abroad there warnt such a team in all creation . Well , about four years ago we began to pick a quarrel with the Squire , and its been goin on every year pretty much after this fashion . The first go off some of our folks wanted the Squire to change some of his leadin horses  --  they said the breed warnt right  --  he ought to put on the lead some Albany trotters  --  that they were the best horses on the lead he could have . The Squire did'nt like to change  --  he said the horses he had , knew the road as well as he did , and they would'nt bolt nor kick up , and when they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then again our folks wanted the Squire to change harness  --  they said they had new patent collars , and a horse could pull as much agin with ' em as with the old fashion 'd collars . Well the Squire did n't like that notion nother . So to the rights they told the Squire he must give up the lines  --  well that he would n't do he said , without orders from the owners of the teams  --  they had appointed him , and so long as they kept him there , he would go along and do his duty , jest he had done  --  and it warnt right to keep stoppin him everyday on the road , and trying to make him try new plans . And with that , all our folks made a regular battle on the squire  --  some took away out of his waggon a part of the bags and boxes , and divided it round among the drivers of others waggons , who was mixin in the scuffle too , and away they crack 'd off with it . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they was only leather and rope traces ; but the squire was too deep for ' em , for his traces was all chains kivered with leather , and so they spilt their jack-nives . Some went on a-head and rolled stones in the road , and dug deep holes , and tried all they could to make the square upset , and threw stones and mud at him and his horses , but the squire kept on his horses did n't flinch , and as they had drag 'd the big waggon over worse roads in the day , they went along without accident . Well now it turns out that all the waggons that drove off so with a part of the squire 's load are in trouble , for the first piece of muddy road , they all stuck fast , and there they are now . One wants the other to give him a pull and a lift ; but they say they all want lifting  --  the squire has just come up with ' em , and now they want him to hitch on to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says that 's impossible , the most he can do is to take back the load they took from his waggon , and then perhaps they can git out of the mud ; but it is more than his team can do , and he wont run the risk of breakin his harness or injure his horses to drag ' em all out together . Well now that 's just about the condition of things , and the longer they remain so , the worse it will be  --  the longer horses and waggons stand knee and hub deep in mud , the less able they 'll be to git out o n't . And I 'll leave ' em there a spell , and we 'll take a look into the natur of the Bank , and what it really is , for to hear some folks about it , one would think it was a most shocking monster , and that it was pretty much nothin else but squire Biddle , when it is no more the squire than that big waggon is , not a grain more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are the owners of the Bank  --  here we see in the first place the nation owns one-fifth , and the rest is scattered round , as you see here , among an everlastin batch of folks all about this country , and some in forin countries ; and I am glad to see on the list here old widows and old men , and trustees of children , who haint got no parents livin and all our own people , they put their mony in the stock of this Bank for his safe keeping  --  not to speculate  --  and just so with the innocent foreigners , and the best o n't is they have paid our tolks a pretty high premium for every dollar o n't  --  well these are folks then that compose the Bank . Now what do they want this Bank managed ?  --  the business of the Bank is to loan money , and is jest for all the world like any rich man whose business is to loan out his money ; is it his interest to dabble in politics or to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never knew one of your rale politicians who ever could pay his debts , and they ai nt the kind of folks , people like to deal with any who may have got money to loan ; they know that talking politics , and gettin things into snarls jest to answer party purposes ai nt the way to pay interest nor principal nother , and politicians in a Bank are the worst folks in the world for the owners of the Bank , for the most on ' em haint got mony of their own to lend , but they are plagy ready to loan other folks ' money to brother politicians of the same party . No no , a man who has got his mony loan 'd out ( and its jest so with a Bank ) want to see every body busy and industrious and mind their business and increase their property , for then they will be able to pay interest and principal too ; they do nt like to see things all mixed up with politics and people quarrellin and disputin , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets agin as soon as they can , for they know that politics ai nt profitable business . Then it comes to this , that if the Bank is what I have said it is ( and its nothin else , ) it ai nt such a monster as some folks try to make us think it is , instead of being a dangerous monster . I see and I know every body else must see , who do nt squint at it , but looks it strait in the face ; that its natur is jest like the natur of any man who has got property in the country , and that is to have every thing go on in harmony and with industry and honesty and accordin to law ; no jangles and tangles and talkin politics in porter houses and bar rooms , hurrain for this man , and pulling down that man ; that kind of work do nt clear up new lands nor plough up old ones , it do nt keep the hammer goin , and the wheels turnin ; and do nt pay interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank has too much power , and that Squire Biddle might do a good deal of mischief if he would . Well , there is my old friend . Capt . Elihu S. Bunker , of the steam-boat President , runnin betwixt New York and Providence  --  he 's got about sich another monster  --  there is no tellin what a " dangerous monopoly " of power that crittur got in that are boat . I was lookin into it when I came on with him a spell ago , and he was showin me how he managed it . If he was to fasten down the kivers of them two mortal big copper kettles he has got in his boat , and blow his bellesses a spell , he would smash every thing for more than 50 acres round  --  Does any body want to know why he do n't do it  --  he has been in a steam-boat as long now as the bank 's been goin and haint scalded no body  --  but he can do it in a minit if he chuses  --  well I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and he do n't own no more of the boat than Squire Biddle does of the bank  --  the owners of the boat employ him to manage it because they know he understands his business . He knows if he did n't watch over their interest they 'd turn him out  --  and jist so the owners of the bank would sarve Squire Biddle . And that ai nt all , Captain Bunker knows if he hurts any body with his boat he 'd run a chance of hurtin himself too  --  he knows too that it is the interest of his owners not to have any accidents aboard any boat  --  for if people git scalded in one steam boat , they 'll keep clear of all on ' em  --  and though some folks think banks ai nt like steam boats I can tell ' em that in the main thing they are exactly alike  --  for unless folks have got confidence in ' em and feel safe in ' em they ai nt worth ownin  --  but when they all go on and meet no accidents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strongest , and cleanest , and quietest , and best managed git the most business . Now I think that 's enuf about dangerous monopolies for a spell . Let us now see what the bank is about , and what we ' ve been about . Deacon Goodenou  --  Has been in that bank as one of its directors off and on ever since it was a bank , and I have heard him say 50 times , ( and he 's a man to be depended on ) he never heard a word about politics in it till about 4 years ago  --  and it all came from our sendin every year since that time , some rale politicians to help the other 20 directors to manage the bank  --  the first go off , the deacon says , they thought best to keep quiet , and make no stir about it ; for it was pretty much like finding skunks in the cellar  --  the best way was to let ' em alone , if they 'd keep there , and run the chance of their goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suck  --  but when they undertook to cum up chamber and smell about in all the cupboards , it was time to snub ' em  --  and then came trouble ; and that 's jist about the way now ; and the deacon says , and he is about right , that politicians in a bank are jist as bad as skunks in the cellar  --  there ai nt one grain of difference . Some on you say we do nt want a bank now  --  well that may be so  --  but when I got up this mornin it was plagy chilly till I got my coat on  --  now I am warm and it may be I do nt need a coat  --  but I think if I take my coat off I 'll feel chilly agin  --  and I am so certing of this I wont make a trial ont . Some on you say the owners of this bank haint got no right to a recharter  --  they have had it long enuf  --  and its time now to have a new shuffle and cut  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why  --  tho ' this bank was chartered for twenty years  --  it had a good right to believe we would renew its charter if it be haved well and did as duty  --  jist as a congressman has a right to expect his constituents will send him to congress agin if he behaves well  --  and its a good way to-keep folks strait and make em do their duty  --  but if we are to knock this bank down and have a new shuffle and cut , then I say that them folks who make money out of a rise of stock in the new bank , ought to pay the loss that all these old folks and young children will suffer by nocking down the old bank  --  to say nothin about the innocent foreigners who put their money in this bank ; thinkin it was safe . And let me tell you another thing  --  the longer a bank stands , and the older it gits , the better folks abroad and at home like it  --  people who have got money to lend do n't like changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to lend folks money in South America ? and do you think any of them governments could make a bank that folks would have any confidence in ? I do nt think they could  --  jist because they keep choppin and changin every year . Will any on you say that it ai nt a good thing for a country to make folks all about think it is a safe one to lend mony to ? ai nt good credit worth nothin ? Well , how does any man in trade git credit , and make folks think him safe to trust ? Will he break up his stand every year , and change his business , and try new plans ? I say that ai nt the way , and no man ever prospered after that fashion ; but when he finds things go well with him , he hang on ; or else he haint got no wit in him . Now , my notion is , that none on us alone can make folks all about creation think we are safe folks to trust . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason a good big bank can manage this for us . Folks abroad know the bank ; and the bank know us ; and so we can manage things through the bank better than we can alone . Some on you say it ai nt right to pay interest to foreigners  --  that when we git money from foreigners , they keep drainin us of interest . Well , that is all chalk and water . Now I know we have got an everlastin new country to clear up yet ; and if an honest industrious man can git a few hundred dollars lent to him , he can go and buy a good many acres , and clear it up , and sell it to these very foreigners , who are all the while coming out here to settle among us , and they pay fifty times more for it than the land first cost ; and so our folks go on borrowin , and can well afford to pay interest , and find themselves in a few years with money to lend too . And as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say to foreigners , as the Cape Cod fisherman says to the fish , when he gets on the hook . and is pullin him in  --  " So long as you hold on one eend , I will t' other . " But folks abroad who have money to lend , do n't know our folks who go on new land : and a good many on old land nother . But they know our bank , and our canals , and rail-roads , and we sell ' em the stock , and make ' em pay good premiums too : and our folks can lend their money to our farmers . But if we go on , and nock down this bank when its charter is out , and bring trouble on the country , foreigners say , " Aha ! there 's trouble there ! "  --  back they come with their stock , and git their mony , and keep it ; and all our prosperity is nock 'd in the head ! We charter 'd this bank for 20 years ; and so we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean when the time was up , to nock ' em all up too , and say we do n't want no bank , nor a canal , nor a rail-road ? It ai nt common honesty to say so ; and I wo n't shuffle and cut with you after that fashion ; for make what I might by a new shuffle , I would be asham 'd to look one of these innocent foreigners in the face  --  to say nothin of this long list of widows , and orfans , and trustees of estates , and old folks , many on em , when they bought the stock at a high premium , I suppose never thought about the charter , or how long it had to run but trusted to the government . And now if you can chizzle them out of their property , as you will by puttin down this bank , jest to git a new shuffle and cut at a new one  --  without turnin as red as a beet when you meet em , I for one say I ca n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done  --  if I have trod on any one 's toes , it ai nt so much my fault as hisen ; for I tread the the strait line , and tread ony on toes that stick out beyond the line , and that 's too often the case with folks now-a-days in offices . I 've telled you now pretty much my notions ; and I tell you for the last time you have made a mistake , and that 's no disgrace to any man unless he tries to stick to it after he knows he has made it . If you do n't know how to git the country out of the scrape you 've got it in , the people will tell you pretty quick , or I ai nt no hand at guessin . I have now done my daty . If the people do n't do theirn it ai nt my fault . If they say my notions are right they ' ll act on em ; if they say they are wrong , then things will go on as they now go , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wont promise . If things come to the worst , I shall suffer as little as any on em , for I haint got no wife and children to support ( and I am sorry for those who have , if things are to go as they now go , ) I can cut my fodder pretty much any where . But I love my country , every acre o n't , and it goes agin my grain to see any part o n't suffer . And I know all this suffering comes from party polities  --  this same party politics that has driv all our wisest and best men out of office ; and now to keep together wants to get hold of the big wagon and all the money in it . My dander is up , and I best stop now  --  for the more I think o n't , and the more I write about it , the more wrathy I git . So no more at present , From your fellow citizen , J. DOWNING , Major , Downingville Militia , 2d Brigade , LETTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him as a present from Carthage , N. Y. over his shoulder into the Cabinet while the members were in Council , the scampering that followed the sight of it , and the result  --  with a true picture of the scene . Letter - - Washington 10th January , 1834 . The pill I give the Cabinet , and the rest of the Government here on the 27th of last month , is jist beginnin to operate , and I do nt think some on ' em will want any more fisik for a good spell to come . Some of our folks make plagy ugly faces at me , but I told ' em that 's a sure sign they want fisik , and they 'd feel better to rights . It was well I stop 'd jist where I did in that Cabinet paper , for my dander was jist liftin ; and if I had gone on ten minits longer , I 'd hit some on ' em so hard they would'nt swell . But that ai nt what I want to write you about now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in York State for the ax they made for me , and which they sent to you to send to me . I have jist got it , and it has tickled me eny most to death . I never got such a present afore in my born days . I started right up chamber with it to the Gineral , and bolted strait into the Cabinet room with my ax on my shoulder  --  the Gineral was there with pretty much all our folks overhauling the Post Office accounts , and tryin to git them straite , which is a plagy tuf job ; but no matter : in I smash 'd but afore I could git out one word , I never see such a scamperin . I turned to head some on ' em , jist to tell em what I was after , but it seemed the more I tried , the more they tried to streak it , and in less than one minit there warnt a livin criter left but I and the Gineral ; and the Gineral some how got a notion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there warnt no pluck in him . He was standin up with his back agin the mantil tree , and his hickory in his hand , and look 'd for all the world as tho ' he was jist expecting a fight . Why , says I. Gineral , what on earth is all this scampering for ? Well , says he , I reckon you can tell better than I can ; and with that , he blink 'd at me most plagily ; and says he , what is the news now ? Why , says I , there ai nt nothin new but this ere ax , and I brought it to show you ; its a present to me , says I from Starks &; Co. , away up in York State , on the Black River . The Gineral changed face in a minit , and it was jist like the sun risin . He step 'd up to me and took the ax , and walk 'd to his chair , and sat down , and throw 'd his head back , and ha haw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these times to see the Gineral tickled at any thing . As soon as the Gineral could say any thing ,  --  says he Major call back Tany and Barry and Amos , and haw , haw , haw , says the Gineral ; and jist then , I got the notion why they all scampered off so ; and sot down right in front of the Gineral , and we haw hawd 'd I tell you , for more than half an hour . And so to rights , we got talkin agin , and the Gineral he wiped his eye , and blew his nose jist for all the world as tho ' he had been cryin ; and says he , Major , it ai nt strange they was a leetle afeard of you , for do you know jist as you come in , some on ' em was sayin about the plagy Post Office accounts . If they did'nt git em strait pretty soon , you would git at ' em and chop em all up into mince meat ; and jist then sure enuf in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says the Gineral agin . Well , says he , Major , I 'm glad that people about are beginnin to look at you pretty much as I do . I knew , says he , the time would come when they would say I knew what was what when I got you to be with me ; and says he Major , let 's look at this ax , and the Gineral he rubb 'd his specs ; well says he , this is a splitter ai nt it ; why , says he , if a man only got lathered he could shave himself without a barber , for for this ax is as bright as a looking glass and sharp as a razor ; and here is the maker 's name too : " Starks &; Co . ' Carthage , New York " I do wonder now , says the Gineral , if that ai nt the same " Stark " who lick 'd the British at Benington a spell ago ? " " I ai nt certin , " says I. " Well , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know Major I have been in so many wars myself , that I some times mix em up , and I have now got so much to attend to here , that I am bother 'd about names and places and times , most plagily . Now there is our little district attorney , our folks telled me when I appointed him a Bank Director that he was jist the kind of man we wanted " to ride Biddle " and upset him ; and when they tell 'd of " ridin " " upsettin , and mentioned his name , I got a notion in my head that I ca n't get out yet , that he may be the same man I 've heard tell on , who took a ride once , and then wrote a long account o n't in poetry . Well , says I , I 'm not certain of that nother ; but I 've got a notion that the man you mean was John Gilpin . " That 's the same man , ai nt it , " says the Gineral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he lived in London . " O , that makes no odds , " says he Gineral ; " for they used to call Philadelphia the London of America . " Well says I , then it must be the same , and if he 's got on the squire to ride him , I guess it will turn out pretty much such another ride ; for , says I , the squire is a pretty good horse for a tight pull ; but I do n't think he 'd stand easy under a saddle ; it ai nt the natur of that breed . Well Major , says the Gineral , we must thank those folks for the ax any how , and as soon as the Senate pass , upon that message we sent em t' other day about other presents , you can have the ax . Very well , says I , Gineral , and if Congress do nt pass upon something else , says I , so as to git things as leetle better in the money way , I 'll want the ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a livin . I want you to send a printed copy of that letter to the makers of that ax , and when you git all my letters to you printed in a book send em one of the books with my thank , for the ax . Your friend , J. DOWNING . Major . Downingville Militia  --  2d brigade , LETTER LXXI . Argument The Major and the President holds a general conversation on the state of the Nation , when the Major gives an explanation of the financial operations as now conducted , by means of hocus pocus , with cups and balls . Letter - - 25th Jan. 1834 . Ever since I and the Gineral settled the Post Office accounts , as I tell 'd you in my last , by charging the amount that Major Barry is astern , to " Glory " and " Reform , " the Gineral has been more easy about it than I am afeard other folks be , especially some of the opposition folks in Congress ; they keep smellin round  --  and unless we can git up another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post Office , but some other branches of the Department . Congress keeps hammering away yet about the deposits , and the Gineral was gist agoin to give up , when we got the news from Albany of the vote of the Legislatur there in favor of the Gineral in taking away the deposits from the United States Bank , and the vote of the New Jersey Legislatur , and strong news too that some other Legislaturs wo 'd do the same . The Gineral was amazingly tickled , and says he , Major , I reckon your notion that the people wornt with us on that pint is a mistake , and now says the Gineral , I 'll hang on and keep the deposits , and Biddle may whistle for ' em . " Well , " says I , " Gineral we 'll see , and as I said afore , if the people do n't tell the Legislaturs another story , and Congress too , afore we are a month older , then , " says I , " I know nothing on em . " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll see "  --  and jest then in come Amos and the Globe man , and some more of our folks , and lookin pretty streaked too , and I got a notion right off there was somethin stirrin  --  and os they began to tell the Gineral and Biddle was to work bribin all the people he could to sign petitions to Congress , asking to put back in the Bank all the deposits agin , and to recharter the Bank . " Why , " says the Gineral , " ai nt that too bad ,  --  Major we must give the Back , sayshe , that Latin pill , there is nothin will stop em but that skiry factus " ( or some sich a name the Gineral calls it . ) Now , says I , Gineral , stop a bit , says I  --  there is one thing puzzles me considerable about this bribin business  --  I should like to know who they be who are takin bribes  --  it ai nt the nature of things , says I , for Squire Biddle to bribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless  --  then , says I , it must be that he is bribin the enemies of the Bank , and that 's our party . Now , says I will you set by and hear folks say , that our party is such a scabby set of fellows as to take bribes  --  if you do , says I , I wont , and with that I riz up , but before I could round the corner of the table I and the Gineral was alone agin . I sat down and said nothin  --  I gritted my teeth a spell , but that did n't do much good  --  I took my knife and whittled the table . but that warnt much better , and the ony way to rights that put me in a good temper agin , was to whistle more than 40 verses of Yankee Doodle , for I did n't like to say a word to the Gineral whilst I was in a pashin . The Gineral was all the while walkin up and down the room  --  so as soon as I got through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nothin more about bribin , says I ; well , says he , Major , I reckon you are riget , for the notion never struck me afore that that kinder talk hits right upon the heads of our friends , for they are the only ones that needs bribin . Now , says I , Gineral , jest lets you and I sit down and talk over this business , and I 'll tell you , like a true friend , how the cat is goin to jump , and if it do n't turn out as I tell you , I 'll give you my ax , and throw in my regimentals in the bargain ; and so the Gineral he sot down , and I went at it . In the first place , says I , if I git in a pashin , you must keep cool  --  and if you git in a pashin I 'll keep cool , but if we both git in a pashin , then there 's no tellin . Well , says the Gineral , that 's a good notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ingins do , and they learn wisdom from natur ; you never see an Ingin and his squaw git drunk together  --  when one gits drunk tother keeps sober , and so they take turn and turn about . Well says I , I never heard that afore , but I suppose tho ' they git along better when they are both sober . O yes , says the Gineral , in war time that is best , but not in treaty time . Well , says I , that 's matter , that ai nt exactly what I am after , but I 've got a notion out o n't which I 'll begin with . Some years ago the Yankees got drunk and got up a kinder nullification ; there warnt much in it after all , according to my old friend Dwight 's book  --  but folks South thought there was , and so they kept sober ; and last year the South got drunk , and then all North kept sober , and that frolic is ended . Now , says I , North and South and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , and they say we have all been takin a drop too much  --  there ai nt no nullification no where in particular , but its all nullification all about us , and all hands are formin a ring and closin in upon us here , pretty much like a wolf hunt  --  they all say we have taken the money that belongs to the people , and the people wont be content till we give it up  --  that 's pretty much the nub of the business  --  and we shall have petitions and memorials from all quarters tumble in upon us , and if we do n't mind them , they will be follow 'd by hard nocks , jest like the story in the Spellin Book about the old man drivin the boys from the apple tree  --  he throw 'd grass first , and that doing no good , he tried stones , and that brought em down pritty quick . The Gineral he began to git in a pashin  --  and says he Major I 'm gittin mad . Very well says I Gineral I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gineral slatted round a spell with his hickory , and talked about New Orleans  --  and Siminoli  --  and the Grand tower  --  and I set whistling all the while  --  " why Major , says the Gineral , I 'll never give up the deposits in the world "  --  " what " says I , " not if the people say we was wrong in takin em ? Suppose the people say the laws are agin us , what then ? "  --  " Well says the Gineral I 've tell 'd em that the Laws are only jest as I understand em and nothing else . " Now says I , Gineral , suppose Clay , or Calhoun , or Webster , was in your office and said so  --  and you was in Congress , or was of the people and did n't agree with em  --  how then says I ? O , says the Gineral , that 's a very different thing ; any one of them fellows would be dangerous to trust with any kind of power . Well says I my notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trust nobody  --  and as I am peskily afeard one or tother on'em will git in here after we go to the Hermitage  --  I do n't want to have any thing done now by us that they will do , and then tell us they ony do what we did . That 's the only thing that puzzles me  --  for says I , Gineral , sass for the goose ought to be sass for the gander too . Well , says the Gineral , there is something in that Major  --  but says he , I cant give up the Deposits any how ; Amos says we must hold on to ' em , and all our folks say so too . Yes , says I , Gineral , its true enuff the hounds have got the stag down , and got a taste on him afore the hunters come up , and I suppose there will be leetle left but the horns and trotters : but , says I , it ai nt right , and the people will tell us so you may depend : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done is to be the rule hereafter , I do nt know but I should like to be President myself : for folks might make laws , and all I 'd have to do would be to understand ' em according to my notion . I do nt see Major , says the Gineral , how it is you git sich odd notions about public sentiment . I know I cant be mistaken , for every letter I have time to read tells me I am right ; and I read the Globe from one eend to tother every day , and that paper tells every thing , and I see nothin there that tells me I am rong.  --  Well , says I , Gineral you know you haint got time to read more than one letter in a hundred that comes . That 's true enuf , says the Gineral , but then our folks do , and they tell me every thing . Tell you every thing ? says I ,  --  but no matter ?  --  and so I whistled Yankee Doodle a spell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposition folks throw dust in your eyes , you cant see things as clear as the rest of our folks about us . " I jest was goin to speak , but findin my dander was liftin , I had to go to whistlin agin , and it took me nigh upon 15 minits to git right , and I expected evry minit , I would have to git my ax and split hickory a spell in the bargain . Now , says I Gineral , you are the only man on earth I 'd look at a minit , and let him say so to me . I got dust in my eyes , says I ? I do nt know what is goin on in doors and out of doors ? Why says I , how you talk . Now says I , you jist sit still a minit and I 'll show you something says I worth lookin into  --  and I went into a room where Mr. Van Buren and Amos and some of our folks git together every once and a while , to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the games play 'd there , and beln naturally curious in most matters , I can play some on ' em nigh upon as slick as Mr. Van Buren himself  --  but he is master hand at it .  --  The game they had been playin most at lafterly , was about managin the public money among the new Deposit Banks , and showin how to use the " transfer checks " and " contingent drafts " so as to puzzle folks in time of need . It was done with a parcel of cups and balls , and little strips of paper  --  and did tickle me amazingly ; and for a spell puzzled me tu  --  and so I thought I 'd jist show the Gineral and see if it would'nt tickle and puzzle him tu . And I thought I 'd let the Page 208 Gineral see if there war n't a leetle dust in his eyes to And so I brought in a whole arm full of this machinery . And as soon as the Gineral saw me , says he Major what on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its a trifle , and I 'll tell you all about it to rights . And so I placed the cups bottom up , all along in a row on the table , and then I gin the Gineral a hand full of small balls . Now says I , I 'm goin to show you about as cute a thing as you 've seen in many a day  --  them cups we 'll call banks , and them balls is the money we took from Squire Biddle 's Bank , the next thing is to show you how things are goin to work , now that we 've got our money from one pocket , where we always know 'd where to find it , and divided it round among twenty pockets , where may-be you may , or may-be you may not find nothin at all o n't  --  and here says I are some leetle pieces of paper that I 'm goin to make use on to throw dust with  --  now says I Gineral , look sharp or you 're gone hook and line says I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know sartin that I can play it as well as Mr. Van Buren and Amos and some more of them are folks , and ' specially the Treasury folks , for they have been at it now off and on ever sense I 've been here  --  and Mr. Van Buren tell 'd em unless they could play at this game well , there was no use in takin away the deposits . Now says I Gineral I 'll begin  --  you are sartin says I there is a ball under every cup .  --  O yes says the Gineral , for I jest put em there , and then begun sliden the cups by each other , and mixin on em , and kept talkin about Glory and Reform  --  and the 8th ' o Jinnewerry , and the Proclamation , and Veto , and Nul lification , and some folks ben like Old Romans born to Command ! and others to obey , and so on , and jest as the Gineral took his eye off the cups and look 'd at me , an was goin to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd out hocuspocus , allicumpain , presto ! e pluritus unum , sine qua non , skiry factions , says I  --  there says I Gineral that 's the eend o n't . Well says the Gineral I do nt see much in that Major  --  did n't you says I ? then so much the better for the game . I suppose then says I you think the balls are under the cups , and jest as you put them . To be sure I do , says the Gineral , I suspected what you was ater Major , and I kept my eye on the cups ; and no balls ever get from under ' em without me seein ' em I 'd stake my life o n't says the Gineral ; and whats more I 'll stake the fastest horse in my stable , that every one of the cups has got a ball under ' em . Well says I , Gineral , it would n't be fare bettin , and so do you go to work and look . And the Gineral he lifted up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of paper . The Gineral , he was stump 'd , he look 'd at me and gin his face a twist , and then he look 'd in the cup and shook it . Well , says he Major , that is plagy odd , what has become of that ball ? Well , says I , I guess the paper will tell you ; and the Gineral took up that , and rub 'd his specks and lead , " Transfer draft No. 101 . " Well then I suppose , says the Gineral , its all right  --  ( for he had jist begun to take the notion of the game ) and insted of one ball in the next cup there is two balls . "  --  " I 'm not sartin , says I , and you better look . And so the Gineral lifted the next cup  --  and there warnt no balls there nother  --  ony another piece of paper . The Gineral look 'd a spell at me , and opened his mouth , and then he scratched his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agin , and then he read the paper . On one side was , " Contingent check $500,000  --  and on tother side was written " Marquess of Carmarthen , " $250,000-6 per ct .  --  " Post office loans , " and all kiver 'd up with figures so you could not see a bit of " White " on the paper  --  the Gineral , he blink 'd at it a spell ; and says he , Major , what does this mean ; well , says I. Gineral , I do nt exactly know myself but I suppose its all right , for I see here on one corner " Amos Kindle "  --  " O very well , says the Gineral , if that paper has past under the eye of honest Amos '  --  my life o n't its all right . But , Major , where is the ball I put under that cup , says the Gineral  --  ai nt it under one of these cups ? Not as I knows on , says I  --  and with that the Gineral he turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lookin into ' em , and there warnt under any one on ' em ; only  --  ony pieces of paper all full of figures , and some on ' em marked " Transfer Checks , " and " Contingent Drafts , " and " Treasury Warrants , "  --  the Gineral hussled em about to see if he could find any of them balls among em  --  and examined all the cups agin , and he looked under the tables  --  so to rights , says he , Major , I 'm stump 'd  --  I nock under  --  I 'm clean beat , says the Gineral ; and now , says he , where are the balls  --  and with that I put my hand in my pocket , and took em out  --  well , says the Gineral , that beats all the rest . Now , says the Gineral , what game is this , ai nt this nickremancy ? Well says I , Gineral , my notion is its pretty nigh that , but Mr. Van Buren says there ai nt a bit of nickremancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it 's a leetle of both on em .  --  Well , says the Gineral , its a plagy cunnin game , Major , ai nt it ? O , says I , its nothin as I play it here  --  you should see Van Buren at one eend of a table , and honest Amos at tother , and some of the folks from York State with the " Safety Funds cups " too , strung around the table , and all on em understandin the game nigh upon as well as Mr. Van Buren , and then they bring in the " party cups " too  --  and such a movin and hocuspocus work , I never see afore in my born days  --  in lookin sometimes I would'nt bet I had a head on my shoulders  --  it beats all natur says I. Now Major , says the gineral , suppose you try it agin , and so as I got my hand in , I played it over 2 or 3 times a leetle better , and the gineral could n't see the trick no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd spread the cups as far as I could reach , and talked about " Glory " like all rath , and tell about the people 's beginnin to think that some folks was outwittin the gineral , and that congress would n't go home afore they git all the public counts sifted , and the people 's money back agin under their control , and the gineral could n't no way keep his eye on all the cups at once , I 'd hocus pocus agin . The gineral could n't see into it , and he rub 'd his specks more than twenty times , but that did n't get the dust out of his eyes , and then I turn 'd to and explain 'd all I know 'd about it to the gineral , and he tried it , and after a good many slips  --  pretty much as Major Barry did when he tried it  --  he got along pretty well considerin . Now , Major , says the gineral , suppose we try it with one cup , and put all the balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . I think says the gineral , if you can outwit me then , I may as well quit . Well , says I , gineral that was jest my notion too ; and I tell 'd our folks , and offer 'd to bet any on ' em they could n't git a piece of paper in the place o n't , without my seein it if they ony us 'd one cup , and not one on ' em would take me up  --  and I 've tried it , but it wo n't work with one cup  --  you must have a good string on ' em . Some of our folks said they could fix a cup so as to play the game with it  --  but they couldnt with a plain single cup  --  and seein that I stump 'd ' em about the single cup , they are at work now in all parts of the country inventin a cup with springs , and screws , and slides , and holes inside o n't . Well major , says the gineral , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I never did like this kind of hocus pocus work , I never understand it ; and I do n't like this kind of nickermancy , or financy  --  and it ai nt to my fancy at any rate , Major , and it sha n't be , that I 'm determin 'd upon ; and jest then in come a hull raft of our folks from Congress , to tell the Gineral what was goin on there ; and as I had this letter to write to you I went into the next room , and whilst I was writin it , I 'd hear the Gineral once in a while stormin away about that plagy game of " financy " and " nickremancy " " There wo n't be a dollar left , " says the Gineral , " to pay the old sogers their pensions , if we do n't put a stop to this game , " and then they all got to blusterin , " and we must , " and " we musn'nt do this and that . " Oho , thinks I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a hand ; and jist as I was goin to to start , I heard the Gineral roar out for me , and not knowing what was comin I jist grab 'd my ax , and was alongside of him in a flash ; and would you think it ? there was more than fifty fellows of our folks , and some on ' em from Congress too , all standing round in a ring , brow beating the Gineral , and tellin him not to do this , and not to do that , and by no means not to break their cups ; for , it seems . the Gineral had jist threatened to smash ' em ; and sure enuf , as soon as he saw me he let drive at ' em with his hickory , and he sent the cups and balls into more than a thousand bits . " Stand by Major " says the Gineral ; never you fear me Gineral , says I ; but afore I had time to spit in my hands , the Gineral finished the war ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gineral has been blowin off steam ; and he haint said a word to me about havin dust in my eyes , and I begin to think the Gineral finds he has had as much in his'n as most folks , and so that 's all for the present ; only I 'll jist tell you its no use for any one to attempt now to deceive the Gineral with new plans , and a new bank ; we 'll have the one we 've got made a little bigger , pritty much after Mr. Webster 's fashion , and that meets my notion , because the country is bigger than it was 20 years ago ; and there mus n't be no nickremancy about it . The Gineral says there must be ony a plain cup , and balls in it ; then there will be no hocus pocus without seein the trick out . So no more at present . From your friend , J.
