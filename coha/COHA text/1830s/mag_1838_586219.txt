txt Tun present crisis will long hereafter , if the country pass well and safely through it , be referred to as one of the great : epochs in the history of our government . It will constitute a dividing line* between two distinct eras . It wil be designated as the Revolutionof 1537 , as we speak of the Revolution of 1500 , when the Republican party succeeded , after a fearful struggle , in overthrowing that . old Federal ascendency which had already sufficiently developed the evil principles involved in it , to threaten the speedy termination of the American Experiment ' in failure and disgrace . The divorce of the ill-ornened union between the political and banking powersan union effected , in evil hour , under the auspices of the founder of the same Federal school by which its perpetuation is now chiefly ad-* vocated-is one of those events which appear comparatively insignificant in themselves , whil they are in truth pregnant with the most valuable consequences . Such is the character of most of those leading events in history which are referred to in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nations . They are great only as causes-like the acorn , containing within its little shell the germ which shall develope itself to the oak that is to . struggle with all the might of the elements , and to subserve a thousand purposes of the most important usefulness to human life . In this point of view is seen the leading difference of eharacteristic between the contest which convulsed the coun4ry during the last Administration , and the still deeper one by which it is now agitated . The former was , on the part of the Government , to destroy a gigantic existing institution , whose power-perfectly organized and combined , while universally diffused over the country , and in close al .. liance , offensive and defensive , with a great political party-seemed at one period all but omnipotent . It was an enormous , substantive , . thing-with a local habitation and a name-distinct and definite- ... the greatness and power of which all men could behold and understand . There was a specific issue joined  --  a simple alternative presented . Its fall was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole land , and appearing a complete con nmmation in itself . The present contest is not , on the part of the Government , to destroy any thing . It* is simply to disconnect itself from an union which has proved mutually injurious to all the parties to it . Its antagonist inifuence is arv unembodied power ,  --  a something invisible and impalpable . It isto overthrow nothing ,  --  and its triumph will be accompanied by n* thundering sound of the do*vnfall of a great towering interest matcled // against it in the field for a struggle for life and death . It will , perhaps , scarcely strike the minds of those who do not look beyond the hour and the surface , as a great event at all . The difference , in this respect , is precisely that between the felling the oak and the planting the acorn . It is apparent that the difficulty on the part of an administration of maintaining such a contest , and carrying it through to a victorious issue , is vastly greater in the latter case than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , a far more arduous one than ever was General Jackson 's . This was fully understood before it was assumed . In the present contest there is little or nothing calculated to arouse and keep alive that species of popular enthusiasm-the result of a generous and true instinct rather than of a profound and dispassionate reflection-which , it is well known , proved of such valuable service to the Democratic party in its late struggle with theT Bank of the United States , by quickening the interest felt by every man in the issue between the two parties , and bringing out the votes of thousands whose daily avocations of toil would otherwise keep them from the discharge of that high civic right and duty . This necessary difference of popular feeling here referred to will be manifest on a slight reflection upon the view just presented , of the general difference of characteristic between the two contests . The acknow. ' ledged difference , both of kind and degree between the personal pop . ' ularity of the gallant old veteran who directed the late administration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , will also not fail to be taken duly into consideration by the intclligent reader , in estimating the force of this consideration* A popular sentiment of this character is irresistible , when supported and justified , as it was on that occasion , by a sound basis of reason and truth , capable of sustaining the shock of argument in the written and oral discussions of the issue conducted by the leading advocates of the respective sides , through the medium of the press , the pri* mary meeting , and the legislative hall . In the second place , the support which General Jackson received from a considerable portion of the State bank interest is now not only withdrawn , but it is well known that that enormous interest , with a combined unanimity of action which makes it vastly more powerful even than the National Bank , has thrown itself into the other scale . It thus acts now in conjunction with , instead of in opposition to , the former power ; which , on its part , claims to have been increased in efficiency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a State charter . The most sagacious and shrewd party press of the whole Opposition , edited by one of ' the most thorough.paced party politicians ( in the common acceptation of the term ) in the country , has , in an incautious moment , borne a full and emphatic testimony , which no contradictions can annul , to // the fact that it was the " ninety-three banks " that defeated the Republican party in the New York elections of last fall . This opposition of the entire power of the banking interest is not the less a fact , that it is founded on very false and exaggerated ideas , generated by party excitement and panic , of the objects aimed at by the financial policy of the Administration . Another leading feature of difference between the positions of the two Administrations is , that after a short time maintaining its ground the late Administration was met by the swelling support of the universal apparent prosperity attendant upon an expanding currencv , - while the harder fate of the present is to struggle under the burthen of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanations can , during the time of its actual pressure and distress , do away with the general popular effect . It is in vain at such seasons that we would expatiate on theories of political economy , and trace out this effect , no matter how distinctly and unanswerably , back to its real causes in the vicious principles on which our general banking system is founded , for which the Administration is in no degree responsible . At such periods calm argument is comparatively impotent , before the passionate declamation which the occasion will never fail to draw forth , from exulting political opponents , and from the panic-stricken moneyed interests which are so easily made to believe the existing government responsible for the fruits of their own long-indulged career of misconduct . The questions at issue are so complicated , and become so profoundly mystified by the clamors of prejudiced interests and the sophistries of conflicting theories , that it is easy to delude a considerable proportion of the public mind-sufficient to turn the scale of almost all pending electionsinto the belief that it is to the measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derangement and distress that they see around . At such periods the party in power must let the storm howl round it as it may list ; and trusting to time , to its own conscious truth and right , ride it out fearlessly and firmly by its sheetanchor of confidence in the ultimate judgment of our sound and true-hearted democracy . The efforts put forth by the Opposition in the contest are gigantic and worthy of a better cause ; and we frankly confess that they ought to put our own leading friends to shame . As a question , moreover , of the conflict of forces , they fight with great advantage at such a period as the present . They have the unity of opposition , and that thorough discipline consequent on their long and unintermitted campaigns of party warfare as an attacking minority , invigorated moreover by a strong stimulus of hope , and confidence of success , to crown their long desperate toils ; while on the other side the paralysis of dissension and alarm has for a time been seen to exert a fatally disorganizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reckoned by the tens and twenties of thousands , of ambitious and clamorous aspirants , both in Congress and over the whole face of the country , who already imagine that they behold afar off , in the Fata Morgana of their sanguine anticipations , the long pursued Latium-that promised-land of Office for which they have through so many a weary year hungered and thirsted in the wilderness ; while on the other side it is a notorious fact , that at least one-half of the offices at the Executive disposal are in the hands either of open enemies , or still more injurious false friends ; who , having none of that confidence in the continued ascendency of the Democratic party which springs from a profound conviction and enthusiasm , rejoice in Whig successes , and strive as openly as practicable to entitle themselves to exemption from that general proscription to be anticipated on the accession of the Whigs to power . They have leaders  --  and their name is legion-able , eloquent , ardent , active , indefatigable , practised in all the arts of partisanship , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long possession of power on the part of a majority is rather to degeneration in the personal calibre of its leaders and prominent partisans , in those qualities and habits that make them effective in the collision of parties . They have the press ,  --  their newspapers , sustained by commercial patronage and bank favors , and by the support of the more wealthy classes of whom four-fifths are ranged in hostility to the democratic cause , numbering , as is well known , full three to one , to those which the great bulk of the Democratic party is able to support . They have the wealth ,  --  and it is easy for them to send the plausible panic-making harangues of their best orators , under Congressional franks , to the door of every voter in every district , when in the one single institution presided over by so generous a patron of thepressas Mr. Biddle , theycanfind a subscriber to some hundreds of thousands of copies at a time . While on the other hand the friends of the Administration are able to circulate but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where their opponents lavish their tens of thousands ; and with difficulty defraying the trifling necessary expenses attendant upon the elections . Finally , they have the attaclc ,  --  in Chess often worth a piece , and in politics a still greater advantage . We have remarked in a former number upon the disadvantage of the defensive position occupied by a party which has been long in the possession of the Executive power , in our politics . It is so extensive , so complicated , so ramified into thousands of ( Letails , eluding the most conscientious vigilance of supervision , that it lays the party in possession open to perpetual assault , of the most harassing character . This truth ac // quires still stronger application after a long period of strong party excitement ; of high-strained executive action ; and of redundant re* venue , forcing upon it , through the Congressional appropriations , a vast expenditure of money , swelling with the growth of population , and the increasing extent and complexity of the administrative operations of the Government , in an insidious progress extremely difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range over the petty details of executive administration , throughout which those to whom the task is congenial may rove at pleasure ; with no fear of deficiency of materials for their tirades of partisan denunciation , so long as it shall cost a couple of hundred dollars to bury a foreign minister abroad ,  --  a few odd dollars for a passing beggar to shovel the snow from the basements of the public buildings ,  --  or a few shillings for a poor " woman " to discharge some menial office or other within them . * Such , then , is a general summary of some of the leading features of the present contest , viewed as a conflict of parties , with a fair estimate of their respective advantages . We have no desire to extenuate any of its difficulties or dangers , but would look every truth full in the face . It is an arduous contest . It is a crisis to try men 's souls . We exult in it . Those who engage in the noble strife of political parties , with worthy motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with all the stern joy of the patriot in the last battle for all that is holiest and dearest to him . This is no time for neutrality , for inertness , for wavering* Let no man hereafter , when the hard-fought field shall have been won , pretend to any portion of the confidence of the democracy of this great Union who has quniled before the responsibility of a manly choice of parties , at the present crisis-who has not been adequate to rise to the height of the times  --  the outward-shining metal of whose professed Republicanism has become dim before the touch-stone of true democratic principle , which the present question applies to every one . This is one of those periods that return at long intervals , of reorganization to great parties long in the ascendant . The contest with the Bank of the United States was not entirely such a one , though it was preparatory to it , and in many respects marked by a similar character . It was then , National Bank or State Bank , and not , as now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire expulsion of the money-changers from the temple , but for the expulsion of a part of them by means of another part , the latter looking to the reversion of the exclusive possession as the reward of vic* tory . A heavy responsibility rests upon that portion of the Repub* lican party which has attempted at such a crisis to detach itself from the main body , and by occuping a middle position between the // two to hold the balance of power , and thus force the vast majority of their own friends to submission to them as a small fractional minority , by the danger of the entire betrayal of the whole cause to the common enemy . A heavy responsibility  --  and evil the hour when it was assumed by some from whom such a course was not to have been looked for ! That ground can not be maintained any longer . It is too hot to hold ; and the honest democrats among them who were misled by misrepresentation and panic , and who desired only to act as a check to moderate the supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the old and tried associates whom they never designed to abandon ; while those whose democracy was but of the name and the lip have already passed over within the precincts of the adverse camp . What have we already seen in the brief history of the Conservative ' schism ? The Conservative vote has , at every election , been given mainly to the Whigs . One of the two principal leaders of that party ' has been nominated by its organ in New York as a candidate for the Vice-Presidency , with Henry Clay , the father of the American System , and the prominent champion of a National Bank , for President . And its peculiar organ par excellence at the seat of Government has not only placed itself in the very front rank of the Whig press for bitterness and rancor of hostility to the Administration , but has even repaid the respectable friend whose deceived confidence and countenance were mainly instrumental in fostering it and its party into life , with an insulting sneer upon his " second childhood . " After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , it is evident that Conservatism is at an end-except in so far as the name is applicable-in its true English sense , of hostility to all popu* lar and liberal reform  --  to the whole party which has now found itself swelled by this congenial accession . This is , we repeat , a pe* nod of the breaking up and reorganization of parties on their true natural grounds ,  --  one of those convulsions which sweep away all other landmarks of party habits but the fixed rocks of original principle . It is seen in the transfer of that portion of the democratic party whose Republicanism was but the name under which they have long enjoyed the advantages of political ascendency , to their naturat position within the ranks of the old Federal and Bank party ; while , on the other hand , a considerable number of the Whigs  --  a large portion of whom are but democrats thrown accidentally and unconsciously into a false position-are coming over to the support of those principles of which no party prejudices nor clamors can prevent their recognizing the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange , and contains a ( louble reason for rejoicing-equally for each such departure and such accession . The democratic party , in our opinion , after the long possession of power by too absolute a majority , needed such a rejuvenescence-. // such a casting of the skin ; and is now in a much more healthy condition than it has been in for a long time . Its main body has proved itself sound and true-hearted . Under all the disadvantages of its situation , disorganized , alarmed , paralyzed by dissension , and deserted by the leaders long habitually relied upon , it has stood truly by its principles , with a firmness which has excited our high admiration and pride . It will triumph . Its success is certain . Every State and every district in the Union might be swept over by the torrent of popular delusion and panic which has caused a temporary defeat in the elections on many points where we were long accustomed to prevail ,  --  yet would not our confidence in our cause and in the people waver for a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much longer in its state of inflation . The great issue is now too clearly made up to admit of misrepresentation ; and as the correct understanding of it gradually works its way downward , to penetrate the whole broad mass of the people , they can not fail to prove true to their natural instincts and long settled principles . The question is , Bank or Constitution-an independent goveminent of the pcople , on the acknowledged principles of the Constitution , *r a final submission , once for all , of the neck of our young free nation to the yoke of bank dominion . The language of the Administration is this : Let us part . In both forms the experiinent of our union has been twice fully tested . dn both it has failed . I seek not to injure you ,  --  let me alone . You are beyond the sphere of my legitimate action . Remain within the proper commercial limits of yours . I would confine myself to my proper federal duties according to the clear letter and spirit of the Constitution under which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits , based on your capital , prudence , and good faith . Do not seek to rest artificially upon mine . I leave you to yourselves an ( l to your own States by whom you are created and supported . There can never hereafter possibly be peace or harmony for either of us in a renewal of this union . The Democratic party has staked itself on the great principle of the Divorce , and , whether immediately victorious or defeated , will never abandon it . Tranquillity is the greatest good to be desired for both of us . The continuance of the perpetual agitation of this conflict which you are insisting on maintaining with me can be profitable only to a few partisan leaders who are seeking to use you as stepping-stones to power , and as instruinents for the restoration of a national bank . I will be indepeadent . I will not again expose myself to tbe fluctuations , uncertainties , and hazards of this connection . Do you withdraw from the political arena , and return to your proper commercial duties . I seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injure sound and healthy credit and business . None but the unsound and insolvent among you can have any fair reason to object to my determination to be // independent , and to maintain a secure , uniform , and constitutional fiscal system , in the discharge of my limited federal duties ; by keeping and disbursing my o vn revenue ; and by confining myself to that only fixed standard of value which is " the law of the land at home and the law of the world abroad , " and to which you acknowledge it to be your own highest duty to conform your own paper emissions -- though the misfortune , from which I desire to be hereafter exempt , is that you are perpetually wandering far and wide from it . ' Such is the langu%e of the Administration to the Banks . On the other hand what is theirs to the Government ? You shall not be independent of us . You shall not collect and disburse your revenue yourself . You shall not anchor the Treasury of the country by that obsoicte and nncivilized standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that it is a humbug . Constitution or no Constitution , we will regulate the currency for you as for the rest of the people , and yon shall have nothing to do with any other standard than our paper . If the people are content with it , what right have you to complain of it ? We will not rest on our own capital , credit , and our commercial business alone ,  --  you shall give us your credit and especial countenance also . And if you do not surrender at once at discretion , and submit to our dictation , without further impertinent discussions of the principles on which we are organized and conduct our business , we will sweep you out of power , as summarily as we overwhelmed you in the New York elections of last fall . ' Such are substantially the respective attitudes of the Administration and the banks . Which is to prevail ? Of the answer which will be returned by the Democracy of the United States , with whom the decision rests , we have not the slightest misgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language to the banks . It is to a reckless body of ambitious politicians that it ought rather to be attributed ,  --  who are moving heaven and hell to overthrow the Administration , to place themselves in the seat of power . They were defeated on the ground of a National Bank on which they before made the same attempt . They have now assumed that of the special championship of the State banks , which they then so bitterly attacked . For this they seek to convulse the country with panic , and to blind it with the grossest delusions . For this they take the whole system , with all its evils and abuses , to their arms , endorsing and defending every thing ; and falsely charge the Administration with a design to destroy it , and with a general hostility to credit and commerce . False friends they , to the very system in behalf of the evils and abuses of which they are now so clamorous ! They do not conceal , though they attempt to keep for the present in the the back-ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can get the power intrusted to their hands ,  --  an institution which shall constitute an absolute moneyed despotism over // 320 The Political Crisis . the State banks as over the whole country , its laws , its liberties , its property , and its government ,  --  which shall have the power , as the late one once boasted , to crush any of the lesser banks at pleasure ,  - -  which shall have the use of the public revenue , and a preference over all the others in the receii*ability of its paper ,  --  which shall have a monopoly of the business of exchanges , and the power of working the machinery of the currency at pleasure , as its central and controlling main-spring . The question is not between the State banks and the Administration , but between the latter , on the one hand , and the Federal party and National Bank , on the other . The State banks are used only as temporary instruments to be frightened and deluded into a present subserviency to one of the most stupendous schemes of partisan ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice . But it will not succeed ! It can not succeed . The pyramid of the democratic cause may be shaken by temporary shocks , but it can not be overturned . All these popular delusions and panics soon exhaust themselves , and obey the general law of reaction . Great is truth , and it will prevail . Our confidence in the people is unwavering ,  --  and in this sign we shall conquer . Our party will come forth from the present crisis , redeemed , regenerated , and disenthralled . ' This is the last desperate effort of the Whigs . The independence of the public treasury being once established , their cause falls prostrate . It is evident to every one ; it is felt fully by themselves . Their principal leaders must retire in despair from the vain task of battling like the waves with the rock of democracy . The main body of their party , and of the rising generation , will be relieved from their artificial state of prejudice and delusion generated by party excitement , and must obey the natural impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and become democratic . The paralyzing incubus of a large anti-popular minority upon the free action and developement of the democratic principle in our system , will thus become in a considerable degree lightened . A splendid career is opening upon our party , and its high and holy cause ; a new era is indced , as remarked in the commencement of this article , dawning upon our country ; arid it requires but firmness , courage , and confidence in those great principles which can never deceive or fail , to carry it safely through the present crisis , to the realization of those noble and glorious hopes.
