Lords of Council , Priest , Messengers , Sentinels , &c.; Main text ACT I. SCENE I. Pasquali the poet 's chamber . Fiametta mending his hose while he writes . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Why dost thou never write verses upon me ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Didst thou ever hear of a cauliflower struck by lightning ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write of me than of Minerva thou talkst of . Did she ever mend thy hose for thee ? PASQUALI . Pasquali There is good reason to doubt if Minerva ever had hose on her leg . FIAMETTA . Fiametta There now ! She can be no honest woman ! I thought so when thou saidst she was most willing at night . PASQUALI . Pasquali If thy ignorance were not endless , I would instruct thee in the meanings of poetry . But thou'lt call Jupiter a cow driver , till the thunderbolt thou takest for a bunch of twigs , strike thee dead for profanity . This once understand : Minerva is no woman , but wit ; and when the poet speaks of unwilling Minerva , he talks of sluggish wit  --  that hath nothing to do with chastity . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Are there two names for all things then , Master Pasquali ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Ay  --  nearly . FIAMETTA . Fiametta What is the learned name for honest wife ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Spouse . FIAMETTA . Fiametta When shall I be thy spouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy mind to forego all hope of living in poetry . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Nay , if I am not to be put in verse , I may as well have a plain man for a husband . PASQUALI . Pasquali If thou wouldst be put in verse , thou shalt have no husband at all . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Now , wilt thou tell me why  --  in good common words , Master Pasquali ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Thus :  --  dost thou think Petrarch had e'er made Laura so famous if she had been honestly his wife ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta An she were thrifty , I think he might . PASQUALI . Pasquali I tell thee no ! His sonnets had then been as dull as the praises of the just . No man would remember them . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Can no honest women be famous then ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Virtue disqualifies . There is no hope for her in poetry if she be not a sinner . Mention me the most famous woman in history . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Helen of Troy , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more virtuous than she ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta Nay  --  that were presumption . PASQUALI . Pasquali Knowst thou why she is sung in an Iliad ? I will tell thee : being the wife to Menelaus , she ran away with the prince of Troy . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Then is it a shame to remember her . PASQUALI . Pasquali So thou sayst in thy ignorance . Yet for that sin she hath been remembered near three thousand years . Look through all poetry , and thou'lt find it thrives upon making sinners memorable . To be famous , thou must sin . Wilt thou qualify ? A rap at the door . PAGE . Giulio Master Pasquali ! Master Pasquali ! FIAMETTA . Fiametta Holy Virgin ! it is my mistress 's page . An ' I be found here now , I were as qualified as Helen of Troy . She conceals herself . Enter the Page . PASQUALI . Pasquali How now , Master Giulio ! Thou'rt impatient . PAGE . Giulio Zounds , Pasquali ! If thou hadst been a prince , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pasquali If thou wert of age to relish true philosophy , I could prove to thee that the poet were the better waited for of the two . But what is thy errand ? PAGE . Giulio A song  --  I want a new song ! PASQUALI . Pasquali To what tune ? PAGE . Giulio To a new tune on the old theme . Could I tell thee a secret without danger now ! Hast thou ne'er a cat that will mew it out ? PASQUALI . Pasquali No ! not even a wall that has ears . What is thy news ? PAGE . Giulio My mistress Bianca hath lost all taste for my singing ! PASQUALI . Pasquali A pin 's head might pay for that news . PAGE . Giulio But , good Pasquali , wilt thou not write me a new song ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Upon what theme ? PAGE . Giulio Sforza  --  still Sforza ! But it must be melancholy . PASQUALI . Pasquali Why melancholy ? PAGE . Giulio Did I not tell thee once in confidence that she loved him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his praise . PAGE . Giulio I now tell thee in confidence that she hath lost him ; for she is to marry Lionel of Ferrara ! PASQUALI . Pasquali Here 's news indeed . PAGE . Giulio It 's the Duke 's will , and my Lady is grieved to the degree I tell thee . She 'll have none of my music . Wilt thou write me the song ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Must it be mournful , say you ? PAGE . Giulio Ay  --  as the jug-jug of her nightingale . She 's full of tears . Wilt thou write it now ? Shall I hold the ink while thou writest it ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Bless the boy 's wits ! Dost thou think songs are made like pancakes , by turning the hand over ? PAGE . Giulio Why , is't not in thy head ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Ay  --  it is . PAGE . Giulio And how long will it take thee to write eight lines upon parchment ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Not long  --  if Minerva were willing . PAGE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pasquali Ay  --  if thou wilt leave me presently . PAGE . Giulio Farewell then ! Let it be melancholy , good Pasquali . Exit . Fiametta comes out . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Now must I hurry to my Mistress , ere that monkey-page gets to the palace . PASQUALI . Pasquali Stands he well with her ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta If he were her born child , she could not love him more . She fancies the puppy-dog has an eye of her color . Good day , Master Pasquali ! PASQUALI . Pasquali Stay ! will she marry this Lionel , think you ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta Can you know any thing by tears ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Not so much by a woman 's  --  but doth your lady weep ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta Ay  --  like an aqueduct ! PASQUALI . Pasquali Then it 's more like she loves than hates him ! FIAMETTA . Fiametta Now , enlighten me that ! PASQUALI . Pasquali Thus :  --  a woman , if she be a lady ( for clowns like thee , are of a constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , hath usually in her composition , two spirits  --  one angelical , the other diabolical . Now , if you stir me up the devil , he will frown  --  but if you touch me the angel , he will weep ! If your lady weep , therefore , it is more like this match hath waked the angel than stirr 'd the devil  --  for I never saw woman yet , who , if her heart were cross 'd , would not play the devil ere she knock 'd under ! FIAMETTA . Fiametta How canst thou think such brave thoughts on what does not concern thee ! PASQUALI . Pasquali Does it concern me if I shall live for ever ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta Surely it doth ! PASQUALI . Pasquali By what shall I live then ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta By faith in the catechism , I think ! PASQUALI . Pasquali By poetry , I tell thee ! And now digest this paradox ! Tho ' poetry be full of lies , it is unworthy to be called poetry if it be not true as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true which is false ? PASQUALI . Pasquali I will show thee ! Thy lady 's page would have a song , now , full of lamentation for Sforza . In it , I should say , the heavens wept  --  ( which would be a lie )  --  that the winds whispered mournfully his name , ( which would be a lie , ) and that life without him were but music out of tune , ( which would be a consumed lie ! ) Yet if she loved Sforza , see you not that my verses , which are nothing but lies , have a poetic truth . When if she love him not  --  they are poetically false ! FIAMETTA . Fiametta ' T is like thy flatteries then ! When thou sayst my cheek is like a peach , it is true , because it hath down upon it , and so hath a peach  --  yet it is false  --  because my cheek hath no stone in it ! PASQUALI . Pasquali Let me taste the savour of that peach . Thou art wiser than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PASQUALI . Pasquali Find me out if she love him ! I would fain write no more verses on Sforza  --  whom I hate that he hath only a brute courage , and no taste for poesy . Now , Lionel 's father was Petrarch 's friend , and thy lady loving my verses , it were more convenient if she loved Lionel , who would love them too . Go thy ways now . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Farewell , Master Pasquali ! PASQUALI . Pasquali Stay  --  there be rude men in this poor quarter , I will come with thee to the piazza . Come along , Mistress ! SCENE II . The Camp before Milan . The tent of Sforza at the side and watchfires in the distance . Enter Sforza and Brunorio . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Is the guard set ? BRUNORIO . Brunorio All set , my Lord ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza And blaze The watch-fires where I ordered ? BRUNORIO . Brunorio Every one . Hold you your purpose , Sir ? SFORZA . Francesco Sforza To-night , at twelve , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed for the last time . Brunorio ! BRUNORIO . Brunorio You seem disturb 'd , Sir . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza I would have to-night The best blood up that ever rose for Sforza . Are your spears resolute ? BRUNORIO . Brunorio As yourself , my Lord ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza We 'll sleep in Milan then . By heaven , I know not Why I have waited on the changing pleasure Of this old Duke so long . BRUNORIO . Brunorio Twelve years ago He promised you his daughter . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Did he not ? And every year he has renew 'd and broken This promise of alliance . BRUNORIO . Brunorio Can you hold Milan against the Florentine , my Lord ? ' T is said the fair Bianca is betroth 'd To their ally Ferrara ! They will join Naples against you , and cry out " usurper ! " SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Ay  --  I have thought o n't . I 'm the second Sforza ! The first hew 'd wood ! There lies enough to bar me , Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this whip I have been driv'n so long  --  ' T is by the bait of this old man 's alliance I have for ten years fought the wars of Milan . They 've fool 'd me year by year , and still found means With their curs 'd policy , to put me off  --  And , by the saints , they 've reason . Could I point The world to such a thread twixt me and Milan As weaves a spider thro ' the summer air , I 'd hang a crown upon it . Once possess 'd Of a fair seat in Lombardy , my spears Would glisten in St. Mark 's ! BRUNORIO . Brunorio And thence to Naples ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Ay  --  with what speed we might ! My brave lieutenant , You echo my own thought ! Enter a sentinel . SENTINEL . Sentinel A flag of truce By torch-light comes from Milan . Enter Sarpellione , in haste . SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Noble Sforza ! I 've rudely used my privilege to seek you ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarpellione If I might speak to you a timely word In haste and privacy ? SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Brunorio , leave us ! SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione A flag of truce comes presently from Milan With terms of peace . The Duke would give his daughter To save his capital . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza The Duke does well ! SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione You 'll wed her then ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza If fairly offer 'd me , Free of all other terms save peace between us , I 'll wed her freely . SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Then I pray you pardon ! You 're not the Sforza that should be the son Of him who made the name ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Bold words , ambassador ! But you are politic , and speak advisedly . What bars my marriage with Duke Philip 's daughter ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Brief  --  for this herald treads upon my heels  --  Bianca was not born in wedlock ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Well ! SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione She 's been betrothed to other suitors  --  SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thro ' her inherit . The ducal crown ? Is't well to have a wife Who has made up her mind to other husband  --  Who has been sold to every paltry prince Twixt Sicily and Venice ? SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Is that all ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione No  --  nor the best of it . There lives a son , By the same mother , to the Duke of Milan . SFORZA , Francesco Sforza ( seizing him by the arm . ) Said you a son ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione A son !  --  and  --  had I time  --  SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Without there ! Pray the embassy from Milan To grant me but a moment . Turning to Sarpellione . Is it sure ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Upon the honor of my royal master , Who 'll make it good . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Have you authority For what you say ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione In court or camp , Alfonso Will prove this story true . His mother fled , As the world knows  --  in peril of her life  --  To Naples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke  --  I well remember . SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Ere he could demand her From young Alfonso , newly king , she died ; But in her throes brought prematurely forth A son ; whom , fearing for his life , she hid , And rear 'd him , ever like a Prince , till now . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Some fourteen years . SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Scarce that  --  but he is forward , And feels his blood already . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Say he does  --  What make you out of it to change my purpose ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Seeing you can not thrive by conquering Milan , Which Milan 's allies will pluck back from you To put the prince upon his father 's seat  --  My royal master wishes you forewarned . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza He 's kind  --  if that is all ! SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione He 'd make a friend Of the best sword in Italy . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza What scheme Lies under this ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione No scheme  --  but your own glory ! Your star stoops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war on Florence ! ( More earnestly . ) He 'll add Ravenna to your marquisate For but a thousand spears ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza I 'll take Ravenna Without his leave ! Admit the herald there ! No , Count ! your policy has overshot ! The King Alfonso needs no spears of mine  --  But he would have them farther off from Milan  --  A blind mole would see that ! SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione My Lord ! My Lord ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Hear me , Sarpellione ! I have been Too long the sport of your fine policy ! With promises of power and fair alliance I 've fought for every prince in Italy  --  And against all , in turn ; now leagued with Venice To beat back Florence from the Brenta ; now With Florence against Milan ; then with Milan To drive the Tuscan home again , and all For my own glory , by some politic reason . I 'll have a place , or I 'll be in the track o n't  --  Where the poor honor that my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's daughter I set my foot in Milan . My poor laurels , Such as they are , shall root there !  --  and , by heaven , I 'll find a way to make their branches flourish ! Call in the herald , there ! SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione But Lionel , Prince of Ferrara , whom Bianca loves  --  SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Glory has been my mistress many years And will suffice me still . If it should chance Bianca loves another , ' t is an evil To wed with me , which I will recompense With chainless freedom after . In my glory She 'll find a bright veil that will hide all errors , Save from the heart that pardons her . SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Farewell ! You 'll hear o ' the young Prince soon ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza I 'll never wrong him  --  If there be one !  --  Our stars will rise together ! There 's room enough ! Exit Sarpellione and enter Rossano . Fair welcome , brave Rossano ! I know your news . ROSSANO . Rossano The Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers me his daughter  --  is't not so ? ROSSANO . Rossano Seeing your preparations as I came I marvel you anticipate so well ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza A bird i ' th ' air brings news , they say  --  but this Came by a serpent . How 's the spear-wound now , You took for me at Pisa ? Brave Rossano ! We 'll break a lance once more in company . It warms my blood to find myself again O ' the same side . Come out in th ' open air ! We 'll talk more freely , as we used to do , Over a watch-fire . Come out , old comrade ! Exeunt Sforza and Rossano . SCENE III . The apartment of Bianca . Fiametta embroidering , and the Page thrumming his guitar . PAGE . Giulio I 'd give my greyhound now  --  gold collar and silken leash  --  to know why the Duke sent for my lady . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Would you , Master Curiosity ? PAGE . Giulio Mistress Pert , I would  --  and thy acquaintance into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come honestly by . I would you knew as well how your mistress came by you . PAGE . Giulio I came to her from heaven  --  like her taste for my music . ( Hums a tune . ) FIAMETTA . Fiametta Did you ! do they make sacks in heaven ? PAGE . Giulio There 's a waiting woman 's question for you ! Why sacks ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta Because I think you came in one , like a present of a puppy-dog . PAGE . Giulio Silence , dull pin-woman ! here comes my mistress ! Takes off his cap as Bianca enters . She walks across the stage without heeding her attendants . BIANCA . Bianca Visconti To marry Sforza ! My dream come true ! my long , long cherish 'd dream ! The star come out of heaven that I had worshipp 'd ! The paradise I built with soaring fancy And filled with rapture like a honey-bee Dropp 'd from the clouds at last ! Am I awake ?  --  Am I awake , dear Giulio ? PAGE . Giulio ( Half advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visconti Thank God they speak to me ! It is no dream ! It was this hand my father took to tell me  --  It was with these lips that I tried to speak  --  It was this heart that beat its giddy prison As if th ' exulting joy new-sprung within it Would out and fill the world ! ..... ..... Wed him to-morrow ! So suddenly a wife ! Will it seem modest , With but twelve hours of giddy preparation To come a bride to church ! Will he remember I was ten years ago affianced to him ? I have had time to think o n't ! Oh , I 'll tell him  --  When I dare speak I 'll tell him  --  how I 've lov 'd him ! And day and night dream 'd of him , and thro ' all The changing wars treasured the solemn troth Broke by my father ! If he listens kindly , I 'll tell him how I fed my eyes upon him In Venice at his triumph  --  when he walk 'd Like a descended god beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people .

Giulio In four years more I shall bear sword and lance . There 'll be no Sforza To kill when I 'm a man ! Who took him , Lady ? BIANCA . Bianca Visconti A blind boy , scarcely bigger than yourself ; And gave him , bound , to me ! In brief , dear Giulio ! Not to perplex those winking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weds to-morrow Your happy mistress ! PAGE . Giulio Sforza ! We shall have A bonfire then ! BIANCA . Bianca Visconti Ay  --  twenty ! PAGE . Giulio And you 'll live Here in the palace , and have masks and gambols The year round , will you not ? BIANCA . Bianca Visconti My pretty minion , You know not yet what love is ! Love 's a miser , That plucks his treasure from the prying world And grudges e'en the eye of daylight on it ! Another 's look is theft  --  another 's touch Robs it of all its value . Love conceives No paradise but such as Eden was With two hearts beating in it . Leaves the Page , and walks thoughtfully away . Oh , I 'll build A home upon some green and flowery isle In the lone lakes , where we will use our empire Only to keep away the gazing world . The purple mountains and the glassy waters Shall make a hush 'd pavilion with the sky , And we two in the midst will live alone , Counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of sleep ! To bed , dear Giulio !

People kneeling round the steps , and the organ heard within . Enter Pasquali and Fiametta in haste . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Now , Master Pasquali ! said I not we should be too late ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Truly , there seems no room ! FIAMETTA . Fiametta And I her first serving-woman ! If it were my own wedding I should not grieve more to have miss 'd it . You would keep scribbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PASQUALI . Pasquali Consider , Mistress Fiametta ! I had no news of this marriage till the chimes began ; and the epithalamium must be writ ! I were shamed else , being the bard of Milan . FIAMETTA . Fiametta The what , of Milan ? PASQUALI . Pasquali The bard , I say ! Come aside , and thou shalt be consoled . I 'll read thee my epithalamium . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Is it something to ask money of the bridegroom ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Dost thou think I would beg ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta Nay  --  thou'rt very poor ! PASQUALI . Pasquali Look thee , Mistress Fiametta ! that 's a vulgar error , thou hadst best be rid of . I , whom thou callest poor , am richer than the Duke . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Now if thou'rt not out of thy ten senses , the Virgin bless us . PASQUALI . Pasquali I 'll prove it even to thy dull apprehension . Answer me truly . How many meals eats the Duke in a day ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta Three , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So does Pasquali ! How much covering has he ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta Nay  --  what keeps him warm . PASQUALI . Pasquali So has Pasquali ! How much money carries he on his person ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta None , I think . He is a Duke , and needs none . PASQUALI . Pasquali Even so Pasquali ! He is a Poet , and needs none . What good does him the gold in his treasury ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta He thinks of it . PASQUALI . Pasquali So can Pasquali ! What pleasure hath he in his soldiers ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta They keep him safe in his palace . PASQUALI . Pasquali So they do Pasquali in his chamber . Thus far , thou'lt allow , my state is as good as his  --  and better  --  for I can think of his gold , and sleep safe by his soldiers , yet have no care of them . FIAMETTA . Fiametta I warrant he has troubled thoughts . PASQUALI . Pasquali Thou sayst well . Answer me once more , and I 'll prove to thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dare swear , of imagination . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Is't a Pagan nation or a Christian ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Stay  --  I 'll convey it to thee by a figure . What were the value of thy red stockings over black , if it were always night ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta None . PASQUALI . Pasquali What were beauty if it were always dark ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta The same as none . PASQUALI . Pasquali What were green leaves better than brown  --  diamonds better than pebbles  --  gold better than brass  --  if it were always dark ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta No better , truly . PASQUALI . Pasquali Then the shining of the sun , in a manner , dyes your stockings , creates beauty , makes gold and diamonds , and paints the leaves green ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta I think it doth . PASQUALI . Pasquali Now mark ! There be gems in the earth , qualities in the flowers , creatures in the air , the Duke ne'er dreams of . There be treasuries of gold and silver , temples and palaces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit at  --  and all seen only by a sun , which , to the Duke , is black as Erebus . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Lord ! Lord ! Where is it , Master Pasquali ? PASQUALI . Pasquali In my head ! ( Fiametta discovers signs of fear . ) All these gems , treasuries , palaces , and fairy harmonies I see by the imagination I spoke of . Am I not richer now ? FIAMETTA , Fiametta ( retreating from him . ) The Virgin help us ! He thinks there 's a sun in his head ! I thought to have married him , but he 's mad ! She falls to weeping . The cathedral is flung open , and the organ plays louder . The bridal procession comes out of church and passes across the stage . As they pass Pasquali , he offers his epithalamium to Sforza .

For there is one  --  I 'll prove it when you will  --  And he will murder him to take his crown . PASQUALI . Pasquali How know you that ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Alphonso , king of Naples , Would have this usurpation and this murder In time prevented . PASQUALI . Pasquali How ! SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione By Sforza 's death . There 's no way else  --  but ' t is a dangerous theme To talk on here  --  come out o ' the way a little , And you shall have such reasons for the deed  --  PASQUALI , Pasquali ( flings him from him with contempt . ) What " deed !

Rossano She 's loving in her nature , and methought Seem 'd griv 'd when you came forth ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza I should have thought so , But that I had some private information She lov 'd another ! ROSSANO . Rossano You 're perhaps abused ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Nay  --  nay  --  how should she love me ? I 'm well on To my meridian , see you !  --  a rough soldier  --  Who never learn 'd the courtly phrase of love . And she  --  the simplest maiden in a cot , Is not more tender-eyed , nor has a heart Apter to know love 's lesson ere ' t is time . She 's loved ere now , Rossano ! ROSSANO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Rude ! I 'll make This forced link that policy puts on her Loose as a smoke-curl ! She shall know no master , And be no slave for me ! ROSSANO . Rossano You 'll not neglect her ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza The sun of woman 's world is love , Rossano ! When that sun sets , if no unpitying cloud Trouble her sky , there rises oftentimes A crescent moon of memory , whose light Makes the dark pathway clear again . Bianca 's May have gone down for me ! I 'll be no cloud To mar the moon as well . ROSSANO . Rossano Stand by  --  there comes A footfall this way . ( They stand aside . ) Enter Pasquali , hiccupping , and talking to himself . PASQUALI . Pasquali That wine was grown on Vesuvius . That 's the reason it makes such an eruption . If it breaks out o ' the top o ' my head now  --  as I think it will  --  for it gets hotter and hotter  --  I shall know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROSSANO , Rossano ( aside . ) Stay  --  my Lord ! This is Pasquali , whose verses Bianca sometimes sings to her lute . Ten to one now but you may gather from his drunkenness if Bianca loves another .

Pasquali Ay  --  that 's better ! For we 're all merry  --  except the bride . And that 's the way of it . ROSSANO . Rossano What 's the way of it ? PASQUALI . Pasquali See here ! Who is it that never weeps at a funeral ? ROSSANO . Rossano You shall tell me . PASQUALI . Pasquali The dead man , that hath most cause . ROSSANO . Rossano And what hath that to do with a bridal ? PASQUALI . Pasquali A great deal . Of all people at a bridal , who should be most merry ? Why , the bride ! now I have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROSSANO . Rossano For what cause , think you ? PASQUALI . Pasquali There are some things which can have but one cause . There 's but one cause for drunkenness , and there 's but one for grief on a wedding-day . ROSSANO . Rossano And what 's that ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Wine  --  causes drunkenness ! ROSSANO . Rossano And what causes grief in a bride ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Want of love for the bridegroom . ROSSANO . Rossano How know you that , sir ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Listen to in-spi-ra-tion ! " When first young Lionel did catch mine eye , Sforza , the valiant , pass 'd unheeded by ! " ROSSANO . Rossano Villain ! these are thine own lying verses ! PASQUALI , Pasquali ( pulling out his sword . ) The figures of speech are lies of verse . But if thou sayest it is a lie that Bianca loves Lionel best , thou liest in prose , and so , come on ! ( Attacks Rossano , and Sforza comes forward , and strikes up their swords . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come away , Rossano . He writes what 's palatable , and but echoes That which is rung at court . She loved this Prince  --  Sarpellione told me so before . We 'll to the field and our old mistress , glory . Come on  --  we 'll talk of battles and forget her . Exeunt . PASQUALI . Pasquali Fighting 's not my vocation ; but I have an itching that way , and I 'll after him . Halloo ! Were there two men ? I think there were two . The last man called me a drunkard ! That 's no offence ! a poet may be a drunkard ! But " villain ! " that 's incompatible , and must be prick 'd back . Halloo ! Exit . SCENE IV . Bianca 's chamber at midnight . She sits on a couch in a white undress , and Sforza beside her in his armor . BIANCA . Bianca Visconti Dost think this ring a pretty one , my Lord ? SFORZA . Francesco Sforza Ay , ' t is a pretty ring ! I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring his wife sent  --  but you 've heard the story ? BIANCA . Bianca Visconti I think I never heard it . SFORZA . Francesco Sforza She 's a woman The heart grows but to speak of . She was held A hostage by the Milanese , ( I pray you Pardon the mention , ) when , twixt them and me Marancio held a pass . Her life was threatened If by his means I crossed the Adige . She  --  ( Brave heart ! I warm to speak of her ! ) found means To send to him this ring ; wherein is writ " He who loves most , loves honor best . " You 'll see it Here o ' th ' inside . BIANCA . Bianca Visconti Did you see this Lady ? SFORZA . Francesco Sforza I hazarded a battle three days after With perilous odds , only to bring her off  --  And would have sold my life for't . BIANCA . Bianca Visconti Did you see her ? SFORZA . Francesco Sforza I gave her to Marancio when I took The ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak you so warmly Of any other woman ? SFORZA , Francesco Sforza ( rising and taking his helmet . ) Nay , I know not . There are some qualities that woman have Which are less worthy , but which warm us more Than speaking of their virtues . I remember The fair Giovanna in her pride at Naples . Gods ! what a light enveloped her ! She left Little to shine in history  --  but her beauty Was of that order that the universe Seem 'd govern 'd by her motion . Men look 'd on her As if her next step would arrest the world ; And as the sea-bird seems to rule the wave He rides so buoyantly , all things around her  --  The glittering army , the spread gonfalon The pomp , the music , the bright sun in heaven  --  Seem 'd glorious by her leave . BIANCA , Bianca Visconti ( rising and going to the window . ) There 's emulation Of such sweet praise , my Lord ! Did you not hear The faint note of a nightingale ? SFORZA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methought ! They change The sentinels perchance . ' T is time Rossano Awaits me on the ramparts . BIANCA . Bianca Visconti Not to-night ? Go not abroad again to-night , my Lord ! SFORZA . Francesco Sforza For a brief hour , sweet ! The old soldier loves To gossip of the fields he 's lost and won , And I , no less , to listen . Get to bed ! I 'll follow you anon . Exit Sforza . BIANCA . Bianca Visconti He does not love me ! I never dream 'd of this ! To be his bride Was all the Heav'n I look 'd for ! Not to love me When I have been ten years affianced to him !  --  When I have liv 'd for him  --  shut up my heart , With every pulse and hope , for his use only  --  Worshipp 'd  --  oh God ! idolatrously lov 'd him ! ..... Why has he sought to marry me ? Why still Renew the broken pledge my father made him ? Why , for ten years , with war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ..... He must love me , Or I shall break my heart ! I never had One other hope in life ! I never link 'd One thought , but to this chain ! I have no blood  --  No breath  --  no being  --  separate from Sforza ! Nothing has any other name ! The sun Shined like his smile  --  the lightning was his glory  --  The night his sleep , and the hush 'd moon watch 'd o'er him ;  --  Stars writ his name  --  his breath hung on the flowers  --  Music had no voice but to say I love him , And life no future , but his love for me ! Whom does he love ? Marancio 's wife ? He prais 'd Only her courage ! Queen Giovanna 's beauty ? ' T is dust these many years ! There is no sign He loves another ; and report said ever His glory was his mistress . Can he love ? Shame on the doubt ! ' T was written in the ring " He who loves most loves honor best "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart . And so , I breathe again ! To make him love me Is all my life now ! to pry through his nature , And find his heart out . That 's wrapt in his glory ! I 'll feed his glory then ! He praised Giovanna That she was royal and magnificent  --  Ay  --  that 's well thought on , too ! How should an eye . Dazzled with war and warlike pomp like Sforza 's , Find pleasure in simplicity like mine ! ( Looks at her dress . ) I 'm a Duke 's daughter , and I 'll wear the look o n't ! Unlock my jewels and my costly robes , And while I keep his show-struck eye upon me , Watch for a golden opportunity To build up his renown ! ..... ..... And so farewell The gentle world I 've liv 'd in ! Farewell all My visions of a world for two hearts only  --  Sforza 's and mine ! If I outlive this change , So brief and yet so violent within me , I 'll come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a broken heart blots out remembrance . Exit into her bridal chamber , which is seen beyond on opening the door . END OF THE SECOND ACT . ACT III . SCENE I. An ante-chamber of the palace . Brunorio leaning sullenly on his sword by the door . Enter Sarpellione . SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione What 's this ?  --  the brave Brunorio turned lackey ? BRUNORIO . Brunorio Nay , Count ! I wait my turn . SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione If a civilian May have a judgment of a soldier 's duty , You 're out of place , sir ! This is not the camp ! You 're not on guard here ! There 's a difference Twixt patience at your post , and kicking heels In my Lord 's antechamber ! BRUNORIO . Brunorio By the saints My own thought , noble Count ! As you came in I brooded o n't .

I have mark 'd his brows Blackening upon Rossano , who usurps His confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous thunder-cloud  --  I 'll see the depth o n't . ) Sforza knows you 're here ? BRUNORIO . Brunorio I had a message by a varlet page , Who bid me wait here . SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione By a page ? Sacristie ! Fair treatment for a soldier ! Say , Brunorio ! What was't I heard of the Pope 's standard-bearer Clove to the wrist ? BRUNORIO . Brunorio Heard you of that , my Lord ? You see the weapon , here ! SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Was't thine , i ' faith ? I thought promotion had been won with service ! Was't thou , indeed ? I heard the King Alfonso Say ' t was the best blow and the bravest follow 'd He 'd know in his time . How it came to his ears I know not  --  but he made the court ring with it ! BRUNORIO . Brunorio The King ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione How long since thou wast made lieutenant ? BRUNORIO . Brunorio Five years come March ! SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Zounds ! how this peasant 's son Treads merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave Brunorio ! ( Rossano passes out . ) Ay  --  there ! That man cuts off your sunshine , or I know Nothing of courts ! I , that have no part in it , Have mark 'd how you are slighted for Rossano ! Forgive my touching o n't ! ' T is my respect For a brave soldier makes me speak so freely . But were I of your counsel  --  BRUNORIO . Brunorio Noble Count , My heart speaks thor ' your lips . Since this Rossano Has had my Lord 's ear , I 've been thrust aside Like a disgrac 'd hound . SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Frankly , brave Brunorio ! And between us ,  --  I 've heard you lightly mentioned By this ungrateful Sforza ! BRUNORIO . Brunorio How , my Lord ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione I would not tell you but to serve you in it  --  He told Rossano , there , that you had strength , And struck a sharp blow  --  and so did an axe ! But for your brains  --  and then he tossed his head  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brunorio Curse on him ! I 've a sharp blow left yet  --  and brains enough To find a time to strike it ! Did you say Alfonso had spoke well of me , my Lord ? SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione So well , that , on my own authority  --  If you 'd take service with a better master  --  You 're Captain from this hour . BRUNORIO . Brunorio My Lord ! So promptly I take your offer , that your commendations Will find no swifter bearer that myself To King Alfonso . SARPELLIONE . Sarpellione Stay  --  I 'm not just now On the best terms with Sforza , and you 'll see With half a glance , that while he 's here in Milan His best sword could not leave him for Alfonso , But it would throw suspicion upon me , And touch my credit here . I 'll write your warrant , Which you shall keep , and use it when you please . But for the present shut your bosom up , And bear your wrongs . Sforza awaits you now  --  Go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exit Brunorio . He 's a fit tool !

Pasquali Hast thou no dread of dying uncelebrated ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta If it be sin , I have a dread of it by baptism . PASQUALI . Pasquali Is it a sin to neglect thy immortality ? FIAMETTA . Fiametta Ay  --  it is . PASQUALI . Pasquali Then take heed how thou fallest into sin  --  for to be the friend of a poet is to be immortal , and thou art no friend of mine if I have not thy six pieces . FIAMETTA .

Pasquali Thou wilt live when Sforza is dead ! FIAMETTA . Fiametta Is not Sforza famous , then ? PASQUALI . Pasquali He hath fame while he lives , and so had king Priam of Troy . But if Homer had not written , Priam would have been forgot and Troy too ; and if Sforza live not in poetry , he is as dead in a century  --  as thou and Laura were , but for thy favors to Petrarch and Pasquali . FIAMETTA . Fiametta Why does not Sforza give thee six pieces and be immortal ? PASQUALI . Pasquali Truly  --  he pays more for a less matter ! It is the blindness of great men that they slight the poets . Look here now  --  hath not Sforza shed blood , and wasted treasure , and taken a thousand murders on his soul , to leave a name after him ?
