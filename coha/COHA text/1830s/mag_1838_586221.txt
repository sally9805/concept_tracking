txt IN a former article published in the first number of this journal , we made some remarks upon the work of M. de Tocqueville , entitled Democracy in the United States . We were l ) revented , by circumstances , from pursuing the subject in the following number , as we intended ; but as the book is one of a standard character , and of permanent value , it is not likely to lose its hold upon the public attention ; and it is but recently that it has been brought within the reach of American readers , by the republication of an English translation . We are glad to learn , that a second production of the same author , in which he treats of the state of society in this country , is going through the press . We express this opinion of the work of M. de Tocqueville , not because we agree with him in nil his views respecting our institutions , or even in some of those which he appears to consider as the most important . his residence among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to collect as the results of his own observation were , of course , comparatively scanty , and often susceptible of much correction . This conclusions are , necessarily , in many cases , questionable or erroneous , as we have shown them to be in several instances , in our preceding article . But his observations , even when they are more or less liable to criticism , are always those of a really profound and vigorous thinker , equal to the great subject which he undertakes to treat , discussing it in good faith , and expressing his thoughts in a po*verful and elegant style . As such , they are full of interest for all who are fitted , by their previous course of study and reflection , to follow the author on his arduous track , which , however , he adorns throughout with the fairest flowers of a pure and chastened eloquence. rhey are the first observations of the kind which our institutions have yet elicited from any foreign mind ; and are far more valuable , even in their errors , than the common-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first volume of this important work is occupied with a summary account of the political institutions of this country , Federal , State , and Municipal , considered merely in their external form and practical operation .

There was , of course , but little danger of any essential error in a writer like M. de Tocqueville ; and this part of the work is not only executed with great ability , but , in almost every particular , with substantial correctness . It may be recommended with safety to the reader , whether native or foreign , as perhaps the best summary account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points it opens views which , if not entirely original , are presented under so striking an aspect , as to wear the appearance of novelty . As an example of these we may mention the author 's remarks upon the new character given to the judiciary department of the government by a written constitution . In countries where there is no written constitution , and where the latest statute repeals all former ones that are in contradiction with it , the judge has nothing to do but to apply the law as declared by the legislature , to the case before him . Where there is a written constitution which controls all the laws , of whatever date , that are inconsistent with it ,  --  of which inconsistency the courts are to judge , - they immediately acquire , and in this country daily exercise , the right of supervising the whole legislation of the State and General Governments , and annulling the laws at discretion when they deem them at variance with constitutional principles or restrictions . This function , which is common to the judiciary departments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the practice of the world . The Supreme Court of the United States , annulling , at discretion , any act of Congress which it may deem unconstitutional ,  --  hearing and deciding at its bar the controversies of twenty-six sovereign States ,  --  and even , as we have seen in a late instance , issuing its mandamus to the highest Executive authorities of the IJnion ,  --  is a spectacle ,  --  certainly imposing ,  --  dangerous , in the opinion of many , to liberty ,  --  but at all events , entirely unexampled in history . We are not , however , among those who entertain a very exaggerated opinion of the political importance of the judiciary department of the Government , whether for good or evil . We do not feel the apprehensions entertained by some , from its encroachments on the rights of the coordinate departments ; nor do we look to it , with others , as a mighty sheet-anchor , by virtue of which the ship of State is to ride out in safety , through all future time , the hurricanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider its functions and powers as merely ministerial ; in no way dangerous to liberty  --  the abuse of them bringing in its train its own remedy ; and withal as affording no protection against the perils to which our institutions are really liable ; highly important in the business of practical life , to which they are habitually applied , but having little or no bearing upon the deeply seated causes , that // secure on the one hand , an.d threaten on the other , the continuance of our Government . But although the judiciary department may be , and probably is , less important in the theory of our Government , than it is generally supposed to be , the new character that is given to it in this country by the existence of written constitutions , is certainly a very curious feature in the aspect of our system , and one which is well worth the attention of the political inquirer . M. de Tocqueville has presented it in his first volume more distinctly and forcibly than any preceding writer with whom we are acquainted . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not very closely connected by any single train of thought running through the whole , upon various causes and circumstances which are supposed by the author to regulate the working of our institutions , and to determine or modify their influence upon the welfa*e of the people . Here he is , of necessity , more exposed to error than in the former volume-first , from the nature of all speculative discussion , which is more uncertain , as such , than a mere exposition of known facts ; and , secondly , from the character of his materials , which are chiefly his own observations ,  --  hastily made in the course of a short tour , devoted , in part , to another definite object ,  --  upon the vast subject of the character of our people , and the theory and practice of our political institutions . The eagle eye of sagacity can see much at a single glance ; but it requires more than a year 's inspection to penetrate and fully comprehend the secret springs and workings of our immense system of confederate sovereignties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mere force of the popular will , that informs , and , in the language of Virgil , agitat molern ,  --  keeps in motion the whole mass . In the results of a cursory survey of such a system , there is a great probability of oicasional error ; and we find , accordingly , in the speculations contained in the second volume of M. de Tocqueville , a good deal that appears to us inconsistent with a correct view of our institutions and history . In our former article we pointed out some of these errors , and particularly those relating to the in*stability of the laws , and the omnipotence of majorities . In regard to both these points the author 's conclusions are so directly opposite to the obvious results of daily experience , that we are really surprised how a writer of so much discernment could have been led by any circumstances to acquiesce in them . The stability of the political institutions of the United States ,  - -  considered as including the State and Federal constitutions , and the statutes enacted under them alL-is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and the one which furnishes the strongest presumption of their future permanence and success . As they now exist , they are nothing more than a full and natural developement of the principles which were brought into action by the first settlers two // 340 European Views of hundred years ago , and which have undergone no essential alteration , except in the single fact of the separation from the parent country . Even this was not so much a change in the character of our institutions as the expulsion of an element that had always been foreign to them , and had never interfered with their practical operation except as a disturbing cause . During the fifty years that have since clapssed ,  --  the most tumultuous and revolutionary half-century that has ever been known in Christendom ,  --  the Government of the United States has suffered no essential , and hardly any formal changes ; for we can not consider as changes in the laws and constitutions of the country the occasional variations of practice that occur from year to year in the details of the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent in the Arabian tales , which could be held in the palm of the hand , but when expanded , at the will of the owner , was large enough to cover an army of a hundred thousand men ,  --  our constitutions , of which the germ may be found in the brief contract concluded between some thirty or forty poor pilgrims on board the Mayflower in Plymouth harbour , have adapted themselves without essential change , and with an almost inconceivable harmony to the expansion of the people , until they now embrace under their broad protecting canopy a confederate Republic of twenty-six States and nearly twenty millions of men . Far from complaining of the instability of our institutions , we never recollect , without a new feeling of delighted admiration , the almost undisturbed quiet with which our country . has pursued her course for the last fifty years through the series of political convulsions , which have shaken to their centre all the neighbouring and kindred nations of the Christian world . We think that M. de Tocqueville will , on farther reflection , revise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of the omnipotence of majorities , to which we adverted at some length in our preceding article . On this head his theory is not less palpably at variance with the most obvious results of daily experience than on the other . The ceaseless fluctuation of opinion upon matters of personal preference and mere administration ,  --  the alternation of triumph and defeat that marks the progress of contending parties ,  - -  the acrimony with which every majority that obtains possession of the government of a State or of the Union , is assailed and opposed , until it is again reduced to a minority , or , finally , by protracted success , *vears out opposition ; - these are the daily signs in our political firmament , not less apparent , and in no way more questionable than is the steadiness with which our essential institutions look down in quiet majesty from their loftier height , upon this war of the elements that is constantly raging around their base . That a really acute and sagacious writer , like M. de Tocqueville , should have been led to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majorities as permanent , oppressive , and irresistible , is a rather curious fact which is probably to be accounted for by some accidental error or preconceived theory . In the chapters immediat*ly following those on the omnipotence of majorities , NI . de Tocqueville enlarges upon certain circumstances which , as he supposes , temper and mitigate their power . The principal of these is the influence of the legal profession . His theory upon this subject , as upon the one just alluded to , is somewhat eccentric , and is not , in our opinion , much more tenable . According to M. de Tocqueville , the influence of the legal profession is , in our institutions , the real and only principle of aristocracy . " If I were requested , " says our author , " to point out the seat of the aristocratic principle in the United States , I should answer , without hesitation , that it is not to be found among the wealthy , who are not combined together by any common bond of interest . The seat of the American aristocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bar . " The more I reflect upon what I have witnessed in the United States , the more fully am I satisfied that the lawyers are the most powerful class in the community , and the only real counterpoise to the influence of the democracy . In the United States we perceive at once how well the spirit that pervades the bar is fitted by its virtues , and even its defects , to neutralize the vices inherent in a popular government . " When the people are under the influence of some temporary excitement or accidental delusion , the lawyers make them feel an almost invisible rein which checks their fury and keeps them within bounds . To the democratic instinct of the mass they oppose their aristocratic tendencies ; to its love of innovation their superstitious respect for antiquity ; to its vast designs their nartow views ; to its contempt for all rule , their taste for forms , and to its fiery ardor their habits of slow and cautious action . " The courts of justice are the instruments through which the legal profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , but it also operates by several other channels . As the lawyers are the only class of educated men who are not distrusted by the people , they are naturally called upon to fill most of the places in the Legislative and Executive departments of the Government . They consequently have a great share in making and administering the laws . They are often obliged to give way to the torrent of public opinion , but it is easy to see what they would do if they were at liberty . " The lawyers form , in the United States , a power , which is very little feared , and is even not much noticed ; which carries no flag of its own ; which yields flexibly to every passing exigency , and follows , without resistance , the movement of the body politic ; but // which , nevertheless , surrounds and embraces that body in all its members ,  --  penetrates into all the classes that compose it ,  --  works upon it secretly , and finally gives it any shape which suits its own pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one just alluded to , of the omnipotence of majorities , and agrees a good deal better , with a merely superficial view of the mode in which the public affairs are conducted in this country . It is no doubt true that the legal profession furnishes a large proportion of the persons employed in the administration of the Government in all its departments , Executive , Legislative , and Judicial . It is also true that a very large proportion of the lawyers so employed habitually act with the political party which represents for the time , under whatever name , the aristocratic principle , and supply that party with its acknowledged and ostensible leaders . From these apparent facts it is not very unnatural for a hasty observer to conclude with M. de Tocqueville that the legal profession form , in fact , the real and substantial basis of the aristocracy , so far as any thing of the kind can be said to exist in this country . The opinion of M. de Tocqueville is accordingly not uncommon among ourselves , and has contributed largely , in connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers as a class . For it is far from being true , as he supposes , that they are less distrusted by the people than other cdiicated men . It is notorious , on the contrary , that as a class , and with the rare exceptions of those who openly espouse the democratic cause , they are decidedly unpopular . A democratic lawyer is , of course , more popular than any other person would be under the same circumstances , precisely for the reason that he resists the tendencies of his own profession in support of what are regarded as the rights and interests of the people . But though a superficial view of the facts alluded to above might lead to the conclusion that the legal profession forms , in fact , the basis of the aristocracy , or rather of the aristocratic tendencies , which are developed , to a greater or less extent , in this country ,  --  a more thorough examination of the subject shows very plainly that this is not the real state of the case . The members of the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents , organs , or , to use a more appropriate term , the attorneys , of the aristocracy . The aristocracy is constituted by the owners of accumulated wealth , and chiefly by the moneyed men of the great commercml cities . These are generally persons educated in the habits of practical life , and not very capable of pleading their own cause before the public . The lawyers undertake to do this for them ; they occupy the foreground ; they fill the legislative halls and the various departments of the Government ; they talk and write upon all occasions , in season and out of season ; in short , they take the respon // sibility , and bear the unpopularity , of keeping up a perpetual warfare upon the democratic tendencies that are constantly in action , and in the end generally carry all before them . The conspicuous position which the lawyers hold in the fore front of the battle , gives them an imposing and formidable aspect . In reality , however , they are merely present in a representative character , and would declaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do against it , if they could be as well paid for their trouble . In saying this we would not be understood to mean any personal disparagement to the individuals composing the legal profession , for many of whom we entertain a high respect . It is no disparagement to any class of men to say that they carry into other pursuits the spirit and genius of their habitual calling . It is only saying that they are subject to the common law of human nature . An individual of strong or eccentric character may escape from the bias imparted by his professional pursuits ; perhaps may take , by reaction , a directly opposite one . This occurs as often in the legal profession as in any other . But the members of every profession , considered as such , must , in general , exhibit , on all occasions , their peculiar professional character . The soldier will be frank and fearless in the ball-room as well as on the field of battle ; the mere  |p01-itician  shrewd and cunning ,  --  as Cardinal de Retz was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  politique aux choux et aux raves ; and the attorney will argue cases at the dinner table or in Congress as naturally as he does at the bar . We remarked above that the real aristocracy of this country is constituted by the owners of accumulated wealth , and particularly the moneyed men of the great commercial cities . This is also the case in all other countries . The basis of the feudal aristocracy of Europe was the possession of the land , which was formerly the only important element of wealth . The progress of trade and the accumulation of capital have introduced in Europe a new aristocracy of money , which has gradually shorn the former of some of its beams , and opened the way for the entrance of the democratic principle into the Government at the expense of both . The possession of accumulated wealth is the only thing which can give an individual substantial political power ; that is , the power of commanding the services of others . Superiority in intellectual and physical qualities , natural or acquired ,  --  strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  are only so many means of rendering service to others with greater facility or effect . But to render services is a very different thing from commanding them . The exercise of these valuable qualities may produce wealth , and bring with it political power ; but their possessors , as such , are the servants , and not the masters or rulers , of those who employ them . This is the position of the lawyers as a class in relation to the moneyed men . The only lucra // tive part of a lawyer 's business is that which is connected with the management of property , and especially property accumulated in large masses , and employed in an active way . The lawyers , as a class , depend for success in life upon being employed by the owners of property , and particularly of accumulated property . They are , therefore , virtually , with all their superiority of education , and , as a body , of intellectual power , the mere agents , factors , or , in one word , servants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go at all into politics ,  --  which the most prudent carefully avoid ,  --  is entirely subordinate to the professional , which furnishes their means of subsistence ; and they fall , accordingly , without effort , into any political course which the interest of their employers may happen to dictate . M* de rfocqueville remarks that the seat of aristocracy in this country is not among the men of wealth , because they are not united by any common bond of interest . This is a great and very obvious error . The possessors of accumulated wealth are , in the first place , united together by the community of habits , tastes , and pursuits , resulting from their peculiar position and , secondly , what is of more importance , and is -- for the present purpose  --  the governing consideration ,  --  they are very closely combined together by their apprehensions of the same common enemy . The possessors of accumulated wealth are aware that they constitute , in every community , a small minority ; - that they enjoy a peculiar , accidental advan tage , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - and that they have no means of defending this advantage against the immense superiority of physical force which unprincipled adventurers of talent and courage could enlist against them , excepting the protection of society acting through the Government . Hence the owners of property are relied upon , in all countries , as the habitual and steady supporters of law and government ; and hence they are found , in all countries , to favor as a class the establishment of such political institutions as give the greatest efficiency and energy to the administration of the laws ,  --  or , in one word , to favor a strong , rather than a weak government ,  --  the aristocratic , rather than the democratic , principle . Hence , too , in countries where the democratic principle is actually established , and the government has been purposely rendered as light and imperceptible as it could possibly be made , they are constantly tormented by a vague apprehension that their property is in danger , and regularly favor all schemes of state policy , and all modes of administering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which tend to strengthen the Government . This constant apprehension of the same common danger , and consequent tendency to seek protection from it by the same means , are a common bond of interest among the moneyed men , of the strongest kind , and one that is quite sufficient to give // them a marked political character . It can hardly be necessary to show how much stronger such a bond of union is than the mere circumstance of common professional pursuits , to which M. de Tocqueville attributes the supposed aristocratic character of the legal profession ,  --  not to say that a community of professional pursuits is generally found to be in practice , so far as it operates , a principle , not of combination , but of competition and rivalry . That the possessors of accumulated wealth in this country , and particularly the moneyed men of the cities , really entertain the apprehensions alluded to above , of danger to their property , from the democratic character and tendencies of our institutions , is sufficiently notorious . These apprehensions form , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and declamation which have filled the newspapers and speeches of the Opposition party since the commencement of the Government . At the present day the cant terms of Loco-Focoism , Agrarianism , and so forth , which are applied by the Opposition writers and orators to the friends of the Administration , and to the supporters of democratic principles , have their origin in this vague fear that the final word  --  the dernier mot*-of democracy is the equalization* or rather the destruction of property . As long as these apprehensions exist ,  --  however groundless they may be ,  --  there can be rio want of a common bond of union among the moneyed men , or of a sufficient reason why they should resist , with all their might , the regular democratic tendencies of our institutions , and should constitute , of course , so far as any such thing can exist among us ,  --  the nucleus of an aristocratic party . This can never , in the nature of things , obtain , at least for any length of time , the ascendency in the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now does , and has doue almost uniformly ever since the establishment of the Government ,  --  form the basis of a regular and permanent opposition . We find , accordingly , that the principal seat of the opposition to the democratic tendencies of our institutions has always been among the moneyed men of the cities . It does not always happen that they are able to control the numerical majority of the voters around them . Cities are the points where the two extremes of society come into contact , and the larger numbers of the working class often more than counterbalance , at the polls , the wealthy few , although these have so many means of influencing th' working voters within their immediate neighbourhood , that a contrary result is , by no means , uncommon , and is , perhaps , on the whole , a more natural one . It occasionally happens , however , that Boston , New York , Philadelphia , or Baltimore , will present the appearance of a democratic city , but even in such cases they are still the headquarters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffuses its influence through the country . The city newspaper // press is almost wholly under the command of the moneyed men ; the proprietors depend for support upon the patronage of this class , and are , of course , compelled , like the lawyers , to wear their political livery . A few independent editors sustain themselves , with difficulty , in a different course ; hut a large majority of the leading journals in all the great cities are , as is well known , in the interest of the Opposition . The city press is , in short , the great battery by the aid of which the moneyed men carry on the war which they are constantly waging against the democratic tendencies of our institutions , the party which favors these tendencies , and the administrations which they bring into power . Through this channel the moneyed men proclaim their good pleasure to their submissive partisans , exhale their griefs at the progress of democratic princi-. ples , and pour forth torrents of abuse upon all who make themselves conspicuous on the popular side . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political importance , such as it is ; disguises their weakness , in part from the people , and entirely from themselves ; and deludes them constantly with new hopes of approaching triumph , which are as regularly followed by fresh defeats at every election , or returning flow of the popular flood . The young members of the bar are the principal agents of the moneyed men in managing the press ; the seniors , who are willing to run the dangerous career of political life , go forward and plead the same cause in the legislative bodies of the States arid the Union . All , however , as we remarked before , sustain a representative character . They argue the case because they are well paid for it , and cheerfully exchange for this kind of solid pudding ' the empty praise ' which attends upon the vigorous and successful champions of the rights of the people . It is not , therefore , the legal profession , as 1W. de Tocqueville supposes , but the moneyed men of the cities , that form the basis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic tendency of our institutions , for that is the only shape in which aristocracy can possibly exhibit itself in this country . In keeping tip this perpetual warfare upon the spirit of the institutions under which they live , the moneyed men and their agents , the lawyers , are probably not actuated by any worse motive than the influence of their personal position . Nor is their opposition , perhaps* in itself , a great evil . The general equality of fortunes , the cheapness of unreclaimed land , the whole tendency of our legislation , cobl ) erate together in reducing almost to nothing the real weight of the lords of the exchange . They may , occasionally , carry a popular election , hut can never acquire sufficient importance to endanger the permanence of our institutions . They may , even , as an opposition , exercise , not unfrequently , a salutary influence in correcting errors or preventing practical abuses in the administration of the // Government . At particular periods they derive , from accidental causes , an accession of power . In times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meteor to the troubled air . ' War , pestilence , and famine , ' are the elements in which they live , and move , and have their being ; a national bankruptcy is to them a season of jubilee ; with the return of political health and sunshine they sink again into their old hopeless minority . A vicious course of legislation may also , at times , confer upon the Opposition an adventitious consequence to which they are not fairly entitled . This has been the result of the banking monopolies so freely granted within the last few years by most of the State governments . These have generally enured to the benefit of the moneyed men of the cities ; have greatly augmented the productiveness of their capital at the expense of the community , and have given them , for the time being , the complete control of the currency ,  - -  a political privilege far superior in importance to any of those that are enjoyed by the feudal nobility of Europe . The political* bearing of this system , which grew upon the country by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The people are now aware of its character , and are adopting , through the State and General Governments , measures of reform , which , though strongly resisted by the cupidity of the interested parties , must necessarily be successful . No institution or law of aristocratic tendency , least of all any one hnving a tendency to create an aristocracy of money , can possibly withstand long in this country the overwhelming power of the democratic spirit which forms , as it were , the life and soul of the body politic . The aristocratic principle can , therefore , never acquire any dangerous influence among us , and in the only shape in which it can display itself , that of opposition to the democratic tendencies of our institutions , may occasionally operate as a salutary check upon abuse or accidental error . There is , of course , no very strong reason to wish for its entire extinction . And yet , there is something rather melancholy in the idea that a pretty large portion of the prosperous and educated men , particularly in the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole population , should be rendered insensible to all the advantages of their position by a groundless and hypochondriac apprehension that their property is in danger . Situated in the midst of a scene unequalled , unapproached , we may say , in the annals of the world ; carried forward themselves in a grand march of political progress and improvement , the results of which are almost beyond conjecture , the moneyed men of our cities shut their eves upon all these beauteous wonders-speciosa miraculcz  --  and construe this whole mighty movement of society ,  - -  a movement which M. de Tocqueville justly contemplates with a sort // of religious awe ,  --  into a general rush upon their little hordes of accumulated capital . One is forcibly reminded of the comic terrors of the miser , in Moli*re 's play , who can see nothing in the endearments of the young lovers , or in the ordinary details of the business of his own family , but a constantly renewed attempt to violate the chastity of his strong-box . A late English traveller , Miss Martineau , was struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our national existence and progress is fitted to produce upon an impartial observer , and these diseased apprehensions of our city aristocracy , as exhibited in an address to a literary society at Cambridge College , which she happened to hear . The orator had selected for his topic the duties of educated men in a republic . ' In the warmth of her enthusiasm at all she was daily witnessing , and in the fulness of her conviction of her own duties as a member of the great Republic of Letters , and an observer merely of this magnificent spectacle ,  --  duties which , she has since , as we hope to show hereafter , so faithfully and brilliantly , though not without some mixture of errors , fulfilled ,  --  she naturally expected , upon such a subject , from an educated citizen of the republic , a glowing eulogy upon its condition and future prospects . Instead of this , the burden of the song was a dolorous lament over the ignorance of the masses , ' as compared with the superior illumination of the happy few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the feet of the Harvard Gamaliel ;  --  the determination of the aforesaid masses* to possess themselves of the property , ' - still harping on my daughter ! - of the aforesaid happy few , ' and of the universal desolation and misery which are to result from their success , for of this the orator appeared to be assured . A struggle was impending in which the whole power of mind was to be arrayed against brute force . ' That is , our young national Hercules is to be diverted from his giant sports of subduing the wilderness , founding empires , appropriating a continent , and spreading the triumph of civilization and christianity over every shore , to the more seductive occupation of breaking open the strong-boxes of a few importers of English goods , and manufacturers of cotton . What miserable delusion ! We well remember the surprise and regret with which we listened at the time to this unfortunate effort of one not naturally illiberal , but in whom the spring and buoyancy of a vigorous intellect had been destroyed by the corroding influence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution was nobly redeemed the following year , in another address upon the same subject , by Mr. R. Waldo Emerson , to which , and its author , Miss Martineau adverts in terms of merite ( l commendation . In the part of the country where these addresses were delivered , the only warfare in which the mind of the community is engaged , is with the sordid and soul-depressing power of // " MAMMON , the least erected spirit that fell From Heaven , " - who , with the aid of banking monopolies , has there obtained a temporary triumph over the genius of our institutions , and in the intoxication of this success has been enacting , for two or three years past , scenes that have crimsoned with shame the cheeks of every friend of the country , and especially every true-hearted son of the old head-quarters of good principles and literary emporium ' of the West . * We have dwelt somewhat longer than we intended upon this topic , and must pass more rapidly over others . Our author devotes a long and interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of a democratic government practicable in the United States . These he resolves , ultimately , into the good moral habits of the people , and particularly the general respect for religionThe secret is not to be sought in the great national advantages of our position , nor yet in the peculiar form of our institutions , for the Spanish American colonies which are placed , in both these respects , in the same circumstances , have , nevertheless , signally failed in their attempt to realize a stable and prosperous national existence . We must , therefore , look for the cause of our success in some other quarter , which can be , says M. de Tocqueville , no other than those alluded to above . This argument is certainly ingenious ; and it is no doubt true , that correctness of habits , respect for the forms of religion , and a real faith in its important truths , are among the most remarkable features in the aspect of our people . But though the good moral character of the people and the nature of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effect , the original determining principle resides in the government . The moral and intellectual habits of the people , whatever they may be , can always be traced directly to the character of their political institutions . In our country the extraordinary enterprise and industry which are the leading traits in the character of the people , and form the basis of their good moral habits , are themselves the result of the unlimited scope given to individual activity by the freedom of our institutions , and the security they afford that every one shall enjoy , with the least possible deduction , the fruits of his own labor . The security for the practicability and continuance of our institutions lies , in their conformity to the material condition of the people and particularly to the state of property . In all countries the government is a real and substantial thing only so far as it is an expression of the condition of the people . A democratic government , the leading principle of which is political equality , is the natural // expression of a general equality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this equality of condition and property exists , a democratic government is real , substantial , and , of course , permanent . This is the case in the United States* From the first establishment of the colonies up to the present day , there has always existed a general equality of condition and property , broken , no doubt , by exceptions in practice and theory of greater or less extent , but still sufficiently real to furnish a proper basis for a government founded on the principle of political equality among the citizens . This adaptation of the form of the government to the substantial condition of the people is the real cause of the existence and maintenance of democratic institutions ; and the circumstances which tend to keep up the equality of condition among the people ,  --  such as the abundance and cheapness of land and the laws for the equal division of intestate estates among all the children ,  --  are the most important of the subsidiary causes that concur in producing this result . On the contrary , all legislation that favors the accumulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-democratic , and tends directly to the subversion of the present form of government . The most remarkable example of such legislation which has yet occurred is to be found in the banking monopolies , to which we have adverted , and which tend more directly than any other invention of ancient or modern times to a rapid accumulation and concentration of wealth . They are blots upon the fair face of our democracy , and if suffered to spread and flourish in future as they have done for a few years past-. which , however , we do not think possible-would seriously endanger the preservation of our present institutions . NI . de Tocqueville , in the long and interesting chapter which we are considering , has riot , we think , adverted distinctly to this circumstance ,  --  the adaptation of the form of the government to tire condition of the people ,  --  which constitutes , in our opinion , the single cause of the existence and stability of our democratic institutions . We respectfully invite him to bestow some attention upon it in revising his work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is employed in describing the influence of religion in maintaining the democratic institutions of the United States is in the highest degree honorable to the author , and would be sufficient of itself to give a character and value to his work . The eloquent conviction with which he expresses his sense of the importance of this divine principle to the welfare of nations , speaks to the heart as well as the understanding of the reader . In this respect he has much improved upon his great model Montesquieu , who was unfortunately tainted , though to a comparatively moderate degree , with the irreligious spirit of his age . M. de Tocqueville here abandons his master , and finds a still greater one in the // highest inspirations of the profound and generous philosopher of Beaconsfield . We are not sure that we can agree with M. de Tocqueville in thinking , as he appears to do , that the influence of reli .. religion among us tends directly to maintain the democratic character of our institutions . Religion operates directly upon the moral habits of the individual citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enterprise and industry which form , as we have remarked above , the actual basis of good moral habits . The form of the government is determined by the condition of the people , and reacts in turn , to a great extent , upon their moral habits . Religion concurs with a good government in producing good moral habits , and diminishes , under opposite circumstances , the adverse influence of a bad government . If any change in the condition of the people of the United States should lead to a change in the principle of the government from democracy to aristocracy or despotism , the influence of religion would have no tendency to prevent this change from taking effect . The form must follow the substance , and when that changes must change with it . If an essential inequality of condition should ever take place among the people of the United States , the principle of aristocracy would immediately prevail in the government , nor would it then be of any importance that the forms of democratic liberty should be preserved . Of what value was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blasting and bloody tyranny of the Neros and Caligulas , that their nominal rulers were still , as before , magistrates of their own choice , and that the Senate , with all its ancient apparatus of formal dignity , was still enthroned in the capitol ? Religion , we repeat , has no direct tendency to maintain the democratic form of the government , or to prevent its change to a different one . Its present office is to cooperate with our excellent institutions in diffusing virtue and happiness among the people . Under other circumstances its office would be to resist the moral plague , which would then flow in upon society from the highest places , to furnish new motives for good conduct , in lieu of the worldly prosperity which might not then so uniformly follow it , and to preserve as much as could be preserved of the principles of truth and virtue against better times . In neither case would it have any material effect in regulating or maintaining the forms of government , but in these and in all other cases , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government more beneficial , and that of a bad one less injurious , than they otherwise would be . We entirely concur with our author in the belief that the general respect which is felt in this country for religion , and which is professed , perhaps , even more extensively than it is felt , is owing , in a great degree , to the enti e separation of Church and State . When the church is connected with the government the attempt is // made to give the sanction of religion to the artificial forms of society , to acts of ordinary legislation , and to the results of popular election and the accident of birth . But religion has , in fact , no direct bearing on the laws or the organization of society excepting so far as they are a mere declaration of the great laws of nature . Religion enjoins obedience to the laws as the duty of a good citizen , but gives no opinion whether a monarchical form of government is preferable to a republican one , or which of the different pretenders to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When , therefore , Charles or Henry declares himself king by the grace of God , and when the Emperor of China , proceeding a step further , represents himself as the actual Vice-gerent of God upon earth , although there is a sense in which this language may , perhaps , be reconciled with fact , it is , in its plain and obvious meaning , evidently untrue . This is , of course , seen by a portion , at least , of the people ; and when they find religion employed as a means of deceiving them on some points , their respect for it is much diminished , if not entirely lost , and it becomes very doubtful whether they will consent to follow its guidance in any thing . On the other hand , when the sanction of religion is withdrawn from the mere forms of organization or ordinary legislation , and left to operate merely in matters of moral duty , with which it is naturally connected , the people perceive that they are fairly treated , and there is nothing to impair or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instinctive principles of the human constitution . The entire success of the system in the United States gives , for the first time , the authority of a most imposing example to this apparently incontrovertible theory . M. de Tocqueville strongly recommends the adoption of it in his own country , and generally in Europe , as one of the best means of aiding in the restoration of the old religious feeling which was , for the time , almost destroyed by the revolutionary movements of the last century . The work of M. de Tocqueville concludes with a very interesting discussion of the probable future condition of each of the three races which now people the territory belonging to the United States . This is one of the most curious chapters in the second volume , but it opens a field of inquiry into which we have now no room to enter at large . Our author predicts , with apparent conviction , the entire disappearance , at no very remote period , of the few existing remnants of the native tribes . Of the fate of the blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inclines to the opinion , that while they will triumph in the West Indian Islands , they will ultimately disappear from the continent . This opinion is , in our view , extremely probable . The attempt to raise them to a political equality with the white race , has not succeeded in practice in the States where it has been carried into effect in theory . It will probabl'r // never be made in the States where the slaves constitute a large portion of the population . But the very ( lecided superiority of an entire free population over a mixed population of freemen and slaves , which is shown too clearly in the progress of the United States to be in any way questionable , will gradually make itself felt over the whole surface of our territory , and will substitute the former for the latter in all the States by an operation as unerring though somewhat slower than that which substitutes the white population in the place of the Indians . The Colonization Society , although it can have but little operation in diminishing the evil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of free black States along the coast of Africa , do much for the future civilization of that continent , and make some imperfect compensation to its unfortunate inhabitants for the cruelties inflicted upon them through so many ages , by the professors of a religion that inculcates as the great duties of man , peace , kindness , aud brotherly love . As respects the future fortunes of the white race our author is a prophet of almost unmixed good . A rapidly progressive population , the permanence of our democratic institutions , and a general state of national and individual prosperity , are the leading traits in the brilliant picture which he traces of our destiny . He is less confident of the continuance of the Union than he is of the continuance of democratic institutions in the States ; but he considers the Union as less important than it is generally supposed to be in this country , and , in fact , as a fortunate accident . On this head we can not agree with him . We consider the Union as the natural position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinuance of democratic institutions . The argument on this head is extremely simple , and is too familiar to need repetition . A separation of the States would be followed , probably accompanied , by wars among them , and wars would brino* into action successful military chieftains with large and permanent military establishments . If N. de Tocqueville supposes that these can be reconciled with the existence of purely democratic institutions , he must have read history to little purpose . For ourselves , we are fully persuaded that the democratic institutions of the States would not survive , for a single moment , the termination of the Union . We believe that the act of separation , should it ever take place , must be attended by a series of military movements , which would bring about , at the same time , the establishment of military governments in some , and ultimately , in all quarters of the country . This result , however , we look upon as entirely hypothetical . We differ from N. de Tocqueville upon this head , and do not consider the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We regard it as the natural condition of the States through the whole period of their progress , maturity , and VOL . II . NO . VTII. - JULY. x // decline . M. de Tocqueville does not himself point out , with much precision , the sources of the supposed danger ; he even admits that experience has dissipated many vague apprehensions upon this subject , and has increased the general confidence in the stability of the Union . Where then is the cause for distrust ? M. de Tocqueyule speaks rather loosely of the multiplication of the States , which would he sufficient , he thinks , to break the federal bond , and of the tendency of circumstances to diminish rather than increase the power of the General Government , which he appears to suppose would operate in the same way . We will advert , for a moment , to both these points . The multiplication of the States and the extension of the territory of the Union , far from having any tendency to break the federal bond , have always appeared to us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to operate , most favorably upon its continuance . The great danger to be apprehended in democratic States is the effect of sudden impulses resulting from merely accidental causes , such , for example , as the influence of a popular individual . The frame-work of a government , which supposes the sovereignty of the popular will , gives way , at once , when that will is concentrated in a single individual , and before there is time to recover from a temporary delusion the liberty of the State is lost . In this way C*sar , Cromwell , Napoleon , and so many others in all ages , have effected revolutions in States , which consisted virtually of single cities . In an extended territory , and especially in a Union of different States this danger is completely neutralized . There is the same opportunity for sudden impulses , and for individual influence , but their effects are confined to the points where they immediately operate . The vast field upon which the general political action is conducted , affords no scope for personal , local , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of the government . One trifling aberration neutralizes another , and the general result is conformable to the laws of the system , and favorable , of course , to its continuance . Thus in a widely extended Republic the great elemental powers of time and space are enlisted in favor of the existing state of things , and to a certain extent , guaranty its perpetuity . If our country were a single consolidated State there might be more plausibility in the objection , although experience is , after all , far from showing that large States , under whatever form administered , have been less durable than small ones . But , considered as a union of States , there can be no doubt , we think , that the system acquires strength by every extension , as the great Indian banyan tree roots itself more firmly in the ground by every new perpendicular shoot which descends from its branches . We see no reason , other than the merely material inconvenience of assembling representatives // from so great a distance , why the Union may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done the Alleghanies , and spread itself from the Arctic Sea to the Gulf of Mexico with as much safety as it did of old from Maine to Georgia . The apprehension of weakness in the federal bond resulting from a supposed tendency in the progress of events , to diminish the attributions of the Federal Government is , in our view , not less groundless than the one just adverted to . There may have been , as M. de Tocqueville supposes , a growing disposition to contest the power of the General Government upon certain points , particularly that of making internal improvements , and a willingness in the administration of the Federal Government to yield , in this respect , to what may have appeared to be the public opinion . We rejoice at this tendency of events to restrain the central action of our system and to diffuse the functions of government as widely as possible among the local sovereignties of the States . But the powers so conteste ( l might be given to or taken from the government without affecting its ability to sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is exposed . The purse and the sword are the essential elements of power , and they belong , by universal admission , to the Federal Government . There is nothing in the Constitution to prevent the Federal Government from declaring war against any nation on the globe , at any session of Congress , raising a million of men to carry it on with , and borrowing a hundred millions of dollars to pay the expenses . All these gigantic operations are within the admitted , uncontested attributions of the Union . Whether , in addition to these substantial and masculine powers , the Union do or do not possess those of laying out a road , chartering a bank , or founding an university , are practical questions of great importance , but having little or no effect upon the ability of the Government to sustain itself against attack or perpetuate its existence . The Federal Government possesses , in fact , for the purposes for which it is constituted , all the strength that can possibly belong to any government . If it has appeared , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or abroad with less vigor than governments of a different kind might , perhaps , have done , it has not been for want of constitutional authority , but because the agents who administer it are appointed in a different way , and , being subject to the variable impulses of the popular will , are less likely than they would be under other circumstances , to exercise their powers in the same bold , unflinching spirit in which they were given . There has been however , of late , no apparent tendency in the federal authorities to shrink from responsibility ; on the contrary , the last President , by the freedom and firmness with which he used his legislative veto , and asserted his right to act upon the Constitution , as he understood it , // developed the energies of the government in a point where they had been previously dormant , and thus left it more efficient than he found it . M. de rfocqueville notices this feature in the administration of General Jackson , without appearing to remark that it is rather at variance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . The popular complaint , for some years past , has been , as is well known , of a directly opposite character . It has pointed to federal usurpation , rather than imbecility in the federal authorities , as the crying evil of the times . This clamor has , probably , very little foundation , but may serve , at least , to show that there is no important error on the other side . The Union , therefore , we repeat , is not , in our view , exposed to any danger , either present or future . There is no general cause in operation , of which we are aware , that has any powerful tendency to relax its bonds , while on the other hand , the rapid settlement of the country , the increase of population , and the improvements in the communications between the different States , are constantly bringing them into closer connexion , and thus strengthening , in the most unexceptionable , and , indeed , the only effectual way , the ties that unite them together . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the loss of all our national advantages ; and we are also satisfied that it is the natural form of the existence of the States ; that it is beyond the reach of accident or of the perversity of any individual , State , or even generation of the citizens which might attempt to destroy it ; that it must and will endure , through the whole period , whether long or short , of our national being , and can only perish by the decay and ruin of the members that compose it . With these remarks , we close our notice of this valuable work . The importance which we attach to it has been sufficiently shown by the space which we have devoted to it , as well as by the unequivocal commendation which we have given to its general character . We recommend it , in conclusion , as a valuable study to the young inquirer for political truth , and a most interesting and useful contribution to the library of the general reader . We anticipate much gratification from the further publications which are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance , a friendly welcome in our pages.
