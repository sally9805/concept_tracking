txt /z/ to make his own terms till that was obtained , and then he became the most impracticable higgler of his whole tribe . There were no more bargains made out of his furs . Crusiav . Is the fur trade an extensive one in Canada ? Contain M , Very extensive , and taking into consideration with Canada the rest of British America , it becomes a trade of immense importance . You know there are forts and trading-houses established in various parts of that vast region under the direction of the Hudson 's Bay Company . Gustav . The persons who carry on this trade must have a fine opportunity for observing the manners and customs of the Indians . Are they not a very singular race ? Captain M. Yes ; they have many peculiarities . Edward . What is their appearance ? Captain M. They are tall and well made men , coppercoloured , with high cheek-bones , black eyes and straight black hair . Formerly some tribes flattened the heads of their infants by pressing them between two boards . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rocky Mountains . The women are smaU , short , and ugly , at least so far as my observation extended . Gtisiav , What are their employments ? Captain M , Hunting and fishing in time of peace , and hard fighting in time of war . They are very expert hunters . The little agriculture they carry on is principally done by the women . Their sight , smell , and hearing are rendered very acute by constant exercise . They trace a man through the wood as unerringly as a bloodhound . Crustav . Do they still use the bow and arrows ? Certain M. Many of them do , and others have muskets which they have bought of the whites . Their dress is very curious . Some of them wear skins and feathers , and paint their faces . /q/ The Indians never chastise their children , especially the boys ; thinking that it would damp their spirits , check their love of independence , and cool their martial ardour , which they wish above all things to encourage . ** Reason , * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they come to the use of it ; and before that their faults can not be very great . " They avoid compulsory measures , and allow the boys to act with uncontrolled freedom ; but endeavour by example , instruction , and advice , to train them to diligence and skill in hunting ; to animate them with patience , courage , and fortitude in war ; and to inspire them with contempt of danger , pain , and death ,  --  qualities of the highest order in the estimation of an Indian . By gentleness and persuasion they endeavour to imbue the minds of their children with virtuous sentiments , according to their notions of virtue . The aged chiefs are zealous in this patriotic labour , and the squaws give their cordial co-operation . Ishuchenau , an old Kanza warrior , ofen admonished the group of young auditors who gathered around him of their faults , and exhorted them never to tell a lie , and never to steal , except from an enemy , whom it is just to injure in every possible way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' be brave and cunning in war , and defend your hunting-grounds against all encroachments : never suffer your squaws and little ones to want ; protect them and strangers from insult . On no occasion betray a friend ; be revenged on your enemies ; drink not the poisonous strong-water of the white people , for it is sent by the bad spirit to destroy the Indians . Fear not death , none but cowards fear to die . Obey and venerate old people , particularly your parents . Fear and propitiate the bad spirit , that he may do you no harm : love and adore the Good Spirit , who made /z/ US all , who supplies our hunting-grounds , and keeps all alive . " After recounting his achievements , he was wont to add , ' *Like a decayed prairie tree , I stand alone :  --  the friends of my youth , the companions of my sports , my toils , and my dangers , rest their heads on the bosom of our mother . My sun is fast descending behind the western hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then with hands and eyes lifted towards heaven , he thanked the Great Spirit for having spared him so long , to show the young men the true path to glory and fame . Their opinions , in many instances , are false , and lead to corresponding errors in conduct . In some tribes , the young person is taught to pray , with various superstitious observances , that he may be a great hunter , horse-stealer , and warrior ; so that thus the fountain of virtue is polluted . The Indians are entirely unacquainted with letters ; but they have a kind of picture writing , which they practise on the inside of the bark of trees , or on skins prepared for the purpose , and by which they can communicate the knowledge of many facts to each other . The Indian names are descriptive of the real or supposed qualities of the persons to whom they belong : they often change them in the course of their lives . The young warrior is ambitious of acquiring a new name ; and stealing a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are achievements which entitle him to choose one for himself , and the nation confirms it . The Indian women are industrious wives and affectionate mothers . They are attentive to the comfort of their husbands , watch over their children with the utmost care and tenderness ; . and if they die , lament the loss in the most affecting manner . Some of the medical men pretend to have seen the Great /z/ Spirit , and to have conversed with him in some visible form , as of a buffalo , beaver , or other animal ; and to have received from him some medicine of peculiar efficacy . The animal whose form had appeared is considered to be the remedy ; and they imitate its cry in making their medical applications . The medicine bag , in which these savage physieians have a few herbs , entire or pulverized , and which they administer with a little warm water , is an indispensable requisite in Indian medical practice . Indeed , the head of every family has his medicine bag , which is a place of sacred deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most precious articles . The value of its contents an Indian only can appreciate . In every stage of society persons appear who accommodate themselves to the state of th e public mind . Of this description are the jugglers , conjurers , or powahs , among the ignorant and superstitious Indians . They are partly medical quacks , partly religious impostors . Many of them are dexterous jugglers , and cunning cheats . They pretend to foretell future events , and even to influence the weather . It is likely that they are often , in some measure , the dupes of their own artifices . Gustav . Are these Indians pagans ? Captain M. Of the religion of the Indians we have no full and clear account Indeed , of the opinions of a people who have nothing ' more than a few vague and indefinite notions , no distinct explanation can be given . On this subject the Indians are not communicative ; and to obtain a thorough knowledge of it would require familiar , attentive , unsuspected , and unprejudiced observation . But such observation is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some points uncertain , notices only can be given . On looking at the most renowned nations of the ancient /z/ // heathen world , we see the people prostrating themselves before innumerable divinities ; and we are ready to conclude hat polytheism is the natural belief of man , unenlightened by revelation . But a survey of the vast wilds America will correct this opinion ; For there we find a mnltitude of nations , widely separated from each other , all believing in One Supreme God , a great and good spirit , the father and master of life , the maker of heaven and earth , and of all other creatures . They believe themselves entirely dependent on him , thank him for present enjoyments , and pray to him for the good things they desire to obtain . They consider him the author of all good ; and believe he will reward or punish them according to their deeds . They believe in inferior spirits also , both good and bad ; to whom , particularly to the good , they give the name of ManitoUj and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dreams , and think themselves de serted by the Master of life , till they receive a manitou in a dream ; that is , till they dream of some object , as a buffalo or beaver , or something else , which they think is an intimation that the Great Spirit has given them that object as a manitou , or medicine . Then they are full of courage , and proud of their powerful ally . To propitiate the manitou , or medicine , every exertion is made , and every personal consideration sacrificed . ' ' I was lately the proprietor of seventeen horses , " said a Mandan ; **but I have offered them all to my medicine , and am now poor . " He had turned all these horses , which constituted the whole of his wealth , loose into the plain , committed them to his medicine , and abandoned them for ever . But , although they offer oblations to the . manitous , they positively deny that they pay them any adoration , and afiirm that they only worship the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of private or public religious worship . They have neither temples , altars , stated ministers*of religion , nor regular sacrifices ; for the jugglers are connected rather with the medical art than with religious services . The Indians in general , like other ignorant people , are believers in witchcralft , and think many of their diseases proceed from the arts g ( sorcerers . These arts the jugglers pretend to counteract , as well as to cure natural diseases . They also pretend to predict the weather and to make rain ; and much confidence 10 placed in their prognostications and their power . The devotional exercises of the Indians consist in tinging , dancing , and performing various mystical ceremonies , which they believe efficacious in healing the sick , frustrating the designs of their enemies , and securing their own success . They often offer up to the Great Spirit a part of the game first taken in a hunting expedition* , a part of the first produce of their fields , and a part of their food . At a feast , they first throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the fire . In smoking , they generally testify their reverence for the Master of life , by directing the first pufif upwards and the second downwards , or the first to the rising , and the second to the setting sun : at other times they turn the pipe to every point of the compass . They firmly believe in the immortality of the soul , and in a state of future retribution : but their conceptions on these subjects are modified and tinged by their occupations in life , and by their notions of good and evil . They suppose the spirit retains the same inclinations as when in the body , and rejoices in its old pursuits . At times , an Indian warrior , when about to kill and scalp a prostrate enemy , addresses him in such terms as the following :  --  ' ' My name is Cashegra I am a famous warrior , and /z/ am going to kill you When you reach the land of spirits , you will see the ghost of my father : tell him it was Cashegra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his victim* The Mandans expect , when they die , to return to the original subterraneous abode of their fathers : the good reaching the ancient village by means of the lake , which the weight of the sins of the bad will render them unable to pass They who have behaved themselves well in this life , and been brave warriors and good hunters , will be received into the town of brave and generous spirits ; but the useless and selfish will be doomed to reside in the town of poor and useless spirits . The belief of those untutored children of nature has an influence on their conduct . Among them the grand defect is an erroneous estimate of good and evil , right and wrong . But how much soever we may lament their errors on these interesting points , we need not be surprised at them ; for how many , even in more enlightened communities , and with clearer means of information , can scarcely be said to have sounder principles or a better practice ? A reverential and grateful sense of the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his institutions , and obedience to his will , by benevolence , integrity , candour , and kindness towards men , and by sobriety and industry , is too little valued and practised by many who enjoy the light of revelation . Hitherto the Indians have learned little but vice by their intercourse with white men . When Captain Martin had concluded this description of the Indians Mr. Oakley promised the children a particular account of the fiir trade of Canada , on some future occasion , and the party broke up for the evening . /z/ Mr. O. It is noT time , I thiok , that we should amuse ourBcWeB wilh the EnropeaoB , amongst whom civUiulioil has made aach aatODiahing progress . The Europesn may , indeed , be looked upon as a being greatly superior to the inliabitanls of any other part of the globe , and this superiority may be attributed to the social life he leads , la society he is communicative , and even when different nations are engaged in war with each other the learned of either party keep up a friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lately emeed into splendid notoriety , and who even now preserve many of their ancient Asiatic and barbarous cnstonur . You will readily guess I mean the Kussians . This people are distiuguished by a robust constitution capable of resisting the cold and rigour of their climate . The purity of the air , their simple way of life , abundance of food ) the frequent use of butchers ' meat , and per- /z/ haps also that of hot baths cause the Russians to attain to their full growth at an earlier age than-e natives of other countries . When an infant begins to make use of its limbs , the mother sets it down on the grass to crawl about as it pleases , and in her absence its grandmother and little brothers and sisters take care of it by turns ; for , in the country in particular , fraternal affection is a predominant virtue of the Russians . If the infant be healthy , it is accustomed , when six months old , to gruel , and by degrees to vegetables and meat , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns . Its clothing is simple and adapted to the climate , and consists only of a long gown of blue linen cloth , unless the weather be very severe . In autumn it is changed for a woollen one , made long and wide . It is usually the mother and her daughters who weave all the cloth that is required for the consumption of the family . Children who are strong enough to assist their parents in occupations abroad , wear in summer a long linen dress . In the villages all the children go barefoot and bareheaded , except in the coldest days of winter , and it is not uncommon to see them run without shoes through the snow . In winter when they go abroad they usually wrap themselves up in a sheep 's skin ; the older ones tie strips of woollen cloth round their legs , and wear shoes made of bark . Stockings are not used by the country people ; and boots are worn only by such as are in rather easy circumstances . Caroline . You forgot , papa , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , I dare say , are not so soft as ours . Mr , O , You are very right in that conjecture . Th6 Russians are strangers to beds like ours . In summer they lie down on a broad bench set against the wall ; and if the /q/ night is cool , they cover themselves with their cloth gowns . But where do you suppose the whole family sleep in winter ? Charles , Most likely in some very cold place . Mr , O , There you are quite out . You imagine , perhaps , because the Russian peasant is so inured to the most severe cold , that he cares very little where he lies down to rest . The very reverse is the fact ; he lies upon the stove . At these words , little Charles burst out a laughing , sup  - -  posing that his father was only in joke . Mr. Oakley thus proceeded : Yes , literally upon the stove ; and , what is still more , upon a stove heated like all those of the Russian vQlagera ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being surrounded with forests , they have no necessity to be frugal of wood , of which each peasant is at liberty to take as much as he pleases . The houses of the common people are still made of wood ; formerly you might buy them in the markets ready made , and you may even now purchase the wood all ready prepared , so that it only wants putting together . The facility with which the ancient Russians constructed their houses produced the following extraordinary event . The Siberians , being subdued by the Russians , obstinately refused to embrace Christianity ; the latter , therefore , resolved on striking their imaginations by a stroke of policy . The timber for a chapel was prepared and secretly carried to Tobolsk , where the Siberians were encamped in great numbers . On the night preceding the Feast of St. Nicholas , the patron saint of Russia , the sacred edifice was erected , a bell was hung , and the altar was properly furnished with everything necessary for the performance of the religious ceremony . The Siberians , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were perfectly strangers , but their surprise may be imagined when they saw the building which was not to be seen in the preceding evening The miracle was attributed to St. Nicholas ; the Siberians hastened to enter the church , d were dazzled by the numerous lights ; a priest in his canonicals was officiating , and preaching the Christian religion : overcome by terror and astonishment , the Siberians hastened to be baptized ; and the little chapel in which the ceremony took place is still to be seen . Ouatav , This was a strange way of converting this people . Mr. O , True ; but it is less objectionable than preaching a religion of mercy at the point of the bayonet The Russians retain many of eir ancient customs : and notwithstanding the efforts of Peter the Great to make the countrymen relinquish their long beards , they wear them to this day I am not sure whether it would not be a cruelty to compel them to part with them , for they are a great protection to the throat Among the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as particular beauties . When the czars gave audience to foreign ambassadors , they selected the most corpulent men as their attendants , to give their court a more majestic appearance . The courtiers wore cropped haur ; it was only when they were in disgrace that they suffered it to grow ; accordingly , when the people saw a boyard with long hair , they said one to another , There goes a nobleman who is out of favour with the czar . You see from this fact how widely different are the customs of different nations ; since the Franks deemed it the highest indignity to have their hair cut off , and distinguished malefactors by this mark . The Russian women /q/ had at this time the much more dangerous custom of covering the whole face with paint . This fashion , introduced into Russia from Constantinople , has unfortunately spread among all classes , and become general among the women of that country ; although they have almost all a fine complexion . Among the customs which this country seems to have received from the Asiatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling tales , relating old traditions , and singing ancient popular songs . The fondness for this amusement is universal , but it is more conspicuous in the lower classes . On Sundays , and on the eve of any festival , especially in autumn and winter , the common people assemble in the houses and listen attentively to the national tales which the grandmother or some other person relates to the whole family . The subjects of them are the heroic achievements and wonderful adventures of their ancestors , or events of common life , such as the artful tricks of rogues and sharpers . Their songs relate to the same kinds of subjects , and are more particularly in vogue in the country . There you may frequently see a young girl singing a national song with the sweet simplicity of nature , and accompanying herself upon a kind of guitar called bdUdaika while her companions dance round her , keeping time with the music , and performing a soft of pantomime analogous to the words ; so that , without understanding their meaning , you might guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Sundays and holidays , you hear in the villages of Russia the tunes of old songs , accompanied with pantomimic dances , either for the amusement of the performers , or by the command of the nobles and gentry ; many of whom are as warmly attached to this national diversion as their inferiors . It is even probable that it was introduced by the nobility of former ages , who , /z/ not knowing what to do , and being too ignorant to spend their time in a useful manner , assembled their slaves to divert them , according to the practice . of the most effeminate nations of the east . But the Russians will never make any great progress in civilization while they continue , as now , perfect slaves ; the master can sell or give away his vassals , and of course dispose of their time in whatsoever occupation he pleases . Yet they are remarkable for an extraordinary quickness of apprehension , and this quality they possess in common with all nations who owe their origin to the Sclavonians . The Russian peasant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to learn a particular trade , in a very short time makes himself master of it ; he then returns to his land to exercise his talent , either in building , painting , &c.; &c.; Even among the workmen , who practise in the superior arts , you will see thick clumsy men , dressed in their coarse cloth gown , with bark shoes , working at the most delicate reliefs or paintings . They do not call themselves artists , but keep plodding on , practising what they have been taught , and never attempting to quit their original station . Their tools are as simple as their dress . The hatchet serves ' them for most purposes ; with it they chop , they saw , they sculpture , they plane . Sic , &c.; Perhaps there is no nation so apt at imitation as the Russians . The great lords have chapels ; and they keep skilful musical bands , composed of their vassals , whom they have caused to be instructed in playing upon different instruments . Not only are they taught their several trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 76 Children . Oh , what a shame ! Mr. O. You see , my children , that the people of Russia /q/ are still barbarous in some respects , since education it self is imposed in a most painful and ignoble manner . The patience of these poor peasants has introduced a kind of music very tedious for those who execute it , but very agreeable for those who hear it . Imagine to yourself an orchestra composed of forty , or sixty , or even eighty musicians , all playing upon the same kind of horn , though each striking one single particular note ; the first , for example , always gives the lowest sound , the others rising in succession a tone or halftone till they reach the highest sound ; so that these musicians arranged in a row represent the pipes of an organ . As they have only one note to sound , the only difficulty is to play that in time and at the proper moment ; a task more difficult than to go through the tune or air upon one instrument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different instrument , which may in fact be called the one a , the next a sharp , iic . Mr. O. Exactly so . The first horn is ten feet long , and the last will be only half a foot : these vassal musicians perform their particular tunes with the greatest precision , and they say that , in the parties of pleasure of the nobles upon the water , the effect of this music is quite entrancing . The Russians show themselves equally skilful in the study of languages . It is not uncommon to hear children of ten or twelve years old speak fluently the German , English , and French languages . The Russians appear to be independent of circumstances , for no situation of life seems strange to them . They equally brave the greatest heat and the most intense cold , the most imminent danger , and the most overwhelming misfortunes ; and the vassals evince the most perfect resignation and /z/ submission to the orders of their masters. * When the cold is at twenty-five or twenty-eight degrees , the coach* men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where their masters are enjoying themselves ; when there are many of them they kindle a large fire ; and , indeed , in many parts of Petersburg there are places appropriated to this purpose , where fires are regularly kept . But a Russian will often content himself with the shelter of his vehicle , and stretch himself at his length beneath it . But he sometimes finds a more dangerous though warmer bed ; he will stretch himself along a horse 's back , or extend himself upon the crupper of two of these animals , never losing his equilibrium . But the Rossians are remarkable for this faculty of keeping their level , let their position be what it will . The intoxicated Russian seldom falls , or if he should chance to lose his footing for an instant , he regains his feet before assistance can be offered to him . The risk the workmen incur when building a house terrifies those who have been used to see the numerous poles and cords and planks which an Englishman employs in erecting a scaffold ; the Russian listens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger , as he stands lightly upon a cornice , a plank , or even apparently upon a single lath . One would almost suppose the Russian'sought danger as an amusement , for his amusements strongly partake of it . He can not live without his ice hills , which were imitated * The resignation of the Rusaan peasant may rather be termed apathy , arising from the hopelessness of his situation , and the absolute will of his master . That man can hardly be called resigned who is compelled to obedience and submission by the dread of punishment , and the certain knowledge that he has no appeal from the judgment of his lord .  --  TVanshior. /q/ in the public gardens of Paris some short time ago . In the summer , these sliding hills consist of smooth planks ; in the winter they are formed of ice . At Petersburg , they are constructed upon the banks of the Neva , and the velocity with which the sledge descends is so great that it crosses the river , ascends another hill constructed on the opposite side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sledges are in motion , and frequently you may see them occupied by the same people for hours together . The rich are as fond of this amusement as the poorer classes ; but they never venture to exhibit in public ; they have ice hills erected in their gardens or court-yards . The sledges which ascend and descend with such velocity are , nevertheless , directed by the skilful Russian with the greatest precision , and it is very seldom that any accident occurs . Another amusement of the Russians is that of the seesaw , which you have , perhaps , seen yourselves at some of our fairs . It is particularly on the great holidays of Russia , such as the week before Lent and at Easter , that these swings and see-saws are most seen : and as it is , in fact , during their fetes that we can best observe the genius of a people , I am the more particular in speaking of them . Before , however , I proceed , I must observe , that the Russians , though they follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious customs to the Roman Catholic faith , and that in several points they approach much nearer than the Catholics to the austere manners of the primitive Christians . Their fare during Lent is extremely severe , and would be considered a punishment by some other nations , who are , unfortunately , too much addicted to what we call good living . The Russians , on the /z/ contrary , are early habitaated to privations , and endure them with incredible patience . There have been instances of Russian armies , which , destitute of provisions for whole days , and exposed to the greatest fatigues , have nevertheless continued their march without a complaint or a murmur . The manner in which they are brought up is well calculated , as I have already observed , to inure the body to all the hardships they are exposed to in the rigorous climate in which they live . Were it not for this , how could a Russian peasant issue from his vapour-bath , and , running over the snow , plunge into the first river he comes to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open air , in a frost of twenty-five or thirty degrees , with his bosom uncovered , and his heard bristled with icicles ? It is not therefore astonishing that the Russian should be more indifferent to all the allurements of the senses , which very often powerfully influence the natives of more genial climates . In the depth of winter , the people of Petersburg and Moscow are obliged to eat frozen meat , which they purchase at a cheap rate in the markets , where heaps of slaughtered animals , stiffened with the cold , are seen piled up in strange confusion . During the whole of Lent the Russians eat no meat , neither are they permitted to dress any of their victuals with butter . The lower classes , at these times , make shift with vegetables and fish , often half putrid ; and , weak as this food must be for their stomach , accustomed to more solid nourishment , they would upon no account violate the laws of the church , and indulge themselves with better . Brandy is the only luxury they add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thiry sometimes drink to excess . As Lent advances , they anticipate the rejoicings with which it is to terminate ; /q/ they wait with impatience for Easter-eve ; and as this is usually the beginning of spring at Moscow , they prepare in that city to welcome the return of that agreeable season with the most joyous festivity . The night before Easterday , no one goes to bed ; on the contrary , every person dresses himself in bis best clothes to be in church a little before twelve o'clock . The cathedral in particular is crowded ; each individual , of what condition soever he may be , provides himself on entering the church with a candle , and holds it burning in his hand . The assemblage of so many lights produces a very fine effect , which considerably increases the profound silence till the clock strikes twelve . The officiating priest instantly exclaims three times with a loud voice , Christos woskres ! which signifies Christ is risen . These words are the signal for the commencement of the festival , and a general bustle succeeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraces without regard to sex or rank , and accompanies the fraternal kiss with the salutation , Christos woskres ! To this the other replies , Istinse woskres I ' - he is risen indeed . To me this custom was extremely impressive ; because it seems calculated to impress upon mankind that they are all brethren , and to make them forget the inequality of their condition , directing their attention to the joyful event of the resurrection of Christ : an event which completed the salvation of the poor as well as of the rich , and also the triumph of the divine religion over the guilty machinations of wicked men . While the whole congregation in the church are giving themselves up to joy , all the bells in the city begin to ring , and bands of singers and priests chant the praises of the risen Saviour . The tunes of these hymns are very ancient and appropriate ; they are grave and solemn , and inspire a /z/ devotion perfectly consonant to the majesty of the place. * As to musical instruments , the Russians never use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as indecorous , as the same instruments are employed in all profane diversions . The bells continue ringing , and the people of the lower class hasten to purchase for a trifle the pleasure of pulling the rope for a few moments . At day break , eggs and other kinds of food , amoig the rest , paschuj which is made of crudled milk , are ca:ried to the altar ; the priest blesses them , and from that moment the Russians are at liberty to eat all sorts of meat without distinction . Accordingly , no sooner is the service over than the people repair to their houses to regale themselves upon those things from which they have been obliged to abstain during Lent . They then prepare to pay the accustomed visits , and from daylight till noon the streets are thronged with coaches and pedestrians ; on all sides are heard the edifying words , Christoa woakresi always accompanied with the fraternal kiss , and the rattling of eggs painted red . Some persons also present their friends with artificial eggs , of very ingenious workmanship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with elegant paintings . In order that they may have a plentiful supply of eggs at Easter , the Russian peasants keep their fowls during the whole winter in the apartments which they themselves inhabit . Edw . Why do they give one another eggs at Easter , papa ? - The church called Nikiti Mutschenik , at Moscow , is remarkable for the fine sing with which divine service is there accompanied . It is built in such a manner as to give a powerful effect to the sound of the voice ; for which reason it is attended on Sundays and holidays by people of the first distinction . This choir of vocal music was founded and endowed by a merchant of the city . SECOND ETENINCk 21 Mr. O. This custom is of very high antiquity ; and is practised not only by Christians , but by many nations on whom the light of Christianity has not yet shone . The Jews place eggs upon their paschal tables ; and the Per sians , on the first day of the year , present each other with eggs painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that the practice is derived from Paganism , and perhaps served originally to denote the beginning of the world . The afternoon is devoted to rest . The people go to bed very early , to make amends for the loss of sleep the preceding night , and to recruit their strength that they may be about to take part in the festivities of the following days . On the morrow , when persons of some distinction receive the visits of their acquaintance , the people throng to the public places , especially to the rampart of Selainogorod , which is the chief theatre of their amusements . Preparations have been made to receive and divert them in their way ; swings , puppet-shows , rope-dancers , booths for refreshments are all to be found there , and contribute to produce the most diversified and singular spectacle that can be conceived . The people enter heartily into these amusements : the swings , which , as you know , from our early conversations , are a favourite diversion of the Russians , are kept continually going . The Russian is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank died , his relations , during six weeks , distributed much alms . The merchant , when he opened his shop in the morning , began his daily occupation by purchasing a certain number of loaves , which he divided and distributed among the poor . And , agreeable to ancient usage , the Czar , on the first day of Easter , repaired to the prison of the city , where he addressed each captive thus :  --  /z/ Jeaus Christ is risen also for you , He presented them at the same time with a new pelisse , and dinner was provided for them at his expense . This affecting custom was worthy of the first ages of Christianity , when all men looked upon themselves as brothers . I shall conclude this sketch of the manners of the Rnssian nation with a remarkable feature ; which is , the great authority that parents among them possess over their children ; an authority founded on ancient laws , and a venerable custom which may be traced back to the patriarchal age . This authority ceases not till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , their children remain dependent on them . The sons continue , even after they are married , to reside in their father 's house , and submit in all domestic concerns to the direction of their parents , who are the sole possessors of the property of their family , and maintain their children and their children 's children , if they have any . It is frequently the case , that a son more than fifty or sixty years old , and already a grandfather , as yet possesses nothing in his own right , but is solely dependent on the will of his parents . This state of submission ma ' be thought rather hard ; but it must be considered , that this rigid custom prevents many crimes and calamities of which we unfortunately behold too many examples . I can not proceed further in my description of Russian manners , without drawing your attention particularly to the astonishing progress of civilization to which this peopie have arrived during the last century . When we look at Petersburg , and reflect that the spot upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now one of the finest cities in Europe ; that the rock , upon which the magnificent statue of Peter the Great is erected , was drawn from a morass of Finland ; when we look at the wonderful /q/ church of Casan , the pillars of which are composed of single blocks of granite , fifty feet high ; the numerous palaces , the quays of granite , the fine temples , and the public establishments for education , we naturally ask from whence and from what supernatural aid did one century product such wonders ? Is there any one of you can answer till question ? Gustavus and Caroline , From Peter the Great , * papa . Mr. O. Yes , my children . When Peter ascended the Russian throne , his subjects were in a state of barbarism , in comparison with the other nations of Europe . They were strangers alike to the arts and sciences , as well as to manufactures ; and as ignorance is the parent of vanity , they imagined themselves to be the most enlightened and polished nation in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for his preceptor a man of great erudition and considerable talents . He frequently related to his young pupil what had struck him as remarkable and praiseworthy among other nations , and he gradually excited in the prince a strong desire to introduce among his subjects the milder manners and the arts of foreign countries . His first step was , to form a company of young Russians , whom his preceptor instructed in the tactics of the other nations of Europe . At this time , it should be observed , Peter was no more than fourteen years old . Into this company he entered as a common drummer , mounted guard regularly like the others , and lived on his bare pay ; and he rose in rank , step by step , without passing over any of the inferior gradations . He had long formed the design of travelling to gain information ; and in 1696 , at the age of twenty-four , he set out /z/ from Moscow . But his toar was not , as is usually the case with princes , a party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indolent and the weak would term a school of adversity . The first country which he visited - was Holland . At Saardam , as you know , he worked as a common carpenter , by the name of Peter Mikaeloff , and continued there for a long time unknown . His way of living differed in no respect from that of his labouring companions ; as it was his intention to introduce the art of ship-building into Russia , with a view to the future creation of a formidable fleet , he made himself acquainted with all its details . One day , having made use of a tool belonging to another workman , in his absence , the latter on his return flew into a passion , and gave the unknown prince a sound box on the ear . How did Peter behave ? He said to him with the greatest composure :  --  " You served me right ; for I had done wrong ; " and at the same time made the man a present . All the children unanimously applauded the generous conduct of Peter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he studied geography , mathematics , and natural history . He frequently went from Saardam to Amsterdam , to receive instructions in surgery from a celebrated surgeon ; and he made such a proficiency that he afterwards performed several very successful surgical operations . From Holland he went to England , where he still pursued his sole object , that of acquiring information . The king offered him a splendid palace ; but Peter took up his abode in a small house , where he had a better opportunity of improving himself in the art of ship-building . His attention to everything that related to this subject was very great . Sometimes he might be seen , in the attire /q/ of a sailor , working in ships ; and at others , in a different dress , visiting shops and manufactories . He took notes of everything remarkable that he saw , conversed with men of science and artisans , and sent several persons of that description to Russia . He then returned to Holland , and from thence proceeded to Germany , where he principally devoted his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for Italy , when a commotion at Moscow obliged him to return to his dominions . Edw . And did he put in practice in his own country what he had learned among foreign nations ? Mr , O , Certainly , for this was the motive of his travels : he established many kinds of manufactures in Russia , invited skilful foreigners thither , and sent young Russians to other countries to be instructed in the arts and sciences . On their return , he examined them respecting what they had learned ; and if he found them to be well informed , he gave them good situations ; if not , he employed them in the most laborious and despicable offices . As an example of industry , he still continue4 to work , either at the trade of a carpenter , or at that of a turner , or at some other . You may judge of his bodily strength , when I tell you that , going one day with his retinue to a blacksmith 's , he forged upwards of seven hundred pounds of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the awkwardness and grimaces of his courtiers , who were obliged to bring him coal , to keep up the fire , and blow the great bellows . When he had done , he received his wages for the day , and with the money bought a pair of shoes ; observing , that he had certainly a good right to the shoes , for he had earned them . His love of the arts induced him to undertake a second tour , in which he behaved as on the former occasion . He went to Denmark , and afterwards to /q/ /z/ Holland and France . When at Paris , he told the Duke of Orleans , then regent of the kingdom , he had not come to that city for amusement , hut to inspect the monuments , the manufactories , the arsenals , the hospitals , and other public institutions : he therefore requested him to give orders for all those things to be shown him , if he wished to confer a pleasure upon him . From the following anecdotes you may infer how attentive Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a village in the neighbourhood of Paris , he saw a man , dressed in black , working in a garden : he inquired who it was , and being informed that it was the rector of the parish , he alighted from his horse , went to the clergyman , and expressed his astonishment that he should employ himself in such humble occupations . The rector replied , that the exercise was wholesome , and that his labour contributed in some measure to his subsistence , as his living was far fh ) m being a rich one . Peter immediately made a memorandum in his pocket-book of the name of the rector and the village where he resided ; saying , that the worthy pastor would serve as a pattern to the clergy of his country . On another occasion , passing through a small town , he perceived at an inn a padlock of superior workmanship . Peter , who was a competent judge of mechanical performances , inquired who made this padlock , went to the man , and invited him to settle at Petersburg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the academy of sciences , and was admitted a member of that society . On his return to Russia , he sent to the academy , as a testimony of his gratitude and esteem , two charts , drawn with his own hand , from surveys by himself . One of them , representing the extent of the Caspian Sea , is now preserved in the imperial library at Paris . During his travels he never /q/ failed to Tisit the tombs of great men , expressing his veneration for their memory . On seeing at Paris the monument of Cardinal Richelieu , one of the greatest statesmen of France , he embraced his statue , exclaiming : - ** Great man ! Oh that thou wert now living ! I would give thee one half of my dominions to teach me to govern the other ! " Travelling through Saxony , he stopped at Wirtemberg , where he went to see Luther 's tomb in the chapel of the castle , and afterwards desired to be shown the house in which that reformer had resided . On departing he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , on one of the walls , which is still to be seen ; for care has been taken to surround the spot with a tin case , to which is affixed a small grating  - -  But the most remarkable circumstance in Peter 's life is the founding of Petersburg , in a place where there was then nothing but a few fishermen 's huts . Peter the Great neglected nothing which could ensure the prosperity of this new colony , allure foreign merchants to it , and cause the arts and trade to flourish there . There is still to be seen , on a little island of the Neva , a small house of wood , which Peter ordered to be built for himself in 1703 ; and in one of the public squares of Petersburg is the fine statue of that great man , erected upon a block of granite , twentytwo feet high and forty-three long ; which , being found in a morass six miles from the city , and weighing near four millions of pounds , was removed to the spot where it now stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dears , are some of the most remarkable events in the life of this great man , whose ardent thirst of knowledge may afford a useful lesson and pattern to persons of every rank ' in life . One more example of the patience and perseverance of the Russians I will relate to you . In the /z/ reign of Catharine , the court of Petersburg conceived the singular idea of building a palace entirely of ice , and this idea was executed . Edw . What ! a palace of ice ? But how did they make it solid enough to prevent the wind from destroying it ? Mr. O , Pieces of ice were cut exactly like stones , and laid in the same manner ; but instead of mortar , the workmen threw water between these pieces of ice , which immediately froze , and rendered this building very strong . Charles , I can't help pitying the poor fellows who had to work at it . Mr. O , They were very cold , no doubt ; for this reason it required Russian constitutions to execute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our climate would never have accomplished it . Eliza . Were there any apartments in this extraordinary building ? Mr. O. Not only apartments , but likewise windows and doors ; and what is still more , every apartment was furnished . Here were to be seen tables , glasses , chandeliers , nay , even a bed , and all of ice . Charles . As for such a bed as that , I had rather shift without it . Mr. O. I believe you , my dear fellow . The angles of the large rooms were embellished with statues , and the front of the building was adorned with various pieces of sculpture , the whole of ice . To heighten the illusion , recourse was had to art , and the natural colour of marble was given to the columns and other ornaments . Before this palace were mounted six pieces of cannon and two mortars , which were charged with gunpowder , though they were entirely of ice : they were fired , and the explosion was exactly similar to that of our metal cannon . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which sat a man in the Persian costume . This elephant threw water ont of his mouth by day , and burning naphtha by night* It is impossible to describe the effect produced by the spectacle of this palace when the sun shone upon it ; the ice reflected the rays of light on every side , and sparkled like the most brilliant diamonds . But the astonishment and pleasure of the beholder were infinitely increased at night , when the interior of this palace was illuminated with candles . Everybody then imagined it to be one of those fairy castles of which various eastern tales give such magnificent descriptions . The elephant at the entrance throwing burning naphtha , which produced blue and yellow flames , contributed greatly to increase the pleasure . This extraordinary edifice continued standing all the winter till the month of March ; but the increasing heat of the sun gradually reduced it to water , and swept away this transitory palace . I have already told you that the Russians , in their commerce , have preserved many Oriental customs ; their fairs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues from Tobolsk , present a picture not unlike that at Hadwara : for here , as at that place , may be seen merchants from Russia , Tartary , Armenia , China , dec . When they have settled their commercial accounts , they all unite in social amusements , and in the enjoyment of public spectacles . The fair at Makariew is held in the summer ; but that of Irtush in the winter ; and the merchants repair thither in sledges . Although the cold is intense , this caravan has the appearance of a party of pleasure . When it is night , they pursue their journey by torch-light , and when the hour of repose approaches , they halt , kindle fires , and /z/ make tea and punch . Good-humour and gaiety preside over these inspiring beverages ; and , cheered and happy , the travellers take their rest , and witli the dawn of day resume their journey . The city of Irtush is , as you may suppose , crowded by this vast influx of people ; some of whom come the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian and Siberian merchants is here made ; and it is the only means by which the inland traffic with China is carried on : the Chinese merchandise is received from the small town of Kiachta . Kiachta is a Siberian city , situated upon the frontiers of China : a small river separates the Russian and the Chinese custom-houses . Nothing but the great advantages China receives from this commerce could induce them to permit this transitory intercourse with foreigners , of which they are so jealous that they will not permit their own people to correspond with their relatives during their abode at this town . A list of articles required for the ensuing year is mntoally given by the merchants , and these lists , with their orders , are transmitted by the custom-house officers to their respective cities for their examination and completion . It is in this manner that the commerce between Russia and China is carried on , which amounts to many millions . Russia imports tea , nankeens , porcelain , Slc. ; and China receives iiirs , iron-ware , cloths , Slc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so shackled by the Chinese . /z/ Mr. 0 . If the details I gave you at our laat meeting amused you , 1 will this evening entertain you with the history of another northern race . The Children . Oh , pray do , papa ! Mr. O. The Norwegians then shall occupy our attention ; and the industry of this people will furnish us with ample subject for discussion and admiration . I shall not , however , irouble you with a description of the Norwegian towns and cities , but shall confine our perambulations to the country . But let me first hear if you know the situation of Norway . Edui . Norway extends about two hundred and twenty leagues between the sea and Sweden , to which it is conliguouB , The southern paris of this country are covered with mountains , forests , and morasses . In the north , the cold is so intense as to stop vegetation , and here nothing but bleak and barren rocks present themselves . In the sum- /z/ mer the heat is intense , from the reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shortness of the nights , which prevent the earth from getting refreshed before the bright god of day again appears . The principal riches of Norway consist in its immense forests , and its valuable metallic mines , particularly its iron ores . Mr. O , Such accurate details as those you have just given , Edward , are truly praiseworthy . I will now , therefore , and with much pleasure , describe to you the inhabitants of this extensive country . To speak correctly , there are no villages in Norway ; the land which surrounds the towns and cities may be truly designated country as we understand that word ; it is very rare to see even two or three houses together . Each person lives in the middle of his own domains ; the houses , consequendy , stand singly , and in some parts are at a considerable distance from any other dwelling . The Norwegians are a fine race of men , very active , sprighdy , and industrious . They are so inured to cold that they do not clothe themselves in thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , they think it effeminate to wrap themselves up in warm apparel . In the depth of winter they wear but one waistcoat , over which they put on a very short coat of coarse cloth ; both are held together by a broad leather girdle , fastened in the front by three or four small buckles . The coat and waistcoat are open above , so that the bosom is absolutely uncovered . The shirt collar is fastened round the neck by a large silver button , and the head covered with a cap made of four pieces of woollen cloth . Breeches made of skin , worsted stockings , clumsy shoes , and gaiters complete the dress of a Norwegian . He works in the cold with his bosom bare , and the sweat frequently trickles down his forehead while icicles are hanging from his breast ; /q/ and some , even , to show their indifference to cold , apply snow and ice to their bosoms either by the fireside or in the open air . This is attended with no bad consequences ; almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable for longevity . Eliza . And yet I should think they had enough of snow in those northern countries , without making it a plaything ; at least , I should think it a melancholy object . Mr. O. It would be painful for us to support ; but the inhabitants of the north are accustomed to it ; and , besides these , they reap many advantages from it as well as many pleasures . I have described to you the amusements of the Russians : now you shall hear something of the Norwegian skaiters . Snow , when well beaten , becomes a surface as solid and as smooth as ice . This being the case , the Norwegians , the Laplanders , the Swedes , and the people in the north of Siberia have invented wooden skaits . These skaits are made by the Norwegians of pine , and consist of planks of wood four or five feet long . The children have , at first , much difficulty in advancing along the snow , and get many hearty falls in serving their apprenticeship ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lead them on till they attain perfection in this curious exercise . It is hardly possible to conceive the swiftness with which the skaiter passes over the ground : his great skaits convey him rapidly np hill and down . Furnished with a stick , which serves him as a rudder , he readily avoids the stones and the trees which come in his way . Even precipices , unless they should be enormous , do not arrest his progress , neither slacken his speed . The sight of a wild beast terrifies him not , for he soon leaves the enemy far behind him . It is a pleasing and singular spectacle on a Sunday , to see numbers of the Norwegian peasantry , skim- /z/ ming over the country in order to attend divine service . Sometimes the skaiter is a hunter ; in this case he pursues with giant strides his prey , having at his hack , his gun , his pouch , and his provisions . These skaiters are frequently employed in war time , as scouts . The price of a good pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The coarse blue or gray cloth of which they make their garments is manufactured by the peasants themselves . On holidays their dress is made of rather finer cloth . The stuff of which the women make their gowns is likewise of home manufacture ; it is worn , even in company , by people of the higher classes , who pride themselves on its being of their own making . Upon the whole , the ingenuity and industry of these people are extraordinary . Every peasant is his own cabinetrmaker , carpenter , tailor , and shoemaker . He makes his own furniture , chairs , tables , carts , wagons , clothes , stockings , &as.; In almost every parish there are persons , who , without having learned any trade , are remarkable for a mechanical genius : but their general turn is for carving in wood , which they execute in a surprising manner with a knife of their own forging , upon sledges , drinking-cups , boxes , and other utensils . They even make watches , fowling-pieces , pistols , and all sorts of goldsmiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The royal museum at Copenhagen contains some very rare curiosities , the production of the Norwegian peasants . A lady of the Danish court one day showed me , in a company where we met , a beautiful repeater , which she wore . Every body admired the workmanship , though it was observed not to be so highly finished as the best performances of the watchmakers of London and Paris ; but we were all not a little surprised when she informed ns that this watch was made by a young Norwegian who had /z/ never learned the trade or been from home : that before he could set about this arduous task , he had been obliged to make , with his rude implements , such fine tools as he wanted ; and that in three years he had at length completed this beautiful piece of work , which for solidity and regularity was not surpassed by any other of the kind . I have also seen small barrel-organs which were made in that country , and which competent judges had declared to be excellent . It is chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these various works . The family is then assembled round the kitchen fire , on which are thrown logs of fir , that give a very good light ; or splinters of resinous wood are stuck up perpendicularly , and lighted for the same purpose . At the same time they amuse themselves with telling fairy-tales , or singing national songs . In like manner , every farmer makes whatever he stands in need of ; he builds his own house , his corn-mill , and his saw-mill . The women weave the cloth for their own garments , as well as for those of their husbands and children . The Norwegians are accused of pride ; but this failing appears very pardonable , when we consider that no people can be more free and independent , since they can easily dispense with the rest of the world . In fact , every farmer is , as I have already observed , cut off in a manner from the rest of mankind . He has at home every thing necessary for his subsistence ; he has no favour to ask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as he is able to work . That which chiefly occupies the industry of the Norwegians is their timber . You have heard of nations who support themselves on their whales , their seals , their reindeer , their cocoa-trees , and bread-trees : this nation founds /z/ its support and commerce on timber ; it is to them the best gift of Providence . Agricultare is little practised in Norway : com , indeed , grows in the southern parts ; but it is frequently destroyed by the intense frosts . Formerly the inhabitants ate dried fish instead of bread ; but at present they are supplied with potatoes and bread , which have become more common . In unfavourable years , the poor country people were sometimes obliged to mix with their meal the bark of the birch-tree , which they dried and ground with their oats . The bread made from it was generally not less unpleasant to the taste than pernicious to health . This wretched expedient is fortunately becoming every day less necessary from the increased cultivation of com and pulse . Some few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are both expensive and troublesome . In fact , the Norwegians import most of the productions of the earth . From England they receive hay , and from Holland vegetables . Fishing is the usual occupation of the inhabitants of the coasts ; where it is carried on with very little trouble , because they aie composed of rocks and creeks always frequented in summer by multitudes of fish . To catch them , the fishermen have only to throw a net across the mouth of each creek to prevent their escape , and another to draw them on shore . They salt part of their booty , and dry the rest , for which purpose they spread them on the rocks . Considerable quantities of both kinds are exported . The inhabitants of the coasts are likewise much addicted to navigation ; great numbers of them live entirely on the water in vessels , which they manage with great dexterity , even in the most violent storms . The very women , who accompany their husbands to sea , are very skilful in the working of these vessels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steer ships into and out of port , acquire considerable property by this profession . Gtistav . What are the remarkable animals of Norway ? Mr. O. There are wolves , bears , elks , reindeers , foxes , hares , and squirrels . In winter , the hares become white as snow , and the foxes and squirrels turn grey . Chestav . Are there any curious birds ? Mr. O. Their coast abounds with the same sea-birds as our own . TheOsprey and the white-tailed Eagle here soar over the billows witii majestic sweep , and the great sea eagle* perched on the lofty crag , watches in moody silence for his prey . Gustav . What is their prey ? Mr. O. Chiefly fishes and aquatic birds . These they usually carry off to devour at their leisure , either on the rocks or in their nests . Sometimes they fix on a dead carcass thrown on the shore , and remain stationary upon it for whole days , preying upon it with the disgusting voracity of the vulture . Gustav . What is the employment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interior of the country are almost all employed in felling trees , and other occupations of the like nature ; such as squaring timber and sawing planks , which they convey to the towns and ports on long sledges in winter , and in summer on rafts which they float down the numerous rivers that intersect this mountainous country ; but the rocks in their beds prevent vessels from navigating them ; and the timber , before it reaches the ports , commonly receives considerable injury from the cataracts , which it meets with by the way , and down which * See cut on page 31. /z/ it is dashed with great violence . On its road , the pieces often get entangled , and the peasants who live on the banks are expected to set them freely afloat again ; to effect this , they ar lowered down the rocks by means of cables ; sometimes it happens that , in setting one float aright , the poor man sees with terror the mass behind him righting likewise , and advancing with inconceivable rapidity ; his fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cases , that he escapes instant death . On the arrival of the timber in the cities and ports , each merchant knows his own by the marks upon it . A number of saw windmills are at work in the neighbourhood of these places , cutting the timber into planks and logs . Sometimes a hundred of these may be counted at night , all . at work , by the light of coal flres . The city of Christiana is much indebted to these saws for its prosperity : the English prefer the timber of Christiana to that of any other place . The timber yard is so filled that the planks , piled up , form a sort of alley or ' labyrinth . The constant egress and ingress of the peasants form a pleasing picture to strangers ; no sooner have they deposited their burthen in the yard than the inspectors make a mark upon their backs with chalk ; signifying the quantity of timber they have brought , the place from whence it came , and the master to whom it belongs . With this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all speed to the merchant , for fear that the marks should be eflaced , in order to receive his money . He has only to present his back , and he is instantly paid ; the mark is then brushed off , and the payment and receipt are settled . Gustavus laughing . This custom implies , at least , unbounded confidence on both sides . Mr. O. It is founded upon the good faith which should /q/ always reign in commerce , and which is very generaUy found in this country . In the places where there are mines , a great deal of wood is used as charcoal ; in other places they make pitch , tar , and potash . If we take into consideration the various uses to which the Norwegians apply wood , I did not improperly say , they lived upon it . It is calcolated that , as an article of commerce , it brings into Norway about six hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds sterling . Hospitality , so common a virtue in the countries of the north , is remarkably prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially manifested in the Christmas season . Its festivities last several weeks ; which are spent in feasting , parties of pleasure in sledges , and all sorts of amusements peculiar to the northern na- - tions . From Christmas-eve , called in that country Juul to Twelflh-day , the table of the Norwegian peasant is liberally supplied , and every stranger who happens to come in is invited to partake of such cheer as it affords . Were he to refuse , it would almost be considered as an affront ; they would tell him that it is Christmas , and that nobody ought to refuse participating in a festival during which they deem it a sacred duty to diffuse all the joy and satisfaction they are able . Christmas for ever I " is the sentiment which they have continually in their mouths , either in addressing an acquaintance , or when they meet a stranger . The most impressive circumstance in this custom of celebrating the period of our Saviour 's nativity is , that they even make their animals partakers of the general joy . On Christmas-eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than usual . Formerly , every farmer , on this occasion , tied a sheaf of oats to the top of a pole before his house for the little birds ; and it was considered 40 EVENma entertainments . a violation of hospitality to shoot the happy guests , or in any way to molest them in their feast . Charming and affecting custom , which proves the generous sentiments inspired by the Christian religion , and how it delights in making its festivals occasions for rejoicing , and the exercise of universal benevolence ! How sweet is the reflection , that the commemoration of an event of equal interest to the whole human race excites the same joy throughout all Christendom , is fraught with the same consolation and the same hopes for the inhabitant of the bleak mountains of Norway as for the native of the genial climate of Spain ! But if the character of the Norwegian peasant displays many estimable qualities , it is also tarnished by others of a very diflerent kind . The Norwegian , as I have said , is proud and quarrelsome ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him give up a point . This litigious disposition has frequently occasioned sanguinary encounters . It was formerly customary among them to carry a large knife suspended by a chain from their girdle ; and when , heated with liquor , they began to quarrel , they challenged one another to combat with these knives . On such occasions they hooked themselves together by their belts , and fought till one of the two was killed or mortally wounded . It is related , that this barbarous custom was so general that when a peasant went to a wedding , at which they drink to intoxication , his wife never failed to carry with her a sheet in which to wrap his body , in case he should perish in a fray . Wise laws and the vigilance of government have , however , suppressed these cruel practices almost entirely . They are a relic of the barbarous manners of ancient times , that have been retained in insulated districts , and among the nations more unpolished than others . If , therefore , civilization has detracted from /q/ the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least produced the advantage of having softened and rendered them more sociable . While the Norwegians find a support in their extensive forests , one part of the inhabitants of Jutland , and several of the islands belonging to Denmark , are obliged to seek the means of subsistence in the heaths of their uncultivated soil . They can only extract turf from these deserts ; and , in order to procure this , they have only to cut it in square pieces and then 3ry them . This is not hard labour , but is monotonous and melancholy ; and as turf is cheap in this country , a man must cut a thousand squares as a day 's work . One pat of the turf is used as coal . In the morasses , a species of turf is found which , when thrown upon fire , emits a light as bright as that produced by a flame : in many of the cottages , a family will assemble round one of these fires , with no other light but what they receive from it . It often happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render the habitations of the peasants perfectly isolated . The Finlanders had formerly the same advantages as the Norwegians ; immense forests occupied that part of their country which was not occupied by lakes or morasses ; but the ill judged conduct of the inhabitants have nearly destroyed them . Instead of economizing this precious gift , they set large portions of it on fire ; and , when the soil is covered with ashes , they sow it with seed , Crustav , How can they be so imprudent ? Mr , O. Having discovered that the fresh ashes rendered the earth very fertile , they destroy their woods in order to reap speedily the fruits of their labour . If they cleared the marshy lands , their work would be longer and more painful ; they love to labour little and reap much . In this ; /z/ the7 act like ail people who think but little , and who sacrifice their brightest hopes to the enjoyment of the present moment .. It is true , that the Finlanders could never reap profit to the same extent as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marshes that commercial intercourse is difficult . Every household depends upon itself for the gratification of its wants . The master of the cottage is tailor , miller , weaver , &c.; They are contented with their miserable huts because they are ignorant of better ; they are bigoted to their ancient customs , and , although oftentimes distressed for provision , they receive coldly that valuable vegetable , the potatoe , and the bread made from the reindeer moss . It is with nations as with individuals ; a solitary life renders us self opinionated ; by depending constantly upon ourselves , we imagine that we are all-sufiicient , and need not the advise of others ; we become mistrustful and obstinate . By associating with others , we naturally profit by their knowledge and ex* perience . Yet the Finlander is not without advantages which result from his isolated situation ; he is not exposed to the temptation and bad examples of cities ; and with the rudeness of uncultivated life , he has also preserved its simplicity . In his intercourse with strangers he is exceedingly reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made to enlighten them , they are exceedingly superstitious . Their magicians who are now , however , compelled by the vigilance of their magistrates to resort to secrecy , in order to carry on their pretended arts , bear about in a bag all they consider necessary for their magical delusions . They have many old songs which they teach as a shield or remedy against evils . The Finlanders have always loved singing . /q/ and they possess a talent you would little suspect , that of poetry They compose songs and long poems , in which , though many of the ideas are whimsical , the sentiments they contain are noble and strongly expressed . These poems become oral traditions , for they know not how to preserve them in writing . Some of the peasants will repeat a thousand lines , which they have either heard or composed . Sometimes these verses are sung , accompanied by a stringed instrument , called kandele , which , according to their mythology , was invented by a god . At the feasts of the interior Finlanders , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite to him , so that their knees touch ; he then recites a couplet , to which his companion adds another , " and so till the poem is finished . A pot of beer is the only recompense for this rustic effusion of the muses . When the in-peasants travel towards the coast , in companies of forty or fifty , they cheer the way by song . The women too , when turning the grindstone and performing other offices equally hard , beguile the hours with historic or romantic ballads . The women are very industrious and exact in the performance of their household duties . **I begin to love these Finlanders , " said Caroline , as Mr. Oakley , rose from his seat ; ** I am sorry they are so far from us ; I should like to hear them sing their national songs . " In order to make up for this defect in your happiness , you shall read some of their songs . One of the learned men of Finland , for there have been such , has translated some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translate some of them for you into your native language . But the Finlanders are not the only nation who amuse themselves with songs at their labour ; the Highland /z/ women sing in chorus as they make hay , reap , weave , or milk their cows . Their airs are melancholy , but sweet ; and they sing them with a pathos peculiat to themselves Thus music is a cneerer to the industrious man , and an agreeable pastime to the idle man . But it possesses charms of a more lolly nature than these ; sacred music lifts the soul to heaven , and gives a foretaste of one of the joys of heaven , which has been revealed to us ; for we are taught by holy writ that day and night , hymns of praise and loud hosannas fill the courts of that blissful abode , where labour , pain , and sickness never find entrance . I can not conclude this evening with a subject more proper to engross your last thoughts . So good night , my children , and may the blessing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakley began thua : You have heard that the inhabitants of the interior of iHoTway carry on a lucrative trade ; it in not bo with the inhabitants upon the coast and upon the more northern parts . There the racks rise in thick fogs , and the air is cold and sharp ; and these parts are but thinly inhabited . There are islands wheie two or three families only are found , who are perfeitly ignorant of what is passing in the vorld . Once or twice in the course of the year , a priest risits them ; sometimes they have twenty leagues to go to church , around which are generally built small huts , for the convenience of those who travel thus far to perform the irreligious duties . A journey to church forms a party of pleasure to those poor people , for as soon as church is over , they assemble together for amusement , feasting , or business . Fishing forms the principal occupation of the Norwegiane : upon this subject I have already glanced ; but I /z/ must revert to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fish by these people . Twenty thousand fishermen assemble about the isles of Voage , particularly at Lofodden , for the purpose of fishing . These places , all at once , assume the appearance of a populous city ; the sea is covered with boats , and the coast presents a motley group of Norwegian fishermen and foreign traders . Eliza . Papa , what particular reason have they for fishing near those isles 1 Mr , O , Because the fish , in the month of January , flock thither in immense shoals to deposit their spawn ; whether it is that . the bottom of the sea is less cold in those parts , or that the islands in this latitude render this tempests beneath the sea less frequent , or whether they diminish its fury , I can not tell ; but certain it is they abound there . At night the fishermen spread their simple nets , which are about twenty fathoms long , and composed of large net ; before morning these nets are generally full ; the fishermen then pierce the fish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such fishermen as can not afford nets fasten fish hooks to a cable , or fish with a line ; but these processes are far less profitable than the nets . The fishing season lasts about six weeks or two months , and the drying of them occupies two or three months . I must not omit the salmon fishery in Finland , particularly that in the Tornea , which empties itself into the Gulf of Bothnia . This fishery may be almost called a chase , so curious is it . At night a number of boats float upon the river , lighted by burning brands , and containing two men ; one of these sits in the bottom of the boat , and rows it slowly on ; the other stands armed with a trident at the forepart , ready to strike the salmon when , attracted by the light it rises to the surface . If the salmon is very powerful , /q/ fais companion goes to his assistance . The river , as you may suppose , upon these occasions , presents a very singular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating upon the river , the men armed like Neptune with a trident , who are perfectly visible , and every now and then plunging their formidable weapons into the agitated waves as it seems . But enough upon this sub-ject The rocks and seacoast of Norway , as I have already informed you , and of the isles of FeiVo , the Orcades , and the islands of Shetland , are exceedingly well stocked with a ( uatic birds , such as penguins , puffins , herons , cormorants , falcons , and eider fowl . The flesh of some of these is eaten fresh , and some is salted ; their eggs form excellent food , nd the down is carefully collected , for it is much sought after in cold countries . You see how useful these animals are to the poor inhabitants of these desolate places , though they are often obliged to expose themselves to the greatest dangers to come at them . The fowler scrambles up the rocks , which are often two , three , and even four hundred feet high , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footing . Ascending to the ele. vated parts where the birds deposit their eggs , the bold adventurer braves the danger of inevitable death , which would be the consequence of a false step . No dread of this , however , deters him ; he secures the eggs , and descends with his booty from this prodigious height with more indifference than we should go down a ladder . But many of the precipices are so abrupt as not to be accessible from below . The natives then employ another expedient . Having climbed to the top of the opposite rock , one of them lowers down the other from the slope contiguous to the brink , by a rope , made either of straw or of hogs* bristles : /z/ the latter they prefer even to ropes of hemp , as it is not so liable to be cut by the sharpness of the rocks , and the former is apt to untwist : they trust their existence to a single assistant , who lets his companion down by the rope , which the latter firmly grasps . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks , and puts all the eggs which he discovers into a basket fastened to his waist . His life therefore depends solely on the strength of his comrade at the top of the rock , who holds the other end of the rope ; for if he should chance to lose it , the adventurer would of course fall , and be dashed in pieces against the projecting crags , or drowned in the billows , which break with a tremendous noise against the foot of these rocks . Caroline . Do such accidents sometimes happen ? Mr. O. Unfortunately , but too often . If the fowler finds no eggs in one place , he proceeds to another , pushing himself out from the face of the rock with a small stafl* , to avoid injury , while thus suspended , from its projecting parts . Being far out of sight of the person above , he gives signals to him from time to time to shift the rope , which is ofen done while encumbered with the whole weight of the fowler and his booty . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Noss , a vast rock apparently severed from the isle of the same name by some unknown convulsion , and only about sixteen fathoms distant . It is of the same stupendous height as the opposite precipice , with a raging sea between ; so that the intervening chasm is a scene of matchless horror . Some adventurous islander having reached the rock in a boat , which he fastens at its foot , he climbs to the top , and drives several stakes into the small portion of earth which is there to be found . Correspondent /q/ stakes are placed on the edge of the opposite clifis . To these stakes on both sides is fastened a strong rope , along which a kind of basket , called a cradle , is contrived to slide . The fowler , placing himself in the basket by means of a small parallel cord , wafts himself over , and returns the same way with his booty . Eliza . It must make one shudder to look at them . Mr. O. I confess , my dear , that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his basket , suspended in this manner between the sky and the ocean . In the Feroe islands , the manner of catching birds is also extremely hazardous . Here the natives are often obliged to climb rocks whose summits are lost in the clouds , the cliffs which contain the objects of their search being sometimes two hundred fathoms in height . These are attempted from above and below . In the first case the fowlers provide themselves with a rope eighty or one hundred fathoms in length . One of these bold fellows fastens this about his waist and between his legs , takes a small line in his hand to give signals when he wants to be lowered , raised , or shifted from place to place ; and puts on his head a strong thick cap to protect it against the stones which are now and then loosened from the rocks . Thus prepared , he recommends himself to the protection of the Almighty , and is lowered down by six of his comrades , who hold the rope , which is preserved from wearing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the margin of the rock . The dexterity of the fowlers is amazing ; they will place their feet against the front of the precipice , and dart themselves some fathoms from it , survey with calmness the places where the birds nestle , and again shoot into their haunts . In some places the birds lodge in deep recesses ; there the fowler will alight , disengage himself from the rope , fix it VOL. n. 5 - /z/ to a stone ; and , having at his leisure collected the booty , which he fastens to his girdle , will resume his perilous seat . At times he will again spring from the rock , and in that attitude , with a fowling-net placed at the end of a staff , catch the old birds which are flying to and from their re* treats . When he has collected as many eggs and birds as he can manage , he gives a signal to his comrades above , who pull him up and share his hard-earned profit . The feathers are preserved for sale ; the fiesh is partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's provision . Such is the method of catching the birds which build their nests on the tops of the rocks ; but similar risks are run to take those which have their haunts below . The party goes on this expedition in a boat ; and on its arrival at the foot of the precipice , one of the most daring fastens a rope about his waist , and being furnished with a long pole , having an iron hook at one end , he either climbs , or is thrust up with a pole by his companions , to a place where he can gain a footing % by means of the rope , he draws up one of the boats crew ; the rest , each furnished with his rope and fowling-staff , are brought up in the same manner . They thus continue their progress upwards , till they reach the haunts of the birds , and wander about the face of the rock in search of them . They then act in pairs ; one fiastens himself to the end of his associate 's rope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footing , he permits himself to be lowered down . It is evident , that in this case he must depend for his security on the strength of his companion , who has to haul him up again ; but it sometimes happens that the person above is overpowered by the weight , and both are precipitated . headlong into the sea , or dashed against the points of the rocks , amd inevitably perish . /q/ jEliza , How happy these poor people must he , if they return at night to their huts with an abundant booty ! Mr* O , Certainly they must ; but they are often deprived for a considerable time of that pleasure . It frequently happens that they pass seven or eight days in this tremendous employ ; during which they live in the most miserable manner , and have no other lodging than the cliffs of the rocks . " Poor fellows ! " exclaimed the children in a tone that evinced the pity which they felt for their hard lot ! Charles . Ah ! how sorry I am too for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eggs and their young ! Mr. O. Tou have abundant reason to pity them , my dear child . The poor creatures make a lamentable noise* while hovering full of anxiety about their nests , * when they see their eggs or their young carried off . Sometimes it even happens that , exasperated by the loss of their little ones , they attack the robbers with the utmost fury ; this exposes the latter to an additional danger , which they find it very difficult to guard against , especially when they are assailed by several birds at once . The down obtained from them is dried in the sun , by whose heat it is so reduced that ten pounds yield , after this indispensable operation , no more than three of good down , which is sold by the name of eider-down , and used for feather-beds and pillows . The Greenlanders take from these poor birds nothing but their eggs and their young ; as to the down , they leave it behind , or amuse themselves with letting it fly about in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been relating , to how many perils man frequently exposes himself to procure a subsistence , and how fortunate are those who /z/ can provide the means of living with greater ease and fewer dangers . Fortunately , egg-hunting is not always so troublesome . Upon the coast of Norway , there are many little islands which are level plains , yet exceedingly well stocked with aquatic birds . The eggs of these birds form the riches of their proprietor . You will smile , when I tell you that there appears a sort of convention between the birds and their owners ; for the former fly from their nests when the latter approach them , and return to them when they depart , leaving one egg only behind them . But if a stranger arrives and commences the work of desolation , they scream and make the most frightful noise . I have often had occasion to observe their shyness , myself , when attempting to shoot them among the islands . We went in a boat , * and pushed ourselves noiselessly along under cover of the bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of their shyness . But nesttaking is not confined to the north of Europe ; in the south of Asia , they get those nests which are considered a delicacy by the Chinese and other Asiatics . Crustav . This bird is , I think , a species of swallow . Mr. O , Yes . This little swallow constructs a nest with very fine filaments , which are fastened together by a transparent glue . The Asiatics think it possesses strengthening qualities . The nearer the nest approaches to white the more valuable it is . In the island of Nicolon they abound , and in the isles of Sunda likewise . In the island of Java there is a rock which these swallows frequent , and the produce of which has been valued at twenty and even forty thousand Spanish dollars . The Dutch farmers who pos- * See cut on page 45. /q/ sess rocks of this description , are particularly careful that nothing shall molest them , and they watch the Chinese with a most jealous eye , for these people will , if they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected , but this hunting of nests is nearly as hazardous as that of the eider fowl . The rocks are difficult to climb , the caverns are sometimes the receptacles of wild beasts : besides these dangers , the Javanese have the terrors of superstition to surmount , for they believe the caverns to be inhabited by angry spirits who resent the audacity of man in thus disturbing their haunts ; before , therefore , the natives undertake these excursions they offer sacrifices to these spirits , and make vows ; and if any misfortune happens to them , they attribute it to the revenge of the evil genii. /z/ nFTH EVENING . Mr. O. We yesterday discussed , my children , the daogers the Scotch , Icelandic , and Indian hunters are forced to brave lo get down nests and eggs of different birds . I will to-night describe to yon ihe chase of the shamoy which is no less daring and hazardous . The shamoy inhabits the rocks and mountains of SwitEerland , Savoy , and the Tyrol , aa well as the Pyrenees . Feeding upon grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delight in the steepest and most elevated rocks , which they climb with the greatest agility , springing from rock lo rock , and leaping over abysses twenty or thirty feet wide . It requires not only great hardihobd but much agility to hunt these animals . Before the hunter commences his perilous undertaking he provides himself with a good gun , a telescope , a sack filled with provisions , a hunting-knife , and a pole with a eharp iron at the end : /q/ neither does he forget a couple of spikes , which he fixes in the soles of his shoes , that he may obtain a firm footing on the ice , and thus be enabled to pursue the shamoys over the glaciers . Furnished with all these indispensably necessary instruments , he sets out on his expedition . The usual hour of his departure is twelve at night , because he endeavours to reach the most elevated pasturage of the Alps , to which the shamoys repair to feed , before the shepherds , of these mountains come thither with their flocks . On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if he discovers any at some distance , he makes a considerable circuit , and takes particular care not to get to windward , because the smell and hearing of the shamoys are so extremely acute that they can smell powder at the distance of nearly a mile , and hear the least noise . The hunter , therefore , if he would not have his game escape , must employ great address in climbing the rocky hills till he gets within shot of the shamoy which he has in view . He commonly endeavours to shoot it on some elevation , where the shamoy , while grazing , can not pej ' ceive its enemy : he takes aim , fires , and as soon as he sees his game fall , he quickly runs up , and the first thing he does is to cut the ham-strings . Charles . Why does he serve the poor beast so ? Mr. O. It is a measure of precaution ; for the shamoys , having a very thick skin , , and being extremely tenacious of life , frequently escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost always at too great a distance for the ball of his piece to penetrate very far . As soon as he has secured his game , he considers which way he ought to return : if the road is too difficult and steep , he takes nothing but the skin , leaving behind him the carcass , which becomes the prey of the eagles and vultures ; if not , he takes it upon /z/ his shoulders , carries it home , and it serves as food for his family ; for the flesh of the shamoy is excellent eating . He then dries the skin .. and sells it . It is very difficult to kill the young shamoys ; the hunters therefore endeavour to catch them alive , in the following manner :  --  when one of these goats has been killed , the kid remains near the dam , and may be easily taken . If , however , it happens to escape , the crafty hunter sets the dam which he has killed upon her legs , as if she were still alive ; the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man leads it home , where it is brought up with goat 's milk till it becomes so tame as to accompany the other goats to pasture , and to return regularly with them . Such is the ordinary method of hunting shamoys ; but the poor fellows who follow this occupation are not always so fortunate ; they frequently expose themselves to dangers which bring them to the brink of destruction . If several shamoys are feeding together , it is difficult for the hunter to kill any of them ; because each of these animals , in turn , performs the duty of sentinel , continually looking about and pricking up his ears ; and when he perceives anything , he begins to make with his nostrils a whistling noise , so piercing and shrill as to make all the neighbouring rocks resound . At the same time this animal stands upon his guard ; if he whistles again , it is a sign of very imminent danger : he bounds away , and in the twinkling of an eye the whole herd is gone , scrambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing his game escape , climbs the most rugged steeps , leaps the most tremendous abysses , traverses extensive plains of ice , and pursues his course without reflecting how he shall get back . The day declines ; night comes on ; he knows to what dangers he shall be exposed in the dark ; but nothing /q/ can check his ardour : animated by the hope of finding , when he awakes , the game that has escaped him , he passes the night upon a bare rock , exposed to the inclemency of the weather , in the dark , and separated from all the rest of mankind . lie takes from his bag his supper , consisting only of oat-bread and cheese , with which he drinks snowwater and a small quantity of brandy . After this wretched fare , the poor hunter stretches himself out on the bare ground , in the open air , while so many thousands of his brethren are enjoying , in a lower region , and under shelter of their huts , the sweets of society and repose . The early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he must clear to come at his prey ; and , after drinking a dram , he throws his bag on his shoulder and pursues his way . Sometimes in ascending he loses himself among the rocks and glaciers ; so that he can neither advance nor recede a single step , without running the risk of going still further out of his way . Add to this a thick fog , which often intervenes , and prevents his seeing two yards before him . He is then obliged to wait till the mist disperses . In this dreary situation , his courage forsakes him not . In his way , he frequently meets with precipices , which he is obliged to leap over , if he would not lose his time in making a considerable circuit . What does he then ?  --  He stops , pulls off his shoes , takes his knife and . cuts the soles of his feet ; and at the moment when the blood begins to flow abundantly , he ventures a leap from one rock to the other , in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet keeps him from slipping . Frequently too the eager hunter pursues a shamoy to the most elevated point of a rock surrounded on all sides with the most tremendous precipices . The animal , being thus dri- /z/ Ten . to extremitj , and having no other means of escape , springs over the head of his pursuer , and sometimes tumbles him into the abyss beneath , if he neglects to throw himself on the ground , that the shamoy may pass without touching him . Crustav . But how is it possible that there can be people who expose themselves to such hideous dangers for the sake of a shamoy , or merely the skin of that animal ? Mr , O , It is because these poor people partly subsist by the chase , and frequently conceive for this employment a passion which is often more violent than even that of gaming . In that country there are people whose father and grandfather have perished in this manner , who nevertheless pursue this perilous occupation , and declare that they would not forsake it for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you the dangers which befell three hunters while engaged in the pursuit of those poor animals . This story will convince you still more of the magnitude of the dangers to which they expose themselves . Three hunters were in pursuit of a shamoy on a glacier , which was so covered with snow that it was impossible to see the deep chasms into which , when melting , the water precipitated itself in torrents . The foremost of them was walking over one of these treacherous abysses , when the snow gave way and the poor fellow disappeared . In spite of his - fright , he fortunately retained sufBcient presice of mind to throw out his arms and legs , when falling , in such a manner as to remain suspended between two walls of ice , with a view of the torrents roaring as they fell in the horrid gulf beneath him . His comrades , having lost sight of him , began to be apprehensive that he had met with some accident ; and on making the signals previously concerted among themselves , they knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They returned as speedily as possible to the nearest hamlet , a good league distant , in quest of cords . Disappointed of finding any , they took a miserable bed-quilt , cut it in strips , which they tied together , and flew to the spot where they had left their unfortunate companion , who had continued during all this time in his painful position , exhausted , perishing with cold , and overwhelmed with fear every moment lest he should fall into the abyss . They let down the cord which they had contrived to make , and which the poor fellow fastened round his body : but , oh horror ! at the very moment when they had pulled him up to the brink of the precipice , so that they could just reach him with their hands , the rope broke , the wretched man fell a second time into the yawning gulf to a greater depth than before , fuid , to add to his misfortune , broke his arm . His comrades , however , were not discouraged ; they joined their rope , twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their companion , who , notwithstanding the fracture of his arm , fastened it around him , and was at length extricated from his most perilous situation . But it is not merely the dangers of the chase that threaten the lives of these poor people ; the quarrels and disputes which sometimes arise among them are not less destructive . If , for example , an Italian and a Swiss hunter , or two hunters from different parishes , happen , without knowing it , to be in pursuit of the same animal , the conse quence is a quarrel , which very often terminates in the death of one of them . I shall relate but one instance of this kind , which will suffice to enable you to judge how rude and brutal the manners of these people must be . A hunter of Savoy was pursuing a goat which he had severely wounded . Two hunters of tfie Vallais , a district /z/ of Switzerland , separated by lofty mountains from the ter ritory of Savoy , fired at the same shamoy , and saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal belonged to the Savoyard , by whom it had first been wounded : he being , besides , the nearest , ran up to it , threw his game upon his shoulders and went away . The Yallaisans , who chanced to be lower down than he , and could not get at the shamoy on account of a precipice , shouted to him , and ordered him to relinquish the prize ; at the same time a ball from one of their guns came whistling by his ears . The Savoyard , without paying the least attention to them , quietly pursued his way , till he heard a second ball whiz by him . Unfortunately the road was so rugged that he could not run , and he had neither powder nor ball to defend himself against his enemies . What was then to be done ? He found himself obliged to resign his prey . Enraged at having risked his life for nothing , he considered only how to revenge himself on the two Yallaisans who had thus obliged him to relinquish what he looked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch the Yallaisans unperceived by them . He saw them at dusk enter a small hut , such as the shepherds of that country are accustomed to construct : and then ran to his own habitation , two leagues distant , took a double-barreled gun , powder and ball , returned , not without danger , to the hut , and through a crevice in the boards beheld his two competitors seated by the fire . He softly thrust the muzzle of his gun through the crevice ; but just as he was taking aim , he considered that his enemies , since they fired at him , could not have had time to confess their sins , and consequently that , if he were to kill them , they would run the risk of eternal perdition . This reflectoin so softened the heart of the Savoyard Uiat he abandoned his design ; /q/ and , abruptly entering the hut , he frankly acknowledged to the Yallaisans what he had intended to do . Such was the impression made upon them by this action , that they begged pardon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared with him the shamoy which had been the cause of their dispute . Mr. Oakley 's children admitted that this was a very praiseworthy action , though every man of honourable principles would have done the same . Edw . Does it not sometimes happen , papa , that the poor hunter 's game tumbles down those precipices ? Mr , O. Yes , but if there be the least chance of recovering it , you may be sure that he will risk everything for that purpose . He lays down his pouch and his gun , makes his way over snow , and across deep chasms , takes , from time to time , extremely dangerous leaps , and sometimes he is even obliged to go quite down to the shamoy . If the animal has not been absolutely dashed in pieces by the rocks , he contrives , by means of a cord which these people commonly carry with them , to recover all his prey , or at least the best parts , leaving the rest for the vultures . Sometimes , also , to save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep valley , with the intention of picking it up when he has got down so low . Gustav , What is the value of a shamoy , for which a man thus exposes his life so many times ? Mr. O. The value of a shamoy is not considerable ; when whole , it will sell for twenty or thirty shillings sterling . The more it is wounded or mangled , the less it is worth ; the principal thing , it is true , is the skin , which commonly fetches sixteen or twenty shillings . It is therefore rather a passion for hunting than the proiit , which impels the hunter to traverse snow and ice , amidst /q/ /z/ dufaiess and fogs ; for it is not only poor people that are fond of this employment , but also those in opulent circumstances . Among the latter history records a prince , who aanowly escaped perishing while hunting the shamoys on the Alps . This was Maximilian , who aAerwards became Emperor of Germany , and who had so completely lost himself among those mountains that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time relate that an angel extricated him from this disagreeable situation . Probably some other hunter , or a shepherd who was better acquainted with the roads and paths among the Alps than the prince , met with him in this embarrassment , and put him into the way which he wanted to go . ( hiatav . This shamoy hunting must be a fine bold and exhilarating amusement ; but of all field sports that which most takes my fancy is the ancient one of hawking . Mr , O , It was undoubtedly delightful in itself ; and then they had all * means and appliances to boot ; " beautiful ladies* and gallant cavaliers on horseback , with hawk in hand , a numerous train of attendants ; and the free range of an extensive country . It must have been rare sport ; fit for the kings and nobles who delighted in it . You have seen what intrepidity man displays in hunting , in the air and in the water , for the means of subs istence ; he shows no less courage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found therein . In vain has nature hidden the greater part of minerals in mountains or far beneath the surface of the earth ; man by patience and labour becomes master of them ; and we can not but admire his genius when we examine the means he has employed to extract from the earth those minerals and treasures which are so beneficial to him . /z/ * See cut on page 54. /q/ By a wise dispessation of Providence the most useful are ose which are most liberally bestowed . I shall not mention the quarries of stone , marble , granite , and grindstones . As the explosion of these is more laborious than perilous or astonishing , I shall confine myself to those of salt , iron , and coal . It was , no doubt , a long time before man thought of extracting metals from the stones which contained them . Sweden and Norway are exceedingly rich in copper and iron . Dalecarlia , a Swedish province , is nearly supported by its mines . In the neighbourhood of Fahlun there is a celebrated mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even at a considerable distance the effects of the smoke and the pestilential vapours may be discovered : all vegetation ceases in its environs : the entrance to it is down a stair for a short distance , but the rest of the subterraneous descent is performed by ladders and cords . The Dalecarlians are a hardy race , and endure the united effects of great heat and noxious vapours most surprisingly . These Dalecarlians enjoy many privileges of which they are very proud , and the recollection that they have occasionally assisted their country at moments the most critical gives them an air of independence , which to an Englishman is always gratifying . In the Swedish annals their deeds are numbered , and particularly those which assisted Gustavus Ydsa to gain possession of his throne . When Charles XII . was a prisoner at Bender in Turkey , twenty thousand of these brave men offered to repair instantly to his rescue . The labour of extracting metals from the bosom of the earth is not greater than that which bestows upon us one of the most common necessaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was got from saltsprings . Mr , O. There are several means of procuring this necessary article . Near the seacoast , pits are dug , into which the salt-water is admitted ; the sun exhales the water , but the salt remains behind crystallized by the genial influence of the god of day . The salt-water which is found in springs is conducted into large reservoirs , where it is boiled , and by evaporation the salt is procured . But there is yet another method of procuring salt from mines . It is on this subject that I propose to speak to you tonight , and to direct your attention to an object in which nature has a much larger share than the hand of man ; I mean the famous salt mines of Poland , and their wonderful subterraneous excavations . The whole vicinity of the Carpathian mountains , from Silesia and Gallicia across Hungary to Wallachia and Moldavia , comprehending a space two hundred leagues in length , and twenty or thirty in breadth , seems to be but one single bed of salt , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this whole tract , salt-mines are wrought with great success ; but the most productive and remarkable of them all is the mine at Wielitzka , six miles from Cracow . The town of Wielitzka is situated in a valley enclosed by mountains , which rise around it in the form of an amphitheatre . The mines begin a little on this side of the town , pass underneath , and extend to a considerable distance beyond it on the other side . Gustav , Then the whole town is undermined ? Mr , O , Yes ; and the . cavities thus formed are larger than mines : each of these holes has a particular name and destination . The /q/ first seven are usbd for drawing up the salt as it is wrought , and letting down necessaries for the men and animals that live below . The eighth is appropriated to the labourers , who ascend and descend by means of ladders , the very sight of which is sufficient to intimidate people who are not very courageous . The ninth is solely used for water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit these curious works . It was this that I descended when I went to see the mines of Wielltzka ; and the way in which you descend is this . In the first place , several children , apprentices to the workmen , with lights , are fastened to a very strong rope , which reaches to the bottom of the mine , and is let down by a machine turned by a horse . The travellers are then slung in leather straps secured to the rope ; and if there are several going down , they are suspended two and two , above one another. * In this manner we were fastened , after dressing ourselves in miners ' clothes ; and when the workmen had taken their stations above us , the signal was given , and we began to descend very slowly . After some time we entirely lost the light of day ; the aperture above appeared smaller and smaller while an immense abyss opened beneath us , and presently we could hear nothing but the creaking of the pulleys of the machine which was letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull and monotonous sound . The aperture at length grew so narrow , that we were obliged to make use of sticks which had been given us just - In this manner the horses also are let down . The poor creatures tremble in every limb , when they see themselves thus suspended in the air . Happily for them , they can not know that it is for the last as well as the first time ; for the horses intended for the use of the nunesy when once let down , remain there for life , and never more behold the light of day . /z/ before we began our descent , to prevent our striking against the stones and rocks projecting from the side . It is impossible for me to give you any idea of my feelings , when I found myself cut off from the light of day , suspended in this dismal cavern over an abyss , which the dim light of our lamp rendered still more horrible . All that the poets have said respecting the descent and entrance to the infernal regions falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At length we reached the first story , or contignation , as the miners call it . Here we enjoyed a spectacle unique in its kind , at once awful and interesting ; a spectacle , the reality of which I never should have believed had I not been convinced of it by ocular demonstration . At the first glance , I fancied myself transported into another world , and we all remained some minutes stupified with astonishment . Figure to yourselves a subterraneous town , several miles in circumference , with its streets , houses , and squares ; men , carriages , and horses going to and firo in all parts ; in short , everything that is to be seen in the largest city . But what raised our astonishment to the highest pitch was , to find that all these wonderful things were cut out of the solid mass of salt . The pavement and the houses are composed of salt ; the road by which you descend to this vast subterranean town is likewise of salt , and the prodigious columns resembling the finest crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same material . Add to this thousands of lamps , whose light reflected on every side by the crystallized salt , produces the most beautiful mixture of colours that can be conceived , and exhibited to the view of the spectator en- chanted palaces , sparkling with diamonds , rubies , and sapphires ; and you will have but a faint idea of the effect of this sight , so astonishing and impressive . Nature seems /q/ to have spared no pains to beautify these subterraneous regions for those who are doomed to reside there . Caroline . What then , do the labourers employed in them live continually under ground ? Mr , O , They live there with their families , and soon become familiarized to these abodes , where they find everything necessary for their subsistence . Streams of fresh water run through different parts , and furnish a pure and wholesome beverage for men and horses , which have likewise their stables below . Our attention was also drawn to the chapels where the labourers assemble to prayers before they begin work , and hear mass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen in these chapels , some of which are for the labourers , and others for the officers and overseers , is of crysti-Uized salt ; the altars , the columns , the chandeliers , the images of the saints , all sparkle by candlelight , and produce an enchanting effect .  --  Having inspected all the curiosities of this first stage , we descended to the second , the third , and the fourth , all of which resembled the first ; and quite at the bottom the people were busily employed in constructing a fifth . Edw . Of what nature is the work of the labourers in thesfi mines ? Mr. O. Their work is extremely laborious , and often very dangerous . When the overseers have marked out the masses or blocks of salt , which the labourers are to loosen and clear away , some of them fall to work to split these masses into several parts , and others to collect the fragments in large hogsheads . The place from which such a mass has been removed resembles a little grotto of crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , you see long galleries extending further than the eye can reach . /z/ having on either side a range of grottoes , all of which are of the same dimensions . You must be extremely well acquainted with these places not to lose yourself in this labyrinth ; nay , there are fe of the labourers who can find their way without a guide ; but this is not the only danger which threatens those who pass their lives in these subterraneous abodes , after having in a manner renounced the world , and all communication with the rest of mankind . It sometimes happens , that the pillars of salt , left to support the vault after working a quarry , however strong they may be , give way at last under the enormous mass which they have to sustain . The ground above them carries along with it in its fall whatever stands upon it , even the very houses of the town of Wielitzka , though some hundred feet above the mine . In the lower stages little fear is entertained of accidents of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now proceed more methodically than they formerly did , and make the pillars stronger and more solid , instead of merely detaching and carrying away the salt . Gustav . Then tilie town of Wielitzka , which stands over these mines , is not perfectly secure from such accidents . Mr. O. Unfortunately it has but too much reason for apprehension . It has been discovered , that some of the columns of salt have already bent considerably under the weight , and been almost entirely crushed by it ; and , not withstanding the precautions taken to prevent disasters of this kind , the town of Wielitzka is every moment liable to be swallowed up , the consequence of which would be the total , ruin of the mines . Another danger to which these miners are exposed arises from fire ; conflagrations have broken out several times , and among the rest one /q/ about the middle of the seventeenth century lasted near a year .  --  I must on this occasion call your attention to a kind of phenomenon which sometimes takes place in these mines , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt mines in Hungary an attempt was made to open a fresh quarry which had been neglected upwards of thirty years . The people employed in this operation perceived a dark passage , which one of the miners was sent with two of his comrades to examine . The man who went first with a lamp in his hand , perceived a cavity which descended perpendicularly in the rock ; and , to ascertain what it was for , held his lamp down to it . The air , suddenly taking fire , rushed upward with the greatest fury out of the mine to the height of sixty feet , after knocking down and burning the poor fellow who was the innocent cause of the accident . His companions , who had fallen down in their fright , sustained no further injury ; but nobody durst in future approach this dangerous spot . In the mines of metals such circumstances prove still more disastrous . I will just give you one example of the kind . An inspector of the tin-mines in Cornwall perceived at some distance from the spot where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which all the metal had been extracted , a small spherical mass resembling whitish smoke , of the size of a walnut . Justly supposing that this was the commencement of a mephitic vapour , which might in time prove dangerous , he resolved to disperse it , and ordered a candle to be held as near to it as possible . A violent explosion , but not attended with any mischief , was the consequence . A few days afterwards , returning to the spot , he saw in the same place as before another ball of smoke forming ; and as the first had been in no wise dangerous , he thought he might suffer the second to increase ; he /z/ therefore left it oat of mere curiosity . The next and following days he retamed , and observed that the globe continned increasing in size , and that on the fifth day it was as large as a man's head . It grew whiter and whiter , and kept graduaUy ascending . The miner began to be alarmed at its augmentation , and resolved to disperse it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workmen to retire to the distance of eighty paces , he fastened a candle to a long pole , and slowly approached the ball . It suddenly took fire , exploded with a tremendous noise , and inflamed the whole atmosphere , as far as the place where the miners were stationed . Several fragments of rock were loosened and dropped near them . They had presence of mind enough to run away as fast as they could . The inspector , struck with this accident , resolved , fortunately for himself , not to go near this dangerous spot again ; for in a few days , ( me of the miners having imprudently held his candle near a similar ball , it exploded with such violence as to cause a part of the mine to give way ; and the flame , issuing from an aperture , set fire to a neighbouring house , and killed the occupier , with his whole family ; besides which , eighteen of the workmen were crushed to death under the rocks . When you have acquired some knowledge of natural philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event like this ; which , at present , I dare say , appears to you to border on the marvellous . /z/ " To-NiOHT , " said Mr. Oakley , as he took his seat in the library , " to-night I shall entertain you with the character and economy of a nation , which has acquired a , great reputation by its industry ; I speak of Holland . In Older duly to appreciate the industry of the Dutch , you must first become acquainted witti their immense labours in rendering their soil , in the first instance , merely hitable . Holland is so flat and low a country , that the sea is level with it , and even , in some places it is higher than the land . To prevent the encroachments of the ocean , the Dutch have constructed immense dykes ; for the want of these , formerly , the sea overfiowed a large tract of country , from which it had receded ages before . Edw . Did the sea once cover Holland , papa ? Mr. 0 . Holland may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subsiding of rivers and the ocean . The soil is consequently light , and its foundation resls , not like that of most other countries , upon solid rocks , and stones . The disasters which have at different times he- /z/ fallen Holland , have been a warning to the Datch , and if their country still exists , it may be said to be owing partly to their industry . The Gulfs of Zuyder Zee , DoUart , and Moordick were formerly fine provinces , covered with cities and villages . At the beginning of the third century , the sea swallowed them up  --  Towards the end of the fifteenth century , the Gulf of Dollart was formed ; a century afterwards , a great portion of Flanders was swept away ; and fifty years had scarcely elapsed , when another province , containing seventy-two villages , and one hundred thousand souls , was engulfed by the merciless deep . Innumerable and partial inundations , besides these , have repeatedly taken place ; but I shall pass them over in silence . The dykes upon the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous expense ; they lie upon the most substantial piles , and are so wide that four carriages can pass along abreast . When the wind blows strongly from the north and north-east , the sea , in the course of eight days , will destroy the work of years . These laborious works must then be repaired , or constructed anew , behind the remains of the former dykes . A small insect too , a worm , joins its minute , but destructive influence , to that of the ocean , in destroying these barriers of the coast of Holland , by perforating the piles , the foundation of the dykes ; it is even more dangerous than the sea itself . Crustav . It must be a work of considerable difficulty as well as labour to repair these dykes . Mr. O. Undoubtedly it is ; and hence it is that they often prefer erecting fresh ones . We must allow that few people surpass the Dutch in patience and perseverance ; their country is a proof of this ; for , besides the innovations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy rains , that they alone would be sufficient to overwhelm them , did not the inhabitants make artificial canals to carry off the water . It is here , as in many other instances , we must admire the genius of man , in his efforts to render his native soil habitable and agreeable . I entreat your whole attention as I give you the following details , and that you may the better comprehend them , I shall make use of a topographical map to assist my description of this wonderful country . As Mr. Oakley said this , he rose and fetched from a bookcase a very accurate and minutely drawn map of Holland . " Oh , what a singular looking country , " exclaimed the children , ' ' one sees nothing but canals and ditches . ' * Eliza . It is all cut up into squares of different sizes . Mr. O , Your observation is just , Eliza ; and you perceive , consequently , that all these canals , so connected , resemble a large net . In the spring , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands ; it is then a curious sight to see all the little windmills at work . The pumps of these machines raise the water from the ditches , and force it into small canals , from whence they are conveyed to the larger ones ; but as the banks of these are high and furnished with dykes , it is necessary to employ other windmills to raise the water to their level . ' The main canals are very wide , and fine roads are mostly seen on each side of them . The canals may be called the high roads , for they act as such . Yet these canals , large as they are , would not contain all the water which winter produces , unless it were carefully directed to immense sluices connected with the principal rivers . The industry of the Dutch has thus transformed a swampy and marshy country into one beautiful and fertile , where the meadows /q/ /z/ are well stocked with cattle : mills of all kinds , pretty country-houses with fine gardens , bordering for the most part the canals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects which greet the eye on every side . Large cities and towns intersected by canals , which are ix this case mostly bordered by large trees , are thickly studded throughout the country . The dampness of the soil demands the most constant attention in the dwelling-houses : they are painted on the outside ; the pavement and windows are washed every day ; and , in fact , cleanliness is here carried to an excess which is annoying to strangers . For instance , in the village of Saardam , which is about a league from Amsterdam , and famous as having been the residence of Peter the Great , it is forbidden to ride through the streets . But in the village of Broek you enter at the back door , for fear of soiling the front one ; and in great houses , you change your shoes at the door , and put on clean ones , which , are presented to you . You smile at this particularity ; it is no doubt carried to excess , but in such a damp country as Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary ; for the climate would otherwise have pernicious effects upon the constitution of the inhabitants , instead of which they are but slightly felt amidst the comforts which the Dutch have created in their cities and country . Gustav . I have heard the Dutch compared with beavers for their industry . Is a beaver more industrious than other animals ? Mr. O. The industry of the beaver in constructing his dams and habitations are indeed surprising . He , however , only distinguishes himself by a particular instinct directed to a particular purpose , for which he has been fitted by /q/ nature . His conformation as w as his propensities show the life he was fitted for . Here* you have a drawing of one . See what a curious tail it has ; large , flat , and covered with scales instead of hair . The animal was made for a mason , and furnished with his trowel . He was destined to build mud forts . His teeth too are peculiarly adapted for cutting down the trees which he has occasion for in building . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order which this people exhibit in their houses , extends to their favourite occupation ,  --  commerce . They have but little taste for what we call pleasure ; they live soberly and are wholly occupied by their affairs . Formerly the Dutch were factors to other nations in transporting different merchandises from one quarter of the world to another . Hence sprung their first riches : they became formidable by sea , and at length got possession of extensive lan'ds in Europe , Asia , and even in America . It is curious , that one of the first articles which in commerce contributed to their wealth and reputation , was a small fish  --  the herring . The herring fishery had so enriched them in the sixteenth century , that from it they had the means of supporting a long war , and finally of obtaining their independence . This fishery employs a hundred thousand sailors annually , twenty thousand of whom are Dutch . Gustav . I think I have read , papa , that the herrings come every year in great shoals from the Icy Sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalists ; this fact is , however , somewhat doubted ; but this is very certain , that they are found between the forty-fiflh degree - See cut on page 71. /z/ of northern latitude and the pole , and that at a certain period of the year they visit the coast to deposit their spawn . By a Dutch law the fishermen can only throw their nets between the twenty-fifth of June and the fifteenth of July , and in order to encourage this fishery , a premium is given to the first boat which goes out and returns laden . Their nets are composed of silk , a thousand or twelve hundred feet long , at the ends of which are fastened large stones . They are unrolled by means of a capstan , and empty barrels fastened to the edge of the net shows their position on the surface of the sea : confused by the nets , the fish attempt to glide through the meshes , but are caught by the fins and gills , and thus remain suspended . On the Dutch nets , the meshes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish can slip through them . Their fishery would be more productive without this precaution , but would diminish for the future . The Russians and the Swedes had formerly upon their coasts a good herring fishery ; but as the meshes of their nets were so small as to retain all the fish they caught , the fishery naturally and gradually decreased , and it is now not worth mentioning . The nets are cast at night , and lanterns are fastened to the upper parts ; for fish , as I have before had occasion to observe , are easily attracted by light . It must be a curious sight to see a net thickly hung with herrings : but sometimes in the midst of the fisherman 's joy at his good fortune , a shark , or some other destructive fish , gets entangled in the nets , in pursuit of his prey , and destroys , not only the fish , but the net itself , by its boisterous efforts to free itself from its confinement . The herrings would soon spoil in their natural state ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their insides are /q/ taken out , and they are thrown into brine . The next daj they are placed in casks with a large portion of salt ; fhm thence they are aAerwards removed into other casks with fresh salt , and in this state thousands are exported . Some are , however , retained and prepared differently ; after remaining in the brine twenty-four hours , they are tied by the gills to sticks , which are suspended in the chimney , and ezpgsed to a thick smoke ; in the course of another twenty - four hours , they become , what we call , ** dried herrings . " The English and the Swedes turn the intestines to account ; the former feed pigs with them , and use them as manure . The Swedes do better ; they extract oil from them in the following manner :  --  On their coasts there are generally several buildings , containing a number of great cauldrons , into which the intestines are flung ; when these are dissolved in the boiling water , a quantity of cold water is poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , and is carefrdly skimmed off . The remains at the bottom of the vessel then make good manure . This lucrative article of commerce produces , as you may suppose , . great wealth to Holland . There was a time when the Dutch engrossed this fishery , and they then employed fifteen hundred boats , and thlj was the period of their greatest splendour . The neighbouring states , Flanders in particular , had set them an example of industry . During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , the Low Countries were most flourish* ing , they were , indeed , the centre of commerce , connecting that of the south of Europe with that of the north . Bruges , Antwerp , Mechlin , and Ghent were then some of the most populous and industrious cities in this quarter of the globe . Vessels belonging to all nations filled the port of Bruges , and brought thither the productions of the /z/ remotest countries , in exchange for such as they wanted ; so that Bruges was the magazine for almost all the commodities of the then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diffused prosperity through the adjacent provinces . The commercial cities of Germany , which had at an early period entered into a treaty of alliancdv known in history hy the appellation of the Hanseatic League , had extensive storehouses at Bruges . This city contained , besides , fifteen commercial companies , and a great number of foreign mercantile houses . Great numbers of persons , engaged in trade , quitted , with their families , France , Spain , England , and Germany , for the purpose of settling at Bruges . All the towns of the Netherlands were full of linen and woollen manufactories , which afforded constant employment to a great number of skilful workmen . The excellent quality of their productions , which were exported to distant countries , deservedly procured them a high character ; and increasing wealth rewarded their indefatigable industry and activity . A skilful and diligent workman is sure to meet with a good reception wherever he goes , and is never at a loss for a livelihood : but he loves peace and tranquillity ; and when war begins to ravage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his art to another . Such was the course pursued in the middle ages by the artisans of the Low Countries , especially the weavers and manufacturers of cloth . Having been harassed and oppressed in some of the towns of Flanders , they went in great numbers and settled in other places . By this emigration the manufactures of the latter increased to an astonishing degree . The city of Lou vain alone contained , at that time , four thousand master weavers , and fifteen thousand journeymen ; but these industrious people , receiving fresh molestations , /z/ quitted the country and dispersed ; some repairing to Holland and Germany , and others to England . From this period our cloth manufactures have kept gradually rising into their present importance . At the end of the fourteenth century , iiowever , Bruges was still the centre of the commerce of almost all Europe . The ships of the Hanse Towns brought thither furs , deal and oak timber , beer , bacon , copper , and leather ; and Spanish and Portuguese vessels arrived with cargoes of figs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , quicksilver , and other commodities . The French there exchanged their salt , and red and white wines : and the English their wool , beer , lead , and tin . Italian vessels imported the most valuable merchandise : the Genoese brought raw silks , gold and silver thread , cotton , and alum : the Florentines and Venetians came with spices and drugs from the Levant , jewels , sugar , and sweet wines . In short , there was not an article of necessity , convenience , or luxury , but what was bartered at Bruges , and there found buyers and sellers . Several useful inventions which began to be generally adopted about that period added new branches to the commerce of the Netherlands , and gave an increased stimulus to talents and industry . In 1410 , a painter of Bruges , named Van Eyck , made improvements in the art of painting in oil ; from that time pictures executed by means of these new processes were in such request in foreign countries that the painters of the Netherlands could not furnish them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engraving on wood , which wa$ brought in to its aid , gave a fresh impulse to industry . Soon aAerwards attempts were made to engrave on metal , and a new pleasure was afforded to the lovers of the fine arts . At Nuremberg , in Germany , hand-guns and watches were about the same /z/ time invented . Another inhabitant of Bruges discovered the method of cutting and polishing diamonds . All these fortunate discoveries produced great changes in manners and the way of living . Luxury increased with the wealth which flowed into the Low Countries . Bruges , which owed its splendour to the laborious industry of its manufacturers , grew too opulent , and began to conceive too strong a relish for indolence and ostentation , to preserve the same character . Commerce can not be upheld without industry and activity ; and when these two supports fail , the momentary lustre which it diflused declines and disappears . So it fared with Bruges . The inhabitants being gradually habituated to pomp , and having relinquished the simple and modest manners of their forefathers , neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that mart . Another city found means to attract them , and to win their confidence : Antwerp increased at the expense of Bruges , and soon eclipsed , by its astonishing splendour , the high reputation which the latter had hitherto exclusively enjoyed . We shall see tomorrow to what a pitch of grandeur Antwerp attained about the middle of the sixteenth century . This account can not fail to interest you , because it relates to one of the most flourishing periods of modern history . The human mind , tired with the descriptions of so many wars and fatal catastrophes , with which the history of all ages and of all nations is filled , turns with double satisfaction to the picture of the periods of their prosperity . These , indeed , occupy but a very small space , in proportion to the rest of history ; but , at least , they demonstrate to what a degree of felicity human society may attain by the arts of peace , and by the exercise of the intellectual faculties which Providence has conferred on man . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may suppose , did DOt keep him waiting for them the following evening . Their father entered , and thus resumed the account which the night before he had been obliged to break off . The rapid increase of the grandeur of Antwerp is a circumstance of which there are but few parallels in history . Few cities have risen solely by commerce lo the degree of splendour to which that place attained in the sixteenth century . It was chiefly by the strict honour and punctuality of its merchants that this city drew foreign nations to its mart , and soon became the centre of the commerce then carried on with all quarters of the world . There was no region , however remote , in which the merchants of Ajit- /z/ werp were not known and in high credit . The richest commercial men of other countries repaired in great numbers to Antwerp , and settled there with their families . The wealth which poured into the city was immense ; and the merchandise brought thither from all parts of the globe accumulated to such a degree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time assures us , that every valuable and curious production of both Indies , Asia , and Africa abounded at Antwerp . " Its storehouses , " says he , " overflow with all the productions wafted by the Nile , the Ganges , the Tagus , the Seine , the Rhone , the Tiber , the Rhine , the Danube , and other famous rivers . Marble , ivory , and brass are there piled up in enormous heaps : you there see mountains of pepper , ginger , and other spices , as also of rare and costly woods . The shops are filled with immense quantities of rich stuffs and silks of the most beautiful colours . In short all the treasures of nature and art are there displayed . " In the middle of the sixteenth century Antwerp had twelve thousand houses , and upwards of two hundred thousand inhabitants , both citizens and foreigners , who were almost all engaged in some branch of trade or manufacture : the skill and punctuality of the Antwerpers were celebrated throughout all Europe . Children , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of their parents , and earned a livelihood by making small wares . One of the principal sources of wealth to the city was the fishery and trade in fish , which afforded employment and profit to a great proportion of its inhabitants . On market days , eight or nine hundred ships were sometimes collected in the port of Antwerp , and upwards of seventy-five thousand cod-fish sold on account of the /q/ fishermen in one day . Fish abounded in general at the tables of the rich as well as of the poor : and immense quantities were besides exported to France , Spain , England , and Italy . The circulation of money could not be more active than in that city : the amount of the business annually transacted there was estimated at five hundred millions of crowns of Brabant , exclusive of what was done in the way of barter , the total amount of which was never known . One banker paid a single draft for seven hundred thousand guilders in specie ; a month afterwards he paid a million ; three months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short time , seven hundred thousand . In the houses of the great merchants , the stranger was dazzled with the gold , silver , and precious stones which glistened in every part of them . Commercial prosperity and great wealth are always accompanied by a taste for the fine arts , and awaken genius . The prospect of gain sharpens the invention , and the hope of acquiring a fortune encourages artists . No city of that time afforded them such resources as Antwerp ; and thither the ablest painters , architects , statuaries , and engravers consequently resorted . Most of these artists had been educated in Italy ; but Antwerp alone could worthily reward their efforts and their talents . These again instructed a great number of pupils , who afterwards dispersed themselves throughout all the countries of Europe . Antwerp had then arrived at the highest degree of splendour to which any city ever exalted itself by its own proper means : but cities and states are liable to the same vicissitudes as individuals : their splendour passes away , and leaves nothing but the pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearer is their decline , /z/ and the more tremendous their fall . Wealth is very often the first step towards indigence ; because , in extraordinary good fortune , men are rarely capable of keeping within the bounds of moderation , and avoiding excesses . In proportion as the merchants of Antwerp grew rich , they lost the simplicity and integrity which had gained them the confidence of foreigners ; they became proud and prodigal ; the folly of striving to surpass one another in luxury and expense seized most of them , and deranged their afiairs . Their haughty behaviour disgusted great numbers of foreigners ; the Dutch strove to draw to their country part of the trade of Antwerp ; and , being more sober , more industrious , more punctual in their dealings than the merchants of the Netherlands , their enterprises prospered , and they acquired wealth by prudent and judicious speculations . Such was the first cause of the decline of Antwerp . Events of another kind , which have so often overthrown empires and cities , completed the ruin of that celebrated mart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourishing cities of Brabant , and gave a mortal blow to commerce and industry , which had rendered them so opulent . The Netherlands belonged to the King of Spain . Philip the Second , a prince who persecuted with excessive severity the various sects which had separated from the church , then swayed the Spanish sceptre . His intolerant sentiments drove his subjects into rebellion ; they asserted their right to change their government ; and endeavoured , by force of arms , to emancipate themselves from the authority which they had hitherto obeyed . The intestine commotions began in 1567 , and drew down numberless calamities on the inhabitants of these provinces . Antwerp , their capital , was destined to suffer the most severely , and long to feel the effects of civil war . In November , 1576 , /z/ this magnificent city was taken by the Spanish troops , and ravaged in the most terrible manner . The town-house and eit hundred other houses , were consumed by fire ; seven thousand citizens of distinction perished by the sword of the enemy , and the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The booty taken by the soldiers was prodigious ; but as the city was surrounded by the troops of the states , it could not be carried away . The soldiers , as thoughtless in their pleasures as they were cruel in their rage , then assembled at the exchange ; where they placed a great number o ( tables , played for whole days together , and lost in a few moments the prodigious sums of which their rapacity had dispossessed the lawful owners . Some of them , more covetous or more prudent , had cuirasses and arms made of solid gold ; with which they sallied from the city , after staining them with a black liquid , which gave them a colour resembling that of iron ; but the goldsmiths , not less artful than the soldiers , contrived to keep part of the gold , and to supply its place with copper . The long duration of this war , and the consequent calamities , famine , pestilence , and want , made such a total change in the condition . of the Netherlands that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be more striking than the contrast between these provinces ravaged by war , and their fiourishing state previously to the troubles . That population which had before given life to the smallest places , and made them commercial towns , had disappeared ; many fine villages were deserted ; the fields , so lately covered with abundant crops , were now overrun with thorns and briars : thick woods usurped the lands which had been cultivated with such care ; and , instead of happy people , the passenger met with nothing but wild animals , chiefly wolves and foxes , which VOL. n. 8 /z/ the small number of inhabitants who remained were unable to destroy . The largest towns , Antwerp , Bruges , Ghent , Brussels , Ypres , and others had lost the greatest part of their industrious citizens , who were dispersed over the world . The fortune of war had reduced the most distinguished families to indigence ; people , who by their increasing wealth had excited the envy of their fellow citizens , asked charity after dark in the streets , or were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not perish of hunger . Moreover , other nations about this time established commercial marts in their own territories . Speculation became more extended , and enterprises more divided , especially in consequence of the intercourse with America ; and since the fall of Antwerp , scarcely any city has been able to draw to itself , like that place , all the business of the whole commercial world . You see , my dears , what prosperity , industry , and the arts can diffuse through a state ; but the example of Antwerp likewise shows the  --  fatal effects of excessive wealth , and the difficulty of keeping in a happy mediocrity . Before we have done with the interesting history of the commerce of past ages , I will give you some account of a very curious kind of traffic , which was for some time in fashion in Holland , and even produced a sudden kind of revolution in that country . These particulars will convince you of the truth of my observation , that men rarely know how to keep within the bounds of moderation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the instance that I am about to adduce was of less consequence than those which I have already related , and only shows the absurdity of men when under the influence of any prevailing fashion or folly . /q/ Among the native productions of the east introduced into Europe by means of its relations with India , was a flower which the Turks call tulibant and which received in Europe the appellation of tulip . It appears to have been well known in this part of the world so early as the middle of the sixteenth century . These flowers , you know , though of every variety of colour , . are not the greatest ornaments of our gardens , being surpassed by many otliers in beauty and fragrance . Nevertheless the tulip , about a century after its transplantation into Europe , acquired a consideration which no other flower ever obtained ; so that it was valued far above even the most precious metals . The lovers of flowers seemed to be seized with a sort of madness , which has been aptly denominated tulipomania , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folly which this word denotes , and of which there are but few parallels . . It was from 1634 to 1637 that the tulipomania raged in Holland , particularly at Harlaem , Amsterdam , Utrecht , Alkmacr , Leyden , Rotterdam , * Horn , EnkhuyseUf and other places . In those years tulips rose to enormous prices , and enriched many speculators . The florists held in particular estimation certain species , to which they gave particular names , and which they sold dearer than others . A single root of the variety called viceroy produced the owner four fat oxen , eight hogs , twelve sheep , ten hundred weight of cheese , two pipes of wine , a bed and furniture complete , a silver cup , a great quantity of corn , and other provisions , to the value of twenty-flve thousand florins . These roots were sold by weight , like the most valuable commodities ; an ounce often cost several thousand florins : the most esteemed variety was that called semper auguatus ; /z/ it was valued at two thousand florins , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots of the kind ; one at Harlaem , and the other at Amsterdam . A flower* fancier ofiered for one of these , four thousand six hundred florins , and a fine coach and two horses into the bargain . Another person gave twelve acres of land for a root . In 1637 , the collection of tulips of one individual , was sold , after hifiC death , by his heirs , for the enormous sum of nine thousand pounds ; one single semper augustus sold for two thousand florins . Everybody 's head was turned by the passion for ' tulips ; those who had not ready money bartered away their l &nds; and houses to procure them . The florists , and other persons who were engaged in the cultivation of flowers , in a veiy short time made immense fortunes . All classes of society were therefore desirous of embarking in the trade ; and all the Dutch from the first gentleman in the land to the chimney-sweeper and rag-man , began to speculate on the tulipomania . A bed of tulips was considered the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least as much as the most ma'gnificent palace . It is related , that a sailor , having brought some goods to a merchant who cultivated tulips in his garden for this speculation , received from the latter a herring for breakfast . As he Was going away with it , he saw some roots in the garden ; and thinking they were common onions , he began quietly eating them with his herring . At this moment the merchant came up , and perceiving what he was about , " Villain ! " cried he , in a tone of despair , " your breakfast has ruined me ; I could have regaled a monarch at half the expense . " The poor sailor , as you may suppose , was in the utmost astonishment ; and it was not without difficulty that he was made sensible of his mistake . /q/ Th ? rapid increase of private fortunes made people neglect everything to engage in the speculations of the moment . The taverns and alehouses resembled little exchanges ; bargains were there concluded in the presence of notaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in general these negotiations , which were transacted with the utmost gravity were followed by splendid entertainments . It has been calculated. , that in one single town of Holland the dealings in tulips amounted in three years to ten millions of florins . It should be observed , however , that those who carried on this traffic did not cultivate the flowers , but only bought and sold ; and it was frequently the case , that neither the buyer nor the seller ever saw the tulips for which they bargained . Others engaged to supply roots , which in fact they never furnished : before the flowering season , arrangements and negotiations were concluded for the sale and purchase of more tulips than perhaps all the gardens in Holland contained . There existed , as I have told you , but very few flowers of the variety called semper ixuguatus ; and yet no other kind was so frequent in commerce as that . A gentleman would perhaps buy of a chimney-sweeper two Uiousand florins worth of tulips , and sell them again to a farmer at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had the tulips , or thought of obtaining possession of them It was not properly speaking in tulips that they traflicked , but in money . Had the rarity and beauty of the tulips been the object of this trade , people would have bestowed the utmost attention on the cultivation of that flower : they would have gone to its native country , the east , and sought the most beautiful species all the world over : but , instead of this , the speculators never quitted their alehouse , and enriched themselves by an ex /z/ // traordinary kind of jobbing ; the whole secret of which was this : Suppose a dealer engaged to furnish a gentleman at the expiration of six months with a tulip-root of any particular iBort , for the sum of a thousand florins ; at the expiration of the time agreed upon , the price of that variety was either higher or lower , or perhaps the same as before . If the current price of one thousand florins had meanwhile risen to fifteen hundred , the gentleman did not demand his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred florins in cash ; but if the price was lower than at the . time of making the bargain , say eight hundred florins , the gentleman , on the contrary , paid the dealer the sum of two hundred . If , however , the tulips were neither dearer nor cheaper at the end of six months , neither party lost or gained , and their contract was at an end . Every* thing depended on the price current , by which they regulated their agreements and bargains ; and the dealers were as anxious to know the prices of tulips every day , as people are with us to inquire the prices of stocks . It frequently happened , that the same person gained of one , and lost to another ; and if he had no cash to pay his debts , he referred his creditors to those who had lost to him ; so that plenty of business might be transacted without tulips , and even without mojiey . As everybody was desirous of participating in this kind of stock-jobbing , the rich speculated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes were confined to the most common sorts . Taking all circumstances into consideration , this commerce in tulips , or rather tulipomania , was in reality a game of chance , by which all were at first seduced by the immense profits to be derived from it ; but as these speculations possessed only a fictitious lustre , and /q/ had no solid foundation , the gamesters were at length undeceived , and learned , to their cost , that excessive cupidity generally makes dupes of those by whom it is harboured , and that labour and industry are the surest road to fortune . Nations and individuals , who apply themselves to commerce , can not , I repeat it , hope for prosperity , except from industry and frugality . To conclude the history of the tulipomania , I shall add , that in a few years the rage for speculations rose to such a height that most of those who engaged in them were at length unable to fulfil their contracts . Others squandered the wealth which they had so easily acquired ; whilst others again more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their property to continual risk . The price of tulips fell lower and lower ; the sellers , to avoid utter ruin , offered the buyers natural tulips , but the latter would not have them . Hence arose numberless squabbles and law-suits : the tribunals refused to diecide these complicated affairs ; and the speculators were obliged to abate their extravagant demands , and to take what they could get . Many were ruined , and had unfortunately conceived an aversion to their original occupations , which had furnished them with the means of a comfortable subsistence . Accustomed to indolence and reverses of fcnrtune , they chose rather to live in penury than to return to their former employments . The eyes of all were at length opened , and many people became sensible of their folly and shame , at the expense of their property and peace of mind . At the beginning of the last century a game of chance of the like nature was introduced into France , by a man named Law , a Scotchman , who had gained the confidence of government by exhibiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state . He was appointed direc- // tor of a company of merchants trading to Louisiana in America , and he opened a bank at Paris . - By spreading a report that gold and silver mines had been discovered in Louisiana richer than those of Peru , he roused the spirit of cupidity ; every one hastened to partake of the working of these mines ; shares were purchased with avidity , and this speculation became in the end an insatiable passion . The price of the shares rose from five hundred francs to a thousand : fresh shares were now offered , misers themselves could not resist the temptation , exchanging their treasures against bits of paper , which were to produce wealth without end . All ranks of the nation speculated ; Law was looked up to as a universe benefactor ; no private individual had ever enjoyed so large a share of consideration ; a single audience with this banker was talked of as an important circumstance in a man 's life . This mania extended to the provinces , the country people flocked to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank was besieged from morning till night ; but , as the treasures for which they exchanged their solid gold for that in the mins of Louisiana arrived not , the confidence of the people bu to be shaken . They became anxious to dispose of their paper shares ; but as everybody nearly possessed more or less of these valueless tickets , there were no purchasers . The bank was then beset , not for paper shares , but for money ; and Law , alter , having been flattered , blessed , and courted , was compelled to a disgraceful and hasty flight . It was now perceived that instead pf lightening the burthens of the state it had indeed added to them . This being the case , government had recourse to other and more substsuitial means . But the failure of this scheme did not prevent the French , in imitation of our bank notes , resorting to a plan of the same kind during /q/ f the revolution . They issued assignats ; but the nation in general was not to be so readily duped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few made their for tunes , but the assignats were quickly withdrawn from cir* culation* A few have been saved as curiosities , and as a melancholy remembrance of the unhappy epoch . I must , however , revert to Holland and to flowers ; the city of Harlaem has to this day preserved a peculiar taste for flowers . About a century after the tulip mania a pas* sion for hyacinth arose , and in 1730 a single root was sold for a hundred Louis d'or ; but this passion was of short duration , and the hyacinth soon sunk to the same level as the tulips ; yet the Dutch florists still cultivate the finer sorts of hyacinths , which are high priced . Besides which , they possess a great profusion of the principal flowers of the parterre , and they even form a considerable article of commerce with them . This taste has extended itself to Flanders , where in some cities exhibitions are held in the spring : those amateurs who produce the finest specimens are entitled to a prize . The ladies are candidates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evening , Edward begged his father would permit him to skait on the following day with his brother Gustavus , as the river was frozen completely over . Mr. Oakley consented , adding , " It is in the country we have just discussed tliat skaiting is carried to the greatest perfection . Holland , being everywhere intersected by gulfs , canals , and rivers , presents , on all sides , vast plains of ice , which furnish much amusement , and are the grand means of communication between distant parts . Men and women , old people and young , all skait , sometimes alone , sometimes in companies . The gulf of Y before Amsterdam , and the Mercer at Rotterdam become /z/ the scene of general diversion . The country people profit bj the frost to cany easily their goods to market : the ladies are conducted in sledges by good skaiters : they have also a kind of boat , which , resting upon two pieces of iron , glides like a sledge ; when it is furnished with a sail it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Swedes are as good skaiters as the Dutch ; indeed , almost all the northern nations excel in this amusement . They make parties of pleasure , they travel , and they thus carry provisions and merchandise in a very short space of time from one place to another . ' * Caroline observed , that she should like to know what a person who had never seen water frozen would say of this amusement Mr. O. You may infer the efiect of such a sight from the following anecdote , which I read in some book of travels :  --  An ambaJBsador of the Emperor of Morocco at the Hague , desirous of giving his master some idea of the amusement of skaiting , wrote to him , that during a certain season , all the rivers of the Netherlands were covered with a kind of cake , which looked like sugarcandy , and was capable of bearing carriages and horses ; that at such times multitudes of men and women took infinite pleasure in running as swiftly as an ostrich upon these cakes , with the help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their feet . The Emperor of Morocco looked upon this account of his ambassador as so incredible that he called him a story-teller . Gtutav . This story reminds me of a female Creole who arrived in Paris before last winter from the Isles of France . Seeing one morning the houses and streets covered with snow , she exclaimed , * ' Oh , I wonder who has covered all the places with white cloth ? " /q/ Mr. O. In a country where the inhabitants live so near the water , it will naturally be supposed that frequent accidents happen . In order to render them less fatal , a charitable society has been established at Amsterdam to restore those to life in whom the vital spark is not quite extinct , and to reward those who shall save the life of a fellow creature . This charitable institution , the first of its kind , was established on account of the dangers of the water and their remedies , and in the course of six years two hundred persons were rescued from a watery grave . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same kind . In 1771 Paris had an establishment , and in 1774 London followed her example , as did other cities of England , under the title of * Humane Societies . " Gustav , Of the various amusements , which you have mentioned , among the people you have visited , do you recollect to have seen any ' which were , on the whole , preferable to the field sports of our own country ? Mr , O , I am hardly qualified to answer that question with impartiality , as I happen to be very partial to our English sports . Fox-hunting is an exilarating , though rather wild sport ; in my young days I was extravagantly fond of shooting , " not so much I think on account of any pleasure I took in destroying the harmless birds , for 1 often felt compunctious visitings as I saw the poor things fluttering and gaspingafter the fatal shot  --  but on account of the delightful scenery and the thousand agreeable sights , incidents , and sounds , which a sportsman meets with in only passing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend you , my boys , to practise shooting . Botanizing , or seeking minerals , will familiarize you with the wild haunts of nature , without causing pain to any living thing . /z/ Mr. 0 . Germant , with the account of which I shall entertain you this evening , composed of many great and small states govemed by different sovereigns , who have Tormed a conrederation for their common interests . Under the Roman Emperors it was a barbarous province , but in these times , ii is Ihe country of all others , where the Greek and Iiatin classics are most studied . By stndy , labour , and economy , the Germans are become a great nation , to whom we are indebted for many important discoveries . A happy emulation prevails among several of their minor cities , the effects of which are distinguishable in their commerce and industry . Until the commencement of the thirteenth century they had innumerable difficulties to struggle agmnst . The nobility , infatuated by the chivalrous spirit of those days , eared but little for anght hut adventures ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other , and despised the merchants who neither could nor would fights Oftentimes they confined them in strong castles , or watched for them and pillaged them on the public road ; thus many of these castles were in fact but receptacles for daring banditti . The princes dared not protect the oppressed merchants , who , by their connection with the Jews , ere in some degree partakers of the contempt to which that unhappy race was doomed . Yet the spirit of commerce opposed this yiolencp , and finally gained the esteem of the other classes of society . Those merchants who had an extensive commeroe associated together for their mutual safety . In the middle of the thirteenth century , two com . mercial cities , Hamburg and Lubeck , were the first which formed a treaty against thepirates and powers who appeared resolved to crush their commerce . This treaty was called the Hanseatic League . The cities composing it armed vessels which drove away the pirates that had infeskd the German Ocean and the Baltic Sea . Other commercial cities soon discovered the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the cities of Wiemar , Rostock , Stralsund , Groningen , Lunenburg , Bresme , Magdeburg , Halle , Goslar , and some others were successively admitted . All these cities were remarkable for a spirit of activity : their ships visited every port ; they had factories in England , Spain , Flanders , Italy , Norway , and Russia ; princes protected them , and even sought their alliance . The inland cities enriched themselves by the convoy of merchandise to and from the ports . The road to Italy passed through Augaburg and Frankfort ; the merchandise from Asia came by way of Riga , and the other ports of the Baltic : by Strasburg , Aix la Chapelle , and Brussels they corresponded with France ; all these /q/ /z/ places became eminent-as the resort of merchants , artists and workmen . At Frankfort a fair was . established to which all the merchants of Europe repaired . Gold and silver abounded in the great cities of Germany ; the gbldsmiths and jewellers received these metals from Saxony and other countries where mines were worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were admitted only expert and clever men ; and these watched over their common interests and kept order among the difiert members . In the evening and on Sundays the masters of the corporations assembled together for amusement This custom still continues in several cities of Germany . Endowed with a peaceable temper and much patience , the Germans have distinguished themselves greatly by their inventions , and the perfection to which they have brought them . The art of oil painting , which was revived in Flanders , was adapted by the Germans to the painting of tapestry , and they soon supplied other countries with this article . A monk of Cologne , named Schwartz , discovered in the fourteenth century the art of making gunpowder , as he was performing a chemical operation . The explosion at first terrified him ; a second time he mixed the same ingredients , viz. charcoal , nitre , and ' sulphur , and reducing this substance to a certain proportion , produced gunpowder . The Arabs were acquainted with a destructive mixture of this kind , in which naphtha formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combustible powder with which they composed their fireworks . The Germois soon learned to apply this destructive powder to the uses of war ; they cast cannon and made guns , and this fabrication occupied many artisans . /q/ Caroline , Papa , is it not a very bad thing that gunpowper was invented ? Mr , O , " That certainly may be called a bad invention which injures ; but the sad desire to injure our fellow creatures did not arise from this invention ; for dince men have assembled in societies the passions of their nature make them revengeful . You know* from history that the wars of former times were as sanguinary as those of the present day . Instead of cannons and guns , the ancients made use of catapults , slings , and bows : they fought hand to hand . The present system of warfare is more scientific than that of former times , but I doubt whether it . is more sanguinary . But war , even when undertaken in our own defence , is always too much so , and calls forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebted to the . Germans of the middle ages for more agreeable , aoid moe useful discoveries . An artisan of Nuremberg invented watches ; clocks had already supplied the place of the hourglass . The first clock which appeared in Europe was that which Haroun al Raschid sent to Charlemagne . This was indeed a royal present : no such ingenious method of dividing time was known to us at that time . Edm . Papa , how did the ancients divide time ? Mr. O , In the earliest ages men were reduced to mere observation upon the position of the sun , the state of the - firmament , or the length and position of shadows . To shepherds and peasants who pass their time in the open air , this was no difficult task : from hence arose pyramids and obelisks , whose shadows indicated the hour , and sundiab ; hourglasses are very ancient likewise ; before the discovery of watches they were in general use . The introduction of clocks into Europe was a real benefit , when /z/ once known , and they were soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather made , was in France , in the year 1370 ; Charles the Fifth caused it to be constructed by Henry de Wick ; it was erected in the tewer of his palace , which is to tiiis day-called " The tower of the Clock . " CrU8tav . Is it not the tower situated at the extremity of the " Palace oC Justice " and the " Quai de THorloge ? " Mr , O. Precisely so . In Italy and in France clocks were in use in the thirteenth century , but they were rare , and consequently Very high priced . The German artists went on perfecting their useful works , adding fresh wonders to their mechanism : they represented the course of the stars and the calendar festivals , and they chimed tunes , &c.; Three of their clock makers completed that masterpiece in the cathedral of Strasburg , upon the plan of the celebrated mathematician Pasypodius , between the years 1571 and 1574 . This fine clock indicated the movements of the starry host , the planets in the zodiac ; seven mythological statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of every hour an angel raised his sceptre as if to give the signal for striking , w.hile another turned an hourglass ; then a lion began to roar , and a cock to crow , flapping his wings at the same time . Four figures , Representing the four ages of man , struck upon four bells , indicating the quarters of the hour ; and after them appeared the figure of death to strike the funeral knell to the hour gone by , never to return . Caroline , Oh , papa , what a beautiful idea ! Mr. O , Very much so , my child ; it was an allegory designed as a warning picture of the fleeting hours of man . This ingenious piece of work has , however , been long destroyed . The clock in the cathedral ohorch at Lyons , /q/ made by Lippius , a German likewise , is not less complete than the former ; it is shut up in a square tower surmounted by a dome , at the top of which a cock flaps his wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour and another to turn the hourglass ; the chimes at the same time play the hymn of St. John , , and a little figure beats time : there are other figures which represent the mystery of the Annunciation . This clock has been frequently repaired . At Nuremberg , Venice , and Augsburg other curious clocks have been constructed . ' That which struck most upon the imagination and ' fancy of the people was the movement of the figures ; ignorant that a single lever or a wheel could produce what appeared so wonderful . As the science , however , advanced , artists became anxious to make them more correct as to time . At length they were made portable , but it was not till the spiral spring was discovered that watches were invented . Heele has the reputation of its invention . The improvements made by the Swiss , the French , and the English in this curious piece of mechanism are prodigious . But the most useful of all its improvements is the chronometer , which is a sure guide to mariners when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparison of the height of the sun and the hour it was at the place they last left . Edw , . We were taught its application in our geographical lessons . For instance , when a pilot finds that it is midday where he is , and that it is two o'clock at Brest where he regulated his chronometer , he concludes Uiat there is the difference of two hours between them ; and , as the distance of an hour upon the globe is equal to fifteen degrees of longitude , he is sure that the place he then occupies is /z/ thirty degrees of longitude , or seven hundred and fifty leagues from Brest . Mr , O. I see , my son , that you thoroughly understand the use of the chronometer ; and this knowledge shows yon of what infinite advantage to astronomy , geography , and navigation this single mechanic art of watch-making has produced . Numberless other machines have arisen from this discovery , among which is one called ** the musical chronometer . " By lengthening or shortening the pendulum , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we must return to the Germans , to whom we are indebted , for another branch of industry of the greatest importance ; I mean that of printing . In order to value this discovery you have only to look at the men of former times and those of the present day . Ages passed away without ' the knowledge of writing ; remarkable events were transmitted by word of mouth from one generation to another . Memory is one of the faculties of the mind which may be wonderfully strengthened by exercise . It has been presumed that the Poems of Homer were thus transmitted to posterity . The Scotch ibountaineers are famous for transmitting their national songs in this way from father to son . Some helps were at length given to this power of the mind ; hieroglyphics were invented ; the Egyptians for many years made use of this imperfect writing . Material objects were represented by their own images , and imaginary ones , or abstract ideas , were expressed by syngibols . Thus , a serpent with a tail in his mouth was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle the sun 's course in the heavens . The ancient monuments of Egypt , the obelisks , the mummiei , the papyrus are covered /q/ with these hieroglyphics ; which , imperfectly expressing the ideas of those who invented them , have become perfect enigmas to posterity . This symbolical writing is still used by several nations who are unacquainted with any other mode . The natives of the Molucca islands , for instance* express their thoughts by fruits and . flowers : the/Sotith Sea islanders , and several Asiatic tribes , employ flowers and branches of trees for the same purpose . Caroline . But how can . they recollect things by this method ? Mr. O. Every branch , every flower , represents some idea , some name ; and by the arrangement of these things they communicate their ideas with great clearness . When one of our ships , on her departure from New Zealand , brought away a young native of that country , he took on board with him a quantity of boughs , which formed his journal of the voyage : for whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which he laid one of his boughs in a particular way , aid afterwards had only to look at them when he wanted to recollect the names of any of those islands . The savages of America make use of sticks of different sizes . When they send a deputy to another tribe , he carries with him a number of sticks . On his arrival he has nothing to do but to look at them to put himself in mind of all his commissions . He frequently speaks for whole hours , and his harangue is expressed oitly by his sticks . On his return he employs the same method to communicate to his countrymen the fesult of his mission . There are other American nations , who tiransaet all their negotiations by means of a pipe , which is denominated calumet , and is adorned in various ways , accoxdingly as they are desirous of peace , war , or aUianoe with their /z/ neighbours . The inhabitants of Peru , before the invasion of Uieir country by the Spaniards , had , instead of writings , signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colours , by means of which they expressed all their ideas . When the Spaniards instructed them in the Christian religion , tiiey also made use of stones of every shape , which Uiey arranged in different ways , to enable them to remember the prayers which they were taught . Caroline . It must be confessed that men are very ingenious in every country . Mr , O. Your observation is just , Caroline ; all nations have adopted some plan to assist in communicating their thoughts to others , or of retaining those which they have received . The figures which are engraven upon the ancient monuments of Denmark , Sweden , and Norway , and which are called RuniCi appear to be an invention resembling that of the Chinese . Their meaning is unknown : all these ways of communicating thoughts to the absent are imperfect . Writing by letters is ' the only accurate way we have of conveying our feelings to each other when absent , and this plan has therefore been adopted by all civilized nations . The Greeks and Romans had letters , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries been possessed of this wonderful art . The ancients wrote upon parchment , upon the papyrus , upon wax , &c.; The Indians - write upon palm-tree leaves , nay , paper has been long known in Asia , particularly in China . The want of this article in Europe rendered books exceedingly rare and dear ; for parchment was difficult to be got at all times , and hence arose that destructive principle of effacing ancient writings in order again to make use of the same skins . In Italy , many fragments of this kind have been fomid. /z/ partly effaced , the r'emains of which make us the more regret what is lost ; since the writing which has replaced them does but ill supply the classic lore of ancient Rome . As the taste for literature increased , books became invaluable ; a book well written was a kind of treasure , which was bequeathed to descendants or public communities , as we would now bequeath our landed property . The monks enriched their , convents and the courts of their princes with manuscripts truly precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed . Writing was then a trial of patience ps well as skill . The initial letters were either in gold or colours . Sometimes books were illuminated by pretty miniatures ; and the covers were not unfrequently of cdrved ivory . In Flanders there was an establishment of monks , called ** Brothers of common life who gained their livelihood by copying books . The Great Chronicles of Saint Dcnys , which contained the History of F/ance , were so much venerated that they were preserved in the treasury of that abbey , and were shown to strangers as one of the most precious treasures it contained . In times of great trouble , these chronicles were consulted as precious deposits of wisdom . But this mode of writing books was tedious ; wooden blocks were , therefore , invented , upon which a page was cut , and the impression taken off . This idea arose , perhaps , from seal , impressions , and the figures upon playing cards , which were long known before printing , and which now , unfortunately , form a favourite pastime all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Cards appear to have been an invention of the Orientals , always in search of sedentary amusements . It is probable they were introduced from the East by the- , commerce of /z/ Lombardy and Venice with those parts . They were known in Gennany so early as the fourteenth century , probably imported thither by the Imperial troops who had served in Italy . The Geimans appear , not only to have entered into the spirit of this amusement , but to have made it , finally , subservient to commerce . They furnished most countries with them , always considering the particular taste of each people in their desis ; for in the south , they represented upon their cards , and still do the same , cups or chalices , swords , the coin denier , and batons ; in the northy they preferred pictures of little bells , acorns , oak leaves , and hearts ; in France they chose spades , diamonds , hearts , and clubs . It is pretended , that these four images , originally , represented the four castes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , merchants or citizens , and peasants . In Spain , several kings forbade their use , under severe penalties ; but the love of play was so general that the laws could not check it . A traveller of the sixteenth century says , that he frequently could neither get bread nor wine , nor any other provisions ; but that cards were offered him everywhere , even in the smallest villages . Gustav , France of course followed this example . Mr. O , Cards were introduced into France at the beginning of the fourteenth century ; but they were equally forbidden by the laws ; and although in private families they were very generally in use , the court thought it an amusement but ill according th the value of time . They were , however , sanctioned in the reign of Charles the Sixth , as an amusement for at unhappy monarch during his dreadful malady . Many authors relate , that a man called GringonQeur , undertook fo twenty-nine sous , to paint cards in gold and colours for the amusement of the /q/ king . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a popular amusement* Piquet and other gameff were soon invented . Caroline . But what great amusement is there in cardplaying ? I should have thought that more varied amusements should long ere this have supplanted cards . Mr , O. It was precisely because cards require neither knowledge , skill , nor feflection , that they suited the different tastes of society in those times , when the multitude was totally ignorant , and the higher classes of society were proficients in nought but the arts of war . I am , however of your opinion ; we . have nowadays so many amusements , that cards ought to have been long ago exploded . Their toleration , however , is to be attributed to the inertness of the human mind in many instances . People possessing no energy of character , are cpntent to learn cardplaying , and when they have attained thus much of knowledge they are satisfied with their proficiency in wisdom . So long as they can find persons whose knowledge extends no further , they are content to play on . The Latin Grammar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe its printing to card-playing , or rather card-stamping . In the Royal Library at Paris , some of the wooden blocks are still preserved . But these blocks served only for one work ; and , by way of economy , single letters were cut , which might be moved at pleasure : but this method was tedious and expensive ; the cutting of so many letters in wood , which were soon worn out , was found to be little more advantageous than writing : invention then was set to work , and letters were cast in metal . From this moment printing became a solid good , which was by degrees brought to . its present state of perfection . Three industrious Germansi named Guttenburg , Faust , /z/ and Schoeffer , made many progressive improvements in it . Gattenburg , in 1450 , established the first printing press , with the assistance of his companion Faust . Shortly afterwards they were joined by Schoeffer , a man whose intelligence greatly contributed to the improvement of this new art . The first works which issued from this press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaluable by their owners . HolFand claims the invention of printing for Laurence Coster of Harlaem ; others attribute it to Mental of Strasbiirg ; but as we are not acquainted with any printed works previous to the time of Guttenburg and his companions , we must allow them the honour of inventing the typographic art This invention was no sooner known in France than it was proposed to introduce it into that country . In 1469 , . the prior of the Sorbonne at Paris , Jean de la Pierre , sent for three printers from Mentz , to set up a press even in the Sorbonne itself . The works which issued from this press , and those which came from Germany , so injured the trade of the copyists that they denounced printing to the parliament as a magic art , andthe wise magistrates were credulous enough to order the confiscation of the books immediately . But Louis the Eleventh , revoked the decree of the parliament , and ordered the books to be restored to * their owners . Faust had arrived in Paris some years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague in that city : Schoefifer came afterwards , and was received with distinguished marks of favour : Guttenburg had received an appointment in the house of the Elector of Mentz . The Emperor of Germany permitted the printers to set up presses throughout his dominions , and gave them ' the privilege of wearing golden fringe upon their , robes . Such was the respect which the inventors /q/ and their immediate successors received from the gratitude of mankind . Thanks to the art of printing , the thoughts of genius have now free power to charm . We can read and meditate upon Cicero , Demosthenes , Virgil and Homer , Plato and Xenophon ; we can , at a small expense , furnish our libraries with the choicest works of the ancients and modierns , and thus form an acquaintance with great men of all ages . Formerly , libraries containing a hundred volumes were considered large . But it is not the quantity of books which establishes the utility of printing . On the contrary , this precious art is often perverted to the worst of purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but those who skim lightly over many books , can know but little of their contents . A man who reads thus resembles him who , by seeing much company , is a stranger to the individuals who compose his society ; he knows them by sight , but of their characters and dispositions he is totally ignorant . As for bad books , they are as pernicious in their effects as bad company : with so many useful and agreeable books as there are for our perusal , it would be unpardonable to choose those of a different character . Since the invention of printing , instruction is become general , good books have multiplied , and many persons have spent large sums in the laudable purpose of dispersing them to their fellow creatures . An invention made in France , during the revolution , has greatly facilitated this desirable end . Till this period , the letters were separate and placed in forms , and after having inked the types , a sheet of damp paper was placed upon the forms , the whole together passing under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of printing . But stereo- voL. n. 10 // typing , tiie process to which I alluded just now , is differently performed ; instead of casting the characters separ rate , the stereotype page is cast solid ; to make this , the movable types are arranged at first in the usaal way , and a page being thus set up , a mould made of plaster of Paris is taken from them , the soft plaster sinks into the hollow of the letters , and thus it presents the whole page in relief . This mould is then baked in an oven until it is thoroughly dry ; when prepared in this way one or more pages can be cast from it ; these are called stereotype plates or pages . Gustav . What advantage has this mode of printing over the original one ? Mu O. l*he following . When a book is printed in the usual way , as many copies are printed as the author or publisher hopes to sell : the form is then distributed and the letters are again employed for other purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole composition must necessarily be reset , which greatly increases the expense of publication . In the stereotype , on the contrary , the types remain immovable , and you have only to pass the pages through the press to have another edition . The English nation have profited by printing to convey and extend the knowledge of the Christian religion to the most distant parts , where their missionaries have translated the scriptures into the language of the country they inhabit , they are then forwarded to England and printed . The United States have followed this praiseworthy example . The spirit of application , natural to the Germans , has turned the discovery of printing to good account . A number of books were printed and libraries were established for the use of schools . In no other country are so many books printed as in Germany . The city of Leipsic contains almost as many printing presses and libraries as EIGHTH EVENING . Ill the whole of Russia . Two great book fairs are held annually in this city , where a great number of books are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of printing , called lithography , or the art of drawing upon stone , and of taking off thousands of impressions of these drawings . This is a precious discovery , by means of which writings or drawings may be multiplied to an infinite degree . The taste for music , which may be said to have sprung originally from Italy is highly cultivated by the Germans . The names of Gluck , Haydn , and Mozart are familiar to all of you . In countries where the Catholic religion exists in all its splendour , this art is much prized . In some Cantons music is taught in the villages . The German musicians are spread in every country . The taste of this people for music has rendered them expert in producing instruments which add to its bewitching effects . Vienna , Prague , Auxburg , and Nuremburg contain many manufactories for musical instruments . The invention of piano-fortes , or harpsichords , is due to this people ; and it is they who have made the organ , so wonderful and so powerful an instrument . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well calculated for church music , and which can produce sounds thrilling as the loudest thunder , or sweet as the softest lute , was first invented by the Greeks of the Lower Empire . The Emperor Constantine Copronymus sent one to King Pepin , who placed it in the church at Compeigne ; and the Emperor Michael gave another to Charlemagne . These were looked upon as wonders in France . It is said , that the delight and surprise were so great , which the organ produced , that many persons fainted away upon hearing its first sounds . Others would not be persuaded // but that there was some one concealed within , who produced the thundering noise and the gentle sounds . But this organ was a feeble instrument compared to that of modem times ; it occupied so little compass that it was as easily transported from one place to another as are our piano-fortes . It , in fact , differed but little from an instrument which the Italians called Ninfale which the player attached to his body , while he played upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of bellows , which was attached to it , in order to fill the pipes with air . But when the industrious Germans had enlarged and perfected the organ , all other instruments were obliged to yield the palm to an instrument which produced the effect of a whole orchestra . It , in fact , consists of a variety of wind instruments , produced by a number of pipes of tin , of lead , or of wood ; which , receiving air , the player makes speak at pleasure , either by foot pedals or by the hand . The aperture through which the air passes into some of these pipes resemble that of a bassoon , or other instruments , and thus the great variety of sounds is produced . The organ has been introduced into most Christian churches ; that of Harlaem is justly celebrated ; but France , Germany , and England possess some exceedingly fine ones . You have often heard street organs : some of these are exceedingly well made . But the great masterpiece of mechanism is the union of clock-work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these machines , in which all kinds of instruments have been imitated , and put in motion by an automaton figure , which strikes the keys , as you or I would , apparently ; and one is perfectly astonished to hear a simple machine execute some of the most difficult pieces of Mozart , &c.; and producing the effect of a whole /q/ orchestra . Human ingenuity can now , I think , go no further . Before I dismiss you for the evening , continued Mr. Oakley , I have a drawing to show you which I think will interest you . It represents a splendid Asiatic bird .  --  Do you know what it is , Gustavus ? Guatav , Oh , yes . It is the bird of Paradise. * I have seen a drawing of one before . Mr. O , This I selected from a collection of drawings in the portfolio of a naturalist . He had delineated several varieties of this bird ; but this variety pleased my fancy most , and I obtained it . Gustav , How beautiful it is . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown . Mr. O. Our English ladies have already availed themselves of its beauty , and I am told that the tail of the Bird of Paradise is becoming quite a fashionable plume . Gustav . Is the bird valuable or pleasing from any other circumstance than its beautiful plumage ? Mr. O. No ! It has an unmusical voice , and its legs are particularly unsightly ; so much so , that the natives of the countries where they were taken used to cut them off , in former times , before they sold them to the European adventurers , pretending that they had no legs ; and this fable was vulgarly received , for some time , as a fact , in natural history . Crustav . I suppose such a statement would hardly gain credit now . Mr. O. No ; natural history has , of late , kept pace with other sciences in improvement , and an important error of this kind , has , now , only to be publicly announced in order to be contradicted by hundreds of competent authorities . /z/ The cabinets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with objects of art , admirable for the patience which their execution must have demanded . At Vienna there is a machine which copies writing , and also an automaton chess player , which plays the second pari . Several sovereigns have played with this singular machine . At Munich there is a harpsichord , which notes down the music as it is composed , upon the instrument The cabinet at this place contains also many other curiosities of this kind ; there is a small chapel in the castle filled with them . In ifae cabinet at Dresden , there is the moatcnrioua collecdon of clocks ; and in the castle of Wilhemsboche , near Cassel , a German artist has the most singular /q/ library ; all the volumes are made of different woods indigenous to the country ; the back of each volume is composed of the bark of the same tree , and has a label , upon which is written its name in several languages : the sides of the book are highly polished . Upon opening this carious volume , you find the fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same tree , as well as the mosses and insects which are peculiar to it . Edto , We could make a library of this kind when we are in the country . Mr , O , It would no doubt be a very agreeable occupation ; but , I fear , as we are not skilled in the labours it would require , we should find it would occupy too much time ; yet we may make the attempt next summer , with the assistance of a cabinet-maker . It will , at least , be easier to make this library than to imitate the collection of the Father Blank , in the castle of Wurtzburg . This ingenious monk , observing , in Switzerland , the great variety of tints in the moss tribe , conceived the idea of making pictures with them . The success of his first essays encouraged him to employ other substances , which nature has delighted to vary with colours ; such as the feathers of birds , the wings of butterflies , the leaves of trees , brilliant and sober clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he represented , in a very agreeable manner , landscapes , animals , and other objects . There are more than a hundred of these pictures in existence . Amongst others , is an eruption of Mount Vesuvius ; and this is the way in which he produced it ; with the wings of a particular kind of grasshopper he represented the fire , and with the down from butterfly 's wings he made the volumes of smoke , from mica he produced lava and pow-* der from rose-wood and brazil-wood gave the reflection of the fiire upon the adjacent mountains . /z/ The skill of the Germans in mechanic arts is also shown in objects of an inferior nature ; such as toys , tools , &; c . These are dispersed throughout Europe ; and Nuremberg appears to be the grand mart for them . Some of these works are remarkable as the productions of simple peasants . The works in wood come from Saltzburg , the Tyrol , &c.; They are celebrated for their solidity of workmanship , and their cheapness . It would appear almost incredible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which requires the application of several great machines to complete them , should be bought for a few pence , if we did not know that the German workmen live very soberly , and are contented with small profits . And hence it is , that although other countries may make these articles as well , yet they are mostly procured from Nuremberg , Augsburg , and other cities of Germany . Their cofiee-mills , small looking-glasses , toys , strings for pianos , and so forth , may be found in every pedlar 's pack . These cities care not how trifling the article may be in itself ; so loug as it is asked for , it is an object of commerce , which they carefully cultivate . Marbles , which form one of the amusements for children of all countries , engage the attention of merchants : a mill established near a city for their composition , furnished millions in the course of a year . One merchant has been known to export several hundred weight of those little instruments which children call rattles , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is by flattering the taste of the people of all dimes that the merchant succeeds in his speculations . At the village of Steinseifen , in Silesia , the inhabitants employ themselves in cutting out figures of men and anir mals in wood , and small weaving machinery .. One of nucth evening . 117 these artisans cut out in a piece of wood , five feet long , the Mountains of Giants , which , as you know , are situated in this part of the country . Although he had no mathematical instruments to assist him in computing the height of these mountains , yet hy his own observation , and the correctness of his sight , he contrived to represent , with tolerable accuracy , the relative height and position of divers objects ; such as woods , rocks , meadows , villages , ponds , isolated houses , mills , streams , Sic . ; for all these are represented in his model , which is now in the cabinet of Berlin . Some parts of Germany resemble one great workshop . Lusatia , Silesia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drapers . Silesia alone exports annually cloth to the value of twenty thousand francs , besides woollen stuffs , &c.; Every year the city of Frankfort upon the Oder imports from Livonia and Courtland , thousands of casks of flaxseed , which is much better than that of Frankfort . This seed is cultivated throughout Silesia and Bohemia ; and after the flax is gathered , all the country people begin to spin . There are even spinning schools in these parts ; and there are people whose business it is to buy up the thread when spun . After having sorted it according to its quality , these collecting peasants sell it to the merchants , and these again dispose of it at fairs established principally for its sale . Thither the weavers repair to get a supply of thread , and when they have woven it into cloth they sell it , unbleached , to other merchants , established in the cities . But in order that the weavers should furnish perfect cloths only , there are inspectors appointed to examine it . The cloth merchants get their linens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this operation , which // is both long and laborious . The linen is oftentimes washed , spread out in the meadows , then passed through cylindrical machines , and finally dried in outhouses : Cambrics require a peculiar process , which is kept rather secret . The quality of these cloths is various . In some places they make only coarse cloths ; in others you find superior specimens . The manufacture of table-linen is confined to one place . It is a pleasing sight for a traveller to observe the inhabitants upon the banks of the Oder , all occupied in making cloth , from its source even to its mouth . In Moravia the same spirit prevails ; the workmen and peasantry , when their daily labour is completed , employ themselves in spinning . In the country of Berg , upon the Rhine , all sorts of manufactories are carried on . At Elberfeld , they make large quantities of printed calicoes , and those handkerchiefs called India handkerchiefs ; and in the disposal of this particular article , the merchants study the taste of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sent . To Denmark they send those which are green and black ; Spain and Portugal receive black ones ; Sweden black and yellow ; Poland blue and black . The little town of Barmen divides with Elberfeld the traffic in thread , silk and cotton , tapes , cords and laces which are sent to all parts of the world . Ronsdorf manufactures large quantities of silk ferret ; Italy supplying it with the raw material , and receiving it again in the manufactured article . Lennep receives from Saxony and Spain e wools , which the inhabitants export in fine kerseymires , equal to those of England . Another city , Romascheid , in the neighbourhood of iron mines , is celebrated for its iron manufactures ; every workman confines himself to the manufacture of one article . One /q/ makes anvils and ploughshares ; another scythes and saws , and so on . At Solingen , all sorts of cutting instruments are made ; from sabres and swords , down to those common knives , which may be bought for a few pence , and which make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been known to part with ail that was dear to them . Styria is famous for scythes : and the French , even to this day , prefer the Styrian scythes to those of their own or any other country . Prussia has received from nature a gift peculiar to itself , I mean amber , which the sea throws up on the coast of that kingdom , and which is also found under ground . The origin of this mineral has not yet been ascertained ; the ancients valued it as much as gold . The Phoenicians trafIcked largely in this article , but they carefully concealed the country from whence they got it . In the countries which join Prussia , it is found in such small quantities that one would almost suppose the Phoenicians got their supply from Prussia itself . Amber is , however , no longer in such high estimation , though it is still wrought into ornaments , and used as a perfume . Dantzic has a considerable traffic in this article . The turners of this city form a kind of corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obliged to bring them the product of their labours ; the amber is then divided between the different turners . The best time for this fishery is after a violent tempest ; if the wind then changes , the amber is left upon the coast ; but if this does not happen , the fishermen must boldly venture into the sea , holding long poles , with bags fastened to them , with which they sweep , as it were , the sands . Unfortunately , the months of the great collection are November and December ; and these poor fishermen , // dad in leathern jackets , are thns compelled to brare an almost insupportable cold , besides the danger of being swallowed up by the waves ; they generally keep together in groups , that they may assist each other ; besides which they are very dexterous and skilful in supporting themselves upon their long poles , when the waves approach them ; by this means they can resist their fury ; and by yielding steadily to their pressure , they are sometimes safely carried to the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of a large piece of amber repays these poor creatures for all their labour . They have found a single piece worth from six to eight hundred pounds ; but , generally speaking , it is found in small pieces . In the cabinets of natural history in this country , pieces of amber are found , which contain small animals , drops of water , or vegetables . Let us remark enpasaant that it is to an astronomer of Prtussia that we are indebted for the planetary system which is generally adopted in these times . He it was who first discovered that the sun does not turn round the earth but that the earth and the other planets revolve in certain times and spaces round that glorious orb , which thus forms the centre of this assemblage of planets and other celestial bodies ; and this is called the Copemican system . This beautiful discovery was seized by the ardent mind of Galileo ; * and , struck with the evidence of this system , he strove to substitute it in the place of those false and absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celestial bodies . But so profound was the ignorance which still prevailed , that Galileo 's efforts proved at first unsuccessfiil . People incapable of soaring to such a height as Copernicus , Galileo , * **27;85;TOOLONG /q/ and other men of science , imagined that their doctrine tended to contradict the truths of the Holy Scriptares , and was absolutely hostile to the tenets of religion . Galileo was accused of impiety ; he was summoned before the tribunal of the inquisition at Rome , and confined some time in prison . Afler his liberation , he still continued to profess the sublime truths which genius had discovered , and which , so far from destroying religious sentiments , con* tribute to enlarge them , and to conrey a more accurate and impressive idea of the omnipotence and bounty of the Creator . He taught , in fact , that the limits of our sight are not the boundaries of the universe . Besides the multitude of stars which to us appear luminous points , and yet are as many suns resembling ours , there exist numberless other ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of space , escape our feeble sight . Every portion of the immense extent of the universe is filled ; in every part revolve celestial bodies , peopled with inhabitants endued with thought and sensation . There is not a spot but what contains living creatures and substances adapted to the maintenance of life ; and in this incredible diversity of being of every kind , we admire the most exquisite order , from the most capacious body to the animalcule that is scarcely perceptible to our senses . Immutable and everlasting laws govern the motions of the heavens , the suns , and the worlds . The wise man is lost in the idea of eternity ; and can not find words to express the felicity that awaits him in the next life , when , disengaged from this mortal body , his spirit shall soar above all these systems , and behol ( J , for the first time , the eternal light which gives life and motion to everything that exists . Such was the sublime doctrine of Galileo , who deserved rewards for propagating it among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great philosopher was thrown a second time into prison , and treated as the vilest of criminab . His confinement was long and periloas , and received no mitigation , notwithstanding the powerfiil interference of the family of Medicis , by whom he was patronized . We can not help deploring the weakness of the human mind , when we reflect , that precisely the most glorious truths have , in every age , found the greatest difficulty in gaining belief among men ; whilst errors have invariably spread with extreme rapidity . Instead of rising to the heights of Galileo 's genius , his ignorant and superstitious contemporaries required him to descend to their groveling standard ; and , to avoid a cruel death , this great astronomer was obliged to sign a recantation of the opinions which he had professed . He was at length allowed his liberty , on condition that he should never go out of the duchy of Florence . From that time Galileo lived unmolested at his country-house . He had the misfortune to lose his sight ; but this circumstance never ruffled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the company of Yiviani , his faithful disciple , aU the felicity which is felt by the virtuous , when surveying with satisfaction a life of honourable exertion and devoid of reproach . But to return to the industry of the Germans . You have heard this evening , that they turn their woods to a good account in the various articles into which they form Uiem . In their natural state , these woods ofier a great advantage to the inhabitants of the banks of the rivers which fall into the Rhine . The felling of forests and the construction of floats occupy many hands upon the banks of the Moselle , Neckar , Maine , Murg , and the Lain . These floats are destined principally for Holland . At Manheim and at Mentz they form them into large bodies , which are collected at Andemach : there they are united , and are then termed Rjketf and this embarkation does indeed resemble /q/ a fleet in some respects , from the great preparation it requires . Imagine to yourself a vast collection of logs , masts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other trees beneath them , lying across ; these again traversed by others to the depth of eight feet beneath the water , the top being covered over with planks , forming an even surface . This enormous mass is from seven to nine hundred feet long , and seventy broad . It consists of five hundred thousand square feet of wood . On each side of the fleet there are rafts fastened , and these are called knees ; it is also accompanied by fifteen boats , carrying cables and anchors , of which there are generally a hundred on board . Other boats precede it , to announce its approach , or to execute the commissions of the equipage , or to sound the river . Six or eight hundred men embark upon this fleet as pilots , rowers , servants , &c.; The master pilot conducts it , and the steward looks to the domestic concerns which relate to it ; for , as you may suppose , a great quantity of provisions must be embarked for the support of so many people ; indeed , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread , from one hundred and fifty to two hundred quintals of fresh meat , and even much live cattle ; eight or ten quintals of salted meat , twelve quintals of cheese , much butter , many vegetables dried , and salt ; some hundreds of tuns of beer , and several pipes of wine . Butchers , bakers , and coopers have the charge of these different provisions . About a dozen little cabins , constructed upon the float , serve as a dwelling-place for the equipage . A pretty little house is erected for the master , also a great magazine is erected for the provisions , a dining-room and a kitchen furnished with enormous caldrons and  --  toves to cook the provisions for the passengers and work people . /z/ When all is ready for the departure of the equipage , every one on board takes off his hat ; and with head uncovered , entreats a blessing from heaven upon his voyage : the master pilot then mounts an elevated seat , gives the signal with his hat , the rowers repeat it by waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised , the cables are cut , and the enormous mass floats amidst the cries of the workmen and numerous spectators , which its departure always attracts upon each side of the Rhine . But all is not pleasure for this float . The Rhine , the borders of which are so beautiful and so picturesque , whose banks are adorned with numerous villages and verdant hills , present , nevertheless , many dangers to the navigator . Its whirlpools , its sands , and its falls are more fatal to a float than to a vessel . The master pilot must be very skilful to avoid all the perils of the voyage , and notwithstanding his utmost skill accidents frequently happen . From fifteen to twenty days are employed in descending from Andemach to Dortrecht , the extent of the voyage . When the float is arrived in this city of Holland , a part of the equipage is paid off and sent back ; those workmen who remain assist the Dutch in breaking up the mass of timber ; a raft is then constructed of fir planks , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles which were necessary for the performance of the voyage , and which are thus conveyed back to Germany . Part of the trees and beams are then sdtd to the Dutch , and the rest to other nations . Before the departure of this float , it is sometimes valued at twenty thousand eight hundred and thirty-three pounds ; but the labour it requires to convey it to Dortrecht increases its value to twenty-nine thousand one hundred and sixty-six pounds . Oftentimes a cubic foot of wood which cost tenpence only originally , is sold in Holland for eight shillings and fourpence . /q/ Gustav , There are not many of these great floats surely in one year . Mr* O. Very generally from nine to twelve and fifteen have passed up the Rhine during the same year . They bring a great deal of money into Germany , but they also strip their forests of their finest trees , and will in the course of time produce a scarcity of this valuable article ; at least such an event is naturally to be expected . I can not quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country by Count Zinzerdorf . Like many Catholic convents , it presents the pleasing picture of a community animated by the love of piety , labour , and industry . I am now speaking of the Herrnhutters , or , as they are better known to us , the Moravians . They have settlements in Holland , Germany , Denmark , England , and America . In my travels , I visited some of their establishments , and , with all due deference be it spoken , I fancied I observed that the spirit of commerce was , in many instances , their first spring of action , and that even their desire to propagate Christianity among the savage tribes , oftentimes arises from a secrat desire to extend and benefit their own commerce ; but in general I found them worthy of the highest moral praise . They lead an austere life , never visit balls , plays , and spec* tacles ; they never read romances , nor play at cards nor dice : their dress is simple , and is a costume peculiar to themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes or choirs . There is the boyv ' class , the girls ' class , those of the men , the women , the widows , and the widowers . Three times a day there is divine Service performed ; the remainder of their time is wholly de* voted to labour . Herrnhut is a small village of upwards of a hundred /z/ houses all neatly built , and occupied by members of the fraternity . They are small , but very clean and cheerful . In these reside the married people . The bachelors live * together in a very large building adjoining to the chapel ; not far from which is another capacious edifice for the accommodation of strangers . The single women inhabit a separate house , exactly resembling that of the brethren ; for such is their general appellation . The women are all called sisters . There are likewise distinct houses for widowers and widows . Such are the different parts of which the village of Herrnhut is composed . The chapel is a large quadrangular hall ; and the service , or the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I entered it . All the inhabitants of the place , simply but neatly dressed , were seated on long benches , the women on one side and the men on the other . At one end was a gallery with an organ , and on another side stood a small table covered with a green cloth . Behind this table sat the minister , who was just going to address the congregation . They first joined in singing a hymn in a solemn and affecting manner , accompanied by the organ . It is extremely impressive , it must be acknowledged , to see and hear a congregation singing with one accord the praises of the Supreme Being , accompanied by the harmonious sounds of the organ and other musical instruments . In many places of worship the organ serves only to display the talents of the organist , and to divert the attention of the congregation instead edifying them . In passing through many towns and even villages of this country and Germany , I havfe observed that , on Sundays , the young people make a practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solemn manner , with such instruments as they can play upon . I was much pleased with this custorn , /q/ which appears to me well calculated to heighten the sentiments of piety and the elevation of soul inspired by the Christian worship . On this occasion I recollect with pleasure the divine worship performed by the Prussian regiments , when in camp , at which I was present several times . The men , in their best clothes and without arms , form a very large circle , in the midst of which are the chaplain , the officers , and the regimental band . The music begins to play a psalm tune , and the words are sung by the whole regiment . It would be impossible for me to de  - -  scribe the impression that is always made upon me by these sounds of peace issuing from the lips of so many soldiers , more accustomed to raise the shout of battle ; and in my opinion , this ceremony , followed by an energetic discourse from the chaplain , can not fail to produce a salutary effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Herrnhutters likewise concluded with a discourse delivered by the minister ; who , when he had finished , informed the congregation that in the afternoon of the next day there would be a funeral , which I resolved to attend , that I might see something more of the customs of this community : besides , I had already heard much of the beauty of the situation of the burial-ground of Hermhut Accordingly , I repaired at the appointed time to the chapel . The ceremony began with a hymn sung by the whole assembly ; the minister then pronounced a discourse , which was followed by a piece of music ecuted by a number of the sisters in the orchestra . SomOiiung , while others accompanied them on different instruments . I should have observed , that the coffin containing the remains of the deceased was placed on a bier in the middle of the chapel , in the space which separated the men from the women . After the service in the chapel was over , six brethren took /z/ the bier upon their shoulders to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on French horns ; then followed all the congregation , men and women , two by two . On reaching the burial-ground , the minister plaeed himself exactly opposite to the grave , the men ranging themselves on his left hand and the women on his right . The coffin was let down into the grave during the singing of a verse ; the burial service was then read ; and when it was finished , the congregation returned in the same order as they had come . Gustav . Did you not say just now , papa , that the burial-ground of Hermhut was celebrated in the neighbour-hood ? Mr. O. Yes , my dear , and I availed myself of the opportunity , when the ceremony was over , to examine it . An alley leads to it down a gentle descent . I imagined that I was entering a large garden , and at first remarked nothing but regular walks planted with small trees , whose branches , interwoven with each other , produced a delicious shade . A quick hedge surrounded the ground on every side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the others ; the men are interred on the left , and the women on the right . At the head of each grave is placed an oblong stone , on which are engraven merely the name of the person and the date of his death . All the graves are simple and uniform ; here are no distinctions , no pompous inscriptions , no ornaments . This burial* ground , as 3u see , excites none of those disagreeable sensations which you have felt on visiting those of some of our churches . Gustav . I know what you allude to , papa : we remarked in some of those places , that the poor are separated from the rich ; which displeased us , because we conceived that /q/ at death all inequality of rank and fortune , and all distinctions , founded on that difference , ought to cease . Mr. O. You were right ; and my sentiments on the subject were the same as yours . A burial-ground is the general receptacle for the remains of all ; and since all of us , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why should we make a distinction that might awaken emotions of vanity in the bosoms of the opulent , by whom such a place may be visited from curiosity or any other motive ? A.re not the poor insulated and forlorn enough in their lifetime , that their remains must be exiled as it were to a distant part of the cemetery after death ? It is to be hoped that the practice which has called forth these observations will not last for ever ; but that Christian charity , the only genuine philosophy , will strive to correct this abuse . The Herrnhutters set us iii this particular a worthy example . The striking simplicity which prevails among them , as you will presently hear , in the intercourse of life , reigns even in the tomb ; and the inspection of their gravestones conveys a higher idea of the virtues of the deceased than all the magnificent monuments and pompous inscriptions that are met with in our churches and church-yards . At the same time I have no fault to find with that grief which produces in families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pious monuments , and is always afraid that it has not expressed , in terms sufficiently strong , either their regret or the virtues of the person whose loss they deplore ; and in this point of view it would be wrong absolutely to condemn these monuments and these inscriptions . Neither was I pleased to find in a town of Holland , called ZwoU , a burial-place which I should not have distinguished from a public street , but for my guide , who pointed out to my notice that the pavement /z/ we were walking upon covered regular rows of graves , in which the dead are interred beside each other ; the pavement is then laid down again and a number engraved on each stone corresponding with that of the church register . I admire the love of order and neatness for which the Dutch are remarkable ; but this way of extending it even to the depositories of the dead , is in my opinion carrying the matter rather too far . What consolatory idea is excited in the soul of a father , a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of a bald pavement , when lamenting the loss of a child , a parent , a wife , or a sister ? Trees , flowers , verdure , in a burial-ground , cherish a kind of soft melancholy in the soul ; and the sight of so many different tombs tells us that numbers of our fellow creatures are partakers of the same afflictions with ourselves , and that a feeling the common lot of mankind ought to mitigate our individual distress . But what salutary effect can a paved place , like the church-yard of ZwoU , produce on the survivors , who , to live well , ought nevertheless to familiarize themselves with the idea of death , and to bear in mind that their pleasures will not be more permanent than their griefs ? From this digression , which I think not an unseasonable one , I return to the subject which occasioned it , the description of the village of Herrnhut . The Moravian brethren , persuaded that death brings us to the true place of our destination , never wear mourning for their deceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair to the field of repose , with music , to celebrate the memory of the brothers and sisters , who , during the last twelve months " have rejoined , " to use their own expression , " the celestial community . " I began with an account of the places of devotion , and /q/ shall now proceed to the buildings appropriated to the ordinary purposes of life . The unmarried men all live , as I have told you , in an extensive building called the Brethren 's House . The stranger is struck with the regularity and cleanliness which pervade every part of it ; the meeting-room , the refectory , the dormitory , the whole , in a word , is in the neatest order . I found all the brethren at work at their respective trades . There are professions in which they excel , for instance , cabinet-making ; accordingly their productions of this kind are in great request , and are sent to distant countries . It is a general observation , that whatever is made at this place is executed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and resulting only from incessant labour and patient perseverance . Morning and evening , all the brethren assemble to prayers in a meeting-room , where I observed a very pretty litde organ . The dormitory is extremely spacious , and contains near two hundred beds , all numbered ; the bed-clothes are of their own manufacture ; this prodigious hall is lighted at night by a few lamps . Tvf% of the brethren keep watch here by turns , and awaken the others at the usual hour in the morning . If any one of them wishes to rise earlier , he sets down the evening before the hour at which he desires to be called , by the side of his number , on a black board placed near the door . Those whose watch it happens to be then come in the morning and awaken him precisely at the time he wishes : the dress of the Herrnhutters is extremely simple , but , like everything else about them , remarkably neat . The building inhabited by the unmarried women is denominated the Sisters ' House , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brethren . Like /z/ the latter it contains a common meeting-hall , dining-room , and dormitory . Cleanliness is here carried to a higher pitch , if possible , than in the Brethren 's Hoose . Here too is perceived the same activity and industry . All the sisters were at work when I visited this establishment : some were engaged in the business of the kitchen , while others were spinning , sewing , embroidering , &c.; Their dress is as simple as that of the brethren . No fashions , no superfluous ornaments are to be seen among them , and those of all ages wear caps . The different classes are distinguished by the colour of the ribands fastened round these caps ; young girls , for instance , wear dark red ribands ; single women pink ; married women blue ; and widows white . * Twelve or fifteen brethren govern the whole community : their function lasts ten or twelve years , at the end of which lime they elect others , and to this election deputies repair from all those countries where there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the capital of their dominion . Their establishment called Bethlehem , which is about a day 's journey from Philadelphia , in the United States of America , resembles a large workiop or manufactory , where great quantities of cloths and stufls are woven , and hats , &c.; made in great perfection . These people are divided into classes like those of Hermhut* In general the five or six hundred thousand Moravians , who are found in Europe and America , are distinguished by their rigid morals , and their love of labour . They are a peaceable people , who deprive themselves of many of the pleasures of life , lest they should abuse them . /z/ Mr. O. Thk eveniD , ( he Swiss will form the principal subject of our diacussibn . We discover amongst this people much of that simplicity of manners which has long been banished from the rest of Europe . The Swiss inhabit one of the most picturesque pails of the world : it is intersected hy chains of prodigious rocks and mountains , between which may be seen fertile valleys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased by the melting of the snow , overflow their banks , and assume the form of large and impetuous rivers , flowing the country round . As you ascend the mountuns vegetation diminishes ; pines and firs succeed to the ash and chestnut ; these in Iheit turn yield to brushwood and aromatic plants , which form excellent pasturage ; above these extend vast regions of snow crowned with glaciers , heaped one upon the other in sublime magnificence . In mountainous countries the villages are insulated , and the communication between them /q/ // difficalU This circamstance compeb the inhabitants to depend principally upon themselves for the necessaries of life . One is astonished at the prodigious efforts which the Swiss have made to render a country habitable and agreeable that was formerly infested by wild beasts , which found a secure asylum in its immense forests and in the caves of the mountains . Human industry has , howevery conquered these natural difficulties and obstacles which appeared insurmountable . The hee of the country now presents , in many parts , beautiful gardens and meadows ; picturesque houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture land , and fields of ooni . Sometimes different houses are connected by avenues of fruittrees , from which hang clustering vines . Frequently , when the traveller , surrounded by rocks , supposes he is immured in the most profound solitude , he is surprised by the sight of an humble cottage , a mill seemingly suspended over a cataract , or a chapel surmounted by a light spire , glittering in the sunbeams : perhaps his reveries may be disturbed by the distant sound of a sheep-bell , as the flocks wander in the upper regions of these stupendous mountains . The houses are mostly built of wood , they are often very extensive . The fir-tree is a great Messing to the Swiss . When a peasant wishes to construct a dwelling house , he cuts down some of this kind of tree , and with the assistance of two or three of his companions soon constructs a habitaticm , covering it with square pieces of wood , if slates are not easily procured in his neighbourhood . The rooms in Switzerland are low , and fiimished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small , and double when exposed to the winds . These windows are numerous so that the rooms are light , and as more than one is seldom opened they are also warm . /q/ In winter as in summer the Swiss are always occupied . In those parts where agriculture flourishes , and where the climate relaxes in its rigour , manufactures flourish . The orchards bear Abundance of fruit , which ' is either dried or made into cider . The little cherries distilled , furnish a liquor well known as Kirash . In the plains , flax and hemp are cultivated , and cloth is manufactured in large quantities . But the Swiss are not merely content with providing for their own wants : they impact raw silk from France and Italy , and manufacture it nrly as well as their neighbours , and then export it . Formerly they made much woollen cloth ; but of late years they have applied themselves to the manufacture of cotton , and in this too they rival the Enjish . It is quite amusing to see , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making lace , and weaving crapes or gauzes ; * the outside of the house resembles the habitation of a peasant , within it assumes the appearance of a workshop . Another branch of Swiss industry is the manufacture of watches , , particularly in the environs of Geneva and Neufchatel : whole villages are sometimes inhabited by watchmakers , and even the ordinary peasants , have oftentimes a small apparatus for making watches . In my wanderings in that beautiful country I frequently have seen cottages placed between rocks and cataracts , and have pitied men who were thus consigned to such dreary solitudes ; but upon entering these dwellings I have been surprised to discover the father and son occupied in watch-making , while the mother and daughters were busy in embroidering or making lace ; thus , where I expected to And the abodes of poverty , I have discovered comfort and the cultivation of the luxuries of life . Thousands of watches are exported annually to all parts of the world . /z/ Emigration is another great resource of the Swiss . la all countries they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soldiers their services are in equal repute and request . Yet notwithstanding their emigrations , the Swiss are passionately fond of their country , and the sound of their favourite air " The Ranz des Vaches , " when heard in a distant clime , has been known to operate so powerfully upon them , that they have returned immediately to that spot called by us , home . They have often fought desperately in defence of their liberty , and have evinced in their wars for independence the heroic spirit of the ancients . In the valleys they pursue a pastoral life ; the sale of cattle , and the making of cheese is the principal occupation of the mountaineers . Some of their cheeses are exceedingly valued , such as the Gruyere and those of Emmenthal . The former are made upon a chain of hills which runs through Friburg . Each cow furnishes nearly two quintals of cheese during the season in which they occupy these mountains . The higher the pasture lands lie , the more succulent is the grass and the more delicious the milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpines . They frequently possess . neither herds nor flocks , but hire the cows from the pedants of the valleys , and make arrangements with the owners of the pasture lands of the mountains . There they make butter and cheese ; and at the end of the fine season they descend to the plains , return the cows to their owners , and sell their butter and cheese . Caroline . I should suppose that this cheese were made upon a very simple principle . Mr. O. The absolute making of it is simple enough ; but it requires much skill and attention , nevertheless , to succeed in the operation . But of this you shall be convinced , for I will detail to you the whole process . /q/ The DiRk is poured into a large kettle , and when it k warm , a little curdled milk is thrown into it ; it is then stirred with a kind of trowel , and afterwards left upon the fire for about a quarter of an hour , - that it may thickeiT . The cheese maker then comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , with two trowels , he stirs it from the bottom upwards . The milk , by this action , forms bubbles , which the cheese in forming breaks . After an hour 's labour of this kind , the liquid is put on the fire , and is again stirred with the lath ; it is then violently agitated , to force the water from the milk , whidi soon assumes a substantial form by this process : when this is effected , it is thrown into a mould and pressed down with stones . An inferior cheese is made from the remainder of the liquid ; this is turned into a cloth , tied up , and hung to a nail . Other kinds of cheese are made in Switzerland , by mixing aromatic herbs with the curd , and some are salted highly . The goats too , which are numerous , furnish excellent cheese . In the canton of Glaris , each parish possesses flocks , consisting of from one to two hundred goats , which a master goatherd conducts to the mountains , there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is etill Biore considerable . Horses and pigs are likewise fed upon these mountains ; bat , as the difficulty of providing for these animals , in the winter , is sometimes great , their owners frequently dispose of them at the end of die ifine season , and purchase lean ones in the spring , and fatten them on the mountains . Those who possess but a few of these animals endeavour to procure forage enough in the summer to support them in the winter . Id the eanton Kf Olaris , where , as I have to you , there are immberEl of goals , the poor shepherds venture their lives . to support these aoimals. la the crevices  --  of the rocks , /z/ there grows a most delicious kind of grass , but the goatcannot get at it , and these men attempt an exploit which terrifies even these bounding animals . In the parishes which have the right of gathering this grass , a signal is given by a bell upon certain days ; then the poor shepherds climb up the rocks , and with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edge of a precipitous rock , some hundred feet high , they gaily pursue this dangerous occupation . We , in their place , should grow giddy , and think more of our own safety than gathering a little hay . Their boldness is sometimes amply rewarded ; they make storehouses in the clefts of the rocks , where they deposit their treasure , and at the approach of winter they remove it to their cottages . All these shepherds possess a robust constitution and a proud and independent character : they highly prize their liberty , and are passionately fond of their country . Their customs , festivals , and dress are the same as they were some centuries ago In general , if we wish to contemplate those pure manners and that simple life which reminds us of the patriarchal age , we must avoid great cities , and repair to the mountains of Switzerland . The men pass the greater part of their timeVith their flocks , in the upper regions , where the air , calm and pure , softens their sensations , and allays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pastoral life , and the absence of every object which could excite the passions , inevitably preserves simplicity in its most extensive form ; but , at the same time , it must be confessed , that it also perpetuates the rudeness of their ancestors . Many of the Swiss lead a wandering life like the Nomades of Asia , and only visit their families occa8i ( mally . Such , particularly , is the custom in the valleys . TElfTH EVENING . 139 on the frontiers of Lombardy : the heads of the family wander about with their flocks , while the rest of its members remain quietly at home to reap the harvest , and to pursue other domestic occupations . Qefore they set out for the mountains where their flocks are accustomed to pas the summer , the owners assemble and fix the portion which each is to pay of the expenses incurred during their stay in the pastures of the Alps . X ) ne of them assumes the general superintendence , and is deno , jninated by way of eminence il pastore . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catde or to make cheese . Besides the owners , there are herdsmen who receive wages . Scrupulous punctuality in the performance of the duties of their station , frugality , and sobriety are qualities innate , as it were , in the shepherds of Lombardy ; but they are not so aflabie as the other Italians , and their look announces a gloomy and even a savage disposition . They never amuse themselves with sing- ing , like the Swiss shepherds .  --  During their residence upon the Alps , they spend the whole day , and likewise half the night ainopg their cattle . Their dress consists of a coat of red or white woollen cloth , waistcoat and breeches of the same , and gaiters . They wear neither neckcloth nor stockings , but in bad weather wrap themselves up in a white cloak . Their hair is cropped very close ; in other respects they are very cleanly , and are never seen without a clean shirt . The food of these herdsmen is simple as their dress , consisting the whole year round of porridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their breakfast and luncheon they have nothing but a bit of cheese , and they drink water or goat 's milk . To the most common aliments , as bread and soup , these temperate people are almost entire strangers ; and though // their cattle supply them with delicioas butter , and cfaeeae , they nse only the refose themselves , reserving the best part for sale . By living in this fragal manner , and denying themselves every comfort , they save considerable BumSf and freqaently make large fortunes . They all sleep on boards supported by four legs. *  --  Their bed is composed of hay and of their cloaks , the clothes of each serving him for a pillow . So accustomed are they to this hard life that old men of eighty annually perform this journey to the Alps .  --  - You see , from the example of these Italian shepherds , that the absolute wants of man are very trifling , and may be suppliied at a very insignificant expense . While we exhaust our invention , our forCane , and our strength , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a dish of poiridge or milk , and a bit of coarse doth for their garments . When the weath is fine and dry , the herdsmen travel by night ; but in bad weather , or cold regions , they proceed only in the daytime , and wait till the morning dew is dried up . One shepherd goes at the head of eadi flock , which follows him with the greatest docility , and another brings up the rear . The cattle follow their conductors over rocks and glaciers . Whmi tliey pass through a village , the animals crowd dose to the shephds , but in the open country they go in a more straggling manner* If ikey meet with good pasturage , the shepherds halt , walk round the flock , and , by uttering broken and guttural ries , . they collect the animals that are at some distance from the rest . These perfectly understand this signal , as well as that for their departure , which is a very shrill whistle . If the pasture is of little extent , the - shepherdb proeeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the cattle aie by m means backward to acquit Uiemaelves. /q/ Charles . These Lombard shepherds I suppose have dogs too ? Mr. O. That is a matter of course : where there are there must be dogs also . Those belonging to these shepherds are large , and have very long hair ; they assist their masters with great zeal , and watch with the greatest attention the little flocks committed to their care ; but being very poorly fed , they often want the strength necessary to prevent the wolves and bears from carrying off and destroying some of the sheep . It is only by shouting as loud as possible that the shepherds can put those ravenous animals to flight . The race of sheep in Lombardy , and especially about Bergamo , whence come most of the flocks that visit the Alps , is larger than the common breed ; they hold their heads very high ; their muzzles are more arched than those of our sheep , and their ears lie closer to the head . Another distinction between these sheep and ours is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition ; their lambs are never seen frisking about , and no other bleating is ever heard among them than that of the dams calling their young . On the approach of any ferocious animal , they crowd close together , instead of dispersing like other sheep . In like manner , when it snows , hails , or rains , they creep under stones or rocks , where they remain without stirring . Though frequently covered with snow , they are never sheltered from the weather , and are therefore stronger and less subject to distempers than the sheep of this country . It is in the month of December that the shepherds lead them back from the Alps into the plains of Italy , As the flocks are then in very good condition , from the excel-* lence of the pasturage , and the salubrity of the climate in which they have passed the summer , the journey downward /z/ requires les time than the other . On their arrival in the lower region* the shepherds shear the sheep , and then conduct them into the plains of Piedmont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks of the Tesino.  --  There they hire vast pastures , where they divide their flocks , as they are accustomed to do on the Alps ; at night they pen them , unless the cold be too severe , in which case they are collected in large sheds , which are guarded by dogs . It may be proper to observe , that these flocks scarcely ever return to their native country , and that their keep costs their owners a very trifling sum . Crustav . Is it for the wool alone that such large flocks are kept ? Mr. O. The Lombard shepherds are better managers than the Spanish , who are content with the wool : the former derive other advantages and profits from their flocks . In the first place , they dispose of the largest rams ; in the liext , they sell the wool ; and , lastly , they make use of the milk and cheese with which the sheep supply them , and avail themselves of all necessary circumstances , as I shsdl presently show . Milking the ewes is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , at an hour fixed for this operation , the sheep are driven into a kind of enclosure with two wickets . At one of these the animals enter ; and when once in , the dogs posted there will not sufier them to get out again ; on which they attempt to escape by the other wicket , but two shepherds seize them by the tail , and hold them till they are milked . When all the ewes have in this manner passed out again at the second wicket the milk is mixed together , and strained through a doth . The cream is skimmed off , and with it are made excellent small round dieeses , from six to eight inches in diameter* /q/ and weighing from two pounds to two and a half . The milk that is left is then skimmed a second time : the shepherds keep the best of it for their own use , and give the remainder to their dogs . Though the produce in milk and cheese is considerable , as the latter is in high request , yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . When , for instance , one of their rams perishes by zeddent , they take care of the finest part of the skin to make parses of it if it be a ewe that is killed , they break the animal 's bones , and stretch it out on the roof of a shed , or upon long poles ; and when the flesh is perfectly dry , they carry it with them into Italy , where the poor people putchase this wretched food For the conveyance of their cheeses these shepherds have very strong asses , which can carry nearly as much as a horse , and which grow very fat and comely on the Alps ; so that on their return they sell them in Italy at a high price . The cheeses are packed in the form of long rolls , in small bags , and hung in other bags on each side of the ass . The load is covered with a blanket or sheep-skin ; upon it is laid the pot in which the porridge or poUenta is made for dinner ; the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage of our shepherds . These people , as you see , though living in the midst of the most civilized nations , have nevertheless but little intercourse with society ; and perhaps they would even dispense with that little , were they not obliged now and then to resort to it in order to sdl their commodities . Provided their flocks prosper , they are happy , and wholly indiflferent to the political events which are almost incessantly passing around them ; Uiey are strangers to the torments of ambition and the inquietude of riches ; they possess fortunes , /z/ it is trae ; but they preserve them for their families , and are careful not to trifle away the fruits of their labour in frivolous pursuits , or the vain desire of displaying their wealth in show ' : their views are more solid , and consequently their condition is less subject to the variations of great fortunes in cities . The Tyrol resembles Switzerland in many respects ; it is mountainous , and inhabited , like the Alps , by a brave and loyal people , distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of the Tyrol emigrate every year , and practise in foreign countries the trades they have learned in their native villages . They even travel into Russia and Turkey , for the sole purpose of selling canary-birds . Those who remain at home mostly pursue a pastoral life in summer ; and , during the winter , they employ themselves in manufacturing several little articles of wood , and others of the skin of the chamois . The Tyrolese of Vorarlberg execute more extensive works in wood ; they make boats , shops , and houses , all in separate pieces , but nicely fitting and numbered ; these are conveyed to the lake of Constance on sledges , and embarked for Switzerland , where they are soon purchased and transported to various parts . Eliza . A house of this kind does not cost much , I presume /z/ Mr. O. Neither architect nor mason have bills to present ; there is only the carpenter to be paid , and he is , perhaps , contented with the value of fjm seventy-five to eighty pounds sterling . But their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will execute the most surprising and minute articles . The shops of the Tyrol of Salzburg are sometimes c , abinets of curiosities . I have seen , for instance , the organs of the human eye exactly /q/ imitated in bone , which could be taken to pieces at pleasure . The women are as industrious as the men ; they knit , they spin silk and cotton , they embroider , plait hats , and weave the prettiest baskets imaginable . Sometimes ten of these women will be assembled in the winter time , round one table , pursuing each her favourite occupation . In the neighbourhood of Bregentz , there are women who from one pound of cotton will spin thradd enough to fill one hundred and dy spindles , each spindle containing one thousand nine hundred and fifty English yards of thread . The children follow the example of their parents ; they begin very early to provide for themselves . In the spring , troops of boys assemble , each furnished with a basket containing provisions and a little fiute ; these , under the conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and placed under the care of peasants , in order to keep their flocks . At the end of the fine season , the same old shepherd guides them home , every boy bringing ten or twelve shillings with him as his salary or wages . This industrious custom of making the children provide for themselves is not confined to the Tyrol ; I have seen , in Silesia , the little children , after school was over , employ themselves in collecting straws to make hats ; the least children picked up the straws , the bigger ones sorted them , or plaited them into long plaits , fifty yards long . A child could furnish , in his hours of recreation , two tresses of fifteen yards during the week , some more or some less ; and according to the quality of their work they received for its value . One can not but admire the taste of these mountaineers for the mechanic arts ; they construct upon the simplest principles mills to grind their corn , to press oil , to sharpen VOL. n. 13 /z/ their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tra  - -  veller relates , that , upon entering a cottage , he perceived a cradle rocking in which an infant was asleep ; there was no one within , and his curiosity was excited as to this movement , when he discovered a string attached to it ; but still there was no one to pull this string ; however , upon his following the thread which was to unravel the mystery , he found upon the banks of a stream in the neighbourhood , a wheel which , by turning , alternately tightened and loosened the string , and thus rocked the cradle . In the castle of Inspruek there is a perfect globe made by a shepherd of Tyrol . The Scotch mountaineers present to us very much the same manners , the same characters as those of Switzerland and the Tyrol . They are much attached to their country , and have preserved the manners and customs of their ancestors . Brave warriors when called upon to defend their country : and in times of peace they are equally ready and faithful in the discharge of their patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , and many of them are obliged to emigrate to seek subsistence in foreign climes ; but , wherever they are , they always retain a passionate love for their country . The sound of the bagpipes , which is their national instrument , has peculiar charms for them . In a combat , in which a company of Highlanders were giving way , their commander ordered the bagpipes to strike up a favourite tune ; the effect was instantaneous , the troops rallied , and marched boldly up to the enemy . They preserve a faithful remembrance of the great deeds of their ancestors , and are fond of commemorating them either in prose or verse . They possess many traditional songs upon this subject , which they never commit to writing . With these good qualities they retain most of the /q/ prejudices and superstitions of their progenitors , as well as their more noble qualifications . This , indeed , is very common among all mountaineers ; shut up in their mountains , and possessing no commerce with great cities , they profit but little by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , " said Gustavus to Captain Martin , who had been one of the circle for this evening , " can you not tell us a lively story of your adventures , Captain ? You must have a great many in store . " Captain Martin . Well , I will tell you one little story of an adventure of mine in India . Caroline , I suppose it will begin with " Once upon a time . " Captain M. Yes , that is the regular opening for a story . " Once upon a time , " then , I was travelling in the interior of India , when I fell in with an Oriental hunting party . The Rajah of the province was giving a grand hunt , in company with his court . The place , where I fell in with them was once an immense plain covered with high grass and clumps of trees . You can hardly imagine a more picturesque scene . Many of the party were mounted on elephants gaily caparisoned , their backs loaded with men and bristling with spears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immense multitude were content to hunt on foot . Their game consisted of every animal of the country , from the gazelle to the royal tiger . It was highly animating to see them driving the animals before them , deers , antelopes , bears , leopards , all fiying tumultuously from the glitter of their pursuer 's arms , and the tremendous clang of their musketry and musical instruments , and unmusical shouts . I entered into the spirit of the occasion , and hiring an /z/ elephant and driver , joined the pursuit . I had enjoyed the sport but a few hours before I heard a low growl in the high grass near me ; and at the same instant my elephant raised his trunk , and gave the peculiar snort by which is generally understood to indicate the presence of a tiger . I instantly directed my attention to the quarter from whence the growl had proceeded , and saw the grass move ; and presently I could see a small part of the tiger 's body . I instantly levelled my musket and fired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball from taking full effect . It grazed the tiger 's back . He had been skulking out of the way before , but on feeling the wound he turned and sprung upon the elephant 's back , and the animal set out upon a full gallop , raising his trunk , and snorting at the same time . Crustav . Well , your situation was a very interesting one at theHnoment . I suppose you could hardly arrange matters with the tiger , so as to continue your ride amicably together . Captain M. Our situation was rather interesting . One feels more excited looking into a tiger 's mouth within a few inches of him , at perfect liberty , riding double with him too , on an elephant 's back , than when seeing the same animal in a cage in the London Menagerie . The driver ran his spear into the tiger 's body the moment he mounted , but still he retained his hold and growled most uncivilly at me . I had no alternative but to pull a pistol from my belt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold , and , falling upon the ground , was speedily despatched by other hunters of the party who came up to our assistance. * /z/ " Caftain Martin , " said GustavuB , asaoonaatheparty were assembled for the eTening , " you were speaking last evening of the liger . Is there not a Brazilian tiger ' " Certain M. I believe that name haa been given to the jaguar . He almost equals the liger in size and ferocity , and rivals the leopard in the beauty and sleekness of his fur and the gracefulness and agility of his motions . He is lower in stature and clumsier and heavier than the leopard in all his proportions . Hia tail is much shorter , and is the principal thing that distinguishes him from the leopard , whom he very much resembles in his spots and general make . This animal eommils dMtructive ravages in the swampy foreeta of South America ; it is Iheie often hunted by the natives who attack him in various ways . One of the most common is to chase him wiih a large pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick copse . In the /z/ tree he is destroyed by the musket or lance . But if he escapes to the bushes , it is a difficult matter to aim at him with precision . On such occasions an Indian sometimes attacks him single-handed . Armed with a lance or long knife , he envelopes his left arm in a sheep-skin , by means of which he evades the first furious onset of the animal , and gains time sufficient to plunge the weapon into his body before he can turn for a second attack . There is a sketch in my portfolio which will show you how the Indian advances to the attack. * When the children had sufficiently admired the drawing , Mr. Oakley proceeded with his descriptions . We have already considered most of the people of the North , let us now direct our attention to those of the South . In warm climates , man having less to endure from the inclemencies of the air , light clothing , cottages constructed of reeds and leaves suffice him ; and the fruit which the soil naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him much labour and trouble . But on the other hand , dispensed from the hardier pursuits of the north , the inhabitants of the milder regions of the south possess little industry and less application . Thus their principal commerce consists in the exportation of their natural productions , and the importation of manufactured articles . Oftentimes we find the inhabitants of other countries importing from their more genial climes the raw materials , and after they have manufactured them , - exporting iihem again to the same climate . Italy , Spain , and Portugal furnish ample proof of this . All these countries , rich in natural productions , are proud * See cut on page 149. /q/ to see their ports filled with foreign vessels , waiting for cargoes of unmanufactured materials , which their owners return manufactured . Italy abounds in fruits , silk , rice , wine , and oil . But their silk is exported in a raw state ; and manufactured , principally , in France and Switzerland . The Italians do fabricate a small quantity of this article ; but , in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * The culture of rice has been the means of introducing a very lucrative article of commerce into Italy , I mean the manufacture of hats from the rice straw . These are made by the female peasants at their leisure , and are exceedingly profitable to them . It is chiefly in the north of Italy that this article is manufactured , where trade and commerce , in fact , principally flourish . The southern parts are , indeed , noted for the indolence of their inhabitants , who place their happiness in the Dolce far niente . In this part of Italy , therefore , theie is , as you may suppose , more idleness and more poverty than elsewhere . Laziness always brings with it its own punishment . The great ports of Italy , such as Venice , Leghorn , and Genoa , form a striking contrast to those parts to which I have alluded . In the middle ages , commerce was so flourishing in these cities , that they ranked among the powers of Europe ; they kept fleets , and had ambassadors at foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting , and less than any other that which is founded on ambition ; these states weakened each other by their intestine wars . The commerce with the Ea &t,; which had been hitherto confined to /z/ the Mediterranean , took another direction upon the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope ; and , by degrees , those cities lost that rank which they had acquired . Yet they still retain a preeminence over other Italian cities ; for in time of peace , they serve as a depot for many European manufactures which are exported to America , and for those which , in return , are brought from the New World . Besides which , they possess manufactures of their own ; such as liquors , silks , perfumes , brocades , and a variety of minor articles in glass and wax . Of these maritime places Venice merits our particular attention , for who can fail being interested in a state which , by its prodigious activity and industry , became almost an empire . Let us , my children , examitie its situation upon the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in the middle of marshes , at the top of the Adriatic . Mr. O. These marshes are called lagunes . It was necessary here , as in Holland , to erect dykes , in order to preserve these marshes from the inundations of the sea , and to render the soil habitable . But the Venetians have done more ; they have built one of the finest cities in Europe , which , during a thousand years , has retained its place among the commercial cities of Europe . The situation of Venice is exceedingly favourable for commerce ; by sea it communicates easily with the shores of Italy , Dalmatia , Greece , Turkey , and the isles of the Archipelago and Mediterranean . The rivers which fall into the Adriatic connect its commerce with Germany , Piedmont , and the Tyrol . The VeneteSy who had the courage to establish themselves in these marshes , soon became sensible of the advantages of their situation ; and , as comiperce was disdained by the Teutons , the Lombards , and the Franks , , they undertook the profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trade was salt ; this they conveyed to the north of Italy by means of the Po , Brenta , &c.; This commerce became so immense that they even repaired to Africa for salt to sell it in Europe . The princes of Italy granted them several privileges , among which , the perniission to have depots , and to hold markets for the sale of this commodity , upon the chief rivers , were not the least . Salt merchants were established , who each supplied a particular district or country with this valuable article . At length several states endeavoured to deprive them of this lucrative commerce ; but as they could not supply it at so cheap a rate as the Salinari of Venice , they failed in their speculations . The Venetians , however , became insolent in prosperity ; and not content with blocking up all the rivers , when an effort was made to deprive them of this monopoly , they even compelled the king of Hungary to close the mines of Croatia . But Venice , placed between two people of different habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to each in supplying them with the means of indulging their particular tastes . The Italians they supplied with the wealth of the Indies ; silks , spices , pearls , diamonds , &c.; To the Arabs and Greeks they carried wines , chains , iron , the woods of Italy , oils , silks , arms , and ships which they had made themselves . You know , that before the discovery of American spices , pears , curious woods , and precious stones came principally from Asia . The Phoenicians , in very early times , carried on this traffic by the Mediterranean . The Assyrians and Chaldeans at length succeeded in diverting the course of this commerce , and Bactria became the grand channel for this purpose . Egypt , in the sequel , turned the tide of /z/ commerce into the Red Sea , which in its turn acquired wealth and importance from being the mart of Eastern traffic . V The Usbeck Tartars , in their turn , restored to the continent this grand object , ' and by means of the Oxus they conveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendour of Constantinople , however , restored it to a maritime conveyance ; and , as the Greeks were too indolent to enter into commercial speculations , the Genoese stepped forward , and for many years engrossed the Oriental trade ; but the rising power of Venice gave a check to their monopoly . In the year 1202 , the crusaders having taken possession of Constantinople , Venice left the establishment of a new dynasty to the French and the Flemings , contenting herself with establishing a podesta or mayor , and a patriarch in one quarter of the city . From this period the splendour of Venice may be dated ; she possessed Dalmatia and some other provinces ; many of the Grecian Islands and colonies in Candia . She dispersed throughout Europe gold ' cloths , silk stuffs , cottons , carpets , pearls , diamonds , &c.; To Egypt , Barbary , Arabia , and Syria she exported all sorts of arms : Venice abounded in goldsmiths , looking-glass makers , armourers , and organ manufacturers . The Doge of Venice was looked upon as a sovereign prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place among the potentates of Europe . She has always preserved her industry , although political events have deprived her of her power : she may be said even now to struggle against those misfortunes which iippear to have overwhelmed her , presenting the grand spectacle of a city flourishing for ages by the industry of its inhabitants . /z/ Florence exercised a gentler empire in Italy than Venice ; she acquired greatness , not so much by arms and commerce as from the cultivation of the belles letters and the fine- arts ; and she well deserved her epithet of the Athens of Italy . Great men of every kind have immortalized this city by the productions of their genius .. Genoa , Pisa , Leghorn signalized themselves formerly by their industry , ana received their due meed of wealth and fame . The amusements of these cities were as noble as their enterprises ; the taste of the Greeks for gymnastic exercises appears to have been transplanted to the soil of Italy . Venice had grand exhibitions upon the water : Padua was famous for horse-races , held like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with statues and pyramids ; Sienna was famous for contests in wrestling ; and Florence had a game peculiar to itself , which I will describe to you presently : but I must first speak of the aquatic fete of the Venetians of modern times ; and few spectacles present a more lively and animating scene than this . Indeed it is impossible to do it justice in a description . The senses are bewildered by the shouts of applause raised by the multitude from time to time , the sound of musical instruments , the motion of the water agitated by the oars of the gondoliers , the appearance of so many gondolas , some of which belonging to people of high rank , glisten with gold and silver , and are adorned with the greatest magnificence and taste , produce all together an effect which must be witnessed to be duly appreciated . The gondoliers are all in uniform , and range themselves with their light boats behind a cord extended across the canal , to mark the spot from which they are to start . The moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . gondolas shoot off at once with the utmost velocity , amidst the acclamations of /z/ imramerable gpectaton . Not far from the end of the canal is set up a pole , roond which the gondoliers are to turn on their way back to the other end ; and this requires considerable dexterity . They then make the utmost exertions to reach the goad erected at some distance in the form of a fortress or hill , and commonly decorated with great magnificence . On their arrival , the conquerors leap from their gondolas , and seize the little flags fixed up near the goal , and each marked with a number , according to which the prizes destined for those who come in first are distributed . They who arrive last have of course later numbers . The last of all has a flag , on which is a representation of a pig ; and , , while the others march triumphantly along with their flags , he b exposed to the hooting and derision of the populace . Each regatta usually consists of five matches , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are given to the winners ? Mr. O. The prizes are seldom worth more than ten pounds : but honour is the principal motive of their emula tion . I'he following anecdote proves that these people are capable of very exalted sentiments . At the regatta which I have just described , one of the gondoliers , when near the goal , fell into the water , and consequently lost the prize . Two years afterwards , a similar regatta being given in honour of the king of Sweden , the same gondolier was one of the candidates . As he approached the goal , there were two gondolas before him ; in one of these was his brother , who unfortunately running against one of the ornaments surrounding the goal , fell into the water , so that our gondolier won the second prize . *'Two years ago , " said the generous fellow , ' * ! experienced how mortifying it is to be disappointed of the prize , when so near the goal . I will not take advantage of the misfortune of another ; my /q/ brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to him the second prize by right belongs ; and if it be refused him , he shall have mine . " The sentiments of the worthy gondolier were universally applauded : and I am sure that you , my dears , will also give your sincere approbation to such generous behaviour .  --  So much , my dears , for the regattas of Venice , formerly given in the presence , and frequently in honour , of the foreign princes who visited that large and beautiful city . Every nation in Europe is acquainted with the games of tennis and foot-ball ; they form the delight of youth and the relaxation of age . Formerly every principal city had its court set apart for these amusements . Augustus and the odious Caligula partook of this amusement . But it was at Florence that this amusement was pursued with all the refinement and ardour which it was capable of inspiring . It assumed a national character ; and , far from being a frivolous amusement , it became a grand military exercise and spectacle . The Medici , the Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dukes of Mantua and Urbino disdained not to become actors in the display , which was witnessed by all the beauty of the Athens of Italy . The fame which Florence had acquired in arts and letters gave a lustre to this amusement , and the stranger was compelled to acknowledge that the Florentines were not less great in their amusements , than in their literature , their monuments , and their commerce . The great square of the Holy Cross was the area appropriated to the game of calcio , or foot-ball . I call it an area , because this game presented a real scene of contest , in which the flower of the Florentine nobility displayed their agility , strength , and even the finesse of war . A corporeal defect , a low birth , and a bad reputation were suffi- /q/ /z/ cient to exclude a candidate . The games were regalated by particular laws , and were appointed- for particular seasons ; from the sixth of January to the end of the carnival the square of the Holy Cross was crowded by spectators ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ings , which were brilliant beyond all description ; for both spectators and actors appeared in full dress . The players upon these occasions were formed into two parties , distinguished by their dress , each displaying as much magnificence as their costume would allow ; this consisted m a light waistcoat and cap , the cloak was thrown aside in order to give as much freedom as possible to the action of the performer . Upon these days the players repaired to the houses of the two chiefs , where their place was assigned them . The two armies , being thus marshaled ( they sometimes amounted to fifty-four members of each party ) , directed their , steps to the great square amidst the acclamations of the populace . First of all , the Innanizi , or foreguard , appeared , hand in hand , or linked together by silken bands : they were followed by * ' Banner Bearers , " accompanied by drums and trumpets :  --  then came the Sconciatori or Seconds , and after these the Datori ; and the procession was closed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faction or party , succeeded by several youths , bearing siU ver cups containing ceruse , to apply to the bruises of the candidates . In this order the cavalcade arrived at the square of the Holy Cross , " where the balconies , the windows , and the amphitheatre were filled with spectators . Six judges , elected from veterans of the game , occupied a particular seat ; it was their office to settle any disputes which might arise between the players of the opposite factions . /q/ When the two little armies were arranged , the Pallaio ( or ball-holder ) , dressed in livery , combining the colours of the opposite parties , advanced between them , and threw into the air the important ball . At this signal the trumpets and drums struck up , and the players rushed forward to seize the ball . The area now assumed the appearance of a battle . The foreguard of each party endeavoured to seize the ground of their adversaries , and to break the ranks of the DcUorif to get the ball beneath their feet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own camp . The grace , skill , and strength which the contenders displayed , the stratagems to which they resorted , excited the most profound and lively interest in the spectators . Friendship and family ties augmented this feeling in the breasts of mothers , sisters , lovers ; and the flight of the ball suspended the breath or produced palpitations equal to those excited upon the most serious occurrences of life . Tumultuous cries announced victory or defeat ; scarcely was the ball sent beyond the camp of the adversaries , when the victorious faction raised its standard , and took posses** sion of their opponent 's camp to the sound of music , while the vanquished with lowered colours , marched dejectedly to that of the victors . Sometimes in the warmth of the combat the parties became so excited as to call for the interference of the judges . At the marriage of Prince Ferdinand of Tuscany with Beatrice of Bavaria , the former was at the head of one of these factions , and the Prince Gaston of the other . The people were charmed atUiis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this occanon the time when Clement the Seventh , Leo the Twelfth , Urban the Eighth , the Grand Dukes Cosmo the First arid Second , /z/ Vincent Prince of Mantua , and Lorenzo Duke of Urbino , had in their youth taken a share in these sports . Even when Florence was besieged the inhabitants partook of these games , placing a trumpet upon the ' top of the tower of the Holy Cross , to show their enemies how little they cared for them . But gradually the splendour of these games has declined , and since the year 1739 they have never been performed . The comparison of this game of Caldo with the gymnastic games of the Greeks is not exaggerated . It appears to have been in imitation of the Grecian games , that John of Medici established the Calcio as well as the chariot racing , in which the nobility displayed so much magnificence . . It is on the Midsummer eve that this latter amusement stilt. takes place : but it is but a mockery of the former display ; for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , drawn by wretched looking horses , and driven round the area , receive the prize , which ho one thinks worth the disputing . But these , as well as many other games which displayed such a magnificence as partook of enchantment , are equally fallen from their original splendour . Florence , that opulent city , appears to have delighted to exhibit in solemn assemblies her riches , the genius of her artists , and the progress of her industry . Those times will never return , in which the nobility and the principal citizens of Florence , clad in silk , ornamented with gold and silver , pearls and . precious stones , united in performing allegorical festivals , embellished by the greatest painters , sculptors , musicians , and architects . Masquerades , chivalrous games , and dramatic representations formed their delight , and excited their ingenuity . The splendour of the Florentine commerce contributed much to the improvement of the arts . When the Turks ELEVENTH ETENINCr. 161 captured Constantinople and overthrew the Greek empire , the Medici gave an asylum to the artists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period Florence possessed a school of painters , and a manufactuie of woollen dioths , for which they were indebted to some poor monks , called ' * Humble Brethren . " Caroline . Papa , did not the government reward these monks for the great benefit they had conferred upon Flo-rence ? Mr , O. The state expressed its gratitude by exempting them from all taxes , and in giving them the superintendence of a community of nuns , who were also occupied in preparing wool . In another convent in Florence , these brothers employed themselves in painting or staining glass . This art during the middle ages was in great perfection , as may be ascertained by the fine windows which are still to be seen in different convents and cathedrals . During the prosperity of this great city , her inhabitants either invent ed or recovered the knowledge of several arts which we highly prize . To them we are indebted ' for the use of spectacles , the lyre of Barbary , thermometers , and other useful articles . At this period also the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a great niimber of charitable institutions . To the praise of the Italians be it spoken , no people under heaven take more care of . their widows and orphans . All these buildings were ornamented with paibtings andsculpture : it was the same in other great cities of Italy ; on every side were seen paintings , statues bas reliefs , and superb edifices worthy of rivalling the works of antiquity . But this spirit still inhabits the bosoms of the descendants of ancient Rome . Among the painters of Italy , Raphael /z/ the Caracci , the Coreggios , the Veronese , the Julio Romano are conspicuous . The Italians excel too in mosaic work , which they produce in the following manner : glass is cut into small tiles and dyed of every tint and shade ; a stone the size of the picture is then chosen , which is imbued with mastic , and the different shades of glass are then by the commonest workmen placed upon this gum , which retains them . Although this work is coarse , it has a good effect at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression of the weather . Many persons live by the sale of antiquities found in the earth ; such as vases , medals , busts , statues , &c.; One art , in which the Romans surpass their ancestors is music ; Italy is the mother of modem music . The taste of the popes , which has rendered this delightful art subservient to the purposes of religion , has contributed to its perfection . When the Grecian empire fell from its prosperity , the musicians of that devoted country found a refuge in Italy ; and from thence they wandered to different parts of Europe . The Italians introduced music into their churches , their spectacles , and their private life : under their genial clime music soon became necessary . The character of the Italians , naturally gay and lively , seem better to understand the art of mixing amusements with the everyday occurrences of life than any other people . The lively imagination of this people inclines them U pleasure : by nature they are poets ; no country has produced so much poetry : we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets : it is true that its language is adapted to rhyme and metre . The art of improvissator* ing , which is very rare in colder climates , is common under th fine sky of Naples , Tuscany , &c.; Frequently one /q/ may hear the ambulatory poets recite in the public places songs , odes , and sonnets , accompanying their recitations with a mandoline . But the improvissatori of a superior cast will compose whole poems , or even tragedies , upon any historical fact which shall be proposed to them . Strangers are perfectly confounded at their flow of language , at the fire of their composition , and the animation with which they continue to pour forth their " unpremeditated lays . " Sometimes , exhausted by their own energy , the improvissatori suddenly stop , and their animated countenances will assume a deadly paleness . An amusement , which in other countries is confined to children , is here enjoyed by persons of all ranks and ages , that of a puppet-show . But the perfection to which the Italians have brought this display of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement ; for they are elegant , active little figures , and perform ballets , tragedies and comedies . And I must now tell you , en passant , that Punch is an Italian gentleman , who has from time immemorial played his pranks for the amusement of his countrymen , particularly the Neapolitans . As for Harlequin his origin is not known , but it is generally believed that France was his original country. * The mildness of the Italian climate permits the work people and artisans to carry on their pursuits in the open air : the common people are sociable , and share each other 's amusement , and at little cost . They are sober and frugal in their diet , living chiefly upon vegetables . At Naples , it is a pleasing sight to see with what care - M. Florian assigns the north of Italy as the country where Harlequin first made his appearance .  --  - TroiuZa/ar. // the disposal of provisions is made to seduce the eyes and excite the appetite of the poorer classes of society , who pass the chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky in the world ; a light clothing and a few pence to feed them is all that they require : thus , easily satisfied , they work ' but little , and are fond of repose . Formerly , there were hundreds of people possessing nothing in the world but what they had on , who passed the nights upon the step of a door , or a bench in the open air . These men were called Lazzaroni . The late revolutions however have greatly diminished this race , who have been compelled to work , but principally from the circumstance of the number who were forced to join the army , and were killed in the wars . The Neapolitans of the capital lead an idle life , rude , it is true , but generally speaking sober . Shellfish , thrown on shore by the tide , a little maecaroni , herbs , and water , form their principal food . Shops set out with meat in the neatest style ; and fruit arranged in the most inviting man-* ner tempt their palates . There you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laurel leaves ; there the fruiterer has tastefully displayed tomatos , dried grapes , and dates smiling amidst myrtle leaves , box , and other evergreens , the whole occasionally diversified with garlands of fiowent , and crowns and festoons of succory and dandelion . The Neapolitan lives upon everything which is eatable ; grains of maize , chestnuts , pompion seeds , gourds , and melons , with a few suffice to appease his hunger , and with this slender food he becomes stout and fat , although he never attains any considerable height . A little water and ice quench his thirst Under so hot a climate as Naples , ice is a necessary ; in fact , it is used aa a remedy in many maladies The Nea  --  /q/ politans have a greater variety of ices than any other people ; there is scarcely a fruit from the juice of which they have not made sherhets united with ice . In great houses the dessert is composed principally of these , imitating a variety of dishes ranged round a pyramid of ice . Eager after enjoyments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them frequent holidays , and presents them with grand spectacles . In Advent , for example  --  but do you know , my children , the meaning of the word Advent /z/ Gustav , Advent is derived from the Latin word adventusy and means the coming . It is applied to the four weeks preceding Christmas , which the church has set apart for Christians as the period in which they are to prepare for that great festival , the birth of our Saviour . Mr , O. Very well . In the times when Christians were animated with more fervent piety , this period was considered , agreeably to the injunctions of the church , as an important interval , which ought to be spent in meditation and retirement . They abstained from tumultuous pleasures , from all actions liable to divert them from a serious train of thought , and carefully examined their hearts during that time , with a view to discover and . extirpate all evil propensities . By these pious exercises , they prepared for a festival designed to perpetuate the remembrance of a most glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater degree than any other people a vestige of the virtuous manners of the primitive Christians . During the whole period of Advent , they have no public amusements ; the theatres are shut ; the balls and concerts are also suspended : but in this interval , the people have other diversions , which , though more simple and analogous to circumstances , are to them not the less attractive . In /z/ many houses they erect a kind of stage , on which they exhibit very naturally the circumstances attending the birth of Christ . There they represent the wonderful spectacle of the greatest of mysteries ; the Son of God made man , and come down upon earth for our salvation . A wretched stable affords a shelter to his parents , Joseph and Mary ; the infant lies between them upon grass and leaves ; the kings of the east come to worship him in this humble abode , and to present him with the productions of their respective countries ; but they are preceded by the shepherds of the vicinity , to whom an angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them are seen on their knees before the divine infant ; others , leaving their flocks in the fields , are running towards e stable . Holy awe and respectful curiosity are expressed in their countenances . All these groups appear in the midst of a beautiful part of the country of Jndea . Behind the staUe is seen the village cf Bethlehem ; and the adjacent country is diversified with trees of various kinds , animals , houses , lofty mountains , and other objects . The character of the whole is uncommonly well preserved ; but it is in the accessories that the talents of the artists are particularly displayed , and thje illusion is as strong as it ean possibly be rendered . On entering an apartment where one of these pious compositions is exhibited , yon fancy yourself all at once transported into the east , into the happy country in which the Saviour of the world was bom : you are tempted to mingle with the shepherds , in order to enjoy the happiness of which they were deemed worthy . ' Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of producing a lively idea of an event which occurred eighteen centuries ago , yet yon seem to be carried back to the very moment when it happened , and you represent it to /q/ yourself with a devotion which leaves behind a delicious impression on the soul . I have seen pictures of this kind executed with such art that the most acute eye could not distinguish whether the scenery perceived through a narrow aperture was a real landscape , skilfully employed so as to heighten the illusion , or whether it was only an imitation of nature . As all the rest of the apartment was dark , and you could not discover whence the light came which illumined the scene in a very brilliant manner , it was scarcely possible to withstand the deception . The distant trees appeared of a dull hue ; the hills which bounded the horizon seemed to be fifteen or twenty miles off ; and you even perceived the aromatic smell exhaled by several wild plants . Those who are at the expense of such a spectacle , which at Rome is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They admit all persons indiscriminately , and few of the inhabitants of Rome fail to partake of this truly curious kind of amusement . During the same season , the city of Rome affords another diversion , which is also of a religious tendency . It is produced by a class of people called pifferari . These are Neapolitan peasants , chiefly from the province of Abruzzo , who proceed from door to door , and stop before the image of the blessed Virgin , playing religious tunes on their bagpipes , which they accompany with their voices . They generally go two or three together ; they are bare headed , and are very often distinguished by a physiog* nomy which commands respect . It is impossible to see and hear without edification these simple people , who so strongly remind you of the shepherds of Bethlehem ; for you doubtless guess by this time that the practice of which I am speaking was instituted only for that purpose . /z/ They first play the tune of the hymn , and then one of them sings the words , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments is not the most pleasing , but it is precisely their rustic simplicity that produces the principal effect upon the ear of the auditors . Most of the tunes which these shepherds play with such a natural expression are extremely pathetic ; and , when heard at a distance , their music is capable of moving even to tears . They arrive in Rome at the beginning of Advent ; and the owners of the houses , before each of which there is usually a statue of the Virgin Mary , make an agreement with them to come and play a certain number of times ; besides which the neighbours and passengers bestow a trifle on them . It is astonishing that , among all the Italians , these peasants alone possess a decided talent for this kind of music ; and it is undoubtedly for this reason that the inhabitants of Rome , which is at a considerable distance from their country , encourage their visits , and take such delight in their edifying hymns . No place surpasses Rome in the magnificence of its religious festivals and ceremonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the veneration of those characters who shed a lustre upon it in the first ages of Christianity , by their zeal and their virtues , celebrated with greater pomp . The festivals of the patron saints are remarkable for a magnificence worthy of the capital of the Christian world . The churches are then adorned in the most splendid manner ; several hundreds of wax tapers , arranged in admirable order , diffuse a brilliant light . An immense concourse of the faithful eagerly attend the service of the day , which is performed with the accompaniment of majestic music . At night the houses and streets contiguous to the churches are illuminated , and the festival commonly /q/ concludes with fire-works . The lower classes are extremely fond of this diversion ; and , as you may suppose , it is they who take the greatest part in these festivals . Nothing can be more magnificent than the spectacle exhibited on St .. Peter 's day by the dome of the church dedicated to that apostle . Edw . Papa , is not that the church which you showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the most beautiful in the world ? Mr. O , The same . Well , on that day the prodigious cupola , which rises to the height of four hundred feet , is completely . illuminated , and at a distance resembles an immense globe of fire suspended in the air . Another spectacle , not much less striking , is displayed on the same occasion in the fire-works let off from the top of the castle of St. Angelo , whence they rise above the venerable edifices of ancient Rome , and are reflected in the current of the Tiber , which flows near the spot . Such solemnities make a deep impression on the souls of the spectators , and rarely is the memory of these brilliant exhibitions erased from their minds . Mr. Oakley here rose , to the great regret of his children , who would have wished him to continue ; but , accustomed to comply in everything with the will Of their father , they contented themselves for the present with the pleasure which they had received , and asked for no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Oakley ofhis promise of the precediDg eveniogi he begaa thni :  --  Ooe would suppose that the festivals spread ihrooghoat the yest were not sufficient for the joyotu disposition of the Italians , since tiiey hare appropriated nearly three months to the pleasures of the carnival . At Rome it lasts bat eight days ; but at Venice it extends from Christmas ' to Lent : and formerly , when there was a doge at the head of the repabUc , they celebrated a fete at . the festival of the Ascension , called Bnclxur . ' The doge , having repaired to the Adriatic in a aaperh huge , threw into the sea a ling , to indicate that the Venetians , from their naval power , bad enchained that wonderhil element . During the carnival , masquerades , balls , games , races , &c.; divide the attention of the Venetians . Folly and pleasure then leign paramount : it is the Satoroalia of the anctaUi , /q/ modernized according to the taste of the times . At the period of the establishment of the Saturnalia , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature , and had no other ambition than to live in harmony with his neighbours , and to cultivate his field in peace . But this state of things did not last for ever : the manners of these people gradually became corrupted ; peace and harmony gave place to discord , ambition , and every vice . Some seized all the possessions of the others , who were thus reduced to poverty , and obliged to work for the rich ; and then were first seen the distinctions of masters and , slaves . It appears , however , that they were unwilling to banish entirely from their remembrance the primitive state of mankind , in which all were equal , and enjoyed the same rights . One day in the year w:as therefore set apart , when all were considered upon an equal footing , when they sought to drown the sorrows of life in the recollection of the golden age , and- to indulge only in joy , and in those pleasures which result from the liberty and equality of a people . Such was the origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good times of King Saturn , whose statue had its legs tied all the year ; whereas , during this festival they were loosed , to denote by this emblem , that , on this day , all men were restored to the freedom of their primitive condition . In the beginning the Saturnalia lasted but one day : but they wer6 gradually prolonged to three , afterwards to five days , and under the emperors to seven ; the two last of which were particularly appropriated to the diversions and sports of children , as it was deemed wrong to deprive them of the pleasure of taking part in this charming general festival . During these days the slaves enjoyed perfect liberty , and were treated as equals by . their mas // ten ; the poor were allowed the same pririleges as the rich . Neither the senate nor the coarts of jostiee sat daring this interval ; all business of every kind was suspended ; schoolboys kept holiday ; joy and mirth gladdened every face ; and friends , at meeting , wished one another a good Saturnalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accnstomed to wish each other a happy new year . To render this festival still more interesting by acts of humanity , some prisoners were set at liberty , and went from the place of their confinement to hang up their fetters in the temple of Saturn . The slaves on those days wore hats ,  --  a privilege otherwise belonging exclusively to freemen ,  --  and a robe lined with purple , like their masters . The latter even waited on them at table , and were not at all offended if their slaves frankly reproved Uiem for anything that they had to find fault with in their behaviour . This circumstance famished- a Latin poet with a pleasing subject for one of his pieces . He supposes that his slave , availing himself of the liberty of the Saturnalia , has been giving him a scolding , and proving , by the exhibition of all his defects , that , though he is master , yet that he is nevertheless in still more abject servitude than his slave . ' * What ! ' * he repTesents him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master , and yet meanly give way to all your desires , and are the servile instrument of all your passions ? Are you not , in fact , reduced to a state of slavery , if you are always dependent on your appetite , if yon are continually uneasy on account of your body , if you suffer yourself to be tormented and overwhelmed with caref  --  Ton may see from this passage , of which I have only given the general meaning , with what freedom the slaves , who , during the rest of the year , were reduced /z/ to silence , might then express themselves in regard to their masters . It should be remarked , that this custom likewise existed in Greece at a very early period ; and that the Saturnalia were there celebrated by the name of Chronia , from the word ChronoSj synonymous with Saturn , or the God of Time . For this reason , he was represented with a chaplet of flowers and a scythe . The first of these expressive emblems denoted the continual youth of nature ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down all things , and is making incessant ravages : it was the idea of life combined with that of death . In general , the ancients were fond of uniting these two ideas , borrowed from the processes of nature , who destroys to reeompose , who dispenses death in order to produce new germs of life . Thus , though they enjoyed not those soothing consolations which religion affords us in the promise of another and a better world ; still the ancients beheld nothing alarming in the idea of death , because an attentive observation of the course of nature had v. taught them , that whatever she produces is transitory , and is Anally destroyed that it may give life to other beings . I have just told you , that under the emperors the duration of the Saturnalia was extended to seven days . On the two last , friends reciprocally made each other little presents of small value , in commemoration of the times when the manners and wants of mankind were alike simple . These presents were sent rather as a token of goodwill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they consisted of fruits , small packets of incense , tapers , &c.; Martial , the poet , complains , in one of his epigrams addressed to an opulent friend , because the latter had sent him , by eight robust slaves , twelve tablets /z/ // seven tooth-picks , one sponge , a cop of baked earth , a measure of beans , a small basket of olives , a jar of raisins , and two jars of bad figs ; adding , eight strong slaves could scarcely bring me all this ; whereas a child would with ease have carried three pounds of good silver . But in Martial 's time the manners of the Romans were already corrupted ; and more regard was paid to the quality of presents than to the sentiments of the person from whom they came* As everything in these festivals was designed to commemorate the simplicity of the manners of the early ages , nuts were staked instead of money , in the different games that were played ; for , in those happy times , rapacity and avarice , two vices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the carnival is evidently the festival of the Saturnalia in a modem dress , you will be convinced by the description which I am going to give yon of the manner in which it was celebrated during my residence at Rome . In that city the carnival lasts eight days . During aU this time , excepting on the Sunday and saints ' days , nothing is to be seen but masquerades and horse-races . The opening of the carnival is announced by the bell of the Capitol , an edifice in which the municipal officers of the city assemble . Detachments of soldiers and sbirri , a kind of civil guards , are stationed in the Corso and in the adjacent streets , to prevent disorder . The Corso is a beautiful street , about a mile and a half long . The windows and balconies are adorned with rich hangmgs , and full of spectators . This street is crowded with people in masks , who exhibit the most singular and diversified spectacle that can be imagined . The perfect equality which prevails , during these festivals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dififuses /q/ gaiety among the multitude . Dresses of all kinds , and of all conditions , serve for a disguise . Here you see hostlers with prodigious brushes going up to the passengers to brush the backs of their coats ; and there you are accosted by vetturinU or carriers , a very numerous class of people in Italy , who with their usual importunity offer their services to every one they meet . A pretended advocate suddenly makes his way through the crowd , walk* ing at a great rate , and declaiming aloud as though he were pleading at the bar ; he addresses the people at the windows , or stops the pedestrians , threatening to prosecute them for some imaginary crime , or to sue them for some debt or other . Harlequins mingle with the multitude , and excite laughter by their comical tricks . They frequently collect into a group , choose a king , put a sceptre into his hand , set bim hi a little carriage , and lead him in procession , accompanied with music the whole length of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quarrel , and in the midst of the dispute draw large cutlasses of silvered paper , with which they hew away unmercifully at their adversaries . The mendicant costume is very frequently seen among this medley of dresses of every kind . Fiip hair flowing down the back , white mask , a money-box tied to a coloured riband , a stick , and the hat carried in the hand , are the characteristics of this costume . In supplicatmg attitudes these beggars go up to the windows , and hold forth their boxes ; sweetmeats , nuts , and other things of the kiiid are given them instead of an alms . After the masquerades , the Corso becomes the scene of horse-racing , which is an amusement of long standing at Rome , as may be known by a barbarous custom commonly practised at them formeriy . The prizes which are now // given are of silver , in ancient times they consisted of pieces of stoff , which the Jews of Rome were compeUed to famish gratoitously : you will never gness the reason of this custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redeemed the obligation formerly imposed upon them to become a spectacle to the populace , by running themselves as the horses do now . Caroline . To run themselves ! Mr , O. This fact is unfortunately but too well authenticated , and certainly does not convey the most favourable idea of the toleration of past ages . Eliza . Why were the poor Jews treated in this manner ? Mr. O. It was considered a very pious action to punish these people for the unjust and cruel death inflicted on our Saviour by their nation , or rather by the fanatics of their nation . For this reason their descendants were treated with the utmost contempt and even inhumanity . It is impossible to read , without indignation , that Charlemagne , after putting to death the heads of the i33magogue , ordered , that in future all the Jews resident at Toulouse should receive a box on the ear thrice a year at the door of the cathedral . In some of the towns of Languedoc and Provence , it was formerly lawful for Christians , during the Passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet with in the streets . In other places they were obliged to pay . enormous sums for permission to settle there ; and in large cities they were confined to particular streets , the livenues to which were dosed every night , as was customary not long since in several towns of Grermany . Sentiments , consonant with justice and humanity , have fortunately been adopted in the present age ; and we observe with pleasure , that the Jews have begun to be conr sidered as good citizens as people belonging to other reli  --  /q/ gionsy and are admitted to share the rights enjoyed by other members of the community . The last day of the carnival at Rome is the most bril* liant of all . Scarcely has the sun set , when the Corso begins to be illuminated in the most expeditious and magnificent manner . The servants besides fix torches on the tops of the carriages ; and the hackney-coaches are provided with paper lanterns . Even among the pedestrians there are many who carry on their heads tall pyramids containing lights . From this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and on all sides is heard this abusive expression , which is very common among the Romans : Sia amazzato-Be assassinated  --  a barbarous wish , unfortunately but too often fulfilled in that city ; though , during the carnival , it is a mere joke , and there is nothing alarming in it . Sia amazzato chi non porta moccolo  --  Let him who does not carry a candle be assassinated*H9uch is the salutation with which you are greeted at every step ; each individual repeats it to his neighbour , at the same time endeavouring to blow out his light . Wherever people meet , whether in the house or in the street , whether they are acquainted or not , be their rank whatever it will , they strfve to extinguish each other 's lights . No place is secure from this universal mania ; people clamber up the carriages , and to the windows of houses ; they penetrate into the midst of companies , putting out every light they can come near , and taking care at the same time to preserve their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are at length completely stunned , and obliged to seek some retired place to recover yourself . It is not till the night is far advanced that the multitude disperses , and this singular festival ter-minates /z/ Gttstav , Did yoB ever ascend the Andes , while you Were in South America , Captain Martin ? Captain Martin , Often .

Captain M. Yery true . They constitute the chief riches of the Indians , and add considerably to the wealth of the Spaniards . They are capable of carrying heavy loads in the most tugged and dangerous ways .

The numerona religious festivals which are celebrated in the south of Eurofw induce me to take a cursory Tiewof 8ome of those fetea which are so geaerally adopted . Id the early ages of the world , when mankind lived in all the simplicity of nature , attending to their flocks and herds , and devoting much of their time to agriculture , they were naturally induced to observe the course of the aun , and the punctual return of the four seasons . Thus the arrival of the aun in the vernal equinox , the summer aolslice , the autumnal equinox , and even the winter solstice , became seasons of rejoicing , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinda . In process of time , and as mankind left the open plains and assembled in cities , they forgot the origin of these festivab ; yet they continued to celebrate them , and with increasing spleodonr and solemnity . The Greeks and Romans introduced their deities , and trans- /z/ fonned these festivals , which at first were only the natural expression of the joy and gratitude of pastoral nations , into religious feasts in honour of some of their gods , or some remarkable mythological event . But when the light of Christianity was diffused over the world , it became absolutely necessary that this religion should relinquish the false notions of the Pagans , and take no share in their public festivals ! As , however , the heads of the church , from truly paternal feelings of kindness and affection , were unwilling to deprive the - new converts entirely of their ancient customs and opportunities of joining , at certain periods , in decorous and moderate rejoicings , they substituted for these heathen festivals others , commemorative of some remarkable event for Christians ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a better purpose . Such , for instance , is the origin of Christmas , which was observed with such ceremcHiy by our ancestors that it is worth our while ' to take some notice of the subject . This festival happens near the end of December ; that is , at the period when the sun , having apparentiy finished his circuit round the earth , begins his course anew . It was at this time that the Romans celebrated the Saturnalia , which I last night described to you , and afterwards the festival of Janus , which has given name to the month of January , the first in the year . The church thought that it could not better replace these heathen festivals than by substituting that of the nativity of Christ ; whence , as you know , it is denominated Christmas . In the first ages of Christianity , most of the , ea:emanies with which the Pagans celebrated the period of the returning sun were retained in this festival , and others relating to the remarkaUe event which the church in- /z/ tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient customs must be particularly noticed that of making presents to friends , and especially to chil* ' dren , at this season ;  --  a custom which gave rise to the Christmas-boxes , presented in some countries on Christmas-eve , with ceremonies which were added by the first Christians , whose uncultivated minds required that the truths to be instilled into them should be rendered palpable to the senses .. Thus , as it was intended to convey a strong and striking idea of the nativity of Christ , a representation of a stable , after the description given in the New Testament , was exhibited on Christmas-day in all the churches , where the infant Jesus was seen with his parents , the shepherds , the angels , and in short , with all the accessories mentioned in the account of the evangelists . Pious believers sung hymns before these images , expressive of their joy on account of the birth of our Saviour . It was midnight when the festival began , because Christ came into the world in the nighf . Such is the origin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting children on Christmas-eve with a kind of grotto or cradle of curious workmanship , adorned with fruits , sweetmeats , or other delicacies , illuminated in the most brilliant manner . In thse pious customs also originated a practice common in various parts of France . The father of the family sings hymns with great solemnity before a large fire , with his wife and children . He directs the youngest to go and pray in a comer of the room , and meanwhile he places several parcels of sugar-plums or sweetmeats behind or in a large billet of wood , frequently hollowed beforehand for the purpose . The child returns to the fire , and with a stick repeatedly strikes the billet , till the sweetmeats droj VOL. n. 16 // oat* and these he picks up with shouts of joy as presents from the infant Jesus . In those climates where in the month of December , the inhabitants enjoy a temperature which we sometimes look for in vain in the month of May , Christmas is celebrated in the open air , by popular amusements . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all is life and gaiety . The streets and churches are thronged with people of all ranks ; everywhere yon see small stages with mangers , which , though not so beautiful as those of Rome , are not less visited and admired by the curious . Bands of music parade the streets , stop before every manger , and play pastoral tunes , which are accompanied with shouts of joy . As soon as it is dark , the city is illuminated with numerous transparencies ,  |p3nramids  of lamps , and thousands of torches , which are carried in the streets . Collations , displaying the fruits of almost every season , and flowen which we enjoy in summer alone are presented to every visitor ; and in the streets the people pelt one another with fruits , sugar-plums , and confectionary . In other places are exhibited dramatic pieces , the subjects of which are taken from sacred history ; or they amuse themselves with a national dance called the volero . Guns are fired in all directions , and every person of any ability entertains his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the churches , which are brilliantly illuminated , and display all the rich ornaments they possess . The tabernacle of the cathedral in particular , which is eight feet high , made of silver , gilt , and enriched witli diamonds and other precious stones , produces the most beautiful effect that can possibly be imagined . In these sacred places the bustle which prevailed in the streets does not entirely cease ; and all the respect due to them is scarcely capable of reStraining /q/ the expressions of that general joy which spreads from one to another , and indiscriminately pervades all ages and all ranks . The same ceremonies and the same gaiety prevails at Provence at this festive season . During Advent , serenades , called in the Provencal tongue , Anibades de Calenes , are given . On Christmas night mass is said , after which different families unite to make a collation , in which the finest fruits of the country are served . Vey frequently this reunion of families is the means of reconciling those members of them who had disagreed . The head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable of the relations second him , and it would be strange indeed , if any one could resist such advances , and hesitate to plunge their wrongs , whether real or imaginary , into the waters of oblivion . Oil and wine are then thrown upon the Christmas log which is burning in the chimney . The streets resound with the sound of the tambourine and other instruments , and Provencal carols : bouquets of fiowers are exchanged , the tables are ornamented with orange and laurel branches ; the children are presented with litde mangers and other toys ; and these , as you may suppose , do not form the least amusing part of the ceremony to them . At Marseilles this festival is celebrated with equal splendour . At a period when civilization had made but few advances , this festival was attended by many rude and disgusting ceremonies ; such , for instance , as ** The feast of fools ; " and , if we judge of it by the description of old writers , it is impossible to help thinking that people must actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which those who took a part in this festival are accused of . This idea appears the more plausible when /z/ we consider that it was in the churches themselves , in the most sacred places , that these pious but ridiculous rejoicings were held . Yon will scarcely conceive how they could have been so long endured , when I inform you , that on this occasion an ass was led in procession in every cathedral . The minor canons and the singing boys having thrown a large cloak over the back of the ass , went to receive him at the door of the church , singing a ludicrous anthem , and imitating the braying of that animal . On this occasion the priests and clergy were fantastically dressed , some like buffoons , others in female attire , &c.; These festivals were accompanied with many other ceremonies equally extravagant ; but having been abolished as soon as the light of reason pervaded Europe , it would answer no purpose to enter into a detail of them , as they tend rather to excite our pity for the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the resources which we at the present day enjoy for our instruction , they would perhaps have made a better use of them than we do . We ought always- to allow due weight to this consideration , when we venture to form an opinion respecting manners and customs that differ from our own ; otherwise our judgment is liable to be totally false . Our countrymen and other nations seemed , formerly , to have possessed so few means of diversion that they resorted to folly to procure it . All sovereign princes and great men had fools , whose office it was to make sport for their masters . The states of Burgundy had societies and festivals of fools . At Lille there was a prince of fools ; at Bouchain a prevot des itrardea ; and at Dijon , a company called de la mere foUe , composed of five hundred persons of the best societies , who during the carnival , traverse the town in grand procession ; each dressed in the /q/ habit of a harlequin and a cap , and carrying in their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apes , asses , foxes , &c.; After Christmas-day came New- Years day , which had its peculiar ceremonies . In some of the provinces of France , even to this day , a Gaulish custom is preserved of gathering the sacred mistletoe from the oak . The cry of Gtti Pan ntaf is still sang in some country places . Then comes Twelfth-day , which is everywhere celebrated in family parties . I have already spoken to you of the festival of Easter , which is , for the Russians in particular , the feast of spring , as the feast of St. John or Midsummer was formerly considered by the ancients . The bonfires made in some countries on St. John 's day are likewise a relic of the customs of the nations of antiquity . Formerly on the eve of St. John the Baptist , which regularly falls two days after the summer solstice it was customary in almost all the towns of France to make a bonfire , which the magistrates , in their state dress , went in solemn procession to light at sunset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away brands or live coals from it . Among the eastern nations , the new year commenced , as it did with the Greeks , at the summer solstice ; that is , in the month which we call June , and this was celebrated by lighting a fire at midnight . The water drawn and the flowers gathered on Midsummer-eve were supposed to possess particular properties . The first of May is a season of peculiar festivity in the country , which is then clothed with verdure , and in the southern climes is arrayed in all the magnificence of nature . At the autumnal equinox the vintage is celebrated . Italy preserves a vast number of these ancient customs , which she has transformed into religious ceremonies . Tlie /z/ Italians are exceedingly attached to eveiything which relates to their worship and their superstitions , which are mingled with their everyday pursuits , and are sometimes of the most whimsical kind . Imagine to yourself a number of people going up the stairs of some particular chamber , upon their knees , in order to propitiate heaven , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's children laughed at this description , and Caroline exclaimed , ** Is it possible that superstition can go so far ? " Mr. O. Those who fancy religion consists in outward ceremonies are but too liable to be led into the greatest absurdities ; and this is often the case where religion is surrounded by a great deal of pomp . From hence it naturally happens that the religious festivals oftentimes degenerate into mere spectacles . The festival which made the most impression upon me , when I was in Rome , was that dedicated to the dead , and which is celebrated the day after All Saints . The same ceremony is performed annually in the catacombs of Paris , presenting one of the most awful spectacles imaginable . In Italy , the solemnity is , however , interrupted by the whimsicalness of the objects displayed to the eyes of the populace , and the fruits which should arise from the contemplation of this annual consecration , and composure of the sad relics of mortality are thus foolishly blighted . Men truly pious resort upon these days to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the vanity and nothingness of human life , and its pomps and pleasure . Gustav . Captain Martin , you have been a great hunter in your time ,  --  did you ever hunt the American lion ? Captain Martin . Yes , and rare sport it was too . This /q/ animal which is generally called the Puma or Cougaar is found in various parts of the American continent from Hudson 's bay to Patagonia . I have shot them in North America , and hunted them with the lasso in South America . The lasso , you know , is a thong of raw hide , about twenty or thirty yards long , with a running noose at the . end of it . It is carried in a coil at the saddle bow . The hunter pursues the animal at full speed on horseback till he is near enough to be sure of his mark , and then throws it with such unerring precision that the puma is instantly throttled and dragged along the plain by the neck . I learnt the use of the lasso myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puma one day , at the instant he was preying on a kid. * /z/ Thk next eveniiig Mr. Oakley began as follows :  --  It is not in Italy only that religious ceremonies are attended with BO much pomp . Spain and Portugal attach equal importance to them . The Spaniards seem to exhaust all their genins and wealth in eplendid feti-s , without being at all sensible to those wants which strangers are so astonished to find among them . Their inns are for the most part disgusting , where the iravellei must be content with a wretched bedj as Tor Tood , he must seek it himseir , either in the city or village ; the master of the house will not provide it . In the private houses of many of the provinces , there are no chimneys , and none of those comforts as to Aimiture , which we consider indispensable ; on the contrary , in their churches and processions , the most profiiae luxury is exhibited . Thousands of wax lights illuminate the diurchea upon the different fetes , the altars glitter /z/ with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these occasions , which become most worldly , from the display and pomp with which they are accompanied . Upon Holy Thursday and Good Friday every person in Barcelona appears in the habit of a " Penitent ' ' that is to say , in a black sack , with a capuchin , and a long trailing tail . A thick white cord is fastened round the waist . The nobles who mingle with the people display their vanity by wearing a dagger stuck in their belts , and having on white gloves , and carrying large tapers in their hands ; they are followed by their domestics in livery ; others walk barefooted , dragging after them a long chain or great cross . Large litters are also exhibited , ornamented with artificial flowers , upon which is represented the several actions of our Saviour 's life ; In this respect the city of Valencia surpasses all the other towns of that kingdom . On Maundy Thursday , Good Friday , Corpus Christi day , and the festivals of St. Joseph and of St. Vincent , the patron of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and garlands of flowers , and galleries are erected for bands of music . Those who attend the procession are superbly dressed after the ancient fashion . Some , in gowns of black velvet , carry wax candles ; others red and purple flags ; others in the oriental costume , in imitation of the chosen people of God , advance in cadence , dancing to the sound of castanets and tambourines ; whilst others again play on dulzainaSf a kind of hautboy peculiar to that country . Ail the corporations of the city , the companies , the trades , the schools , take part in these solemnities , and the concourse of people is immense .  --  At night the houses are illuminated  --  in a word , they are truly popular festivals , which perfectly answer the end for which they were designed . // A stranger may , however , discover in them some reprehensible things , and condemn the bad taste which prevails in their arrangements . It is customary , for instance , at Valencia , for all processions to be headed by gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every direction by men concealed under their drapery , which certainly appears ridiculous and indecorous in such solemn ceremonies . The same reflection applies to the grotesque dresses in which various persons are habited ; but we must not judge with too great severity of abuses , which appear such to us , because we are unacquainted with the events to which these customs allude . Besides , the people of the south are remarkably fond of everything that strikes the senses , and their taste is less refined than that of other European nations . For this reason , the religious festivals at Valencia are generally accompanied with a kind of drama if that profane term may be applied to sacred institutions . The principal events of the life of Jesus Christ , his passion , the most striking passages in the history of the saints , are all represented at these solemnities . Theatres are erected at a considerable expense in the public places ; and dramatic representations , the subject of which has a reference to the festival , are exhibited to the assembled multitude . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Religion , so far from being injured by these customs , as some travellers who judge of everything by their own frigid hearts have supposed , is in reality a gainer , especially if these representations are accompanied with the magnificence displayed at Valencia on the festival of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin . I was once present on this occasion , and I can assure you that the ceremony made a stronger impression upon me than any that I ever attended in other countries . I shall /z/ never forget the pleasing sensations which I felt at rising oik the morning of that solemn day , and on perceiving the streets already full of people and strewed with odoriferous flowers . To me nothing was more striking than to see all the men in their loose doublets of black or bluB velvet , with short linen breeches , which scarcely cover the knees ; and the women with their green or rose coloured spencers , their short petticoats , and small floating aprons adorned with flowers of the orange-tree and acacia . This dress , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I perceived the vivacity , airiness , and elegance even of the lowest classes . The beauty of the sky , the purity and serenity of the climate , the perfume of orange-trees , in a word , the combination of so many things to which I was a stranger , was almost sufficient to make me imagine myself transported into a new world . I was ihrilled with pleasing emotion , and mingled with the merry throng , resolving to rejoice with them , and to share during that day in their innocent gaiety . The festival commenced with a procession equally distinguished for decorum and magnificence . The exterior of all the houses in the streets through which it passed wore an aspect of joy and festivity ; the balconies and walls were hung with rich tapestry , the ground-floors were adorned with mirrors , and the windows with garlands and festoons of the most beautiful flowers . The ringing of all the bells and impressive music heightened the solemnity of the ceremonies . I followed the crowd to the cathedral , which the procession entered after passing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaze of light ; the grand altar , in particular , displayed a brilliancy of rays , which would have been too dazzling ; but that seen as it was , through the beautiful foliage of orange /z/ and citron-trees , vbich filled the choir , the light was relieved by their lovely green . The attention too of the spectators is principally attracted to a group of painted clouds which are suspended , and gradually and slowly unfold , displaying the image of the Virgin ascending to heaven . At the same moment a number of canary birds are let loose in the body of the church . After this religious ceremony , the crowd repair to public places of amusement ; these consist principally of bodily exercises , wrestling , horse-races , and a kind of ballet , some remains of the Moorish customs . But the most famous day among the people of the south of Europe is that of Corpus Christi . In other Catholic countries it is simply a festival of the church , but under the fine climate of a southern sky it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cities and villages take an active part , and which is embellished by the choicest productions of nature and art . It appears as if on that day , which falls at a season of the year when nature displays the greatest . brilliancy , mankind unites to celebrate the great benefits which Providence has bestowed upon them . In Italy , in Spain , in Provence this fete presents the mosrbrilliant display . In the year 1719 , Lisbon exhibited the grandest spectacle which can possibly be imagined : all the corporations assembled in the front of the chapel of the king 's palace : the interior of this chapel was magnificently ornamented ; the richest brocades fringed with gold decorated the walls ; upon the silver shrinest gilt , which stood upon the altar , were so many branches bearing wax tapers , that they formed a blaze of light encircling a large silver crucifix . The tabernacle dazzled the eyes of the beholders ; large porticoes , erected at the entrance of the chorch , served as /q/ vestibules to the house of God : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful vases exhaling the richest perfumes . This kind of portico was erected across the principal streets through which the procession was to pass ; the roads were covered with fine sand and strewed with flowers ; the houses on each side were covered with tapestry , or gold and silver cloth . The goldsmiths ' street displayed all that their artcould produce of splendid and beautiful . The procession was opened by the banners of the different arts and trades of the city of Lisbon : among these were exhibited effigies of the saints , their particular patrons ; the men who bore them were habited in tunics trimmed with silver . Drums and trumpets , ornamented with crimson cloth , preceded a cavalier in antique anpour , followed by forty of the king 's horses : these horses having magnificent housings , were led by esquires , richly dressed : then came the figure of St. George in silver armour on horseback , a velvet cap ornamented with diamonds formed his head-dress ; the saint carried a lance ; and the figure was so wU executed that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseback richly caparisoned , and attended by all the suite of St George . The trumpeters and drummers of the king dressed in green velvet and wearing white plumes closed this chivalrous procession : then ' followed the different religious and secular orders ; a huge silver cross gilt preceded the clergy ; immediately after them came knights , nobles , esquires , &c.; followed by the whole chapter of the chapel royal walking in solemn procession before the magnificent canopy , under which the patriarch carried the Holy Sacrament ; the royal family and attendants closed the cavalcade . The ringing of all the belis of the city , a salvo of musketry from the troops VOL. n. 17 // and of great guns from the fleet and the forts announced the departure and the return of the procession . Popular games and a grand illumination concluded the first day of a fete which , lasted a whole week . But there has ' been no such splendid exhibitions in modern times ; and , in the south of France where this festiiral formerly was held with much splendour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , however , show yon a picture of one of former times as seen at Aix in Provence . Mr. Oakley fetched several engravings representing the details of processions at Aix and Perpignan . The children were exceedingly amused , exclaiming altogether , " Oh , what droll figures ! " devils and fools , and mask-dancing groups , and cars , and cavaliers , and hideous masks T The festival of Aix , resumed Mr. Oakley , was the whimsical conception of Rene King of Provence , who instituted it in the fifteenth century . There was at that time a prevailing taste for farces and pantomimes , and the king , who delighted in these amusements , thought he was conferring an advantage upon religion by enlisting them in his service . His design was to represent the triumph of Christianity over Paganism . On the first day fantastic groups of the heathen deities , some in cars , some on horseback , and some on foot , traversed the different streets : these were accompanied by satyrs , nymphs , and demons , interspersed occasionally by groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden calf , and the like . On the second day the heathen divinities were omitted , and the apostles were introduced with other personages ; the King of Basoche , dad in a silver mantle , the abbot of youth , and lastly , furnished with his scythe , death closed the scene . The principal characters wore large masks , which are still preserved in the city . /q/ Edw , Was this festival celebrated at Aix only , papa ? Mr. O. The city of Aix is the only one which has preserved the processions iuitituted by King Rene , but throughout Provence this fete is celebrated with great solemnity . At Marseilles porticoes of flowers are erected , and the houses and vessels in the harbour are ornamented . Each mechanic appears with marks of his trade : the gardeners carry tapers wound round with flowers , the butchers lead an ox ornamented with ribands and flowers , children dressed like angels mingle with magistrates and other authorities , the sailors on board the vessels flre a salute , and in the villages provincial games are held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullfighting is a perfect national passion among this people and the Portuguese . Although I have never partaken of the pleasure which in the provinces form a part of the festivals of the church , I have nevertheless witnessed them ; and you must know , in the first place , that the Spanish breed of bulls is very strong and vigorous . The Spaniards are reported in all ages to have attached great importance to the taming of these fierce animals , and to have honoured with their particular regaird those men who , by their courage and address , successfully accomplished so perilous an undertaking . This doubtless gave rise to the sports known by the appellation of bull-fights established in the principal towns of Spain . For this purpose the Spaniards have built vast amphitheatres , whose arena is the stage on which those who make a profesiion of fighting with bulls display their prowess . All around the circumference are ranged the seats for the spectators , who sometimes assemble to the number of many thousands . If I recollect rightly , the amphitheatre of Madrid is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The . price of places varies considerably according as , they are sheltered or exposed , in the shade or in the sun ; for these amphitheatres have no roofs . The spectacle takes ' place in the open air , and in broad daylight . A magistrate attended by two police-officers , called in Spanish algiuizilSf presides at the theatre for the preservation of order . At a signal given by the magistrate , a folding door at the further end of the arena opens , and the bull furiously issues from the den in which he has been con6ned . At the sight of the multitude by whom he is surrounded , he stops short and looks fiercely about him , as if seeking some object on which to wreak his rage . At this moment one of the picadores on horseback , and dressed after the ancient Spanish fashions , advances from the other end of the arena . They are cdled picadores , because they are armed only with pikes or lances . The picadore approaches slowly towards the bull , and stops at some distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the greatest attention , and appear for some moments irresolute . The bull then , stooping his head , and mustering all his strength , shuts his eyes and rushes upon his adversary with the utmost impetuosity . The pieadore fixed , as it were , to the saddle , places his lamce in his rest , directs the point of qwq broke it in pieces . He then attacked the horse with such fury as to overturn him with his rider . At this moment the chuioSf young men of extraordinary agility , approached with mall cloaks or of glaring colours , which they held to the bull to divert his attention , and give the picadore time to escape . As soon as the latter had effected his retreat , a second picadore , armed like the first , offered battle to the bull . Animated by his victory , the beast immediately darted towards him ; the picadore dexterously kept him off with his lance ; but the bull returned to the charge before his antagonist had time to prepare for his reception . With his horns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a considerable height , and in his fall overthrew his rider . The chulos then ran forward again to his rescue , and the first picadore took his place . He entered the arena on a horse which had never yet been engaged in a conflict of this kind , and to whom , at the first onset , it proved fataL The bull , suddenly turning aside , avoided the lance , and gored the horse with such fury as to pierce him to the heart . It sometimes happens that the bull rips up the horse 's belly ; the poor animals may then be seen treading under their fet their ownbloody entrails , which hang down from their lacerated sides ; and yet obeying , for some time after , the hand which conducts them to new tortures . Caroline . Ah ! how can people bear to look at such a ciiiel sight ? Mr. O. I was at first astonished at that myself : but I soon remarked , that - custom unfortunately hardens the hearts of the spectators , and even of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the utmost indifference ; or if they manifest any interest , it is in regard to the motions of the enraged bull . /z/ 198 EVEimfo mnwtJMuEim . I odce saw Ihirteen hoTses killed in a single morniiig and sometimes there are many more . 8nch is the patience , courage , and docility of these animals that after they are mortally wounded they will carry their rider to met the enemy , till they drop down dead on the spot . When the bull , tired of seeing his adversary the picadore appear again after his defeat safe and sound , upon another horse , at length seems determined to decline the combat , he in leift to the banderillos . These are eight young men , each of whom is provided with a number of small darts called by the Spaniards banderinaSf which are ornamented with small streamers made of coloured paper . These they plunge into the bull 's neck ; but it is an estaUished rule , that they must never attack the animal with these weapons from behind but always in front . ' To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he is just going td dart at them , the take advantage of the moment when the bull stops and shuts his eyes , to plunge their banderillas into his neck and run away . If they can not make the animal advance to meet them , they hold out to him the moletOj a piece of scarlet cloth or velvet , which they always carry in the left hand . They excite him to the pursuit by passing close to him ; if he turns sharply upon lem , they rely upon their agility to get out of his way . In this case , to amuse him and divert his attention , they drop the moleta . This artifice commonly succeeds ; the bull stops , smeUs at the piece of stuff and tramples upon it . Sometimes , however , he takes no notice of the moleta , but , keeping his eyes fixed on his real enemy , pursues him so swiftly that the banderiUo has scarcely time to leap over the barrier which surrounds die arena . I have seen bulls spring over it almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is six feet high . /q/ Beyond this first barrier , at the diiance of about five fbet , is a second , considerably higher , for the security *of the spe ( ? tators , who were seated in front . Persons of vera- / city have assured loe , that they have seen bulls spring with such force as at one leap to clear these two barriers , and fall upon the benches of the amphitheatre . When the bull has fought about twenty minutes , he is doomed to die . This is the most interesting moment of the spectacle ; accordingly the most profound silence prevails in the assembly . The master of the combatants , csed matctdort appears , and anxious expectation is depicted in the faces of the spectators . He advances , holding the moleta in his left hand , and a sword in his right . During the whole combat he has attentively studied the disposition of the bull , and watched all his motions . If the animal is claro  --  / that is to say impetuous , but not crafty the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , on the contrary , the bull is cautious and cunning , if he appears cool and collected , slow in forming his resolutions , and prompt in executing them , he is called obscuro and such an animal excites apprehension in the most experienced matador . He goes up , looks steadfastly at him , and endeavours to provoke him ; but this attempt often proves vain . At the moment when he thinks to avail himself of an advantage , the wily animd eludes the stroke , becomes the assailant , and forces his enemy to fly . The latter , as he runs , is obliged to look behind him , that he may judge how to act according to circumstancesi One of these matadors , whose name was Pepillo , displayed astonishing coolness and dexterity upon these occa* sions . When he was once pursued , and had got close to the barrier , bis eyes still fixed upon the bull , be observed that the enraged animal was just going to make a at // hijn , and at the very moment when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal 's horns , and thence sprang over the barrier ; which shows , my dears , what a degree of address may be acquired by practice . While I was in Spain , two matadors were killed at Cadiz ; they were brothers . The one perished by accident ; the other rushed into the arena to revenge his death , and fell victim to his imprudence . A skilful and experienced matador , who retains a full command of himself in the heat of action , knows how to irritate the bull in such a manner that he runs of himself upon the point of the sword , which forms the last scene of the spectacle . The fatal steel is usually aimed at the part of the spinal sparrow contiguous to the brain , and penetrates at the junction of the first vertebra to the head . A wound in that place is sufficient to bring the animal to the ground , and to despatch him without drawing a drop of blood . If a favourable opportunity for piercing him there does not occur , the matador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is speedy , but not- so sudden as in the former instance . It sometimes happens , that the most skilful matador does hot hit the right place . One day I saw one of these men miss his stroke , and he was tossed upon the horns of the bull , which shook him twice with great violence before any assistance could be given him . His person escaped without any dangerous wound ; not so his honour , which was considered to have received a stain , till the moment when the bull was finally vanquished , - and the champion was able to measure his horns in his justifi* cation . This done , he requested the spectators to take notice that the horn upon which he had been caught was two inches longer than the other . On proving this fact he was greeted with a general shout of applause . To show a rOURTEENTH EVENINO. 201 want of address or presence of mind in these conflicts is a disgrace tot he matadors , who can not retrieve their character except by signal acta of courage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to such danger as much from motives of hqnour as of interest ; and the Spanish public censure the faults committed by them in their way , as emphatically as bad actors are condemned among us . When the chivalrous spirit was at its height in Spain the nobility entered the lists against the bull : instead of conceiving themselves dishonoured by this sport , they sought glory and fame in these comb . At Naples , in 1556 , the Emperor of Germany took part in them ; three years after this the King of Toledo , encountered a bull and was wounded in the leg . It is wonderful that aqpidents are not more frequent in these fights , considering the length of the horns of some of these bulls . The tips of their horns are ofien five feet distant from one another . Whenever the bull has leaped over the barrier of the arena , he stamps on the ground , and throws up the earth furiously with his feet ; and when he has killed a horse , if the chulos leave him unmolested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast falls at the feet of the matador , the trumpet sounds , and three mules ornamented with bells and streamers come to drag him away . These bull-fights take place once a week , and frequently twice in summer . Eighteen victims are destined for each fight , six for the morning , and twelve for the afternoon . The expense occasioned by such a spectacle is prodigious : the matadors receive a considerable sum , as do also the eight banderillos , and the two picadores . We must likewise include the cost ( the eighteen bulls , and of per- /z/ haps sixteen or eighteen horses sacrificed at one of these fights . Since , however , they have ceased to select as formerly , the finest animals , the expense is considerably diminished . This sanguinary spectacle forms the delight of the Spaniard , the Portuguese , the Italian , and of the inhabitants of he south of France . An act of parliament alxdished them in England ; the popes thundered their excommunications against all persons who should publicly combat these animals . But the Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perilous sport ; the chivalrous exercises of the MaestranaSfjLS or associations of the young nobility , which have places in several of their cities . The knights of these various bodies unite together on certain festivals , dressed in splendid uniforms , and proceed by martial music , pikemen , and jus of the field . Lists have previously been enclosed in a public place of the cify : all being ready , the knights enter the lists , and range themselves in two files , and perform a variety of evolutions on horseback , and then proceed to exhibit mock fights : after this they run at the ring , throw darts at each other , which they receive upon their bucklers : after this shadow of an ancient tournament they repair to the lieutenant of the Maestranzn , where the knights display the more courtly graces of gallantry . . If the Spaniards had preserved the industry as well as the chivalrous spirit of the Moors , their country would be the most fiourishing in Europe ; but it is certain , that since the expulsion of that unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . lowest degree . This active people . had changed the southern provinces of Spain into a delicious garden , blooming with the finest productions of Europe . Silk , cotton , sugar , rice , pomegranates , /z/ olives , lemona , oranges , &c.; rewariled the labours of the Arabs in the fine plains of Andalusia , and formed Incrative articles of commerce . Bnt in these days agriculture is exceedingly Defected , and there are whole provinces which present the appearance of a desert , from the indolence of the inhabitants . We have seen , however , in some of our former evenings , that there are people who would rather live in misery than better their , condition by labour . It is true , lliese people ate but half civilized : but is it not astonishing that even in Europe , where the arts , literature , and commerce have made such great progress , and contributed so much to the prosperity of several nations , there should be countries whose inhabitanta prefer a life of indolence to all the advantages that are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy and Spain must be convinced , that idleness still has partisans among the polished nations . Indolence is particularly prevalent among the inhabitants of Murcia in the south of Spain . Though placed under ( he finest climates of all , and in a region blessed with extraordinary fertility , they receive but little enjoyment from this bounty of nature ; choosing rather to loiter away their time in their houses , and to smoke segars , which is their pnncipal occupation . The situation of their country is highly favourable to commerce and the exportation of the produce of the soil ; but they let their neighbours enrich themselves , and are better pleased to grow gray in poverty , provided they can but spend their days without any unusual exertion , either mental or corporeal . As all the Spaniards are extremely temperate , the Murcians of the lower classes work very little during the summer , because they can then subsist , at a very trilling expense , on salads and fruits . Servants will even quit their places at this // season of the year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of the time of the workmen , and much is spent in smoking segars . The women partake of this indolence ; they know little , and have much difficulty to fill up the laoiguid hours . From henpe it arises that , in some provinces , the Spaniard is languid and even gloomy . Such are the baneful effects of idleness ; when once it takes possession of the mind , it resembles a malady which insensibly undermines the constitution , and renders it incapable of the least exertion . The Spanish and Portuguese colonies in America furnish ample proofs of this . Labour there is considered a disgrace , and the inhabitants are content to be distinguished by a white skin ; in fact , a white skin is considered of almost as much importance as letters of nobility . Nay , instances have been known , in which a Mexican has applied to the tribunals to obtain an attestation that he has a white skin . You will naturally suppose that , possessing such a certificate , they look upon the Mulattoes with sovereign contempt Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ragged clothes , riding with an air of self-satisfaction through the streets , because he belongs to the white race ; that is to say , he is descended from Europeans , wjio are used to command the services of others and are exempt from work . In the Spanish and Portuguese colonies , agriculture is , unfortunately , considered an ignoble einployment . In consequence of this opinion , one may see the finest lands or cultivated in such a style that the poorest English fanner would feel indignant at contemplating them . Brazil , for instance , is one of the most fertile countries in the world ; it has been gifted by nature with the richest /q/ productions , the finest animals , and the moat agreeable i climates . **28;217;TOOLONG ; ea , theFonuguei hare neglected agriculture , and bestowed all their labour i search of gold and silver , diamonda and precious stone A thirst for riches induces the colonists to extract Ihef precious materials from the bosom of the earth ; and whc the mines are exhausted , and their lands thus desert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely in those districts most famous for the subterraneous treasures which present the most miserabi aspect ; while other parts of the country , where labot is necessary for the support of life , present a smiling an animated picture . In the richer provinces , strangers an travellers can scarcely procure the common necessaries ft existence . I have spoken to you of the poverty of Peru ; the Spar iards who inhabit the capital display , nevertheless , th greatest luxury ; but this luxury seldom extends beyon their clothes . Their food and dwelling is sometimes mea enough ; but their wives are dressed in rich stuffa , lacef and jewels . An equipage in indispensable to ihem ; an the young people perfume and dress their hair with inf nite care , and pass most of their time in walking and i other frivolous pleasures . This idle propensity has multiplied the number of nc groes to an astonishing degree , for the colonists themselve do literally nothing .

They make the sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton ; it in they who wor in the gold mines , &; c. ; in short , it is from the labours c the negroes that we receive the productions of the Nei World ; but it is their masters who alone reap the profi of them . But I must return to Europe . VOL. n. 19 // In speaking of the indolence of the Spaniaids , yon must , on no account , include the whole nation . The inhabitr ants of Malaga , Alicant , and Porto rival the most commercial nations , and export in large quantities the delicious wines of their country . In the neighbourhood of Malaga there are three vintages . In June the first grapes are gathered and dried , or are made into syrup . In September the second crop is gathered ; from this a wine is made , less agreeable , it is true , than that which is the product of the third crop , but still very good . The amount of wines and dried fruit which are exported is about five hundred thousand pounds . Olives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of extracting the oil skilfully , and therefore lose much of the profit they might otherwise reap from this fruit . The good quality of any article of merchandise naturally brings purchasers . In Europe , commerce is carried on with much rivalry among its inhabitants ; every nation endeavours to excel in the cultivation of its productions , and by the superiority of their merchandise . If one people by their excellence engross a particular article , that object becomes , immediately , one of imitation to other nations , who endeavour , by the utmost exertions , to establish manufactures of the like importance , and of equal excellence , that they may enjoy a part of the profits of this article of commerce . The Spaniards have felt this with regard to their wool . Spain is one of those countries in which the sheep produce the finest wool in the world . The high price obtained for their fleeces for the cloth manufactures has induced the Spaniards , for a very long period of time , to bestow the utmost attention on the improvement of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flocks of /q/ those animals . Many proprietors have ten , twenty , fort sixty thousand sheep , and even more , which form tbeiipri principal wealth , and produce a considerable profit , if they me with no accident , such as a contagious disease , sa u heallhy season , ot the like . Every flock is under the s perintendence of fifty shepherds , and a chief , who is ca ed mayoral ! the number of dogs destined to watch ll flock is equal to that of the shepherds . As the climate the heights of Estrcmadura and Castile has been found tl most favoDrable for the sheep , the greater part of the ow ers send their docks to those provinces . These wande iDg docks are termed in Spanish nten'nos , and the comp ny of proprietors la meala . Out of about thirteen millioi of sheep , which Spain is computed to contain , there are least five million merinos . They begin their journey the end of April , or the beginning of May ; all the flocl then quit the plains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shepherds to the mountains of Casti or Estremadura : as they are driven only from twelve eighteen miles a day , it takes them more than a month reach the place of their destination ; for they halt sever times to be shorn , which operation is always p  --  rformi in the month of May . This is the most important buf ness for the owner , whose profits always depend on tl quantity and quality of the fleece ; for which reason it ' performed by the shepherds with a kind of solemoit The weather chosen for it must he fine and dry , b cause the skin of the Spanish sheep is so delicate that ra would prove fatal to them . The shearing takes place enormous buildings capable of holding sixty thousai sheep . They are called by the Spaniards esquileos , a erected by the side of the road , and appropriated exclusiv ly lo this parpose. /z/ The flocks pass all the summer on the mountain pastures , and at the beginning of autumn return to the plains . I'he shepherds never quit them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were it not for their society with each other , they would know more of beasts than of man . They are very sober , and exceedingly attached to their flocks . Gustav . Papa , have they not introduced merinos into France ? Mr. O. Yes . The fineness of the wool of these sheep has induced other nations to cultivate the breed , and in France they have succeeded ; for in that country they do not degenerate , and their wool is to the full as good as that of Spain : so that the French shortly expect to be independent of Spain for their fine wools . Is it not very surprising that the Spaniards have been so long satisfied with selling their wools to strangers , particularly to the English , and purchase them again when manufactured into fine cloths T During the last century , however , some manufactures of fine cloths were established in Spain , yet the greater part of their fine cloths are still import  --  4 foreign countries . The Spaniards profit more by their silk , which is very abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live by the spinning and weaving of this article . Barcelona is the Lyons of Spain : this city is inhabited by manufacturers of silk stockings , velvets , tafletas , crapes , &c.; It is also a famous place for shoemakers , who supply the Indies with thousands of pairs of shoes . Cadiz is the grand mart for merchandise destined for America , and for the natural* productions of that part of the world which are brought in return . This place is occupied , not by manufacturers , but speculators and naval men , who extend their enterprises over the greater part of the world . In time of peace , the riches which ei ter Cadiz are immenae . All the mostprecious productioi of America , gold , silver , precious stones , bark , cacao , vai ilia , valuable woods , dyeing plants , and many other articli arrive in this port , and are from thence dispersed thraugl out the different countries of Europe . The ports of Li bon and Oporlo in Portugal present the same busy sped cle as Cadiz . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofesparta in Mercia and Valencia . Esparla is long and tough grass , of which they make mats , chair be toms , girls , and particularly a cordage , lighter and moi durable than that made from hemp : cables are made i this grass six hundred feet long . This manufacture en ploys many people in the country , men , women , and chi dren . In other places they occupy themselves in stri ping bark from the cork tree , with which they form cort for botdes , and soles for shoes . Jackets too are made i this light bark , which are worn by persons who are m good swimmers ; it is also employed in making models i architecture , and is particularly well calculated to represei ruinous buildings . At Cape Roxent in Portugal , there is cork convent . Caroline and Guslavua . A cork convent ! Mr. 0 . Listen , and I will explain this to you . In great cavern in the side of a mountain , human industr and ingenuity have excavated many cells , a chapel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lined with corl above and below , and on all sides ; the tables , the bedi the chairs , the ornaments of the chapel , are all made of to_the same material ; so that it may well be called a cork conven The northern provinces of Spain are remarkable fc other productions . Cialicia and Astuna make cloths ; Bit /z/ cay possesses great iron mines ; but they are not worked with that activity and industry which such useful and beneficial gifts demand . No part of Spain is more famous in history than Granada , which rose to its highest prosperity under the Moors . Of the magnificent edifices in this province , the most notable are the palace of the Alhambra and Generalife , or pleasure house and garden of the Moorish kings . The Alhambra alone occupies the space of a town , and is situated on a hill , fronting that called the Alcanaza , and separated from it by the rapid Darro . The ascent to the Alhambra is through groves of poplars and orange-trees , with fountains by the road-side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner walls ; and a number of tanks or cisterns occupy the space between these and the Moorish palaces ,  --  a congeries of buildings* chiefly remarkable for their interior decorations . The chambers are all paved with marble and ornamented with marble pillars , sustaining arches of pure Arabic form ; they are adorned with stucco and with a species of porcelain which freshly retains its gilding after a lapse of ve centuries . The C9urt of Lions , so called from the sculptures which adorn its fountain , has no fewer than one hundred and fifty-eight marble pillars . The hall of the Abencerrages is so called from the massacre of that illustrious tribe , said to have been perpetrated here by Boabdil , the last Moorish king of Granada . The common people fancy that in the alabaster basin , which is in the centre of the apartment , they can discover traces of the blood of these brave men : but the opinion of intelligent travellers is , that these ruddy stains are merely the effects of time and exposilre to the air . - See cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children were generally assembled in th library ready to receive him ; but upon this evening the ; were sooner than usual , and when he entered the apar ment , they were anxiously awaiting his appearance . " To-night , " said the kind father , " I am going to entei tain yon with an account of your own country . I nee scarcely mention to yon , that Great Britain is an islanc or that its empire consists rather of two large ones , sni rounded by numerous islets . Hence we are by nature maritime people ; and as no other European country poi /z/ sesses the like advantages , we are considered by friends and foes the most powerful naval people in existence . Denmark is , indeed , a kingdom composed of many islands , but situated far north , and much isolated ; she has made no great maritime efforts either to extend her territories , or to enlarge her navy . England , on the contrary , lies near fertile France and industrious Holland . By coasting the shores of the Great Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south . When intestine wars destroyed for a time the commerce of the Low Countries , a number of Flemish artisans found an asylum in England : from this period her manufactures improved so rapidly hat she has outstripped her instructers , and lef them far behind her . In France alone she found a rival who kept pace with her , and in many articles of manufacture the latter has the advantage . But no country equals Great Britain in naval strength . English vessels navigate all seas , bearing the treasures of the world from one country to another : our vast possessions in the two Indies and other colonies furnish an immense quantity of natural productions , which are spread over Europe , to which we must add our own excellent manufactures . Our mercantile companies and associations give a peculiar and enterprising system to our commerce . We have the East India Company , Levant Company , Hanseatic Company , Russian Company , and the companies of Africa and Hudson 's Bay : all these are solely occupied with the commerce and interest of the country whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East India Company , which has been in existence these two hundred years , And which enjoys the exclusive privilege of trading to the Asiatic possessions in India . The vqlue of the merchandise which our vessels bring from that distant country amounts to from six /q/ millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds , to eight millions three hundred and thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three pounds . Two thousand merchants compose this company , each of whom have contributed to its funds by depositing in them about one thousand and fifty pounds : some more , but none less . Each person receives a benefit from it proportioned to his contribution . Twenty-four directors are at the head of this grand company . Many of the Indians , having no idea of such associations , imagined for a long time that this company was a great queen ; and very lately a deputy was announced to an Indian prince as ' * . the grandson of the Great Lady Company ! " This little anecdote made Charles and Eliza laugh . Mr. O. The Hindoos are induced to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its governor , administrators , and military forces ; and that everything is done in the name of the company . rom India and China the East India Company receive manufactured cotton goods ; raw silk , tea , indigo , pepper , saltpetre , sugar , medicinal drugs , porcelain , varnishes , &c.; The West India trade is not in the hands of a privileged company , yet it is equally flourishing with that of Asia , and is nearly though not quite as lucrative . Of the produce , coffee , sugar , cotton , rum , precious woods , &c.; form the principal part . Twelve thousand sailors are employed in this commerce . The European nations do not furnish England with articles of commerce so lucrative as these but many far more useful . Great* Britain imports from Russia , hemp , potash , iron , coarse linens , &c.; From Denmark and Norway , wood and seed ; from Sweden , pitch and tar , sailcloth and copper : from Prussia , seeds , hemp , linseed , and grindstones : from /z/ Holland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , juniper berries , which , however trifling they may appear , form an important branch of trade . The Batch procnre them very much from foreign countries ; in the neighbourhood of Goblentz they are grown and exported in large quantities . Eliza . What use do they make of juniper berries ? Mr. O , Gin , or hoUands , is distilled from them ; they are also employed medicinally in fumigations , particularly on board ship , where it is of great importance frequently to purify , the air . The English import from Spain and Portugal , wines , brandy , dried fruits , cork , wool , and other productions of those countries . From the coast of Africa we receive gums , ivory , and ebony . You would naturally suppose , perhaps , that a considerable commerce exists between France and England ; but besides the spirit of rivalry which subsists between them , and which has caused so many wars , industry being the characteristic of both nations , the exchange of a few productions is all that takes place between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English merchandise is generally prized above all others ; and the net advantage England receives may be valued at about ten million pounds sterling . England possesses about sixteen thousand mercantile vessels of different sizes ; which , upon an average , give employment to about sixteen thousand sailors . In war time , the regular navy occupies as many on board about eight hundred and fifty vessels : the expense of such a navy is enormous ; and of that of its construction you may form a guess , when I tell you that two thousand trees are employed in building one large man of war . A vessel of this kind resembles a castle , so vast and solid is it . /q/ The exportation and importation of merchandise upon the Thames in London , employ three thousand five hundred English and foreign vessels , without counting a number of smaller craft , equally engaged in the transport of goods . Nothing can be imagined grander than the establishments at Portsmouth , Plymouth , and other ports where vessels are built and equipped . They are cities where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen large docks in which ships are refitted ; there anchors are forged ; in other places enormous caldrons of boiling pitch may be seen : in other buildings cables are made ; in others again breweries are carried on . Thousands of workmen are industriously employed for the outward bound commerce . The cities of England resemble large workshops and great magazines . Upon entering them , strangers are dazzled by the magnificent whole , and are too much occupied to examine their details . The constant whirl of so many persons passing and repassing , each appearing to fear the loss of a single moment ; the great workshops , filled with men , women , and children ; such a variety of all kinds of machinery ; the rich magazines and splendid shops , in which thousands of curious and useful objects are exposed to view : all these united present a spectacle , as satisfactory as astonishing , to the man of observation . Indeed what can be so gratifying as the contemplation of so many chef d'oBuvres of genius or of mind ? so many astonishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convenience , the luxury , and the diverse commodities of life . In rambling about the streets of London , one would suppose that the spirit of industry and invention must be exhausted ; and that the arts and manufactures had reached the climax of perfection ; and yet on the morrow , a crowd of new objects present them- /z/ selves to the gazer 's eye ; and on the following day his delighted vision rests on new and more excellent productions . The commercial spirit is common to all classes of society in England : the most distinguished , persons disdain not to inform themselves of the invention and progress of mechanics ; and even make them the subject of their conversation . All ranks interest themselves in the political occnrrences of foreign ports , and this arises from their influence upon trade . The gazettes are eagerly read even in villages far from the capital . The merchants and tradespeople are constantly actuated by speculative projects ; and when the fortune of one man is not sufficient to carry his designs into effect , he associates himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace the different ports of the globe ; and they choose with discernment those countries which offer the most inviting prospects to their undertakings . Their ships frequent all friendly countries , and traverse the most distant seas . This commercial spirit is not confined to the towns ; there are villages in England which carry on a trade as great as that of many towns of the continent . Many of these mechanics begin their day at three or four in the morning , and finish it at nine or ten at night . During these hours of labour , they allow themselves only time to eat their frugal meal of bread and cheese , and beer . This life of close application is however prejudicial to their health , and they are for the most part pale , small , and thin . The same trade is generally transmitted from father to son ; and there are houses and establishments in different parts , which have for many generations enjoyed the public confidence , and still continue to enjoy it by the probity which presides over their operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement /q/ which people of fortune give to the labouring classes ; and the means they resort to are sufficiently ingenious . In some counties , county balls are given ; all persons who take part in these are obliged , men as well as women , to clothe themselves in silk stuffs , fabricated in the county . And each person is compelled to produce a certificate Irom a weaver , manufacturer , or dyer , certifying that it was purchased from them . Sometimes , at court festivals , orders are issued that every one shall appear in the manufacture of his or her country . Formerly , prizes were given to the best spinners , by the principal lady of the village ; and from twenty to thirty , or even forty of the young country girls repaired to the lawn in front of the great house with their wheels . Having taken their seats in a circle , in the centre of which were placed the prizes , a rural band gave the signal for the commencement of their skill , when every wheel began to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued their occupation , for the prize was given to the best and quickest spinner . At the end of an hour the music stopped , and the wheels immediately stood still ; the prizes were then distributed , and refreshments offered : after which a dance on the green , in which the master and mistress of the mansion , with their guests , generally took a part . Caroline . I wish , papa , this custom was in fashion in our county . Mr. O. The establishment of such diversions , so long as they are divested of show and pageantry , would be very desirable no doubt . Prizes are also given to the best plonghers . The labourers assemble at one end of a fallow field , having VOL. u. 19 /z/ before them their ploughs and oxen , or horses . At a given signal all their ploughs start , and turn one or two furrows , according to the plan laid down . Those who stand by as spectators generally bet upon the different candidates .

The 8cotch farmers in particular , often meet in these friendly contests ; there was a meeting of this kind held at Oxford some time since : ten of the candidates were Scotch , and ten English ; each party was animated by more than common feelings , since they both conceived the honour of their country to be at stake . The judges allowed that the English performed well , but the Scotch better . A celebrated English author , named Arthur Young , who travelled over many parts in order to ascertain the best method of agriculture , invented a new plough , which he thought so superior to all others , that he challenged all the husbandmen in his county to meet upon a certain day in order to prove it . Judges were appointed , who marked out the ground which should serve as a kind of area for the exhibition . Six good ploughs were brought , and admitted as candidates for superiority ; they were harnessed with four horses , while that of Mr. Young was drawn by two oxen only : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his furrows were also proved to be deeper and straighter . Every body was therefore compelled to acknowledge that his plough stood unrivalled . In the year 1813 , a landholder , near Cork , gave an agricultural fete , such as was never given in any other country ; three hundred and forty-seven ploughs were assembled in his grounds which covered one hundred and twelve acres . At ten o'clock in the morning all these /q/ ploughs began to move , and an hour after twelve all his fields were ploughed . In order to recompense the husbandmen for their labour , he gave them a handsome repast ; twelve hundred men , women and children , were regaled at his expense : there were besides , seven hundred and forty guests , who were all entertained sumptuously . Several bands of music played at intervals ; and the entertainment concluded with a ball . Many noblemen invite their friends to their seats in the summer , who visit the farms , inspect the flocks , the ploughs , the cattle , the utensils , and machines employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished themselves , and they afterwards dine with their Lord and his friends . But the spirit of industry has fixed its permanent abode at Birmingham , one of the largest manufacturing towns in the world . A population of more than sixty thousand souls is there employed in various ways . The most ingenious machinery is there put in motion to perform all kinds of work in iron , steel , and other metals , from the finest kinds even to the coarsest ; buttons of all kinds , steel watch chains , all kinds of tools , snuff boxes , buckles , plate , medals , &c.,; and a thousand other objects : machines for copying letters , carriage wheels , nay , whole carriages made of iron . Among the machines , that for coining copper money , and which is worked by a water mill , is most distinguished . It strikes thirty or forty thousand coins in an hour . The other parts of this wonderful machine beat the copper into sheets , polish them , cut them , place them , one after another under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they mark the number of pieces which are struck , , so that the workmen can not secret any without discovery . This machine is a real master-piece of mechanism . The // magazines of Soho cover a hill facing this town : here then the workshops and houses of the proprietors add to the effect , which is certainly the finest in Ihe world . The position of Birmingham has much contributed to deyelope its wonderful industry . Fnmi the mines in its neighbourhood , the manufacturers procure coal in* abundance for the founding of their metal ; it is situated almost in the centre of England ; and by means of canals , it readily conveys its manufactures to London , Bristol , and other seaports , from whence great quantities are shipped for different parts of the world . Everything which is worked in steel and iron is carried to the greatest perfection . It was in our own country that the first iron bridge was made , in the year 1779 . It crosses the Severn at Colebrook Dale , and is composed of a single arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This invention has been imitated in France . The Pant des ArtSf** in Paris , is also composed of iron , but it consists of several arches . Other countries which are not so amply supplied with metals , have constructed wooden bridges with several arches : but at Bavaria , in Germany , many have been constructed with one arch only , one hundred feet wide . In no country , except in Holland , is the eaHh so valuable as in England . The system of agriculture has been carried to the highest pitch of perfection by our country men . Our sheep produce a wool , litde inferior to that of Spain ; yet its consumption is so great , that we import annually from four to six thousand quintals of this valuable article . In the fabrication of cotton we excel all the other nations of Europe , and to it we are greatly indebted for our prosperity . Yet it is only since the middle of the last century /q/ that this manufacture has attained such perfection . In 1750 , twenty thousand persons only found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect is now far different . Manufactories , resembling palaces , rise on every side : the most ingenious machines spin an enormous quantity of cotton ; weavers , dyers , printers , are every where occvpied in some branch of this valuable manufacture . The commercial cities export vast quantities of cotton goods . To the invention of machines this happy change may be attributed ; spinning by hand was a tedious operation . A common workman , named Hargrave , was the first person who invented a spinning machine ; but as he was poor , and was ignorant of mechanics , his first essay was very imperfect ; it had eight spindles , after this , he made one with twelve . His idea was - soon appreciated and improved , and finally brought to perfection ; and these - ginning ' Jennies , as they are called , were at length made with sixty spindles . The people , who are easily alarmed , imagined these machines would deprive them of their bread , and they rose tumultuously and destroyed several frames . Their blind fiiry compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were formed , and the work people were at last convinced of their utility , and eagerly sought employment where they were used , and they became daily more numerous . In 1787 , there were in England twenty thousand seven hundred Jennies , and one hundred and fortythree cotton mills . Another workman , named Arkwright , improving upon the idea of Hargrave , made machines infinitely more complex and more powerful , which were instantly adopted everywhere . The inventor realized a large fortune , and was made a knight . There is a model of this machine in the conservatory of arts and trades at Paris . - /z/ 222 EYENINO EirTERTAINnNTS , Gtistav , I recollect seeing it , papa ; it is a great machine with a cylinder , haying an infinite number of bobbins , and at the bottom are many buckets to receive the cotton as it is wound by these bobbins ; the rest of the machinery was so complicated that I could not comprehend it . Mr. O , I believe you ; we must see it at work to understand its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called a mfde which unites the properties of both the machines I have described . A pound of cotton can be spun so fine by this machine , that a single pound produces three hundred and fifty skeins , which would , when unwound , extend to one hundred and sixtyseven thousand English miles . When spinning was thus perfectioned , weaving began also to improve ; and with much success Indian goods , such as calicoes and muslins , were imitated . Their lightness and cheapness soon rendered them a favourite clothing among the English and other people , and the consequence of this was , that many manufactories were established , particularly in Lancashire , where calicoes were first made . The number of persons employed in this manufacture is very great ; of this you will be able to judge , when I tell you one hundred thousand children are occupied in its different branches . Caroline , Whenever I put on a muslin dress in future , I shall always think , with peculiar interest , that I owe it partly to the labour of childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with objects of necessity or luxury . But the English have accomplished wonders by meanaof coal , which is so abundant that they export great quantities of it . Upon the rivers Tyne and Were , sixty-four thousand workmen find support in mining . The most ingenious /q/ machinery is employed to discover the strata of coal , to raise it from the bottom of the mines to the surface of the earth , or to transport it into the barges which are to convey it to the distant ports . In 1757 , the Duke of Bridgewater conceived the idea of constructing a canal from the interior of his mines at Worsley , to the environs of Worcester , to facilitate the transport of coal . The execution of his plan excited astonishment , for it passes over a beautiful river upon arches . But not content with the facility which canals afford in the transport of coal , ' iron rail- ways " have been constructed , having on each side a deep groove or rut , into which the wheels of the carriage are fitted , and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of machines without horses . Some of these * ' rail- ways ' * extend five or six miles . In the counties of Derby , Lancaster , and Lincoln , they are much used , in order to save the expense of carriage as much as possible ; these roads are always made partly sloping when they are short ; so that one horse can draw forty-nine quintals ; but as I have already hinted , horses are in some instances not wanted at all ; the machine is put in motion , and away it goes as if self-moved . The children were much amused at this description , but thought at the same time , that Mr. Oakley was but joking ; he , however , assured them , that he had himself seen these vehicles , heavily laden with peat , moving along apparently without the assistance of man or beast . These machines move by steam ; you will hardly credit to what an ettent the use of this powerful , yet at first trifling vapour is applied by us . With steam-engines we thresh corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weave cotton , wool , and linen , embroider muslin , saw wood , cut crystals , print newspapers , coin money , &c;  --  /z/ It is not therefore surpiising that they should supply the place of the brute creation . Such machines ofbn perform the work of a hundred men and as many horses . In one of the principal breweries of London , everything is performed by steam . It transports malt into the canals which are connected with immense vats , twenty feet in diameter ; it brews the beer , and when it is made , it pours it into casks , and the casks e-moved travel to the place appointed them , where drays are ready to receive them . From beginning to the end of this process all is in motion ; an invisible power here presides without trouble , without precipitation , without noise . The breweries of London are constructed upon a gigantic plan . The boilers of one of them will contain three thousand hogsheads , and the smallest eight hundred . It brews annually two hundred and fifty thousand hogsheads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Duke of Wurtemburg in one of these vats ; and a few years ago , one of these machines burst at a moment when it was full of beer ; the liquid threw down walls , drowned several persons , and flooded the neighbouring parts . An ingenious man of the United States , named Fulton , has applied the use of steam to the navigation of vessels , and the English have profited by this invention .. Formerly it would have seemed strange that steam should be so powerful as to force boats up against the current of streams and rivers . These vessels contain a whole steam apparatus , which forces round large wheels ; these , acting upon the water , impel the vessel on against wind and tide . As coal is as plentiful in the United States as in England , the Americans have steamboats upon all their lakes and rivers , where they are of the greatest importance to navigation and commerce . Many of them are fitted up with /q/ pretty rooms for passengers . The Mississippi , in Louisiana , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels work up from the distance of about five hundred leagues in twenty days . The largest of these vessels , one hundred and twenty-six feet long , can transport seven hundred bales of cotton and one hundred travellers . You will easily imagine what advantage it must be to commerce to have such a convenient mode of conveyance . All the principal towns of the United States have , by the means of these vessels , the easiest possible communication . But England has applied steam to large vessels , so that when the wind fails they can still go on . In France too steam is applied to navigation . Coal has been converted to another use , the lighting of streets and pyblic buildings by gas . By consuming coal in the fire , a gas is procured , which is conveyed by pipes to the different places which are to be lighted with it . A light being applied to it , it kindles and produces the most brilliant effect . Not only London , but many other towns are lighted by it . The genius of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its efi*ects than in overcoming the dangers of the sea . The benevolent and ingenious discoveries of many Englishmen for this purpose , have been largely rewarded by the nation ; this you will say was but justice , but there are instances upon record , in which useful discoveries have been proscribed , and very frequently neglected . The cork jackets I have already mentioned : at Tynemouth , a large sum was ofiered for the invention of a boat which could weather a stormy sea , and thus rescue the poor shipwrecked mariners . Mr. Greathead having observed that a round ball being cut in quarters , and that these // quarters , when thrown upon the water , always retained their proper position , constructed a boat as nearly of that shape as possible , judging that the principle , upon which the former acted would influence the latter . His plan succeeded , and hundreds of persons are indebted to him for their lives . Thus you see , my children , what essential benefits may result from the observation of the most trifling subjects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same benevolent purpose . A Captain Manby has invented a mortar , by means of which , a great cable is thrown from the coast to a vessel at a distance , the one extremity being well fastened to the shore . The project answered , and parliament voted a considerable sum as a reward to Captain Manby . The English have greatly increased the value of many animals . Their horses , for instance , are the fleetest coursers in Europe ; they are - most carefully attended to , and much emulation exists between the owners of these noble animals . For this purpose horse-races have been established , at which large prizes are distributed . These public races , which are held chiefly at Newmarket , and which are the rendezvous of the fashionable world , have so much utility that they have been established elsewhere . Races are held in the Champ de Mars at Paris ; but these are not carried on with the same spirit and interest as they are in England , where horse-racing is a passion . They have for many ages been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings , who bestowed certain prizes upon the victors . You never were at a horse-race , my dears : that is another diversion almost exclusively confined to this country . It is impossible for one who has never seen English /z/ qwq mile over Newisarlcel race-course in a minute , but actually performed that distance in a minute and a few seconds . At Newmarket there are two courses ; the first being seven thousand four hundred and twenty yards , or upwards of four miles ; and the second six Aousand six hundred and forty yards . The former was run by Childers in seven ininntes and a half , and the latter in six minutes and forty seconds , which is at the rate of more than forty-nine feet in a second . At a race , several horses are made to start together , and to run twice or thrice over a certain space , which is denominated the course . The animals themselves seem in3ured with a high degree of emulation : they wait impatiently for the signal for starting , and exert themselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent these horses from acquiring too much flesh , which would be injurious to their speed i Ihey are kept rather lean than fat , and yl they all look very well . Their skin being very delicate , they are kept constantly covered with cloths to promote perspiration , and to increase their activity . Each horse is ridden by a jockey , who is in training for the race a considerable time before hand , that he may be as light as possible . His dress is also remarkably light ; and , before the race , all the riders with their saddles , which are extremely small , are weighed ; and if one of them be found lighter than the rest , so much lead is put into his pockets as makes his weight equal to that of his antagonists ; for it is calculated , that in mnning four miles , /z/ seven pounds make the difference of a distance , as it is called , of two hundred and forty yards , between horses of equal goodness . Instead of seating himself on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touches the horse with his thighs only which he presses close to the animal 's sides . EUza . Are these jockeys well paid ? Mr , O , Commonly about ten pounds if they win the prize , and only five if they lose it . They are generally young men ; but some of them are more advanced in years , and pursue this disagreeable occupation to the end of their lives . Charles . Indeed I should not like to be a jockey : how many tumbles they must get ! Mr. O. Accidents of that kind very seldom happen , because the horses are so perfectly accustomed to the sport ; but the velocity with which they cut the air is lia- * ble to prove injurious to their riders , though the motion communicated to the air by the continual action of their arms in using the whip , enables them to breathe more freely . Their very caps are so shaped , as not only to protect them from the sun , but likewise to cut the air with the greater facility . Numerous spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horsemen follow the racers , hooting and hallooing with all their might Bets are laid upon different horses , and large sums are lost in a few minutes ; whole fortunes are sometimes thus squandered . About a month before the races commence , the public journals announce the horses which are to run , to whom they belong , and how the public opinion stands , by naming the bets which are taken upon the different horses . The races of the Calmucks are not considered of such impor- riFTEBNTH EVSNINO. 22 tance as those of England , where thejr are puraaed wit an ardour bordering upon madness . Isolated on ever side , the English natioD is not so polished as many others yet its with all their rudenesa , possess ai originality of character peculiar to themselves , tincture ( with some remains of the barbaroua customs of thai : ancestors . For instance , they delight in cockfighting , and bet a eagerly upon these little animals as upon horse-raung , fur niahiug them with steel spurs , and exciting them to to_the combat by every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor cocks who fall int ( their hands . J/r . O. Truly , I think with you , that well educatei people might find better samsement than cockfighting Formerly these combats were real spectacles , the puerilitj of which contrasted finely with the Bsrioua character of thi English nation . An Italian , who visited London in Ihi seventeenth century , describes them with much minute ness , the repetition of which would afford you but littU amusement ; I shall , therefore , merely say , the cocks cho sen for this sport come from India ; they are called gamt cocks , and are vigorous , proud , and toarlike , if you wil permit such an expression applied to a bird . The eduea tion of these poor animals is an afiair of importance in th eyes of the amatenrs of this sad spectacle . They even sometimes make a mystery of their manner of feeding an training them . This amusement is not , however , confined to England in several of the villages in Provence and Picardy , it ii pursued with as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanguinary amnsemen which forms the delight of the common people of England /z/ I mean boxing . Bodily strength and the spirit of defence or revenge always meet with admirers among the lower classes . Bnt these must be openly carried into effect ; they disdain perfidy and stratagem , they demand bravery , nottreason . In England , where the people are so frank and open that their condaet often degenerates into radeness , the use of the stiletto is unknown , and the bare mention of this weapon , as a mode of revenge , excites the liveliest indignation . Their quarrels are decided by the use of their fists . There are many ludicrous anecdotes which have resulted from this English passion for boxing , and the independence and freedom with which each man in England has a right to defend himself , when he imagines he is insulted even by persons of the first distinction : I will relate one or two of them. * When the famous Murishal Saxe , in man of extras ordinary strength , was in London , he was challenged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the marshal as he passed him happened to jostle against his arm . The marshal accepted the challenge , and the scavenger instantly began to strip ; no sooner had he done so , than the marshal taking him by the shoulders threw him into his cart , which was fall of mud , to the no small amusement of all the by*standers . In 1789 , 1 witnessed a scene not less diverting . Two men , having quarreled , at length resolved to box it out . To make the more sure of hitting each other , these fellows , after stripping , got into two deep hogsheads , placed close to each other in the street , so that nothing but their heads and shoulders could be seen : and in this posture they fought * The translator has greatly curtailed Kr . Depping 's minute account of the art or rather adenee of boxing , as too well known to exdte interest in an English reader .

The Scotch have a gymnastic pme , more wholesome and more agreeable than those of the English which I have juflt described ; it is called " The Game of Golf , " and in commonly played on extensive plaios or links , die surface of which , though generally level , is occasionally interrupted by tnla and hillocks tufled with furze or long grass . Two round holes , about six iQchea in diameter , and from four to eight feet deep* are made at certain distancea on a right line ; the distancea between these holes vary from two to six'hundred yards . The golfers all wear 3 short loose jacket , ' and provide themselves with slender clubs to strike the balls , made of very hard flexible wood , three or four feet long , according to the stature of the player . One end is thicker than the other , rather crooked , and baa lead run into it , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The player lays hold of this dub with both hands , raises it over his head , and as it descends strikes the ball . /q/ ' which is made of very lard leather , stuffed with feathers : it is commonly an inch and three quarters in diameter , and weighs about two ounces . Each party has a ball , and those who play together strive by turns to drive the ball from the spot where it lies as far as they can . The object of the game is , to send this ball into a certain hole with the fewest strokes . Thus the party who puts the ball into the hole at five strokes beats another which accomplishes it with six or seven , or more . If the number of strokes is equal on both sides , neither can claim the advantage . In this manner the game continues till all the holes are filled . The nilmber of players on each side must be equal . There may be two , four , six , and even eight on a side ; but let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never use more than two balls . You will easily perceive , that to play well at this game , a person must possess several essential qualities . In the first place , it requires great strength and dexterity to drive the ball to a great distance , especially if there are players in the opposite party who , as I have seen , will with a single blow , send the ball upwards of a hundred yards In the next place it requires skill in measuring the strength of the stroke , and applying it in such a direction as to lay the ball in smooth ground whence it may be easily moved , and also to drive it , when near the hole , just into it . and no further ; for a little too much force may defeat the object , and give the advantage to the opposite party . This is the most interesting moment of the game . The Scotch in general pursue this sport with incredible ardour ; they are animated with the highest degree of emulation , and are consequently proficients in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address , at the same time that it affords them a wholesome exercise* I /z/ have seen old men of seventy drive a ball at five or six strokes from one hole to another , at the distance of four hundred and fifty yards . I tried to do the same , but found to my shame , and amidst the laughter of the other players , that the fifteenth stroke left me a good way from the mark . I afterwards practised very often ; and the more dexterity I acquired , the more pleasure and interest I took in the diversion . I can assure you that there are few games which seem to me better adapted to all ages than this ; for it may be played more or less briskly as yon please . The players have an opportunity of showing their strength and skill without being obliged to fatigue themselves ; so that the Scotch amuse themselves at it from eight to eighty years of age . On their return to the town , the golfers frequently enter into long discussions respecting the strokes they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their party to lose the game , or suffered their attention to be diverted from it by the raillery of their adversaries , who usually employ this method to disconcert the opposite party . The rich , who in every country love to distinguish themselves by luxury , have introduced it into this game also* Some of them are attended to the links by a servant , carrying seven or eight clubs , each of which has a different kind of end , for taking the ball as it lies in the grass , in wheel-ruts , and in every possible situation . Considerable prizes are frequently ofiered for the winners , and thousands of guineas are betted on a diversion in which interested motives ought to have no place . The pleasure of having won , and amused themselves with their friends , ought to satisfy the players . In no game whatever can I approve of playing for money . But the speculadve genius of the English enters into most of their amusements . /q/ There is no country under heaven where individuals interest themselves more in the sufferings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is even to their / commercial spirit we owe the establishment of those useful associations which are so numerous in the British isles . When a charitable end is to be attained , a subscription is opened ; the friends of humanity contribute to it according to their means and inclinations , and in this wa sums are procured large enough to found schools and hospitals , to recompense a man who has employed his feeble means in essays of public utility , or to reward the warrior who has spilled his blood in the service of his country . There I are societies for the assistance of infirm schoolmasters , authors , actors , for supporting orphans , for instructing those young people whom vice joined to ignorance , has unfortunately conducted into the different houses of correction for various misdemeanors : in short , the objects of British charity are so numerous that , were I to enumerate them all , I should but weary you . One of these , however , I can not help describing , the arrangement of which is a model of order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best organized establishments in London . About twelve hundred children are here supported and instructed in writing , arithmetic , Latin , Greek , and navigation : attention is generally paid to their inclinations as to their future choice in life ; they wear a long blue robe and yellow stockings . Once a year the Lord Mayor of London visits the hospital ; and , after having assisted at divine service in the church of the establishment , he repairs with the governor to the great haU , and there two of the children pronounce a discourse , the one in Latin the other in English . He who speaks in Latin , is sent the following year to Oxford or Cambridge , where he continues his studies at the /z/ expense of the hospital . In the mathematical class , forty boys are educated for the navy . A number of boys , in another class , are taught fine writing by clever writings masters , and are thus prepared to take clerk 's places ; twice a year samples are exhibited of their performimce , whidi really approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn suppers of the children , which take place erery Snnday evening between Christmas and Easter . Persons are admitted with tickets . The great hall of the hospital being well lighted up , the children enter , headed by their masters , and take their places in the greatest order round the tables . The governors seat themselves at a semicircular table . The supper is frugal ,  --  it consists of bread and cheese , served up on wooden trenchers , and beer in large tankards . During the repast , one of the children destined for the service of the church , mounts a pal* pit and reads a homily . AAer this lecture , the children sing a psalm accompanied by the organ : the reader then gives the evening prayers , and when these are concluded the children retire . The prayers and the hymns of a thousand children , the greater part of whom are orphans , whose innocent voices are thus raised in grateful praise to Providence for its watchful care over their existence , has something in it very touching and afiecting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that many of them left proof of their bounty behind them . England , notwithstanding her industry , has many poor , because commerce is subject to misfortunes , and is often totally ruined by wars ; many individuals are thus plunged into misery . A new invention , other countries forbidding the importation of foreign goods , may annihilate one particular branch of industry ; and thus throw upon the public some thousands of individuals . Besides , tiie shipwrecks /q/ which annually take place are numeroas , and naturally consign to the bosom of the deep treasures which were destined for the covering of a thousand expenses . Some parts of England are unfavourable to commerce , and the soil too is , in some places , barren ; it is not , therefore , surprising , that with all her riches England should contain also much poverty . Thus we may often see the greatest luxury by the side of the greatest misery ; and in the capital we may observe men whose ingenuity in the arts is surprising ; and on the other hiuid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bene* volence of their countrymen , present themselves . These people have their clubs : a friend of mine went in company with another gentleman to visit one of these rendezvous , dressing themselves in old clothes , that they might make their observations more unobservedly . They reached a cellar , which was the place appointed for the meeting , and announced themselves as members of the Beggar 's Club ; on which a servant placed a ladder for them to go down , but immediately aflerwards removed it , that none of the company might decamp without paying . In the clubroom , which was very large , were ten tables , all very clean ; to which , by way of precaution , the knives and forks were fastened by separate chains . Before the guests sat down to table a washerwoman came , according to custom , it being Saturday night , to fetch their shirts to be washed during supper , which was then brought . When it was over , each was asked for his reckoning , which amounted to sixpence , washing included . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without any mistrust of the two strangers , whom they probably took for colleagues from another quarter , proceeded to business . In the first place each of them counted the produce of the /z/ day ; and my friend assured me there was not one of these beggars bat what had collected twice or thrice as mach as an indastrious labourer can earn in the time . Having settled their financial affairs , each of the members called for a pot of porter , and drank to the health of all charitable souls . The blind struck up a tune , and the others began to dance very merrily . My friend was astonished to see many who , in the day-time counterfeited the part of cripples , display greater agility in this diversion than any of the rest . To dancing succeeded songs ; and you may easily suppose that these were not remarkable either for good taste or decorum . The assembly was not yet inclined to break up  --  punch was ordered ; and some , while enjoying their glass , read the newspaper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not till three in the morning that the members of the club , tired of drinking and talking politics , departed to their respective homes . The children laughed heartily at this story , and asked how such meetings could be permitted in a well governed city . Mr. Oakley replied , that it is but just that every individual should be allowed to amuse himself and make merry , provided he gives no molestation to others ; and that in this point of view all these amusements of the lowest classes appeared to him perfectly coasistent with humanity , and with that indulgence which is due to people who count so few happy moments in the course of their existence . Is it true , said Gustavus to Captain Martin , who had been an attentive listener this evening , that there are snakes in the East Indies , large enough to swallow a tiger t . Capttdn Martini I have never seen a snake swallow a tiger ; but a friend of iine who had been many yeaurs in /q/ that country informed me that he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country which commanded a view of a clump of trees . He one morning observed the branches of one of the trees in violent agitation , although it was quite calm . He was about to proceed to the spot to ascertain the cause , when his servant prevented him , declaring that a large serpent of the Boa kind was in the tree sporting and waiting for prey . Soon a small quadruped passed . under the tree and was instantly seized by the serpent , who threw himself on the animal , snatching him in his mouth while he held on to the trunk of the tree with his tail . He kept possession of the tree several days , and frequently seized his prey in this manner . At last a tiger passed under the tree , and was instantly infolded ' in the tremendous folds of the serpent The battle was long and severe , but j the Boa triumphed . When his enemy was dead , he deliberately crushed his bones by twisting himself round the carcass , which was finally reduced to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an operation which it required many hours for the serpent to perform . When he was thus rendered helpless by distention the inhabitants of the place sallied forth and easily despatched him . /z/ Thx followiDg evening Mr. Oakley renewed his recital in these words : We have now , my children , tniTersed very nearly the four ( parters of the globe ; France alone remains for our discnsBion . You have been in France , and therefore much that I have to say to you haa passed under your own obaerration . At Paris you had the advantage of contemplat ing all that France has prudaced remarkable in the sciences , arts , and commerce . Iq out excursions together , I polnled out to you the perfection to which even the smallest objects are brought ; I frequently expired to you the incalculable advantage and resources which were the natural result of these divers productions . You have also observed and will observe more forcihly , should you again visit the Parisian capital , the nibanity and gentleness of manners for flEVENTEENTH EVENING . 243 which all ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be found in an equal degree in any other city in the world . The number of enlightened men . which this city contains would astonish you , were your minds advanced sufficiently to comprehend their genius and pursuits . But this city , so brilliant in our days , filled with monuments of every description , fine establishments , men of merit , and the most agreeable society , , owes its present celebrity to the progressive improvement of ages . Contemplate for one instant Paris , a poor fishing town in. the time of Julius Cssar , and then glance at it now as the capital of a great kingdom and one of the principal cities in the world . Yet France was always inhabited by an industrious people : the Gauls , though vastly inferior to their conquerors the Romans , were acquainted nevertheless with some of the arts ; they cultivated the earth and even adorned themselves with gold and silver . Some of the provinces contain to this day monuments of their ancient religion . The Romans , in subduing the Gauls , introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the same time they created wants among that warlike race of which they were before ignorant Luxury then made rapid advances , the cities were decorated with temples , baths , and triumphal arches ; the establishment of schools hastened the civilization of the nation ; a commerce between Rome and Gaul was established , and the latter soon became one of the finest of the Roman Provinces . It is true that the corruption of the Roman capital extended itself into all its conquered provinces ; but fortunately for mankind the introduction of the Christian religion stopped its rapid progress . The invasions of the barbarous nations extin- /z/ guished in some degree the light with which the Romans had iUamined Gaul . Their progress may be likened to that of a rapid torrent , which sweeps all before it : whole provinces were overwhelmed by them : the Goths entered on the south , the Franks on the west ; the Burgandians swept Burgundy and Tranche Comte ; these were followed by the Danes in Normandy . Had it not been for Christianity , France would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars desolated the country and cherished the ferocious disposition of the people , the monks at the same time silently cultivated literature in the retirement of their cloisters . The state of warfare in which France was thus engaged during many centuries , and the love of glory which has always animated the French people , cherished among them a martial spirit , which gave rise to a regular institution known by the title of chivalry . This institution acquired additional lustre during the crusades or the wars in the Holy Land. * A simple monk in France , by the recitation of the sufferings endured by the pilgrims on their visit to the Holy Sepulchre , so excited not only the French people , but other nations , that they followed him in crowds , and he set off attended by . the most motley company which ever assembled for the capture of the Holy Land . But this immense body of men and women perish before they reached Palestine . The second army was more fortunate , and the Holy Sepulchre was rescued from the hand of the Infidels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model for those of other nations . * The Translator can not help obsendng that Chivaliy is considered hj most antiquarians as being of Gothic origin . /q/ Brave and religious at the same time , he was terrible to those who would oppress him ; submissive to the authority of the church , generous and devoted towards the fair sex , and all who were feeble and sought his protection . Arms constituted his chief occupation , and martial exercises were his supreme delight . Hence , as you may suppose , it was perfectly natural io institute solemn assemblies , which afforded the nobility an excellent opportunity of preparing themselves for real conflicts . To this end were established public games or exercises , which were celebrated with the greatest pomp , and known by the appellation of tournaments . They appear to have been known as early as the second dynasty of the French monarchs , though ancient chronicles ascribe the invention of them to one Geofllroy , Lord of Preuilly , who died in 1066 . He was probably the first that drew up a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them more common and frequent . Other nations seem to have borrowed tournaments from the French , who always excelled in them . The English conceived a partiality for them under Richard I. ; and these sports were introduced at Constantinople , and into the whole Greek empire , in consequence of the crusades , which produced a connexion between the French and that country , now denominated Turkey in Europe . As thes6 tournaments were commonly celebrated with great pomp , and were attended with prodigious expense , they were given only by princes and noblemen of the highest rank , either on occasion of some fortunate event or public rejoicing . As they were sure to attract a vast concourse of people , they were always held in a town of sufficient magnitude to contain the knights and esquires with their numerous retinue , and to supply whatever was necessary for the subsistence of all the people- /z/ // and of the horses which they brought with them . In Germany a count was obliged to bring six horses , a baron four , a knight of the empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rendered these festivals so brilliant and magnificent At a tournament held at Heidelberg , the Count Palatine was attended by eight hundred and twentyeight persons and horses ; Duke Otho of Bavaria had in his train two hundred and fifty ; Duke George of Bavaria seven hundred and twenty-three ; Frederick , Margrave of Brandenburg , eight hundred and six ; and the Margrave of Baden one hundred . There were besides at this tournament eight hundred horses not belonging to the retinue of those princes . Some time before the feast , heralds were sent about the country to carry a solemn invitation to the knights , named by the prince , to partake of the diversion ; without this no person was admitted . On reaching the place of their destination , the knights hung up their shields and coats of arms , that the judges might examine whether they were worthy of the honour of bearing a part in these contests . You must know thatin these times , when the laws were yet too imperfect to prevent every species of crimes , public opinion was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to universal contempt when they were guilty of any misdeed . Thus , those . who were guilty - of murder , treachery , oppression , and even such as had calumniated females , were excluded from all tournaments . This was an excellent law at a time when it was so easy for the strong to oppress or insult the weak . On the day appointed for the festival the judges examined the arms of the knights , to see that they were conformable to the regulations adopted for the tournament , and . that the riders were not fastened to their saddles /q/ which was prohibited by those laws . Besides the judges or umpires , there was a king at arms to preside over the conflict , pursuivants to place the combatants , and heralds to give the signal when they were to begin and finish . Previous to the tournament , the knights went to hear a solemn mass , and then Repaired to the spot where it was to be held . This was usually a spacious open place enclosed with barriers , behind which the knights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ladies and spectators of distinction occupied elevated seats prepared for the purpose , and in general adorned in the most splendid manner . As soon as the signal was given , the barriers were opened , and the knights , on horseback and armed cap-a-pie , entered the lists , where they found antagonists whom they were to engage . You may easily imagine that each , animated by the presence of the illustrious spectators , and the remembrance of the glorious achievements of his ancestors , exerted his utmost efforts to distinguish himself above his rivals . When the conflict had lasted some hours , the trumpets gave the signal for its cessation ; the knights laid aside their armour , and partook of a sumptuous entertainment , during which the names of those who , in the opinion of the judges , had exhibited the greatest proofs of valour , were proclaimed , and prizes were awarded them . These prizes , consisting of armour richly decorated , gold chains , &c.; were commonly delivered to the conquerors by females of the highest distinction and beauty . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken all sorts of precautions necessary for preventing the mischiefs that were liable to result from them , yet frequently fatal effects ensued from the heat of /z/ battle , or the hatred and jealousy of the combatants : ibr there were some who were not sufficioitly masters of themselves to prevent their being hurried away by passion and the desire of victory ; and not strictly observing the prescribed rules , did all that lay in their power to overUirow teir adversaries in what manner soever it might be . Others availed themselves of these opportanities to be avenged on their enemies . Besides , the heavy armour in which the knights were clad rendered a fall from a horse almost always fatal . Numberless accidents of this kind which happened at tournaments are recorded in history . On one of these occasions a Count de Gnines , nanaed Raoul , lost his life ; Robert of Jerusalem , Count of Flanders , was mortally wounded ; Geofiry de Magneville , Earl of Essex , was killed in 1216 ; Florent Count of Hainault , and Philip Count of Boulogne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of Corbie in 1223 ; John Duke of Brabant perished in 1294 . The Belgian Chronicle relates that in 1240 a tournament was held at Neuss , near Cologne , in which sixty knights and esquires lost their lives being most of them suffocated with the dust . In a tournament held at Darmstadt , seventeen Frenchmen and nine Hessians were killed . The popes therefore prohibited these games , at the same time excommunicating all those who shoild engage in them ; but such was the ardour of the nobility for opportunities of displaying their valour in time of peace , that no papal bull or anathema was capable of putting a stop to them . The greater the number of these tournaments a knight had assisted at , the igher was his reputation for valour and dexterity . John of Brabant , wiio , as I have observed , lost his life in had borne a part in seventy tournaments , in France /q/ England , and Gennany , as well as in other distant countries . At first , tournaments were only an amusement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sequel , a game was adopted in which the combatants made use of warlike weapons , that is , with lances and swords , the points and edges of which were not blunted . These combats were called mortal ( armes a outrances ) because they scarcely ever terminated without effusion of blood , or the death of one of those who entered the lists , unless he who was unhorsed would acknowledge himself vanquished : and though so sanguinary , they commonly took place between persons who were strangers to each other , or at least had no cause of quarrel , but who merely sought to display their bravery , address , and their generosity . For this reason , general laws and regulations were enacted for these dangerous sports , though they were sometimes infringed by particular agreement . There were knights who traversed foreign climes , defying all who offered themselves as champions , and challenging them to single combat . History has preserved the defiance which John , Duke of Burgundy , proclaimed in the year 1414 ; it ran thus :  --  " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to advance our honour by the essay of arms , in order to acquire a distinguished fame and the favour of the beautiful lady of our love , of whom we are servants , have made a vow to wear , with sixteen other knights and esquires , a prisoner 's fetter upon the left leg , suspended to a chain which shall be gold for the knights and silver for the esquires , upon every Sunday for the next two years , beginning from the Sunday after the date of these presents , unless we can find an equal numbet of knights and esquires /z/ without reproadi , who will fight us to the end ( outranee ) armed with such arms as he shall please , bearing a Lance , a hatchet , a sword , and a dagger ; upon condition that those , on our part , who shall be vanquished , shall be quit , by presenting , each of them , a chain like those we wear ; and the opposite party , who shall be vanquished , shall each be quit , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of silver to the esquires . " Heralds were frequendy sent to distant countries to proclaim the challenges of princes and knights . During the reign of Henry VI . of England , a knight of Arragon caoie to London and caused public proclamation to be made , that he would engage in mortal combat with any knight or esquire for the honour and service of his master , the king of Arragon and Sicily ; that not having found in France any person who would enter the lists with him , he had come to England to accomplish his enterprise , on condition that the conqueror should carry away in token of victory the helmet or sword of the vanquished . An English gentleman of the name of Asdey accepted the challenge , and the combat took place in the presence of the king ; but I know not how it terminated . When Maximilian , emperor of Germany , presided for the first time at the diet of the empire held at Worms , a valiant knight , named Claude de Bom , and sent by the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword under the windows of the inn , and by his herald at arms challenged any German knight to combat with him , on condition that the vanquished should be the prisoner of the conqueror , and pay him a ransom worthy of a knight . Though there were many knights of tried bravery at the court of the Emperor and of the other princes , yet none of them durst venture to accept the challenge of this stranger , whose renown had spread far and /q/ wide . At length , the emperor fearing lest the honour of his nation should bo tarnished if the challenge of the foreign knight remained unanswered , resolved to accept it himself , and accordingly caused his shield , with the arms of Austria and Burgundy , to be suspended beside that of the French knight . It was agreed that the combat should take place in nine days . That me being elapsed the two champions entered the lists , well armed , and provided with lances and swords . Each maintained profound silence , and awaited the signal for rushing upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they attacked each other with such fury that their lances were broken against their breast-plates . They immediately drew their swords , and were closely engaged for some time , till the emperar received from the stranger so severe a blow as to cleave his armour . So for from being daunted by this accident , the emperar rushed with fresh ardour upon his antagonist , returned blow for blowi and at length extended him on the ground . The knight acknowledged himself vanquished , and gave bis word of honour to repair as It prisoner to the court of the emperor . You see by this example that sovereigns themselves did not disdain to become parties in these combats .. The Greek emperor , Manuel Comnenus , fought in person at the tournament held at Antioch , and by a single thrust of his lance unhorsed two French knights , whom he threw to the ground one upon the other . Edward III . of England fought in a tournament in the town of Chalons ; and Henry II . of France , engaging the Connt da Montgomery at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he died . Though all the combats of knights were in general denominated tournaments , yet that term waa particularly ap-
