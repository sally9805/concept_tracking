txt FEW of our readers , we suppose , are prepared to be told , that Missouri is not only the largest State in the Union , but that it is unsurpassed and perhaps unequalled by any other in natural resources . Yet such is the fact ; taking into view its advantages of climate , soil , rivers , variety of agricultural productions , and mineral wealth , we do not know of any State which is entitled to take precedence of this . The history of Missouri , as a home of civilized man , begins with the cession by France to England , of her possessions // east of the Mississippi , at the peace of 1763 . The French then , relinquishing their possessions on the east of the river , hegan to make progress in colonizing its western banks . The first town founded in Missouri was St. Genevi*ve , which was laid out by a party of French from Kaskaskia , in Illinois , in the course of the year of the cession to Great Britain . Other settlements , west of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the year 1764 , the city of St. Louis was founded , by M. Lack*de , a partner in a company which was extensively engaged in the fur trade , a business at that time already very lucrative . It was selected as the d*ip6t for Upper Louisiana , in which term was included all the State of Missouri and the territory west and northwest of the same . In this wide tract of country , a monopoly of the trade with the Indian tribes had been granted , by M. d'Abaddie , Director-General of Louisiana , to the company just alluded to . It was wealthy , and clothed with very valuable privileges , so that the settlement at St. Louis almost immediately assumed considerable importance . The selection of a place , moreover , was so judicious , that , independently of any other circumstances , it could not fail to attract early attention , being so evidently destined to become , what we now live to see it , the metropolis of a wide-spread and fertile region . It is one of those points which seem formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the advantages that are essential , on the one hand , for , the comfort and health of their immediate inhabitants , and , on the other , for the convenient exportation of the produce of the country , and the importation of whatever is needed for the supply of its wants . Nothing can permanently keep back a place possessing such advantages . Thirty years ago , the towns of St. Charles , St. GenevR*ve , and Cape Girardeau , were competitors of St. Louis in point of population and wealth . The difference of natural advantages has already made a marked distinction among them ; and it is safe to foretell , that in St. Louis will prove to have been laid the foundations of one of the largest cities of the West , perhaps of the largest inland city of the United States . It has only just begun to attract the attention which it deserves . In four years , reckoned from the winter of 1833 - 4 , its population and business doubled ; and it is reasonable to expect that , ten years hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur trade , and the exportation of lead , constituted the chief business of the early settlers of Upper Louisiana , as indeed they made the occupation of the majority of its inhabitants down to the period of its coming into the possession of the United States . Of the emigrants into this region , in the years immediately succeeding its first occupation by the French , some began to form new settlements , as Vuide Poche , afterwards called Carondolet , Florisant , and Les Petites C6tes , now St. Charles ; others joined the infant settlement at St. Louis , which , soon coming to be considered the capital of Upper Louisiana , became the residence of the French and afterwards of the Spanish governors . But the hope of living under their own laws and rulers , which had brought the settlers together , was speedily disappointed . The weakness of France had already compelled her to relinquish her last hold upon America . By a treaty , which was made with Spain in 1762 , hut was not fully carried into execution until 1769 , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , together with the island and city of New Orleans . " The fate of the Louisianians , " says Stoddard , " was made known to them by a letter signed by the French king , datedApril 21st , 1764 , addressed to lvi. d'Abhadie , whom he calls Director-General and Commandant of Louisiana , informing him of the treaty of cession , and directing him to give up , to the officers of Spain , the country and colony of Louisiana , together with the city of New Orleans and the military posts . He expressed a desire for the prosperity and peace of the inhabitants of the colony , and his confidence in the friendship and affection of the king of Spain . He , at the same time , declared his expectation , that the ecclesiastics and religious houses , which had the care of the parishes and missions , would continue to exercise their functions ; that the superior council and ordinary judges would continue to administer justice according to the laws , forms , and usages of the colony ; that the inhabitants would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been granted to them by the governor and director of the colony ; and that , finally , all these grants , though not confirmed by the French authorities , would be confirmed by his Catholic Majesty . The treaty of cession , dated the 3d of November , 1762 , was never published , and the terms of it remain a secret to this day ; but there is good reason to believe that the sentiments , expressed by the French king , corresponded with the stipulations it contained . " - Sketches of Louisiano*. pp. 71 , 72. // Four years elapsed before any attempts were made on the part of 8pain to take possession of her newly-acquired territory . Even then the attempt was unsuccessful . The spanish governor , who arrived in 1766 , with a military force , found it prudent to abandon his design and return to Havana , so great was the excitement among the colonists , because the transfer had been made without their consent . " Things remained in this situation , " says Stoddard , CC till the 17th of August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of the colony . He immediately selected twelve of the most distinguished leaders of the opposition , as the victims of resentment . Six of them were devoted to the halter , to gratify the malice of arbitrary power , and to strike terror into the other malecontents . The other six , deemed less guilty , and surely they were much less fortunate , were doomed to the dungeons of Cuba . This scene of blood and outrnge made a deep impression of horror on the minds of the people , and will never be forgotten . In 1770 , the Spanish authorities were established in Upper Louisiana . " O'Reilly was the first governor and intendant general , who exercised the Spanish power in Louisiana . As governorgeneral he was vested with the supreme power of the province , both civil and military ; arid , as intendant-general he granted lands , prescribed the conditions , and confirmed the concessions made by his subordinates ; superintended the fiscal depart .. ment , and the affairs of the Indians . " - ibid. , pp. 72 , 73 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proclamation changing the form of government in Louisiana , abolishing the authority of the French laws , and substituting those of Spain in their stead . From the time of its promulgation , the French laws ceased to have any authority , and all controversies were tried and decided conformably to the Spanish laws . To the credit of Spain , however , it should be recorded , that her governors conducted themselves with almost uniform moderation and impartiality towards the French inhabitants . This is abundantly proved by the fact , that the spirit of society in Louisiana does not seem to have been materially changed by the transfer to Spanish authority . New laws were of course introduced ; but , except at the very first , no Opposition was made to their administration , and no outbreaks of public feeling took place . The manners and cus // toms of the people continued French ; and , at the present day , we can hardly find any trace of the Spanish dynasty . It is , moreover , a remarkable fact , that when Louisiana again came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French inhabitants were dissatisfied with the change . In 1670 , the Spanish governor , M. lions , began to exercise authority in Upper Louisiana . The house in which he resided yet stands , in St. Louis . It is built in an oldfashioned , substantial manner , with a portico all around , and will probably long remain , a memorial of the past . From this date , to the year 1800 , the colonies in Upper Louisiana experienced scarcely any thing of great interest . The most remarkable events were , an attack by the British and Indians upon St. Louis , in 1778 ; an unparalleled rise of the Mississippi , in 1785 ; and the arrival , at St. Louis , of ten keel-boats , in 1788 ; each of which events gave a name to the year in which it occurred . The attack referred to was instigated by the Canadian English , by way of retaliation against Spain , for the part which she took in the American Revolution . The assailing force consisted of about fifteen hundred men , of whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great danger , but the inhabitants of St. Louis behaved in a most spirited manner . XVhen the attack was first threatened , they fortified the city with a breastwork , formed of the trunks of trees , placed upright upon the ground , with their interstices filled with earth . It formed a semicircle , extending to the bank of the river at both extremities , and terminating at each in a small fort . Three gates , each defended by heavy cannon , afforded a communication with the country . The remnants of these defences yet exist , and are pointed out by the old inhabitants . The attack itself differed in nothing from the usual mode of Indian warfare . It was entirely unsuccessful , and was followed by no important result . In the year 1800 , all the territory west of the Mississippi was ceded back again by Spain , to France . But during the three years of the continuance of French authority , nothing important occurred . No alteration was made in the jurisprudence of either Upper or Lower Louisiana , . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of the whole province ; a fact which is very important to those who would Understand // the legal history , and some of the present laws , of Missouri . * By the treaty of April 30th , 1803 , Louisiana was purchased by the United States from the French crown ; and , six months after , the President was authorized to take formal possession . W. C. C. Claiborne was appointed Governor and Intendant-General of Louisiana , and Amos Stoddard was commissioned to exercise the powers and prerogatives of the Spanish Lieutenant-Governor of that province . The province of Louisiana was subsequently divided into two parts , the territory of Orleans and the district of Louisiana ; the latter comprehended the present State of Missouri , and , as a matter of convenience , was placed under the jurisdiction of the governor of Indiana , in whom all necessary powers had been vested . The governor at that time was General William H. Harrison , and by him the government was organized and put in motion , in a manner most creditable to him and satisfactory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rrer .. ritory , the legislative power being vested in a governor and three judges . In 1812 , an act of Congress gave it its present name , and transferred the legislative function to a General Assembly . In 1820 , a State government was formed , a constitution being established on the 19th day of July , of that year . An Act of Congress , passed after a well-known protracted debate , gave Missouri admission to the Union on the 2nd day of March , 1821 . From the period of the transfer of Louisiana to the jurisdiction of the United States , the country , which heretofore had been slowly settled , and by people of little enterprise , had begun to be very rapidly filled up . A new population then came in , and a new aspect was given to every thing . The laws began to be more fixed and better understood , and their administration to be more impartial . The settlements , after the lapse of a few years , became more * " It is believed by many , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolished by an act of the General Assembly , on the 14th of January , 1816 , which adopts the common law and British statutes as the law of the territory . But the words of that act are , which common law and statutes are not contrary to the laws of this territory . ' The laws of this territory embrace the Spanish laws , not inconsistent with the acts of Congress in relation thereto , ' altered , modified , and repealed as they had been by preceding legislatures . If , then , the Spanish laws were , previous to this act , a part of the law of the territory , it follows , that the common law and British statutes control only those cases , where the Spanish law , restricted and modified , and the acts of the legislature , had been silent .

The original French inhabitants were , indeed , not much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were made , suddenly , very rich ; but the quiet and peaceful lives of the majority were sadly disturbed . In general , they could not sympathize with the schemes , nor compete with the enterprise , of the new comers , and were , therefore , soon thrown into a painful obscurity . For a long time after the introduction of American authorities , they mourned bitterly over the innovations , which , however useful , their unambitious minds could not regard as improve-. ments . What was their loss , however , was the country 's gain . Notwithstanding several severe checks to immigration , the population rapidly increased . The late war , for a time , effectually repressed the progress of the country , and many settlements , as those of Boon 's Lick and Salt River , were entirely broken up . But peace was no sooner declared , than crowds of emigrants , chiefly from Kentucky , Tennessee , and the Carolinas , began to cross the Mississippi ; and , in the year 1817 , the population of Missouri was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the French alone , who had cause to lament the occupation of Missouri by the Americans . To the Indians it brought the most unhappy consequences . That ill-fated people quickly perceived the change in the policy towards them , introduced by the new government . So long as they had none but the French to deal with , they were generally pacific . They had few causes of complaint , and no wrongs to avenge , and they very seldom raised the tomahawk against their white neighbours . With the exception of a few instances of inroad for the sake of plunder , the settlements remained undisturbed . The French , it is well known , have always pursued an indulgent policy towards the Indians . But , no sooner do the English or Americans come near them , than war and massacres begin . So it was in Missouri . The Americans had scarcely taken possession of that country , before causes of contention were found ; the fierce passions of the Indians were aroused , and but little pains taken to appease them ; the border warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war with England commenced , many of the tribes were ready to give her that assistance , which she has never been backward to ask , or scrupulous to use . The years // from 1811 to 1814 , inclusive , witnessed many bloody contests , in different parts of the State . The enterprise of Tecumseh , to excite a general Indian war , was attended with partial success ; but some of the principal tribes held back , and the determined measures of the government soon quelled the disturbances . Ports were built at several important points on the Missouri and il*v1ississippi ; and , after the year 1814 no further contests ensued , except such as were immediately , and without much bloodshed , decided . The Indians , since that time , have been gradually , but rapidly , receding before the whites . Great numbers of them are yet left in the western parts of the State , and the territory immediately adjacent , from whom trouble is , perhaps not unreasonably , anticipated ; but the day of their strength and prosperity is gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter extinction . Between the years 1817 and 1824 , in consequence of the commercial embarrassments , and the sudden check given to the fever of speculation , in the XVestern States , Missouri made comparatively little progress . But , since then , she has increased very rapidly , both in population and riches . The country is settled by a substantial class of people , chiefly farmers , from the more northern of the slave-holding States . Until recently , they have not exhibited the same degree of public spirit and enterprise , that is found in some others of the Western States ; but they have now awakened to the necessity of internal improvements , and several important works are projected or advancing . Education , for which ample provision has been made by law , is also beginning to receive the attention which it deserves . The natural resources of this State are unusually varied and great . Its most remarkable feature is its mineralogical wealth . Almost every county in the State contains mines of some kind or other , many of which are naparalleled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found iron , lead , copper , copperas , chalk , black-lead , brimstone , coal , freestone , limestone , millstones , resembling the Piench buhr , and some indications of silver and gold ; most of them in very large quantities . The nitrate of potash , or saltpetre , occurs in several caverns on the Merrimac and Current Rivers , in great abundance ; also upon the Gasconade , a hundred miles west of St. Louis . Salt springs are // found in almost every part of the State . Compact limestone is very abundant . It constitutes the basis rock at St. Louis , where it answers a valuable purpose as a building material . It is of a grayish blue color , and contains many fossil remains . Chalk has been discovered on the banks of the INlississippi , but in what quantities we do not know . Sulphate of lime , or gypsum , exists in great abundance . It is found on the Kansas River , the cliffs of which often consist of solid strata of this mineral ; also in Jackson County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is found , effloresced , in a cave in Bellevue , Washington County . Buhr stone , said to be equal to the French , is in great abundance on the Osage and Gasconade Rivers . Potters ' clay has been discovered , of the best quality , on the right bank of the Mississippi , about forty miles above the junction of the Ohio , and extending for thirty-four miles up the river . The stratum varies in thickness from one to ten feet , rests on sandstone , and is covered by shell limestone , containing well characterized nodules and veins of flint . It is also found , ten feet below the surface , at Gray 's Mine , Jefferson County , where it is snow-white , unctuous , becomes plastic by mixture with water , and is infusible at a very high heat . Red chalk is found in Washington County . Several springs in the vicinity of Herculaneum , and one near St. Louis , are highly impregnated wit* sulphur , which is deposited on the stones , over which the water runs , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is found in St. Louis , Howard , Cooper , Boon , Monroe , Saline , Lafayette , Casconade , and almost all the counties of the State . Sulphuret of zinc is found , associated wirh sulphuret of lead , at the mines in Washington , Jefferson , and St. Fran*ois Counties . Oxyde of manganese and sulphuret of antimony have both been discovered in Washington County and on the Merrimac . But the great mineral wealth of Missouri is in its mines of copper , lead , and iron . We are not informed of any copper mines in the State , which are in actual operation but the existence of the mineral , in great quantities , has been ascertained beyond question . We have seen several beautiful specimens , brought from different parts of the State , one of which , found in Washington County , almost upon the surface of the ground , was the richest that we have // 523 ever seen . The lead mines of the State are better known . They are found , to the greatest extent , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison , and Jefferson , and also on the Osage River . Some of them have been worked for seventy years . Those in Washington County are thus described by the " Missouri Gazetteer . " " Potosi is situate about the centre of the mineral region and there are upwards of seventy-five lead mines now open and actually occupied within sixteen miles of the town , at which are engaged about five hundred hands in mining , though a great number have gone from this county to Fever River , Merrimac , and other mines , within the last two years . It is impossible to enumerate all the mines in Washington , for the whole county is , as it were , one vast mine . The mineral obtained here by the first process of smelting produces from sixty-five to seventy per cent. , and by the second process about fifteen , making , in all , about eighty-five per cent . of clear , good lead . These five hundred hands raise about five million pounds of lead annually , which , at twenty-five or thirty dollars per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 300 dollars to the hand . " These are probably the richest beds of ore in the State , but new discoveries of them , or of indications of their presence , are every year made , in different places , and probably not one half of them are yet known . The iron mines are , however , the most remarkable . Some of these are so rich and so unprecedented in their character , that the descriptions of them are almost incredible , and seem like fabulous stories . Washington , St. Fran*ois , and Madison Counties , which are adjacent to each other , contain enough iron to supply the world , for ages to come . " The Iron Mountain , as it is commonly called , in the southeast corner of Washington County , is one of the most remarkable curiosities in the world . It is about one mile broad at the base , three hundred and fifty or four hundred feet high , and three miles long , literally covered with a bright , shining ore , having every appearance of metal which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ore is in pieces of a pound weight or more , and , as you approach the apex of the hill , the pieces increase in size , to thousands of tons weight , until they assume the appearance of huge rocks , presenting to the astonished beholder a spectacle which can not be described ; and those large masses are of a quality surpassing any // thing of the kind heretofore known to the world . Six miles south , in Madison County , is another mountain , larger than the one above , known in this county by the name of the Pilot Knob . ' It is entirely covered with iron ore , in huge masses , larger and more abundant than the former . " Besides these iron mountains , all the hills of that district contain great quantities of ore . That whole tract of country is a vast bed of iron . The ore is , besides , remarkably pure . That from the " mountains " does not need to undergo any intermediate process , but may be wrought without being smelted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore , with an exquisite polish and a fine edge . We need not speak of the immense value of such mines as these . They are worth an hundred times more than all the gold and silver of Mexico . We should remark , however , that they are perfectly accessible , and that their treasures may be brought into the market at as small an expense as the nature of the commodity admits . They are situated only about forty miles from the Mississippi , arid but seventy from St. Louis , to which city a railroad is now in contemplation . An abundance of stone coal has lately been discovered in their vicinity , and the whole district abounds with water power . It will not be many years before their wealth is poured into St. Louis , and thence throughout the whole land . They render it certain , that Missouri must , at no very distant day , become one of the most important manufacturing States in the Union . Except in the mineral districts , which are , in general , comparatively barren , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very varied in its nature , so as to be adapted to a great variety of productions . The northern counties contain large tracts of excellent land , calculated for hemp and flax . Cotton is cultivated , although not to such advantage as in Mississippi and other southern States . Tobacco is raised in large quantities , and of the best quality . All the varieties of grain and grasses yield abundant crops . Garden vegetables grow to great perfection . Fruit trees , of all the kinds which belong to temperate climates , are successfully cultivated , and the fruit is at least equal to that in the eastern States . The timber includes almost all the valuable and ornamental varieties of the temperate zone . There are extensive pine forests on the Gasconade and Merrimac rivers . The facilities for raising stock are great , and farmers // direct their attention very much to this branch of their business . There are many parts of the State , consisting of rocky points and broken sections of country , which seem peculiarly fitted for sheep-pastures , and hold out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the agriculturist can hardly go amiss , to whatever he turns his attention . There is not , perhaps , so large a body of rich land as in some other States , but there is so favorable an alternation of prairie and hilly country , of meadow and woodland , that it is all rendered valuable . The State is throughout well watered . Mill sites and water power are found almost wherever they are needed . The Missouri River passes through the richest agricultural portion of the State , and is navigable for steamboats twentyfive hundred miles from its mouth . It has almost innumerable tributaries , which , together with those of the Mississippi , irrigate every part of the State . The Osage river is one of the most considerable . it enpties into tile Missouri , ten miles helow Jefferson City , and is navigable for moderate-sized boats , for several hundred miles . The ( Jasconade is also a very important river , falling into the Missouri a hundred miles from its mouth , and passing through a very fertile and well-timbered country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salubrious . Like that of all North America , it is very changeable , and subject to extremes of heat and cold ; but it is , we think , decidedly milder , if we take the whole year through , than that of the same latitudes east of the mountains . We are aware that , in this opinion , we differ from a greater part of the authorities upon the subject of climate in the United States ; but we have had ample means of observation , and we are confident in the conclusion now expressed . We think , that , while the summers are not at all more oppressive than they are in the corresponding latitudes on and near the Atlantic coast , the winters are shorter , and , with the almost universal exception of a few weeks of severe weather in February , very much milder . We are sure , that we have never witnessed , in any eastern city , a continuance of such beautiful weather , in the months of November , December , and January , as we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except the first half of March , is almost uniformly delightful . // In point of healthiness , this State will bear a favorable comparison with the other western States . It is not , of course , free from the diseases to which all newly settled countries are subject , such as " fever and ague , " the desease which undermines many a strong constitution , and which , although not dangerous in itself , prepares the way for more fatal disorders . But , in most respects , the whole State may be considered healthy . The disease alluded to is generally confined to the borders of the rivers , and may be avoided by proper care . The waters of the Missouri , and of most of its trihutaries , in consequence of the nature of the soil that they flow through , are very wholesome , in which respect they are much superior to the Upper Mississippi , the Illinois , and , we think , the Ohio . The Missouri is singularly turbid ; so i*nuch so , that it gives the same character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink its water ; but they soon learn to think it the pleasantest and most refreshing beverage , and to prefer it , when settled , to the clearest spring water . Chemists who have analyzed it declare , that it is entirely free from all hurtful admixtures , which can by no means be said of the water of most of the Western rivers . This circumstance , of course , exerts a highly favorable influence on the health of the State . Very exaggerated reports have gone abroad , of the prevalence and fatality of the bilious fever . It is certainly the most fatal disease of the region , but moderate caution and foresight are sufficient to guard against it , and it never assumes an epidemic character . The freedom from consumption and its train of kindred disorders , of which there are hardly any cases in Missouri , is more than a set-off to all the diseases which are peculiar to that section of the country . Could we proceed to speak of the commercial advantages of the State , we should be led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the mouth of Columbia River and the lEast Indies , which , if ever established , will be a source of immense wealth to the whole lATest , and especially to Missouri . But for this we have , at present , no room . What we have said may be of some avail , to show the inducements which the State offers to immigrants , and the importance which it is destined , at no remote day , to assume.
