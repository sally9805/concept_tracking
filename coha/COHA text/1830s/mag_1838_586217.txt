txt THE question has been recently mu h agitated in our literary ircles , of the propriety of extending  --  the protection to literary property afforded by our existing law of copyright , to foreign , as well as to native and resident , authors ; in other words , of establishing by reciprocal legislation with foreign nations-having especial reference , of course , to Engla d  --  a system of " International Copyright . " The impulse which first set this ball in motion , ' was derived from a petition to that effect addressed to Congress , in February , 1837 , by not less than fifty-six of the most eminent authors of that country , backed by a few American authors and writers of one sort or another , co curring in the appeal urged by the former upon the liberality and justice of our Government . It was , of course , - perfectly proper and natural for the popular authors of England  --  to address such an appeal to our Government . For widely distinct in nationality , and dista A in geographical longitide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a common vernacular , the general diffusion of-education , and the rapidly progressive increase of population and wealth , on our side of the broad Atlantic , would of course make it a very desirable object for English authors to reap the benefit of the American market in the circulation of their writings . There could at any rate be no harm in the request and he attempt . As for the American signers to the petition , however , - they would have better at the same time consulted their own interests , and discharged their devoir to the cause of American literature , as representatives of which they appear on the occasion , by directing the attention of the Government and the public to the real radical vice in our legislatioa on the subject of literary property ,  - -  which is , our i perfect recognitio of the re lity and sanctity of that specie-s of property . It is in fact entirely reversing the natural succession of ideas and of legislation , for English and American authors to unite in applying for an international copyright law , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we freely confess , are paramount to any considerations of expediency and selfish interests ,  --  while at the same time neither country recognizes in its legislation the very principle of property on which this appeal to our disinterested and self-sacrificing equity is based . * Remarks on Literary Property . By Philip H. Nicklin , A. M. , &amp;c . Philadelphia . Nicklin &amp; Johnson , 1838 . A Plea for Authors , and the Rights of Literary Property . By an American . New York . Adland &amp; Saunders , 1838 . VOL . II . NO. vII. - JUNE . T // Let our neighbour remove the beam from her own eye , before cry .. ing out against the mote which she sees in ours . Let us ourselves , if we are prepared to admit the principle at all , admit it frankly as a vital and governing principle , to reform the whole body of our legislation on the subject , instead of merely making a partial and doubtful application of it at the expense of a clear tax upon our own reading public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our gates , ' but thousands of miles distant frum our shores . The grievance eomplained of is simply , that foreign authors receive no pecuniary benefit for the republication of their writings in this country . In the absence of any copyright restriction , the freedom of competition among our publishers gives us the benelit of the earliest possible publication , at the cheapest possible price , of the best productions of the British press , that is to say , of all such as are adapted to our public taste , possessing that intrinsic vitality of merit which can alone give them circulation . Our reprints are certainly astonishingly cheap , in comparison with the English prices of the originals . This is not derived solely , though it is , of course , in a considerable degree , from the absence of a copyright tax for the benefit of the author . The effect of the monopoly which in point of fact exists among the magnates of the trade ' in London , is at least equally influential in keeping up the high scale of prices of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consideration of their usual superior mechanical elegance , to adapt them to the more limited , but more wealthy classes on which they depend for their circulation . The question is now whether we shall take the gifts the gods provide us , ' and continue to enjoy the advantage of this cheap use of the cream of the literature of our mother country , or magnanimously consent to pay a gratuitous copyright tax to the British author , as an offering of trans-Atlantic liberality , in addition to the remuneration which he receives from his publishers or the public at home . It is a question purely of magnanimity , of volunteer justice and generosity ; and while this is the only real ground on which the application rests , we acknowledge it to be the highest and strongest on which it could be placed . The argumentum ad lb inem addressed to our national self-interest , in the eighth clause of the petition , we dismiss as futile in itself , and , though rather specious and insidious , as calculated , when fairly examined , to prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put forward , that American authors are injured , and the formation of a national literature impeded , by the circulation of cheap English books ,  --  the cost of copyright , to be paid to the American writer , operating as a bounty on the foreign importation , and as a comparative tax on the native production . Even if such were the case , we should certainly be little more disposed to favor a literary protective tariff , to fostex // artificially a domestic manufacture at the expense of a general taxation of the reading public , than in the case of cotton and woollen cloths . If a better literature , books more acceptable to the public taste , can be furnished cheaper by the present system , certainly , if we admit into the inquiry no other consideration than that of expediency , we see no adequate reason to change it . But it is an entire mistake to imagine that its operation is injurious to the formation of a national literature . It might as well be pretended , that the importation of splendid balleries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a gratuitous or very cheap access to them afforded to the public at large , would be injurious to the cultivation of American art . Its operatior* is directly the reverse . The present cheapness of books places them within the reach of hundreds of thousands to whom they would otherwise be inaccessible ; and while it extends indefinitely the limits , it at the same time , by such exercise , vastly improves the taste , of what is commonly termed the reading public . ' Certainly the creation of so broad and sound a basis for the support of a literature of domestic production , by the multiplication of the number of readers , and the cultivation of their literary taste , is not a very direct way to discourage a national literature . Its effect tends rather to raise the standard of taste by which authors write and the public reads , stimulating the former to exertion by the influence of example and emulation , and at the same time enriching the soil from which they have to reap . There is no difficulty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever discouragement may proceed from the influence of our habitual subserviency to British criticism and British example , or from other causes , it is not chargeable to the competition of cheap British republications . The public understand the cause of the necessary difference of price to cover the cost of copyright to the American author ; and , for a book worth reading , are very little disposed to be niggardly in paying it . Certainly the difference of a few shillings in price is more than compensated by the influence of national pride in an American literature ,  --  by the interest in American subjects , on which foreigners are incompetent to write ,  --  and by the increased exertions of the press in behalf of American works , proceeding both from these causes , and from the intimate relationship naturally subsisting between our literary classes and the newspaper press . Again , it should be borne in mind , that the very freedom of competition among our booksellers , in the republication of foreign works of popular interest , necessarily reduces their profits on them down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a price calculated to yield a few cents per volume above a fair remunerating profit for the investment of capital and superintendence , presto , it is supplanted in the market in " twenty-two hours , " by a rival edition , bringing // the price down again to that minimun level . It is manifestly , therefore , the interest of the publisher , as is remarked by Mr. Nicklin in the little volume now before us , and it is his preference and his practice , to invest his capital in American copyright books , in the exclusive sale of which he enjoys legal protection , whenever such as will sell are offered to him . There need be no fear of a want of readers , of an ample public support and patronage , whenever American writers shall obey the impulses of American thoubht and feeling , and embody and utter the free workings of the American mind ,  --  - in harmony with the genius of our national institutions and character , and with the free spirit of the age , which we see in every direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new era in the world 's history . If our literature is now languishing , nerveless , and feebly imitative , it is to other causes that we must look for an explanation of the fact , than to the rivalry of cheaper English books , and to other means for its remedy than to an International Copyright Law . ' To return then to the thread of our former remarks ,  --  the present appeal addresses itself solely to our high and refined liberality , and calls upon us to make a great sacrifice , both of the public convenience , in the widely diffused enjoyment and benefit of cheap books , and of the interests of a very extensive and flourishing branch of trade , involvin* from thirty to fifty millions of money , and several hundred-thou. ands of persons ,  --  without even professing to offer any equivalent in exchange . If the proposed reform is consummated , it will certainly be the first time that international relations have been adjusted , by high-minded statesmen , on this pure , magnanimous principle of action-this exemplification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the old diplomacy of the quid pro quo , for the sanction of universal usage , and for the example of the very nation from which the present appeal proceeds , in other branches of her legislation on this same subject , and others of a kindred nature . It is true that it is proposed that the operation of the law shall be reciprocal , American authors enjoying in England the same privileges asked at our hands for British authors . It is unnecessary for us. however , to waste time in illustrating the notorious truth , that in practice this reciprocity would be like that of the Irish Ambassador , reciprocal all on one side . Now we do freely and reverently admit thefiatjustitiaruatcwlum principle , as the true basis of national morality , greatness , and happiness . Be justice done though the heavens fall ! In the conduct of the aggregate millions which constitute the nation , as in the relations of the individual units , honesty is the best policy ; and such is the wonderful harmony between the moral and physical constitutions of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a // right in policy , on a comprehensive view of real and enlightened principles of self-interest , however fair-seerni g the temptations of an immediate expediency . Would to God , indeed , that nations would but trust themselves to this principle , more freely than they do or dare , in the reform of the manifold evils and abuses by which they are afflicted from of old , without the perpetual restraint of motives of expediency , and alarm for the privileges of existing selfish interests , always clamorous for their own perpetuation ! If our present laws on this subject involve a violation of a natural right of property of the foreign author , unaffected by the consideration of distinct nationality and the distance of an ocean , in heaven 's name let that plague-spot of moral wrong be cleansed out . Let us go and sin no more , however seeming pleasant and profitable the fruits of the unlawful indulgence . And let us , by so noble a sacrifice of interest on the altar of justice , set an example to the other nations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of democratic truth . But in thus hastening on by our example the gradual march of the nations of the earth towards the millenium of the reign of universal love , peace , truth , virtue , and happines , let us proceed wisely and calmly ,  --  above all , consistently ; for the greatest truth is the harmony of all truths . A too rash and partial precipitation in well-doing is scarcely less to be deprecated than the opposite cxreme of obstinate adherence to evil . What then is the principle of right on which the present appeal to our liberality L founded ? It is the sacred principle of property ,  --  the original , inherent , and inviolable right of ownership in the productions of intellectual labor , alleged to exist independently of civil institutions , and of territorial divisions of human society . This is the ground , and no other , on which our national honor is invoked on the present occasion to extend to English authors the privilege of American Copyright . It is certainly a very singular fact in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by universal admission , the great paramount ruling power which has swayed at will the destinies of men and of nations , the very class who have worked that mighty engine of influence ,  --  the thinkers and writers who have poured forth their own minds and infused them into their fellow men , till they have animated and directed the action of the whole social mass ,  --  has been perhaps the most heavily burthened and afflicted class of society . What a reproach and a wonder at the same time that this sad proverbial truth has even grown into the tritest of commonplaces . They have been the only class in whose behalf the principle of sacred and inviolable property in the productions of their own self-impelled and original intellectual labor , and the right to a proportionate compensation for the benefit and // enjoyment imparted to others , has not been recognized and protected by the collective will of society embodied in the Law . It is , indeed7 a truth full of sadness , impressing itself strongly and most painfully on the mind of the student of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social evil , vitally pernicious though too deeply seated to be tangibly felt and appreciated , which has flowed , directly or indirectly , from this principle of moral wrong7 no human imagination can ever conceive the faintest idea ,  --  arising out of the abuse or prostitution of genius , whose action is upon the very heart-springs of society , and from the number of noble minds deterred from devoting their heaven-inspired energies to their natural mission of the instructi a and improvement of their kind While they have worked the social machine , which has protected the rights , and fostered by encouraging laws and institutions the prosperity and happiness of others , th&amp;r own almost invariable lot has been one of oppressed and plundered poverty , and the veriest dregs of misery ,  --  tenfold more bitter to their peculiar constitution and temperament than to common men . The remedy of this wrong , more pregnant perhaps with evil th n any of the other many vicious institutions existing in every society , i , in our opinion , one of the most important reforms now called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of FROPERTY is the key-stone of the arch of society . It is the first , deepest , and most sacred , of the principles of social order and law-those at least which are purely human in their nature and relations . It is a natural and original principle and not a mere artificial creation of law , as is erroneously pretended by some few writers . The right of property in the creations of original individual effort ,  --  inviolable and perpetual , and transmissible by the will of the owner-is unquestionably a *atural moral right , antecedent and superior to legislation ; being the object and motive of social union , rather than its effect and consequence . The tiller of the earth moisteas the ground with the sweat of his brow ; and with the fatigue of his whole frame , and the devotion of the pleasant hours of life from the rising to the setting of the sun , calls forth into existence out of the dull clod healthful food for the sustenance of man 's body ,  --  will any one question his original and perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his industry ? And shall we deny the right of ownership , equally perfect and absolute , of the author to the ' creations of his intellectual labor ,  --  by which he calls forth into tangible existence and visible presence before the eyes of all men , out of the illimitable domain of unexplored truth and unexpressed thought , that spiritual food which is not less necessary to the mental , than the former is to the physical , constitution of man ? In no point of view can the two cases be compared , in which the right of the latter will not * // pear , to the most rigid analysis , while of a superior order in kind , at least equally absolute and perfect in degree , with that of the former ,  --  whether we regard the perpetual benefit conferred upon society by the author of a rood book ; the laborious devotion of mental , combined with even physical , effort ,  --  and the original , individual character of that effort ; the waste of energy , health , and time expended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro&amp;uct , be it poem , history , essay , or romance ; its exchangeable value , susceptible of being regulated by the ordinary laws of economy ; the peculiar characteristics of that class of men-martyrs , in their dealings with their f how men , to that very constitution and - temperament which makes them the highest benefactors of society ; and finally  --  the point of view of the greatest utilitarian importance-the necessity of secure and permanent protection in their natural right of property , to encourage the best kinds of production , o induce the highest o ders of mu ds to devote themselves freely to a life of literary and philosophical labor , and-in the leisure of personal ease , permitting the indulgence of all their healthful natural affections a-nd sympathies  --  to utter all that is in them , and to mature a d perfect its expression ,  --  to the full extent of their powers . And yet , what is the principle which we find pervading the legislation , on this subject , of both England and our own country-the two particularly under consideration t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the full and proper sense of the word . That it is simply a sort of monopoly privilege or bonus , granted for a mere term of years , by legislative grace , for the encouragement of - authors . What language would - be adequate to utter the abhorrence with x hich the proposal would be received , to make a beneral agrarian division of every other species of property , for the benefit of the public at large , at the end of every period of fourteen or twenty-eight years ? Yet when the author , at the expiration , of such a term sees himself despoiled of his property-the value of which is perhaps just beginning to become settled and Rvailable-on which he has expended his toil , his time , his talents , and perhaps his health  --  and sees the same gratuitously thrown open to the public , at the mere - cost of the mechanical processes of the printer and the commercial profits of the bookseller , the voice of complaint is mute ; or if perhaps feebly heard in private from some helpless victim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reaping its fruit . The argum nts are exceedingly flimsy and futile by which we ecasionally hear the attempt made to defend this palpably unjust , and equally unwise , system of literary agrarianism . They are in fact scarcely worth even the brief notice which we shall bestow on them . The real support of the system is  --  to be found only in the *aet ef  --  the helplessness of the class injured ,  --  in the selfish indifference // of men to the oppression which they imagine ( most shortsighted error ! ) profitable to themselve as promoting cheap prices ,  --  and in the vis nertice of habit . It is sometimes , for instance , pretended , that the author abandons* his exclusive right of property by the act of publication . But this act is only the peculiar mode of using his property beneficially * the benefit being , like the blessing of mercy , a ' double one , both to him that gives and him that takes . The benefit of ' the author is proportionate to the diffusion of the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over the exclusive possession and enjoyment of most other kinds of property , a characteristic uhich ought to invest it with a ' double sanctity , on motives equally of public policy and public j stice . It might as well be pretended that the proprietor of a theatre loses his right of ownership in the establishment and " properties , " by the admissioti of the public ,  --  or the o'wner of ' a splendid painting , by its public ' exhibition . In the second place , it is said , that the proper meed and reward of literary effort is fame , and , that the addition of pecuniary incentive is calculated to degrade its objects , to unner e its inspired vigor , and to dim the halo of its glory . Though this objection has been gravely advanced from the English Bench , it does not deserve ' at this day a serio s reply . Alas that the only two classes of worlcersf for the benefit of mankind to whose treatment this cruelly politic principle is applied , of keeping them in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should be cats and authors*-the two extremes-on the one part , of brute instinct , on the most minute scale ' of domestic life , to rid us of rats and mice-and , * on the other , of human intellect , in its sublime and universal mission , for the investigation of all truth , the cultivation ' of all knowledge , arid the developement of that divine germ , struggling ever towards the light of a future indefinite progress of perfectibility , of the existence of which deep.buried within him every human being ' has at times a certain consciousness ,  --  dimly but yearningly prophetic of ' the truth . Or again it is objected , that this exclusive right of publication is a monopoly ; and if granted for a limited term , for the peculiar benefit and encouragement of authors , ought certainly not to be made perpetual . If copyright is a m'on'opol'y , ' every species of propertyr created or acquired by labor is equally liable to the name ; and this ' reason would be equally valid in favor of cancelling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and permitting free entry and seizure ad cvrbitrium to the first comer , or to the public at large . *Agrarianism , ' in the sense of disregard to the sanctity of the ' principle of property , is one of the courteous epithets with which the political school in which we belong is commonly assailed by its // opponents . We are certainly no friends to restrictive legislation , and the creation of partial interests and so-called vested rights , in derogation of the high and holy principle of equality of rights ; we should be glad , however , in the present case , where the sacred principle of true , rightful , natural property is distinctly involved , if those who thus assail us would vie with us in redeeming it from its long abused state of contempt and violation . Another objection is , that property in ideas is an impossibility , inasmuch as they are not only in their nature universal and common to the whole world , the germ of all existing in every individual mind , but they are intangible abstractions , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion of the claims of others who may have an equal right of original conception . This vindication of the denial to authors of their right of perfect and absolute property in their works , is very absurd , though we have known it urged from very respectable quarters . Every thing having an exchangeable value , whether material or immaterial , is wealth , and is of course susceptible of the right of property . This idea is very ably illustrated in Professor Vethake 's recent work on Political Economy which we intend to make the subject of an early review . The privilege of multiplying copies of a book for which there exists a public demand , and of affording to those who are willing to pay a price , susceptible of precise calculation , an opportunity for the possession and enjoyrlient of it , is a valuable property fulfilling all the conditions necessary to entitle it to the same protection extended to every other species of property in that which possesses exchangeable value , derived from its adaptation to gratify the wants and desires , whether physical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , the beasts of the wild , or the birds of the air , are insusceptible of a right of property , yet the capture of the prey by human toil and skill , which may be said to be its creation , for all useful purposes , generates simultaneously an absolute right of property which no one can justly call in question . And so of the universal common domain of thought and imagination . The free community of right , possessed by every human mind , of roaming at larbe throughout its immensity of space , and of uttering , to all who will listen , what it has there seen and felt , is in no respect affected by an exclusive right of property in books . The peculiar combina*Thn and arrangement of ideas , images , and sentiments , and their expression to the eyes and ears of other men ,  - -  in a peculiar manner , *hrough the medium of language , every word of which in its proper place , and every turn of style , is the result and evidence of individeal labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist before , for any useful purpose , but is now made visible and serviceable in a local habitation and a name ; and it is precisely such a creation , by individual labor and skill , benefi // cml to the general interests of mankind , as is naturally attended by a right of property , as absolute and perfect as that right can ever exist . The same elemental materials remain always of course at the free use of any who may choose to recombine and reutter them in their own way ; and indirect , and often unconscious , imitation can neither be prevented , nor does it affect the present question . The objection of its not being susceptible of definition , for the purpose of legal protection as exclusive property , is sufficiently refuted , both by a moment 's reflection upon the distinct oneness of any particular work , of whatever department of literature , peculiar in all its parts and peculiar as a whole in their combination ,  --  and also by the fact that such protection , as we here contend should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years by our present laws , and enforced without difficulty , during that period , by the intelligence of judges and juries . But the principal ground on which this agrarian ' injustice to authors is sought to be defended is this ,  --  that , whatever may be the abstract justice of the case , the general policy of society so strongly dictates that books should be open to all the world , without liability to the caprice or exorbitance of private owners , that the former consideration ought to , and must , yield to the suprema lex of the general good . This argument would lead with equal force to consequences utterly subversive of that entire system of social order Which is based on the fundamental idea of property . It is an application of that pernicious principle , of the consecration of the means by the end , which is the mother of all evil . Moreover , as before remarked , it is pracmically not less unwise in policy , than unjust in moral equity . It would net diminish the quantity , nor impede the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only improve their quality . There is no ( langer of good books being withheld from circulation by caprice or exorbitance . The principles of self-interest and competition are unerring in their operation , if legislation would only trust them freely . The proprietors of copyright will never allow the field which they may possess to run to waste for want of cultivation . The public demand will alxvays command the full supply which it desires ; while exorbitance of price in the latter will nlways defeat , and thus rectify , 4-itself , both by discouraging consumption , and by calling into existence rival productions of similar character , anJ of merit probably improved by the benefit of the former model . It may xvdll be doubted whether books would be in general any more expensive than at present . An immense saving of useless production would be effected , by diminishing the publicatieu of such worthless trash as now constitutes four-fifths of the literature of the day . ' This saving would enure to the benefit c-1 ' literary men of real desert . More good books would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , and the latter less , extensively read ; and in that state of things it may be questioned whether the obvious policy , to both authors and publishers , of multiplying their circulation in a geometrical , by the diminution of price in an arithmetical , ratio , which is now becoming perfectly well understood in the trade , would not have the effect of even diminishing the present general scale of prices ; while justice would be done to literary men , and a new era would dawn upon their present oppressed and really degraded condition . We are , then , in favor of the recognition of the absolute right of property in copyright , by placing it on a footing of equality with other descriptions of property . It is just in equity , and therefore wise in policy . It is perfectly sound in principle , and therefore can not but prove safe in practice . It will produce at the same time a very beneficial effect on the well-being and social condition of the literary class , and exert a very salutary influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the healthful developement of national character and civilization , which receives its direction and tone from the popular literature of the times . This fundamental truth should not be lost sight of ,  - -  that no institution can flourish , and no class of men can exist in a healthy state ,  --  whether for their own well-being , or in their relations with the rest of society so as to develope fully all the useful functions which they are naturally calculated to exercise ,  --  in which the principle of sanctity of property is infringed upon in the slightest degree , by the short-sighted " expediency " of artificial legislation . This is the cause to which may be traced the general flimsy and ephemeral character of the literature of the times , both in England and this country . Few men devote themselves , in the right and worthy spirit , to literature as a profession . With all it is a mere elegant accessory to other more important avocations , except in the case of that ill-starred class of desultory scribblers for bread who spin out their daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of starvation , to flatter the ruling caprice of public taste , and catch as she flies the Cynthia of the minute . ' Those men of eminent intelligence and virtue who are the natural instructors and guides of society in the career of civilization , through the press , are deterred by this oppressive discouragement from the proper discharge of that nobly arduous duty , and are compelled to leave it to take care of itself , in the hands of an inferior order of minds , whose ill-directed and desultory efforts probably do much more harm than good . Or if they do occasionally write , it is under such disadvantage , from the pressure of poverty , and the necessity of addressing themselves to the exigency of the hour and the popular taste of the day , without time to develope and mature what is within them-having no lasting property in their works to consti // tute a provision for age , and transmissible like other property to their children-that society reaps but a small proportion of the good which it ought to derive from their labors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms that could be made by enlightened and liberal legislation . It ought not to be longer delayed ; and the example of its introduction would be eminently worthy of the generally liberal character of our institutions . It is not often that we are in favor of a new restrictive law . We should be glad to see all the natural energies of society relieved from the worse than useless fetters of a great proportion of those now in operation . rrhe protection of natural rights of person and property , on the sublimely simple idea of Jefferson , ought to be the sole end and aim of law . But although , on the pure theory of philosophical democracy , it ought never to transcend this limit , on the delusive idea of encouraging particular interests , vet , within that limit , the essential object of protection ought to be perfectly and absolutely secured , justice being d'one to each by impartiality to all . At any rate , while we hold in such implicit reverence all artificial vested rights , which are not unfrequently iniquitous in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their continuance , we certainly ought not to refuse to recognize and protect those absolute natural rights of property , which are founded on the best original title , production by individual labor , and are at the same time in perfect harmony with the wisest policy and the best interests of all classes of society . The present state of legislation on this subject , in the different civilized countries of the world , may be thus briefly summed up . In France , by the Code , the exclusive " usufruct " or copyright is possessed by the author for the term of his own life , and extends to his children for twenty years after his death . This was a modification engrafted by Napoleon , in 1810 , upon the law of the National Convention , in 1793 , which extended the right to the author 's heirs for ten years after his death ; on which Mr. Nicklin thus quaintly remarks ,  --  " thus showing the sincerity of his celebrated answer to Madame De Stael , when she asked him what woman deserved most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest number of children . ' This law is more unequal than that of the Convention , for a multitude of persons die without children , where one dies without heirs ; and perhaps in altering the law , Napoleon had it as much in view to encourage the multiplication of soldiers as of books . It certainly holds out but small encouragement for a bachelor to write a book , as publishers will not give much for property held by so slight a tenure as a single life ; and such an author would not be able to compete with the father of a family in the sale of his literary ware " The Russian law is more liberal , extending the right to the // author 's heirs for twenty-five years after his death . In Norway and Sweden it is perpetual . With respect to Germany , this subject has been one of more important national interest than to any other country ,  --  the production and circulation of books being much greater among that profoundly reflective and philosophical people than am*ng any other . The want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complaint among German authors as early as the time of the Reformation . The invention of the art of printing was the forerunner of that immense event in the progress of human emancipation , and contributed essentially to promote its success by facilitating the diffusion of polemical writings . Luther was the great improver of his country 's language , as well as the champion of intellectual freedom . In his famous translation of the Bible he fixed a standard of the modern German idiom , from which it has not sin e greatly deviated . The edition of his works was not exempt from the depredation of the piratical pubushers of his time . lie arraigns their misconduct in his usual vehement and energetic style of invective . CC What means this , my dear printers , that you thus rob and plunder the fruits of another 's labor i What an iniquity that we should toil and sweat to produce these works , and that you should reap the fruits of our labor Your conduct is down-. right robbery , which God will surely punish , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( Luther 's Werke , XI . 34 . ) Under the former constitution of the Germanic empire as it subsisted previous to the French Revolution , the Emperors undertook to suppress this shameless piracy by severe edicts , but their protection only extended to such books as were published by the Imperial license . This furnished them with a pretext to put fetters on the press , which the instinct of despotism taught them was to free mankind from political , as well as ecclesiastical thraldom . The multitude of petty Principalities and States into which the Empire was broken , rendered the protection of uniform copyright laws throughout Ger many essential to secure the property of authors in their literary works . But this protection was dearly bought by placing the press under the inaprimat'ar of Austria , and it could hardly be expected that the Protestant powers would permit their subjects to be thus controlled in the freedom of publication . Hence , the diversity of laws respecting copyright which were easily evaded by piracy and contraband . On the meeting of the Congress at Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booksellers presented a memorial to that body on the necessity of providina more effectual securities for the enjoyment of literary property , as an object of the highest concern to the intellectual cultivation , as well as the commercial interests of Germany . This application was opposedby the piratical booksellers of Vienna , who strenuously sought , by all the unjust and sophistical arguments by which the natural rights of property of // authors have always been contested , to prevent the interference of the Congress in their free trade in the produce of other men 's labor . Their opposition was , however , overruled by that body . Indeed , it could not decently or consistently confer upon the Diet of the Confederation the power of regulating the freedom of the press throughout Germany , without , at the same time , holding out to authors whose publications should be licensed the prospect of protection in the exclusive enjoyment of their literary property . The eighteenth article of the Act of Confederation accordingly provided that " the Diet should , at its first session , take up the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the measures necessary to secure the proprietary rights of authors and publishers . " The Diet was not slow to exercise the first mentioned of these associated powers , but it was only in the year 1818 that it found leisure to take up the subject of copyright , nor was it until the year 1835 that it was at last painfully delivered of a decree which very imperfectly fulfilled the so long deferred hopes of the German authors , artists , and publishers . During the whole of this period of seventeen years , the Prussian Government had been constantly urging the attention of the Diet at Frankfort , to this subject of common concern to Germany . Among a nation of thirty-four millions of population , who have a common language and literature , though divided into thirty-nine different sovereign States-where the most extensive book trade in the world is carried on  --  the establishment of uniform laws for the protection of literary property must be considered an object of the highest social importance . Hitherto the works of Goethe alone had been protected throughout the Confederation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment to the extraordinary genius of that great writer , at the expense of the equal justice due to others perhaps more fairly entitled to be protected in the fruits of their intellectual labor , if we regard the effects *produced by their works upon the moral , political , and intellectual improvement of their countrymen . With this single exception , and that of the very honorable moral protection afforded by the fraternity of bookselhers who carry on their trade at Leipsick , the book trade had been followed with an almost total disregard to the international rights of authors among the different German States ,  --  if the term international can be properly applied to the relations between those States , in any other than a fictitious sense . In respect to foreign authors , who write in any language other than German , this want of protection is a matter of very little practical importance , as very few French or English books ( for example , ) are published in Germany , or at least for exportation and sale in the countries where the original editions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the want of some general protection by uniform laws throughout the Confederation , though it rendered books cheaper in Germany than in any other country , at the same time kept her gifted authors poor , and left them scarcely any other reward than what the passionate love of literature and literary fame necessarily brings in its train . the provision in the thirteenth article of the fundamental act of the Germanic Confederation somewhat resembles that contained in our National Constitution , empowering Congress to make uniform laws for securing to authors and inventors the exclusive property in their writings and inventions throughout the Union . But the Germanic Confederation is not like ours , a Supreme Federal Government , within the sphere of its acknowledged constitutional powers , but only a treaty of alliance for certain purposes between independent States , who retain ( at least in theory , ) all their sovereign rights , including those of internal legislation . So that in exercising a similar power the Germanic Diet is necessarily compelled to rely upon the separate legislation of each separate State of the Confederation , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , of course , leaves to each the concurrent power of legislating on the subject of copyright , so as to give a more effectual security , and for a longer term of time than that prescribed in the regulations of the Diet . Thus by the Federal Decree of 1835 the rights of authors are secured for a term of not less than ten nor more than twenty years throughout the Confederation ; whilst by the Prussian law of seventeenth June , 1837 , the property of an author in his works is secured during his natural life , and to his heirs for thirty years after his decease-so far as respects works published in Prussia , or in other foreign States securing a reciprozal privilege to Prussian authors . It also prohibits the theatrical exhibition of all dramatic works so long as they are not published by printing , without the consent of the author , or his heirs , until ten years after his decease ; and does not forget to extend its protection to musical composition , and to prohibit the multiplication of sculpture by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engravings , &amp;c. , without the consent of the author . So that it far exceeds in liberality , not only the decree of the Diet , but our own law and that of England ; besides being free from those ambiguities which have given rise to so much doubt and perplexity in the execution of the copyright laws , both in the United States , and that country from which we have borrowed our legal institutions . A German author publishing his works in one State is now protected in every State of the Confederation for the limited period provided in the decree of the Diet . After the expiration of that period his protection is confined to the limits of the State wherein he publishes ; and this state of things must continue , unless the Diet should hereafter // extend its protection for a longer period , or unless the other States of Germany should make a similar reciprocal regulation to that contained in the Prussian law . The concluding ( thirty-eighth ) section of this law provides that , " in respect to literary works published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as the rights secured by it are granted by the laws of such foreign State in respect to works published in our dominions . " In other words , it establishes the rule of reciprocity as the guarantee of the proprietary rights of foreign authors in Prussia . This principle has already been made the basis of negotiation by the Prussian government with other German States , which have not yet adopted so liberal a protection as that of Prussia , as well as with other countries foreign to Germany , and to which the protection afforded by the Diet does not extend . Should it be met by corresponding measures on the part of the other German States , is would probably prove an effectual security for the rights of literary property throughout Germany ; whilst the cheapness of paper , printing , and other expenses of publication in that country , would always prevent the printing of German works to any considerable extent in foreign countries . To complete this view of the state of legislation in Germany on this subject , we will remark that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1835 , ) concludes with a provision that " the subject shall be taken up for deliberation again by the Diet of 1842 , unless circumstances should require it to be sooner determined , and shall be considered with a view to the effect produced by the present decree on the progress of the arts and sciences , on the public interest , and that of the trade in books and works of art . " In England the right of property of an author was originally regarded in its true light as absolute and perpetual ; and such continued the practice from the first introduction of the art of printing for two and a half centuries , till the latter part of the eighteenth century ; and it was repeatedly recognized by decrees of the Court of Star Chamber , and by several acts of Parliament . It was not till the Statute of Anne , in the year 1710 , that the idea was first introduced , of any limitation to the perpetuity of copyright . On the Revolution of 1688 the abolition of the censorship of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the refusal of license to piratical republications , threw the proprietors of copyright upon the Common Law alone for their protection and remedies . The sense of insecurity from the sudden cessation of the pains and penalties on the severity of which they had before been accustomed to rely , with the difficulty and uncertainty of the Common Law remedy of an action on the case for damages to be specifically proved , led them to invoke the protection of Parliament , by special statute interposition in their behalf . This unfortunate // step has indeed verified in its eventual result the fable of the horse and the man . An act was passed for the protection of copyright for fourteen years , and no longer ,  --  with an equal extension of the erm if the author should be alive at the expiration of that term . J'his limitation , however , had no practical effect . It appears to have been generally , regarded as only supplying more efficient means of protection for the terms thus limited , and not as detracting from the Common Law rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the statutory terms by the Common Law remedies . such continued the general construction of the law until 1769 vhen th' celebrated case of Miliar ( proprietor of the copyright of Thomson 's Seasons , ) versus Taylor ( who had pirated an edition , about thirty-five years after the date of the original publication ) settled the law diffurently . Three of the four judges of the King 's Bench ( the gie t Lord Mansfield , with Judges Willes and Aston ) aecided in favor of the plaiatiff ,  --  Judge Yates alone dissenting ; but n an appeal to the I-louse of Lords , this ju. t and liberal decision vas rev rsed , and the strict letter of the Statute of Anne " and no longer , " was construed as superseding , by the special protection afforded for a limited term , the beneral Common Law right of proerty in perpetuity . The perpetual copyright was , however , preserved , hy special cts passed shortly after , to the Universities of Engla A and Scotland , and the three great public schools of Eton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state another very oppressive feature of the Statute of Anne , the obligation to ( louver nine copies of every publication to as many public libraries , which was increased to eleven in 1791 . The latt rnnrnber , though confirmed in 1814 , was , however , in 1830 , reduced to five , at the instance of Mr Buckingham , then a member of Parliament , viz : one copy each , for the British Museum , London : the Libraries of Oxford ( the Bodlcian ) and Cambridge ( the University Library ; ) Trinity College , Dublin ; and the Advocates ' Library , Edinburgh . The severity of this most unju t tax , in the case of those large and costly works of which very small editions can alone be printed , will he apparent . It is stated by the writer of the " Plea for Authors , &amp;c , " that this tax on Audubon 's Birds of America for instance , would be above eight thousand dollars ! The only subsequent legislation on the subject has been in 1814 , when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the delivery copies , the second term of fourteen years was made absolute , instead of depending , as before , on the contingency of the life of the author . In the United States we have obeyed implicitly , in this as in so many other respects , the prescription of British example . The framers of the Constitution were evidently under that influence when they empowered Congress " to promote the progress of sciVOL. // ence and the useful arts , by securing for limited times* to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries . " Two acts were passed , one in 1790 , the other in 1802 , which placed literary property on the same footing as in England , namely , a copyright of fourteen years , with a contingent extension to a second similar term . The improvement made , in the mother countryln 1814 , was not , however , followed by us till 1831 , when , by Mr. Yerplanck 's bill , Congress went a step beyond , by recognizing an absolute copyright for twenty-eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the right to renew being extended to the author 's widow or children . The time has now arrived for the entire reform of this unjust and unwise principle of legislation , namely , the conversion of an absolute natural right of property , if such a right can ever have an existence , into a mere grant of legislative grace , for a limited term , as a mere artificial monopoly privilege , which it is the presumed interest of the community to annul at as early a date as possible . This important reform can not be said to be in advance of public opinion . We are sure that it would be received with general satisfaction . This article has already extended to too great a length to permit us to notice particularly the recent eloquent efforts of Mr. Sergeant Talfourd , in the British Parliament , in the cause of the proposed reform , advocating both the extension of the term , and the introduction of the principle of international reciprocity ,  --  efforts whose reflection through the press has not been without a considerable influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from important public documents , will suffice to show that we are , at least , certainly on the point of maturity for the recognition of the true principle . The restriction of the power of Congress by the words " for limited terms , " in the Constitution , as quoted above , is not only of an indefinite nature , admitting legitimate exten ion to a hundred years , or even a longer term , but is also easily susceptible of amendment . The Report of the Judiciary Committee , I-louse of Representatives , of 1831 , ( Mr. Verplauck , Chairm an , ) lays down the rightful principle in the following terms ; and as remarked by the author of an able article in the American Jurist , volume 10 , page 80 , it is evident that that committee would have reported a bill to this effect , if they had thought the public min ( l prepared for so nreat a change at one stride : Upon the first principles of proprietorship in prenerty , an author has an excluire and perpetual right , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . Though the nature of literary property is peculiar , it is not the less real and valuable . If labor and effort in producing what before was not possessed or known will give title , then the literary man has title , perfect and absolute , and should have his reward : he writes and he labors as assiduously as does the mechanic or husbandrnan " Mr. Clay 's Report , from the Select Committee of the Senate of sixteenth February , 1837 , says : // " That authors and inventors have , accordin* to the practice among civilized nations , a property in the re.pective pr uctions of their genius , is incontestible : and that this property should he protected as effectually as any other property is by law , follows as a lee , itimate consequence . " While Judge Thompson , of the Supreme Court , in the well known case of Wheaton vs . Peters , in an opinion which Mr. Nicklin ( whose example we follow in making these quotations ) justly characterizes as " an opinion full of light and learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound principles , and as applicable to the *ubject of copyright , are the remarks of Mr. Chri tian , in his notes to Blackstone 's Cornmentaries , ( 2 B. Coin . 406 , and note . ) Nothing , ' says he , is more erroneous than the ractice of referrin* the oriain of moral rights , and the system of national equity , to that sava e state , which is supposed to have preceded civilized establishments , n which literary com sition , and of consequence the right to it , could have no existence . But the true mode of ascertainin a moral right , I conceive , is to inquire whether it is such as the reason , , the cultivated reason of mankind , must necessarily assent to . No proposition seems more conformable to that criterion , than that every ne should enjoy the reward of his labor ; the harvest , where he has sown , or the fruit of the tree , which he has planted . ' Whether literary property is sui generis , or under whatever denomination of ri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems founded upo the same principle of general utility to society , which is the basis of all other moral rights and obli , , ations . Thus considered , an author 's copyright ought to he esteemed an inviolable right , established in sound reason and abstract morality . ' It is unnecessary , for the purpose of showing my views upon this branch of the case , to add any thing more . In my jud** eat , every principle of justice , equity , morality , fitness , and sound policy , concur in protecting the literary labors of men to the same extent that property acquired by manual labor is protected . " Mr. Clay 's Report is not particularly distinguished for either clearness or consistency  --  the tongue being that gentleman 's natural instrument rather than the pen  --  and it is rather sharply criticised by Mr. Nicklin . In one passage he compares the republication of an English book by an American publisher , without regard to the original copyright of the author , to the lawless seizure of a bale of goods brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an able writer on the subject , in a New York paper , who forcibly calls us , in this respect , a nation of literary wreckers . ' The Father of the American System ' certainly lays himself open , in this unfortunate comparison , to a very fair hit from the shrewd Philadelphia bookseller , in whom we recognize a thorough partisan of free doctrines , in the following remark : " Unhappily , we are not all shocked , when the law not only tolerates , but requires , the taking away from the foreign merchant who brings to the United States a bale of merchandise , one-fourth , one-third , or one-half of its value , without payin6 for it , in order that somebody , somewhere down east , may be able to make a similar sort of thing ; and yet , mirabile dictee ! a law is proposed to prevent us from making hooks like those imported by the foreign merchant , " Our eneral views on the subject being such as have been express-a ed above , we do not hesitate to declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copyri*ht system for the benefit of English authors at the expense of a tax on our own reading // public-however we may put ourselves beyond the pale of the fashion of the day , which seems to have been called into existence by the honor done to us of the British petition from so many illustrious names . The corner stone on which that rests is , the absolute right of property . Without the 1 tter as its first and fundamental premise , the whole inference , of the equitable obligation to admit foreign authors to the privilege of copyright , falls to the ground . It then becomes a mere question of expediency , which is so simple as not to have even two sides  --  the natural and rightful duty of our Government , to prefer the interest of our own citi*ens ,  --  both those concerned in the trade , and the public at large who enjoy the benefit of the cheapness of price-being too obvious to call for argument . Now so long as neither nation recognizes at all the principle of literary property ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed extension of the copyright privilege to foreigners resident abroad is absurd . It has no foundation to stand upon . We have a right , before such a sacrifice of the public interest , for the sake of an abstract principle of justice , can be asked for , to demand the recognition of the principle itself in our legislation for the protection of the natural rights of our own authors ,  --  and those who *rould become valuable authors , if only legitimately encouraged by the simple guarantee of their property . The latter is a simple question . It has only one material condition . It rests on the one single principle of property . That principle being established carries with it , simultaneously and irresistibly , the inference of perpetuity of copyright as a reform which can not rightfully be delayed a day . The other question , that of international copyright , is a compound question , involving another and a very essential element , besides that of the natural right of property ,  --  namely , the bearing which the distinction of national indiriduality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have upon the question of the right of use of property of such a nature . This is an important consideration , and is by no means satisfactorily settled by any vague generalities about the universal Republic of Letters* ' or eloquent appeals to the natural sympathies of a common language and literature . Volunteer and gratuitous generosity has certainly never yet been the animating principle that has governed the relations between different nations-least of all on the part of the country for whose benefit it is now invoked at our hands . Every nation is a separate being-an entire sphere by itself-having intercourse , indeed , with other nations , and relations with them that touch on the surface , yet distinct and complete around the central nucleus of its own aggregate interest-with its own system of institutions and laws , designed solely for the benefit of its own citizens , and of those who reside as useful members of society within its own limits . It is certain that no nation has ever hitherto felt // itself called upon to legislate for the benefit of particular interests in foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The introduction of this principle of reciprocity in the irnproved German laws above referred to , is not necessarily to be regarded as a precedent for our imitation , there being a xvide difference between the two cases . The contiguity of the respective German States , in all of which the evil of the want of international protection is mutually felt , makes it a matter of common and equal interest ; while our interest plainly dictat s the refusal of a pri*Tilege to the distant foreigner , the benefit of which to him can only be commensurate with the imposition of a tax upon ourselves . In the case of France and Belgium the authors of the former country have long complained of the cheap contrefa*o s which issue from the rapid press of Brussels almost simultaneously with heir appearance at Paris , not only supplanting the original in the rade of all the rest of the continent , but even most iniquitously forcing large editions into France itself , by contraband , to the serious injury of the rghtful owner . But Belgium has never hitherto made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , than ( hat , getting French books very cheap as she now does , she is cerainly not disposed to relinquish the fortunate privilege , and pay a high price for the benefit of French authors , whereas she produces herself no literature that is reprinted in France . Our case is a much stronger one , not being a frontier nation , and neither destroying the foreign English market by publishing reprints for any other han our own use , nor injuring the author 's enjoyment of his property in the country under whose laws it exists and finds protection , by exporting to it cheap contraband editions . We simply deny the English author the profit of our market , by reprinting cheaply what we desire for our own sole use ,  --  excepting so far as the sale a copy in advance to an American publisher may sometimes constitute a quasi sale of copyright , as in the case of Lockhart 's Life of Scott ' f r which Carey a d Lea have given , we understand , about three thousand dollars , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have usually cost the Harpers about five hundred dollars . We despise the common saying-venerable as it may be with time and general usage-that charity begins at home , ' in the narrow and selfish sense in which it is so often quoted . But in the administration of national affairs the sound wisdom of that impulsive generosity which delights to disregard and sacrifice itself for the beneilt of others-noble and beautiful as it may often be in individual onduct-is certainly not quite clear of doubt , at least in he present age of the world , and in our relations with a country so little remarkable for the display of a national Quixotism of that haracter . We confess ourselves by no means satisfied of the right of a government thus to strain a seeming principle of justice into // such magnanimous generosity towards the citizens of a foreign nation , while at the same time neither nation , in its treatment of its ow citizens , recognizes the very principle of natural right on which the proposed privilege is asked . This is indeed being generous to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign author can have the privilege he asks , by simply cm. ing over and taking out his copyri* , ht here , and entitliub himself by a residence that may be merely temporary , even without assuming the allegiance of citizenship ,  --  and if the privilege is valuable , have we not a right to make use of the inducement as a means of attracting so desirable a class of minds to our shores ? The argument of analogy used by Mr. Clay , from the ccse of a bale of merchandize to the copyright of a book , is not more satisfactory than many of the ingenious analogies and figurative illustrations which that eloquent and distinguished Senator is wont to use so freely . For , in the first . place , our own mutual inte* est in commerce dictates the protection of the foreign owner 's right of property in the bale ; aud in the second place , the entire use and value of the latter is locked up in the merchandise itself , the deprivation of which would be a gross and grievous wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , does not affect the author 's rights of property in lii* own country ; - nnd when it is considered that he wrote in and for that country , with reference to its institutions and under the protection of its laws ; that nothing is taken from him , but that only a new privilege , in a foreign country , is not bestowed upon him ; that no injury is attempted , or could be successfully practised , upon the author in the market for which he originally wrote , by supplanting his own editions by surreptitious cheap editions exported thither for the purpose ,  --  it will be acknowledged that there is a very material difference between the two cases . We do not wish to be understood as pronouncing against the principle of international copy* right . The above remarks are thrown out as doubts rather than as decisive arguments . We only maintain that it is a more complex question than the former for which we have contended , involving , together with the one common principle of the moral right of property , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicate considerations , which are at least doubtful , and upon which differences of opinion may reasonably exist . The question of the recognition of the principle of property in copyright must precede that of the extension of it to foreigners in the manner now proposed ; and we have a perfect right , without liability to the charge of illiberality , to refuse the latter until the former , as a necessary condition precedent , is conceded . Since the subject has begun to be agitated , and the public attention aroused by the discussion of the true principles involved in it , we are unwilling that the occasion should pass away without yielding its full and proper fruit . There // is no reason why the proposed reform in the law of copyright should not go to the root of the evil , by the correction of which a yvry beneficial influence will be exerted on our own national literature , and the well-being of our own authors ; rather than spend itself on a partial evil lying upon the surface ( if , indeed , it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hope , therefore , if a bill similar to that which was passed through the Senate in February of last year , is again introduced by its author , that it will be postponed until after a bill shall have passed restoring literary property to ts proper level of equality with all other kinds of property , recognizing its equal inviolability and perpetuity , and protecting it by similar penalties . Then , and not till then , will it be time to take up the subs*quent question for cons deration , to be decided on aim and statesmanlike views of public justice and public policy ,  - -  and not with hasty enthusiasm , awakened by an appeal to the maganimity of great politcians , even though proceeding from fifty-six distinguished authors of our mother country , and through the medium of a pen so agreeable as that of Miss Harriet Martinean.
