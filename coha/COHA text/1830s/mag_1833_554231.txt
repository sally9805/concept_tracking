txt IN our number for January last , we discussed at some length the great question of the relations between the States and the Union , as it was presented by the pretension of ' South Carolina , to annul the Tariff laws . At that moment , it appeared to be doubtful whether the time for useful discussion had not already passed away , and whether it was not too late to employ with advant&amp;ge. , on either side , any other argument than that which has been significantly called the last reason of kings . South Carolina , through the organ of an extraordinary convention of the people , had published an act , declaring null and void some of the most important laws of the United States , and solemnly pledging herself to renounce her connexion with the Union , if any attempt should be made to carry them into effect by force . 11cr Legislature was engaged in maturing the measures required for the further prosecution of this course of policy . On the other hand , the President of the United States had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if possible. , still more energetic and decisive , to execute the laws , if necessary , by actual force . The quarrel was thus brought to a direct issue , which could only be tried by the bayonet , and from which there seemed to be no escape ; for it hardly occurred to any one , as a possible contingency , that Congress , after devoting the whole preceding session to an investigation of the Tariff , and finally adopting , on the principle of compromise , a *axv , which had not yet gone into operation , would make any new arrangement of the question , in season to be useful , or even were ihere more time , would make to a State actually in arms against the Government , such concessions as would prove satisfactory . An appeal to force was therefore , to all appearance , inevitable . The minds of good men throughout the country were accordingly // overwhelmed with gloomy forebodings , and although we expressed at the time a confident hope and expectation , that the ultimate result of the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this favorable result would be obtained without a good deal of intestine discord , confusion , and perhaps actual bloodshed . A few months only have passed away , and all these gloomy signs have , for the moment at feast , entirely disappeared . At no period , since the establishment of the Government5 has the country been more profoundly tranquil , more generally prosperous , or , as respects any immediate cause of apprehension , more entirely secure from dangers of all kinds than it is at present . On the means by which this change in our position and prospects , in itself so propitious , has been brought about , it is not our intention to enlarge , on the present occasion . Others more appropriate and convenient for this purpose , will probably occur hereafter . We will not now inquire , whether it was consistent with the honor or the well understood interest of the country to make concessions to a State in arms against the Government ;  - -  whetherit was right to sacrifice great and acknowledged principles of national policy to considerations of merely temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union and the State Governments ,  --  which at one time or another must in all probability be settled by the sword ,  --  could ever have been brought to this fearful test , under circumstances more propitious to a correct decision of it , than those which attended the recent crisis . Whatever may be the inclination of our private opinion upon these points , which the yeader will easily collect from our mode of stating them , we can hardly bring ourselves to regret that the evil day of confusion and carnage ,  --  supposing even that it must come at last ,  --  is deferred . There is at least a chance that it may forever be avoided . This commonwealth , at all events , having firmly resisted the measures in question , by the vigorous and united action of her whole delegation in both Houses of Congress ,  --  by the expression of the almost unanimous opinion of her State Legislature ,  --  and by the most imposing declarations of public sentiment in various other forms , may fairly consider herself as exempt from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less scruple and the higher satisfaction , the immediate advantages which their adoption has conferred upon us in common with the whole Union . // The most unpleasant occurrences are commonly attended with some more or less agreeable results . The keen and searching inquiry into the theory of our Government , in some of its most important points , which grew out of the late proceedings of South Carolina , can hardly fail to be of great use , and may perhaps have considerable effect in preventing a recurrence of similar scenes . The moment for drawing the proper conclusions from this inquiry , has , of course , not yet arrived : but the speeches and documents elicited by it will remain on record , and will be turned to excellent account by future historians and political philosophers . It is in the hope of contributing our bumble share to this stock of useful materials , and not with any idle pretension to settle questions upon which the most powerful minds in the country are divided , that we now propose to complete the imperfect sketch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . On that occasion we examined the doctrine , of nullification , as it was stated in the Correspondence between Mr. Calhoun and Governor Hamilton , previously to the holding of the Carolina Convention . We shall now inquire whether any new light has been thrown upon the subject , by the debates in Congress during the last session , and , as far as our limits will admit , shall make allusions to the principles professed in the President 's Proclamation , and in some other productions of no inconsiderable authority . Mr. Calhoun , as our readers are aware , resigned the VicePresidency of the United States just before the opening of the late session of Congress , and was immediately appointed by the Legislature of Carolina , to fill the vacancy in the Senate , occasioned by the election of General Hayne to the post of Governor of the State . It was generally understood and expected that the Ex-Vice-President would appear in the Senate , prepared to explain and defend on that high theatre , to the satisfaction not merely of the members , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he is the acknowledged leader . Public expectation was accordingly not disappointed , when soon after the report from the Judiciary Coinruittee of the bill commonly called the Revenue Collection Bill , intended to enforce the execution of die Tariff Laws in South Carolina , Mr. Calhoun laid upon the table of the Senate a series of resolutions , embodying the leading points of his political creed . Although the principal debate did not take // place precisely upon these resolutions , but upon the bill itself ; it may , perhaps , be agreeable to our readers , to see in this connexion the shape in which the Carolina doctrine was pro* sented on this occasion , by its principal champion . The Resolutions are evidently drawn with much deliberation , and are as follows : Resolved , That the people of the several States composing these United States , are united as parties to a constitutional compact , to which the people of each State acceded as a separate and sovereign community , each binding itself by its own particular ratification ; and that the Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Union between the States ratifying the same . Resolved , That the people of the several States thus united by the constitutional compact , in forming that instrument and in creating a General Government to carry into effect the objects for which it was formed , delegated to that Government , for that purpose , certain definite powers , to be exercised jointly , reserving at the same time , each State to itself ; the residuary mass of powers to be exercised by its own separate Government : and that whenever the General Government assumes the exercise of powers not delegated by the compact , its acts are unauthorized , void , and of no effect ; and that the said Government is not made the fiuial judge of the powers delegated to it , since that would make its discretion , and not the Constitution , the measure of its powers , but that , as in all other cases of compact among sovereign parties , without any common judge , each has an equal right to judge for itself ; as well of the infraction , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the assertions , that the people of these Unite*i States , taken collectively , as individuals , are now or ever have been united on the principle of the social compact , and as such , are now formed into one nation , or people , or that they have ever been so united , in any one stage of their political existence ; that the people of the several States , composing the Union , have not , as members thereof ; retained their sovereignty ; that the allegiance of their citizens has been transferred to the General Government ; that they have parted with the right of punishing treason , through their respective State Governments ; and that they have not the right of judging in the last resort , as to the extent of powers reserved , and of consequence , of those delegated ; are not only without foundation in truth , but are contrary to the most certain and plain historical facts , and the clearest deductions of reason , and that all exercise of power on the part of the Gene-. ral Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such erroneous assumptions , must of necessity be unconstidirectly and inevit tutional ; must tend - ably to subvert the sovereiguty of the States ; to . destroy the federal character of the Union ; and to rear on its ruins a consolidated government , without constitutional check , or limitation , and which must necessarily terminate in the loss of liberty itself . ' The day after these resolutions were presented , Mr. Grundy of Tennessee , a leading friend of the administration , offered , in the form of an amendment , a series of counter resolutions in which , avoiding the general principles involved in the question , he confines himself to a naked assertion of the constitutionality of the particular operations of the General Government , to which South Carolina had taken exception . They are as follows . Resolved , That by the Constitution of the United States certain powers are delegated to the General Government , and those not delegated nor prohibited to the States , are reserved to the States , respectively , or to the people . 2 . Resolved , That one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Government , and prohibited to the States , is that of laying duties on imports . 3 . Resolved , that the power to lay imposts is by the Constition wholly transferred from the State authorities to the General Government , without any reservation of power or right on the part of the State . 4 . Resolved , That the Tariff Laws of 1828 and 1832 , are exercises of the constitutional power possessed by the Congress of the United States , whatever various opinions may exist as to their policy and justice . 5 . Resolved , That an attempt on the part of a State to annul an act of Congress passed upon any subject exclusively confided by the Constitution to Congress , is an encroachment on the rights of the General Government . 6 . Resolved , That attempts to obstruct or prevent the execution of the several acts of Congress imposing duties on imports , whether by Ordinances of Conventions or Legislative enactments , . are not warranted by the Constitution , and are dangerous to the political institutions of the country . ' On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nmend the amendment of Mr. Grundy , by substituting Ibr a part of it the following resolution , the language of which is borrowed in part , from the President 's Proclamation . // Resolved , That the power to annul the several acts of Congress , imposing duties on imports , or any other law of the United States , when assumed by a single State , is incompatible with the existence of the Unioii , contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution. , unauthorized by its spirit , inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded , and destructive of the great object for which it was formed ; ' that the people of these United States are for the purposes enumerated in their Constitution ONE PEOPLE AND A SINGLE NATION , having delegated full power to their common agents to preserve and defend their national interests for the purpose of attaining the great end of all government , the safety and happiness of the governed ; that while the Constitution does provide for the interest and safety of all the States , it does not secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allegiance of the people is rightfully due as it has been freely given to the General Government , to the extent of all the sovereign power expressly ceded to that Government in the Constitution ; that the Supreme Court of the United States is the proper and only tribunal in the last resort for the decision of all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made under their authority ; that resistance to the laws , founded on the inherent and inalienable right of all men to resist oppression is in its nature revolutionary and extra-constitutional ,  --  and that entertaining these views , the Senate of the United States , while willing to concede every thing to any honest difference of opinion , which can be yielded consistently with the honor and interest of the nation , will not fail , in the faithful discharge of its most solemn duty , to support the Executive in the just administration of the Government , and clothe it with all constitutional power necessary to the faithful execution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calhoun afterwards offered his on 0inal resolutions in a slightly varied shape , as an amendment to those which had been substituted for them , in order that the discussion might come on upon them and not upon the substitutes ,  --  *  --  but as the original form was probably the one which he preferred , we deem it unnecessary to insert the new one . In offering his resolutions , Mr. Calhoun accompanied them with some eloquent and forcible remarks , to which we shall presently allude , and it was doubtless his wish and intention , that the great principles involved in the question should he discussed when the resolutions were taken tip . But the Revenue Collection Bill naturally took the precedence , on account of the immediate and // urgent want of ' the powers conferred by it , and as it involved the same questions which were stated in the resolutions , the discussion of the latter was in a great measure anticipated . Mr. Calhoun , though professedly avoiding general principles , in fact said but little upon any thing else , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' his adversary 's argument , avowedly made the general principles involved in the question his principal subject . After the Revenue Collection Bill was disposed of , Mr. Calhoun 's resolutions were formally taken up . On this occasion , the Ex-Yicc-President made a pretty full and elaborate rejoinder to Mr. Webster 's reply to his lhrmer speech . This may be said to have closed the debate . Mr. Webster answered in a very few succinct remarks , and the resolutions , without any decisive action having been had upon them , were then laid upon the table . Such was the form in which this great case was argued before the Senate of the United States . While the discussion was in progress , most of the State Legislatures held their annual sussions , and having received from the Governor of South Carolina copies of the proceedings of the Convention , naturally felt themselves called upon to express an opinion upon their character . The Governors generally recommended the subject to the attention of the Legislatures , and the latter adopted reso1utions* , ae&amp;ompanied , in several instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single exception , and in the most unequivocal terms , the doctrine of nullification as a palpable and dangerous heresy . The Legislature of Massachusetts authorized a Committee to collect and publish , in connexion with the Carolina documents , the reports and resolutions of all the State Legislatures upon the subject . The volume will form a very interesting memorial of the history of the times . The only State whose proceedings varied materially from those of the rest , was Virginia . Governor Floyd , in his message to the Legislature , exhibited a decided leaning to the doctrine of Nullification , and there was a pretty strong party in favor of it in the Legislature . The subject was a long time under discussion , and several sets of Resolutions were successively adopted in the two Houses , but the friends of the Union maintained throughout a clear majority , and in the Resolutions which were finally adopted , on the principle of compromise , by an almost unanimous vote , the doctrine is decidedly condemned . But the most remarkable feature in the proceedings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. W. Leigh , as a special commissioner near the Government of South Carolina , for the purpose of endeavoring to persuade that State to suspend for the present the enforcement of the nullijying ordinance . This overture ) in itself a curious and not unimportant proceeding , considered merely as an incident in our political history , seemed to imply a sort of pledge on the part of Virginia , that at a future period she would be prepared to sustain Carolina in her present pretensions . had the general question ta .. ken a different turn , this measure would have had a good deal of influence in determining the course of subsequent events . The sudden compromise of the whole difficulty rendered it a matter of no importance , but there can not he a doubt that the complexion of the proceedings of Virginia was among the motives that operated most strongly in inducing Mr. Clay to take the course he did . He in fact expressly said as much , in a speech with which he introduced his bill . While the proceedings of Carolina were under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed of course a prominent topic in the newspapers ; and essays of great power and value were published in various *juarters of the Union . The most remarkable were those which appeared in the Nor .. folk Herald , under the title of a Review of the President 's Proclamation , with the signature of A Virginian , attributed to Mr. Tazewell . We may here remark , en passant , that whatever may be thought of the correctness of the opinions of the Virginian school of statesmen , they are entitled to great credit for the persevering diligence with which they devote their time and labor to the political affairs of the country . The debates on importalit topics in the Virginia Legislature occupy more time , and are managed on the x*hole with far more care and ability than those of any other State . The Virginia newspapers are , as far as the amount and value of the political discussions contained in them are concerned , the best that appear in the Union . It is apparent in short from their conduct , that the men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the political affairs of the country as a vast and important subject , in the regulation of which they are determined that their State shall possess her proper influence : and are willing to go through the labor that is necessary to secure it . This disposition , in connexion with their greater steadiness in supporting each other , and their comparative freedom from // the paltry personal jealousies and local factions , that are per mitted to distract the councils and destroy the weight of the Eastern and Middle States , have always given , and continue to give , to Virginia , even in the present comparative decline of her wealth and material prosperity , a political power that has never been exercised by any other State , and which justifies , in some degree , her proud and favorite title . This superior influence is the natural , and we may add merited result of greater personal generosity and devotion to the public good in her citizens ; the St1 tes that desire to emulate her superior* ity in this respect , must begin by practising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remarks which we now propose to offer upon the questions involved in the proceedings of South Carolina , and the acts and publications to which they have led , we shall direct our attention to the general principles , and without confining ourselves very strictly to an examination of the speeches and essays to which we have alluded , shall make such use of them as may appear best fitted to illustrate the argument . The leading point in the Carolina doctrine , as our readers are well aware , is , that any State has a right to annul , at discretion , within its limits , any act of the General Government , which it may deem unconstitutional . The ground on which this pretension is defended , is , that the United States are not one people or nation , but a league or confederacy of powers mutually independent of each other , and that the Constitution is in the nature of a treaty between these powers , each of which possesses the same right to judge of the extent of the obligations imposed by it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated by the others , that is ordinarily possessed and exer&amp;sed by the parties to an alliance of independent sovereigns ; that in all such cases a breach of the conditions of the treaty by one party , exempts the others from the obligation to observe it , and leaves them at liberty to renounce it entirely , or to take such other measures , not inconsistent with substantial justice , for the security of their rights , as they may deem expedient . In our preceding article on this subject , we stated as the leading point in the reply to this argument , and as the great principle which governs the whole discussion , that the Constitution of the United States , being the instrument or charter which determines the form and regulates the action of the government of the country is , as such , a social compact , by which the parties to // it , whether states or individuals , formed themselves into one body politic , political society , people or nation , ( these terms being all synonymous , ) under a common government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  whatever may be its form , character , or origin ; - whether it be written or unwritten , - free , limited , or despotic ; - whether founded in force , fraud or voluntary association ; - whether created by a number of previously independent States , or by a number of previously independent individuals ; - carries with it certain incidents , which belong to it as such , and are inseparable from its nature ; that of these incidents , essential properties or characteristics of every such social compact or constitution of government , the first in order are that the parties to it have not a moral right to withdraw from it at discretion , or to construe at discretion the powers of the government created by it ; but are bound to remain parties to it , and to acquiesce in the acts of the government created by it , excepting in those extreme cases , which justify open rebellion . These principles are in substance the same which are laid down in the President 's Proclamation of the tenth of Deceinher . The Constitution of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a league , and whether it be formed by compact between the States , or in any other manner , its character is the same . Each State having expressly parted with so many powers as to constitute jointly with the other States a single nation , can not from that period possess any right to secede , because such secession does not break a league but destroys the unity of a nation . Because the Union was formed by compact , it is said , that the parties to that compact may , when they feel themselves aggrieved , depart from it : but it is precisely because it is a compact that they can not . A compact is an agreement or binding obligation . It may , by its terms , have a sanction or penalty for its breach , or it may not . If it contain no sanction , it may be broken with no other consequence than moral guilt : if it have a sanction , then the breach incurs the designated or implied penalty . A league between independent nations , generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it should contain a penalty , as there is no common superior , it can not be enforced . A government , on the contrary , always has a sanction , express or implied : and , in our case , it is both necessarily implied and expressly given . An attempt by force of arms to destroy a government , is an offence , by whatever means the constitutional // compact may have been formed ; and such government has the right by the law of self-defence , to pass acts for punishing the offender , unless that right is modified , restrained , or resumed , by the constitutional act . In our system , although it is modified in the case of treason , yet authority is expressly given to pass all laws necessary to carry its powers into effect , and under this grant provision has been made for punishing acte which obstruct the due administration of the laws . ' In this passage of the Proclamation , the theory of the question is stated with substantial correctness , although not ( as may naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of official business , ) with all the terseness and elegance that would be required in a deliberate treatise . It is not strictly just to say , that the parties to the Constitution have no right to depart from it when they think themselves aggrieved , precisely because it is a compact . There are son*e compacts , particularly of those concluded between independent States , the parties to which have a right to depart from them , when they honestly think themselves aggrieved . The precise reason why the parties that formed the Constitution have not a right to secede from it when they think themselves aggrieved , is ,  --  not that it is a compact ,  --  but that it is a social compact :  --  a compact of a particular description , of which it is one of the essential characteristics that the parties to it have not a right to depart from it at discretion , when they think themselves aggrieved . Again : A compact is an agreement or binding obligation . It may by its terms have a sanction or it may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken with no other consequences than moral guilt : if it have a sanction , then . the breach incurs the designated or implied penalty . A league between independent nations generally has no sanction other than a moral one : a government , on the contrary , always has a sanction , express or implied , and in our case it is both necessarily implied , and expressly given . ' This is a rather awkward , and in some degree incorrect statement of the principles applicable to the case , although the practical conclusions of the writer are perfectly just . A sauction , in the teclmical sense of the word , is the penalty annexed to the violation of a law , and is not properly an incident of any compact , whether in the nature of a league or a cQnstitI* // tion of Government . The Constitution of the United *tateg , for example , contains no specification of penalties to be suffer-. ed by those who violate it . As respects the moral sanction , a league and a constitution stand on nearly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligatory to the extept to which they respectively operate . The distinction here taken between them in reference to their different sanctions , is , therefore , groundless , and , if better founded , would be foreign to the question . The difference between the obligations imposed by a treaty , and a constitution of government , is not the censequence of the difference between the sanctions by which they are respectively accompanied , whatever it may in fact be , but of the difference between the purposes and characters of the two instruments . Nor is it quite correct to say , that governments have a right , by the law of self-defence , to pass acts for the punishment of treason . A government , being a mere representative of the people , does not possess , as a government , the right of self-defence , or any other . The right of the people to pass , through the agency of the government , acts for the punishment of treasoc , does not rest on the principle of self-defence . It is simply one of the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of taking all measures that are required for the general welfare , and for carrying into effect the object for which political societies are established . It rests , in short , on precisely the same ground with the right to pass laws for the punishment of mnrder or theft , for the encouragement of learning , or for any other purpose of ordinary legislation . In pointing out these inaccuracies in the language and reasoning of the Proclamation , it is not our intention to depreciate the merit of that document . We consider it , on the contrary , as one that , on many accounts , does great credit to the executive department of the government . It possesses precisely the qualities which the occasion called for ; principles substantially just , if not enunciated throughout with techrncal correctness ; a bold and energetic tone ; and a warmth of patriotic feeling , that awakened a kindred gJow in the heart of every honest citiien , throughout the country . We b*v* s*q he*tatjoj* in saying , that , in our opinion , *this document gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Proclamation more highly , do we consider it more *nport*pt that the erronepus or d*oubtft4 prixicipl*s *ontaiaed is lb *h*qI4 // be distinctly indicated , lest in going forth to the public in this imposing shape , they should be received as acknowledged political truths . The moment when the excitement created by the subject has partially subsided , hut is still sufficiently lively to attract some attention to it , seems to be precisely the one in which these corrections may be made with the gre*ttest advantage , and it is with a view to these considerations , that we have ventured to submit the above remarks . Such , however , as we have stated them , are the leading principles that govern the discussion of this great question , and constitute the proper reply to the Carolina doctrine of nullification . The Constitution of the United States is a social compact , by which the parties to it , whether States or individuals , formed themselves into one body politic under a common government : and it carries with it as such an inherent obligation upon these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obey the laws enacted by that Government , excepting in those extreme cases which justify rebellion . Mr. Calhoun 's resolutions were offered in the ' Senate in the way of rejoinder to this reply , as stated in the President 's Proclamation and various other quarters . They affirm , as the reader has already seen , that the people of the several States are united as parties to a constitutional compact formed by the States , as distinct political communities , and deny explicitly , that , taken collectively as individuals , they are now or ever have been united on the principle of the social compact into one nation or people , at any stage of their political existence . In the remarks which he made on first presenting the resolutions , as they are reported in the Intelligencer , he developed this idea in the following manner : No such community ever existed , as the people of the United States , forming a collective body of individuals in one nation ; and the idea that they are so united , by the present Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is utterly false and absurd . To call the Constitation the social compact , is the greatest possible abuse of language . No two things are more dissimilar ; there is not an expression in the whole science of politics , more perfectly definite in its meaning than the social compact . It means that association of iudividuals , founded on the implied assent of all its members , which precedes all government , and from which government or the constitutional compact springs ; and yet , the President , in this daring attempt to pu&amp; // down our federal system , has ventured to confound things so totally dissimilar . The sovereignty , then , is in the people of the several States , united in this Federal Union . It is not only in them , but in them . unimpaired ; not a particle resides in the Government ; not one particle in the American people collectively. , In his speech on the Revenue Collection Bill , Mr. Calhoun added little or nothing to his previous remarks on this particular point , in the hope that another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster , in his answer to the speech of Mr. Calhoun on the Revenue Collection Bill , addressed himself particularly , as we have already said , to a consideration of the principles announced in the resolutions , 2nd treated at some length the question how far and in what sense the Constitution may properly be described as a compact . On this part of the subject he took the ground that , properly speaking , the Constitution is not a compact at all , but afundamental law : - that it may be said to be founded in consent , agreement or compact , inasmuch as the formation and adoption of it were effected by the general assent of the people ,  --  but that when adopted t became , what its name imports , a constitution , and is no longer a mere agreement . I do not agree , ' he says , that in strictness of language , it is a compact at all . But 1 do agree that it is founded on consent , or agreement , or on compact , if the gentleman prefers ihat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary consent or agreement . The people agreed to make a constitution , but when made , that constitution became what its name imports . It is no longer a mere agreement . There can be no longer a subsisting agreement or compact to form a constitution or government , after that constitution or government has been actually formed and established . ' We make no apology for quoting the entire passage which includes these detached remarks , and which , whatever may be thought of the correctness of the doctrine , is curious and valuable , as the opinion of a great master of constitutional law upon one of the most important questions in the science . It is as follows : Whether the Constitution be a compact between States in their sovereign capacities , is a question which must be mainly argued from what is contained in the instrument itself . We all agree that it is an instrument which has been , in some way , clothed with power . We all admit , that it speaks with authority . The first question then is , what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ? Dons it style itself * league , *onfednracy , ot *ompact between sovereign States ? It is tO be remembered , sir , that the Cohstitut.ion began to speak tnly after its adoption . Until it was ratified by nine States , it Was but a proposal , the mere draught of an instrument . It Was like a deed , drawh , but not executed . The Convention had framed it , sent it to Congress , then sitting under the Confederation , Congress had transmitted it to the State Legislatures , and by these last it was laid before conventions of the people in the several States . All this while it was inoperative paper . It had received no stamp of authority , no sanction ; it spoke no language . But when ratified by the people in their respective conventions , then it had a voice , and spoke authentically . Every word in it had then received the sanction of the popular will , and was to be received as the expression of that will . What the Constitution says of itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other point . Does it call itself a compact ? Certainly not . It uses the word compact but once , and that is when it declares that the States shall enter into no compact . Does it call itself a league , a confederacy , a subsisting treaty between the States ? Certainly not . There is not a particle of such language in all its pages . But it declares itself a CONSTITUTiON . What is a Constitution ? Certainly not a league , compact , or confederacy , but afundarnental law . That fundamental regulation which determines the manner in which the public authority is to be executed , is what forms the Constitution of a State . Those primary rules which concern the body itself , and the very being of the political society , the form of Government , and the manner in which power is to be exercised , - all , in a word , which form together the ( constitution of a State , these are the fundamental laws . This , Sir , is the language of the public writers . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what a Constitution is ? Is it not an idea perfectly familiar , definite and well settled ? We are at no loss to understand what is meant by the Constitution of one of the States ; and the Constitution of the United States speaks of itself as being an instrument of the same nature . It says , this Constitution shall be the law of the land , any thing in any State Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding . And it speaks of itself too , in plain contradistinction from a confederation ; for it says that all debts contracted , and nil engagements entered into by the United States , shall be m*s valid under this Constitution as under the Confederation . It aoes uot say , as valid tinder this comjract , or this league , or this e*enfederation , as under the former confederation , but as valid u*idet this Constztutvon . This then , *Sit* ie de*l*red to bea Constitution . A Constitwa // 1833. tion is the fundamental law of the State ; and this is expressly declared to be the supreme law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribe this fundamental law , ' ' or this supreme law , ' ' for they do say that they establish this Constitution , and that it shall be the supreme law . They say that they ordain and establish it . Now , Sir , what is the common application of these words ? We do not speak of ordaining leagues and compacts . If this was intended to be a compact or league , and the States to be parties to it , why was it not so said ? Why is there found no one expression ifl the whole instrument , indicating such intent ? The old Confederation was expressly called a league , and into this league it was declared that the States , as States , severally entered . Why was not similar language used in the Constitution , if a similar intention had existed ? Why was it not said , " the States enter into this new league , " " the States form this new confederation , or " the States agree to this new compact ? " Or , why was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution , that the people of the several States acceded to this compact in their sovereign capacities ? What reason is there for supposing that the framers of the Constitution rejected expressions appropriate to their own meaning , and adopted others wholly at war with that meaning ? Again , Sir , the Constitution speaks of that political system Which it established as " the Government of the United States . " Is it not doing strange violence to language , to call a league or a compact between sovereign powers a government ? The Government of a State is that organization in which the political power resides . It is the political being , created by the Constitution or fundamental law . The broad and clear difference between a government and a league or compact , is , that a government is a body politic ; it has a will of its own , and it possesses powers and faculties to execute its own purposes . Every compact looks to some power to enforce its stipulations . Even in a compact between sovereign communities , there always exists this ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in such case , this power is but the force of one party against the force of another ,  --  that is to say , the power of war . But a government executes its decisions by its own supreme authority . Its use of force , in compelling obedience to its own enactments , is not war . It contemplates no opposing party having a right of resistance . It rests on its own power to enforce its own will ; and when it ceases to possess this power , it is no longer a government . Mr. President , I concur so generally in the very able speech of the gentleman from Virginia , near me , ( Mr. RivEs ) that it is not without diffidence and regret that I venture to differ with him // July , on any point . His opinions , Sir , are redolent of the doctrines of a very distinguished school , for which I have the highest regard , of whose doctrines I can say , what I also can say of the gentleman 's speech , that , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hesitate about some of the premises . I do not agree that the Constitution is a compact between States in their sovereign capacities . I do not agree that , in strictness of language , it is a compact at all . But I do agree , that it is founded on consent , or agreement ; or on compact , if the gentleman prefers that word , and means no more by it than voluntary consent or agreement . The Constitution , Sir , is not a contract , but the result of a contract ; meaning , by contract , no more than assent . Founded on consent , it is a Government proper . Adopted by the agreement of the people of the United States , when adopted , it has become a Constitution . The people have agreed to make a Constitution ; but when made , that Constitution becomes what its name imports . It is no longer a mere agreement . Our laws , sir , have their foundation in the agreement , or consent , of the two Houses of Congress . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other agrees to it ; but the result of this agreement is not a compact , but a law . The law , the statute , is not the agreement , but something created by the agreement ; and something which , when created , has a new character , and acts by its own authority . So the Constitution of the United States , founded in or on the consent of the people , may be said to rest on compact , or consent ; but it is itself not the compact , but its result . When a people agree to erect a government , and actually erect it , the thing is done , and the agreement is at an end . The compact is executed , aud the end designed by it attained . Henceforth , the fruit of the agreement exists , but the agreement itself is merged in its own accomplishment ; since there can be no longer a subsisting agreement , or compact , to form a Constitution or Government , after that Constitution or Government has been actually formed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are substantially the same with those laid down by Dane in his Abridgeinent of the Common Law , the appendix to which is devoted entirely to an examination of this question , and by Judge Story in his recent valuable Commentaries on Constitutional Law . The Constitution of the United States , ' says Dane , is not a compact or contract agreed to by two or more parties , to be construed by each for itself and there to stop for want of a common arbiter to revise the construction of each party or State . It is , as the people have named , and called it , truly a // 207 Constitution , and they properly said , We , the People of the United States , do ordain and establish this Constitution , and not We , the People of each State . ' * This passage is quoted and adopted by Story , who also says that , A government may originate in the voluntary compact or assent of the people of the several States , or of a people never before united , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a matter resting in compact , but become an executed Government or Constitution , or fundamental law , and not a mere league . ' * In the subsequent debate on the resolutions , which came on upon the 26th of February , Mr. Calhoun. rejoined at considerable length to Mr. Webster 's reply to his former speech , and entered more fully than he had done on the other occasion into the merits of the case . He combated with much force , and we think , with success , Mr. Webster 's leading point , that the Constitution is , in the proper sense of the term , not a compact at all , but a fundamental law . It is no doubt true , that the Constitution may be styled with propriety a . fundamental law , or , as it is called in the instrument itself ; the Supreme Law of the Land , because , being habitually enforced in the Courts of Justice under the same forms as the ordinary laws , it naturally enough comes under the same general appellation . But the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same character . On our view of the subject , transactions , determining the form of the government of a community , however denominated , are , as such , necessarily compacts . They are so described by the most judicious political writers , as well as the highest authorities of a practical character . The remarks of Mr. Calhoun on this sub*ect are entitled to much attention . But the principal argument on which the Senator relied , to show that the Constitution is not a compact , rests on the provision in that instrument which declares that " this Constitution , and the laws made in pursuance thereof ; and treaties made under their authority , are the supreme laws of the land . " He asked , * with marked emphasis , Can a compact be the supreme law of the land ? I ask , in return , whether treaties are not compacts , and whether treaties , as well as the Constitution , are not declared to be the supreme law of the land ? His argument , in fact , as conclusively proves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Constitution is not a compact . I might rest this point on this decisive answer ; but as I desire to leave not a shadow of doubt on this important point , I shall follow the gentleman in the course of his reasoning . He defines a Constitution to be a fundamental law , which organizes the Government , and points out the mode of its action . 1 will not object to the definition , though , in my opinion , a more appropriate one , or at least one better adapted to American ideas could be given . My objection is not to the definition , but to the attempt to prove that the fundamental laws of a State can not be a compact , as the Senator seems to suppose . I hold the very reverse to be the case ; and that , a*rding to the most approved writers on the subject of government , these very fundamental laws , which are now stated not only not to be compacts , hut inconsistent with the very idea of compacts , are held invariably to be compacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of the country . I will cite a single authority , which is full and explicit on this point , from a writer of the highest repute . Burlamaqui says , vol . II. , part I. , chap . I. , sec. 35 , 36 , 37,38 , " It entirely depends upon a free people to invest the sovereigns whom they place over their heads with an authority either absolute , or limited by certain laws . These regulations , by which the supreme authority is kept within bounds , are called the fundamental laws of the State . " " The fundamental laws of a State , taken in their full extent , are not only the decrees by which the entire body of the nation determine the form of Government , and the manner of succeeding to the crown , but are likewise covenants betwixt the people and the person on whom they confer the sovereignty , which regulate the manner of governing , and by which the supreme authority is limited . " " These regulations are called fundamental laws , beGause they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , on which the structure of the Government is raised , and because the people look upon these regulations as their principal strength and support . " " The name of laws , however , has been given to these regulations in an improper and figurative sense ,  --  for , properly speaking , they are real covenants . But as those covenants are obligatory between the contracting parties , they have the force of laws themselves . " The same ,  --  2d vol. part II. , ch . I , sec. 19 and 22 , in part . " The whole body of the nation , in whom the supreme power originally resides , may regulate the Government by , a fundarnen // tal law , in such manner as to commit the exercise of the different parts of the supreme power to different per*ons or bodies , who may act independently of each other , in regard to the rights cornmitted to them ; but still subordinate to the laws from which those rights are derived . " " And these fundamental lau*s are real covenants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different orders of the Republic , by which they stipulate that each shall have a particular part of the sovereignty , and that this shall establish the form of government . It is evident that by these means each of the contracting parties acquires a right not only of exercising the power granted to it , but also of preserving that original right . " But why should I refer to writers upon the subject of government , or inquire into the Constitution of foreign States , when there are such decisive proofs , that our Constitution is a compact ? On this point the Senator is estopped . I borrow from the gentleman , and thank him for the word . his adopted State , which he so ably represents on this floor , and his native State , the States of Massachusetts and New Hampshire , both declared , in their ratification of the Constitution , that it was a compact . The ratification of Massachusetts is in the following words : ( Here Mr. C. read . ) " In Convention of the Delegates of the People of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Convention having impartially discussed and fully considered the Constitution of the United States of America , reported to Congress by the Convention of Delegates from the United States of America , and submitted to us by a resolution of the General Court of said Commonwealth , passed the 25th day of October last past , and acknowledging with grateful hearts the goodness of the Supreme Ruler of the universe , in affording the people of the United States , in the course of his Providence , an opportunity , deliberately and peaceably , without fraud or surprise , of entering into an explicit and solemn compact with each other , by assenting to and ratifying a new Constitution , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity , assent to , and ratify the said Constitution for the United States of America . " The ratification of New Hampshire is taken from that of Massachusetts , and is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the same purpose the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 , in which the Constitution is de // nominated a compact to which the States are parties , and the reply to those Resolutions by the Legislature of Massachusetts of the same year , in which it is called a solemn compact , and inquires , with some reason , whether Massachusetts is not estopped by this public declaration , from any subsequent denial of the same proposition . In another part . of his remarks upon the same subject , Mr. Calhoun seems to have misapprehended the meaning of Mr. Webster 's assertion , that the Constitution , though it may properly enough be considered as the result of an agreement or compact among the people to form a constitution , is itself no compact at all . He supposes Mr. Webster to mean , that the Constitution having once been a compact or agreement , has changed its nature , and is no longer such , but has become a government or fundamental law . In order to show that this view is incorrect , Mr. Calhoun appeals to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which declares , that the ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution , between the States ratifying the same . ' The little word between , ' according to the Ex-Vice-President* means a volume . Compacts , not laws , bind between the States* ' We venture to differ from Mr. Calhoun in regard to the importance of this little word , and are even inclined to doubt whether it be , in the correct use of language , admissible in the connexion in which he introduces it . A compact between two or more parties is binding upon them , and can not , in the ordinary use of the terms , be said to bind between them . ' But independently of this , Mr. Webster , a we understand him , did not mean to intimate that the Constitution , having once been a compact or agreement , had changed its character , and become a fundamental law . What he meant to say was , that the establishment of the Constitution was preceded by a different act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peopib agreed to form a constitution , and which he elsewhere describes as the social compact of tha European writers . The Constitution thus formed is , therefore , the result of a compact , but is not , never ' was , and of course never will be a compact itself . Such , we , say , is Mr. Webster 's doctrine , and . it is the more remarkable tha1* Mr. Calhoun should have misunderstood him upon this point , inasmuch as his own opinion , in regard to it , is substantially the same . He , like Mr. Webster , divides the political organizatior* // of the community into two transactions :  --  a social compact which precedes all government , and b* which the parties agree to form *themselves into one political society , and a constitutional compact which , according to him , springs from , as Mr. Wehster calls the Constitution a result of , the social compact . The only difference between them is , that Mr. Calhoun considers the second transaction a compact as well as the first , while Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the second as the establishment of a fundamental law . On either view of the proceeding , it is obvious that the acts in question , whether compacts or laws , never change their character , but always remain what they were at the time of their conclusion . But although the Ex-Vice-President seems to have misapprehended , in part , the remarks of Mr .. Webster , upon this subject , there is , as we have said , a good deal of force in his objections to the leading point , that the Constitution is not a compact , hut a fundamental law . The reply of Mr. Webster to the second speech of Mi ' . Calhoun was very brief . The only remarks , hearing upon the question we are now considering , are the following . The honorable getitleman does Pot understand how the Constitution can have a compact , or consent , for its basis , and yet not be a compact between sovereign States . It appears to me that the distinction is broad and plain enough . The people may agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or compact ; this is the social compact of the European writers . When the Government is formed , it rests on this assent of the governed that is , it rests on the assent of the people . The whole error of the gentleman 's argument arises from the notion , that the people , of their own authority , can make but one government ; or that the people of all the States have not united , and can not unite , in establishing a constitution , connecting them together , directly , as individuals united under one bovernment . He seems minwilling to admit , that while the people of a single State may unite together , and form a government for some purposes , the people of all the States may also unite together , and form another government , for other purposes . But what he will not thus admit , appears to me to be the simple truth , the plain matter of fact , in regard to our political institutions . ' We do not adopt the opinion of those who separate tbe political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The form of the government to be established , would , in all such cases , be by far the most important circumstance to be attended to , and would , therefore , necessarily constitute a part of the original contract . The object of this contract is not to form a constitution , but to form the particular constitution which the parties prefer , and unless they were assured that they were to have a constitution of this particular form , and no other , it is obvious , that they would never consent to enter into any political association . The form of the government to be established is , therefore , the principal condition and consequently a component part of the original agreement , which constitutes the society . This consideration proves that the constitution , or the instrument that regulates the form of the government , is in the nature of a compact . That it is not and can not be in the nature of a law , using the term in any strict and proper sense , results from the authorities quoted by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also apparent on other grounds , some of which , - as the question is one of great importance ,  --  we will now succinctly state . When , in order to avoid the conclusions that have been drawn from the proposition of Mr. Calhoun , that the Constitution is a compact between the States as distinct communities , Mr. Webster affirms that the Constitution is no compact at all , but a fundamental law , he means , of course , to be understood , that the obligation which the citizens are under to observe it does not result from the principles which render contracts ohligatory , but from those which render the laws obligatory . Contracts are obligatory , simply on the general principles of moral and religious duty . The laws , on the other hand , are obligatory , as expressions of the will of the community , declared in the form prescribed for this purpose by the Constitution . Every community has an inherent right to regulate at discretion , the conduct of its members , under the limitations prescribed by the moral law , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , made in the form prescribed for this purpose , are denominated laws , and are binding as such . That the Constitution of the United States is not obligatory on this principle is nearly self-evident , and results very clearly from the two following considerations . // therefore , that it was the act of an existing community ; - that the United States before its adoption were combined by their previous acts of Union , or in some other way into one political society or people . This we know to be the opinion of Mr. Webster , as it is also that of Mr. J. Q. Adams , of the writer of the President 's Proclamation , and of many other persons of great discretion . It is well known , however , that statesmen of not inferior authority ,  --  among whom we may mention particularly Mr. Madison ,  --  entertain a different sentiment upon this point , and believe that the United States before the adoption of the Constitution were distinct and essentially independent communities , combined on the principle of a confederacy or league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we remarked in our preceding article ,  --  that the leaning of our own minds is in this direction . The question , it will be observed , is not whether the several States have or have not been from their first settlement up to the present day , in consequence of their neighborhood and community of origin , language , laws and manners , substantially one people , hut whether , between the time of the Declaration of Independence and that of the adoption of the present Constitution , they were not , as respects the form of their political institutions , mutually independent communities . The period was a short and stormy one : the country was in a state of transition from one condition of political existence to another , and a general confusion prevailed in every department of business , public and private . The administration of the Government , like every thing else , was in some degree unsettled , and it is not improbable that a careful inquirer might discover in the pretensions , and even acts of the States and of Congress , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations . On the whole , however , we are of opinion that the States considered themselves at the time , and will be regarded by the future historian , as having been during this interval free , sovereign and independent of each other , as they are expressly said to be in the Articles of Confederation . Without enlarging on this subject , we will merely say , that to our minds the single fact that two of them declined , for several years , to adopt the Constitution , and remained without the pale of the Union , is of itself conclusive . Had the States been previously regarded as forming one community , a decision of the majority would , of course , have bound the whole . The language of the preamble to the Constitution , // - We the people of the United States ,  --  is sometimes relied on as proving of itself , that the States composed one people before the adoption of the Constitution : but the word people , having no distinct plural , may as well be considered plural as singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to require it . Our own impression is , that it was employed in the preamble of the Constitution , not in contradistinction to States , which term is also used , hut to Governments , the object having been to show that the instrument was in each State the act of the community at large and not of the State authorities . If this be true , the use of the word has no bearing whatever upon the question of the mutual relations between the States and the Union . 2 . A law is an expression of the will of a community , in the form prescribed by the Constitution for that purpose . Were it even admitted , that previously to the adoption of the Constitution the States composed one people : - that the Congress of the Confederation was a government exercising legislative power , although it is known to all that its acts were merely recommendations to the States : - still the theory of Mr. Webster is encumbered with anothci apparently insurmountable difficulty , which renders it an unsafe basis , upon which to rest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act or instrument should possess obligatory force as a law , it is not only necessary that it should be the act of one people , but that it should express the will of thi* people in the Jbrin previously prescribed for the making of laws . Now the adoption of the Constitution was not an exercise of the ordinary legislative power of the Government of the old Confederacy , ( if Government there was , ) still less of the new Government which it was intended to establish ; but was an act in its nature revolutionary , by which the members of the Confederacy agreed to abandon the mode previously in use for making laws , and to introduce another . The proceeding , supposing it to he the work of a community already in existence , was precisely similar in its character and in the nature of the obligations imposed by it , to that by which States or individuals , mutually independent of each other , agree to form themselves into one body politic , to be governed by laws made in a certain way . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object of which is to determine the way in which the laws shall he made , is not itself , in the proper sense of the term , a law , and that , if binding at all , it must derive its obligatory force from a different principle . // The Constitution is in fact the source from which the laws derive their own obligatory character . They are binding as laws , solely because they wear the form prescribed by the Constitution for the expression of the xviii of the community . This is the proper and only test that is habitually employed by the citizen , in order to ascertain , whether a document , which is presented to him as a rule for his conduct , is obligatory as a law or not . To say that tbe Constitution is obligatory as a law , is to say , in other words , that it was formed and adopted in the mode prescribed by itself for the making of laws. -A law , in short , must be as such , the act of a government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , it follows of necessity that the instrument which constitutes a governm*wt , or in other words gives it existence , can not be a law . It is almost needless to add , that if the Constitution bad been a law , that is , an act of the Government , it would have become obligatory upon the whole people at one , and the same time , arid not successively upon each of the States as they respectively gave in a voluntary adhesion to it . The Constitution is , no doubt , enforced in the courts of justice in the same form in which the laws are enforced . It is described in one of its own articles , as a part of the Supreme Law of the land , arid is frequently called , as it is by Mr. Webster , a fundamental law . The same language has been applied to the written constitutions of other countries . That of the Netherlands , for example , takes in its French form the title of Loi Fondamentale. there is no more impropriety in the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) hrases as natural law , moral law , club law , or any other combination of terms in which the word law is included , and which nicans something entirely different from a law in the ordinary use of the word : but it should be distinctly understood , whenever the phrase is employed in scientific discussion , that constitutions , though described as Supreme or Fundamental Laws , emanate from a different authority , and are obligatory on a different principle from laws . Laws are the acts of governments ; constitutions are not and can not from their nature be the acts of governments , and if binding at all must of course be binding on another principle . It is obvious that this principle is and can be no other than that of compact . Individuals or States intending to form a new political society can not , until they have constituted it , act in that capacity . Each is still entirely independent of all the // rest , and can only be brought under any obligation by his own voluntary consent . Now consent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular purpose , is the essence of an agreement , contract or compact . A transaction of this kind , whether verbal or written , although the parties may be politically independent of each other , being fairly co*icluded , gives to each the rights over the others which result from its nature and condition , and becomes morally obligatory . Such is the character of the Constitution of the United States . It is a contract or compact , by which those States agree to constitute one body politic , under a particular form of government therein described . Hence , as we have said before , the consent of each State was required , and no State was considered as bound by the Constitution , until its adhesion had been expressly given . It would be obviously incorrect to describe the agreement to farm a constitution ,  --  whether considered as implied in the whole course of the proceedings , or as expressed in the preamble , - as the only thing about the transaction having the nature of a compact . it is , on the contrary , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement of the parties was not to form A constitution , but to form THE particular constitution which they did form , and no other ; that it was solely on condition that they should have a constitution of this particular kind , that they agreed to form a new political society , and that , if there had been the least uncertainty as to the kind of constitution they were to have , not one of the old thirteen States would have committed itself to any agreement whatever on the subject . The whole transaction was therefore in the nature of a compact : it belong , s to the class denominated social compacts , that is , compacts for the purpose of constituting new political societies the instrument entitled the Gonstitia ion of the United States is a written record of it , and is one of the very few examples in the history of the world , in which a compact of this description has been expressly concluded , and recorded at the time in a written form . For these reasons , fortified as they are by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calhoun , the number of which might , if necessary , be indefinitely extended , we fully agree with him in the opinion that the Constitution , though properly enough denominated a fundamental law , is essentially in its nature a compact . We also tlink with him , that the parties to this compact were the several States , acting as dis // tinct and politically independent communities . Thus far he appears to have made out his case in a pretty satisfactory manner . In attempting to establish his other proposition ,  --  that the States remained after the conclusion of the compact distinct and politically independent communities , as they were before , and that they are not now and never have been at any stage of their existence combined into one political society or people , be is far from being equally successful . 1 . On these points his doctrine is , in the first place , very fully and satisfactorily refuted by his own admissions . He tells us , for example , unequivocally and repeatedly , in his correspondence with Governor Hamilton , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system is a constitution and a government , while the old Confederation was not a constitution or a government . ' He admits , that the Government constituted hy the present system , bears the same relation to the parties subject to it , which the State Governments bear to their citizens respectively , or in general which all governments bear to the communities over which they are established . Again : he remarks in his letter to Governor Hamilton , that the General Government is the joint organ of all the States , confederated into ONE GREAT COMMUNITY ; ' and that , in the exercise of the delegated powers , the Union is no longer regarded in reference to its parts , but as forming ONE GREAT COMMUNITY , to be GOVERNED BY A COMMON WILL . ' Now the proper definition of the term people or nation , is a political society or community , subject to a common government ,  --  governed by a common will : an agreement having , for its object to constitute such a political society or community , whether made hy previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social compact . In admitting , therefore , as Mr. Calhoun does , not accidentally or unguardedly , but fully , freely , repeatedly and intentionally , that the United States constitute one great community under a common government , he has , as we conceive , entirely estopped himself ( to use his own language , ) from denying that they constitute one people ; that the Constitution is a social compact ; or that the parties who framed it , whether States or individuals , are subject to the obligation naturally devolving upon all who live under a common government , to obey the laws made by that government , except in thi extreme cases that justify rebellion . // The distinction taken in the resolutions between a social and a constitutional compact is somewhat curious ; and , as farther developed in the remarks made ' by Mr. Calhoun on presenting them , may be worth a moment 's attention . To call the Constitution a social compact , ' said the Ex-Vice-President , is the greatest possible abuse of language .. No two things can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole science of politics more perfectly definite in its meaning , than the Social Compact . It means that association of individuals , founded on the implied , assent of all its members , which precedes all government , , and from which government or the ' Constitutional compact springs . ' It is accordingly affirmed in the first resolution , that the United States are parties to a Constitutional Compact , and expressly denied in the third* , . that they have ever been or are now connecte ( l on the principle of a social one . As Mr. Calhoun appears to suppose that the meaning of the phrase Social Compact is perfectly well settled , it is rather ' remarkable , that he should have given an explanation of it which is not only , as we think , incorrect , but exceedingly indefinite and vague . It is that association of individuals which precedes all government , , and from which government or the constitutional compact springs . " Here we are told , that the social compact is an association of individuals ,  --  - that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that government , . or the constitutional compact , springs from it . But as to its character and purpose ,  --  as to what it is , or the object for which it is formed , we are as much in the dark as before . On our understanding of the phrase , a Social Compact is an agreement by which the contracting parties ,  --  whoever or whatever they may be ,  --  forrn themselves into a body politic under a common ' government . If we are right in this ,  --  and ' we are inclined ' to think that the correctness of the definition will not be disputed by judicious men of any party ,  --  it follows , that a social compact is not necessarily an association of individuals . Every one knows that political societies are much more frequently formed by the aggregation of previously existing communities , than by associations of previously independent individuals ,  - -  that the former is , in fact , one of the ordinary and usual methods of creating new political societies , while of the latter met1io* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xx orld* // The explanation given by Mr. Calhoun of this perfectly de* finite term is therefore incorrect as well as vague . What his understanding of its meaning really is , is quite uncertain . As far as we can gather his intentions from his language , he appears to suppose that a social compact is an agreement , by which the contracting parties , ( who , as he erroneously thinks , must be necessarily individuals ) , form themselves into a political society ; hut the conditions , UpOn which this transaction has been concluded , or in other words , the principles on which the society so constituted is to be governed , are the ob* jects of another subsequent agreement , to which he gives the name of the &amp;onstitutional compact . This is the only rational and consistent construction , that we can find for the loose expressions , that the Social Compact is that association which precedes all government , and from which government or the constitutional compact springs . Now , if this be the correct construction of Mr. Calhoun 's language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his principle is not only wholly untenable in itself , but that , if it could be maintained. , it would be fatal to his own argument , find amount to a concession by him of the whole ground in dispute . To attempt to separate the agreement by which the contracting parties form themselves into one political society , and that by which they regulate the mode in which the society so constituted shall be governed , is , in the first place , incorrect in the theory of the subject . The mode in which they are to be governed , is , as we have already remarked , the principal condition upon which the parties to a social compact agree to form one political society . No collection , whether of States or individuals , would ever give their consent to the naked proposition to form a political society , leaving it uncertain whether they were afterwards to be governed by a military despot , a Pope , a Council of Ten. , or an elective President and Congress In each particular case , the contracting parties desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main object in entering into 5itn agreement to constitute a new political society , is to establish a government of the form which they consider as preferable to any other . The agreement to form a political society , and to regulate the manner in which it shall be governed , are therefore necessarily parts of one and the same transaction ; and the attempt of Mr. Calhoun , to distinguish between a Social and a constitutional Compact , is wholly unsuccessful . // But secondly , the distinction , if tenable , would be fatal to his own argument , and would amount to a concession by him of the whole ground in dispute . The social compact , says Mr. Cal-. houn , is that association of individuals which precedes all government , and from which government or the constitutional compact springs . On this theory the constitutional compact , - that which regulates the form of the government ,  --  follows in the order of time and springs from the social compact . This being the case , the existence of a constitutional compact necessarily presupposes and proves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The existence of the offspring presupposes and proves that of the parent . If the United States be , as Mr. Calhoun affirms , parties to a constitutional compact , and if , as he also affirms , the constitutional compact follows in the order of time , and springs from the social compact , the necessary conclusion is , that the United States are also parties to a social compact . To affirm that they are parties to a constitutional compact , and after saying that a constitutional compact follows in the order of time and springs from the social compact , to deny in the same breath that they are parties to a social compact , is one of the most curious and glaring examples of inconsistency in reasoning , which we recollect to have met with ; one which we certainly should not have expected to find , in the work of so acute a metaphysician as the Senator from South Carolina . The distinction taken by Mr. Calhoun between a social and a constitutional compact , is therefore not only untenable in itself , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In recognising as he does the existence of a constitutional compact between the several United States , he recognises on his own principles , the existence of a social compact between them , and this , as he also tacitly admits , is wholly inconsistent with the pretensions of South Carolina . Mr. Calhoun is , therefore , entirely precluded and estopped by his own admissions , from denying that the United States constitute one people ; that the Constitution is a social compact , or that the parties who framed it , whether States or individuals , are subject to the obligation naturally devolving upon all who live under a common government , to obey the laws made by that government , except in the extreme cases that *justify rebellion . But * . Independently of any admissions , the doctrine of the Ex // Vice-President is upon the face of it openly absurd and self-contradictory . The precise object of an agreement by which the parties form themselves into one community , under a common government , is to terminate their previous state of political independence or sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as we have said , its precise object ;  --  the very purpose and end for which it is performed ; . - just as it is the end and object of a contract of marriage to terminate the condition of single blessedness , in which the parties were living before . In both cases the parties avow and publish to the world , that for certain reasons which they state , they mean to change , and do in fact , in the way which is acknowledged to be proper and valid for this purpose , change in a very important particular their previous condition , and assume a new one . To pretend in either case that the parties , after such a public act and declaration , admitted to be valid and regular in its way , retain their previous condition , with all its incidents , in the precise point in which they intended to change , and did in fact change it , is a piece of wanton absurdity that one would rather have expected from a petulant school-boy than a grave , experienced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the exact amount of the assertion that the States , after forming themselves into one community under a common government , retain with all its incidents the political independence or sovereignty , which they possessed before . The assertion is , as we have said , self-contradictory , and requires no other refutation than a mere statement of its terms . In our preceding article , we accordingly rested the case upon this simple issue . It may , however , be thought due to the respectability of the advocates of the doctrine in question , to notice the course of argument , by which a theory in itself so plausible and reasonable , was supported in the Senate . After establishing his preliminary propositions as laid down in the first resolution : viz , that the Constitution is a compact ; that it was formed and adopted by the States as distinct t*ommunities ; and that it is binding upon them as such : - in all which we agree with him , Mr. Calhoun proceeded to draw what he calls conclusions from these premises , in the following terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of controversy , every allegation contained in the first resolution : - That // the Constitution is a compact formed by the people of the several States , as distinct political communities , subsisting and binding between the States in the same characters ; which brings me to the consideration of the consequences which may be fairly deduced in reference to the character of our political system , from these established facts . The first , and most important , is , that they conclusively establish that ours is a federal system ,  --  a system of States , arranged in a federal Union , and each retaining its distinct existence and sovereignty . Ours has every attribute which belongs to a federative system . It is founded on compact : - it is formed by sovereign communities :  --  and is binding between them in the sovereign capacity . I might appeal , in confirmation of this assertion , to all elementary writers on the subject of government ; but will content myself with citing one only . Burlamaqui , quoted with approbation by Judge Tucker , in his Commentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Here Mr. C. read from Tucker 's Blackstone as follows : ) " Political bodies , whether great or small , if they are constituted by a people formerly independent , and under no civil sub .. jection , or by those who justly claim independency from any civil power they were formerly subject to , have the civil supremacy in themselves , and are in a state of equal right and liberty with re .. spect to all other States , whether great or small . No regard is to be had in this matter to names ; whether the body politic be called a kingdom , an empire , a principality , a dukedom , a country , a republic or a free town . If it can exercise justly all the essential parts of civil power within itself independently of any other person or body politic , and no other hath any right to rescind or annul its acts , it has the civil supremacy , h*w small soever its territory may be , or the number of its people , and has all the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their being distinct political bodies from each other , is not obstructed by any alliance or confederacies whatsoever , about exercising jointly any parts of the supreme power , such as those of peace and war , in league offensive and defensive . Two States , notwithstanding such treaties , are separate bodies and independent . " These are , then , only deemed politically united when some one person , or council , is constituted with a right to exercise some essential powers for both , and to hinder either from exercising them separately . If any person or council is empowered to exercise all these essential powers for both , they are then one State : such is the State of England and Scotland , since the act of union made at the beginning of the eighteenth century , whereby // the two kingdoms were incorporated into one , all parts of the supreme power of both kingdoms being thenceforward united , and vested in the three estates of the realm of Great Britain ; by which entire coalition , though both kingdoms retain their ancient laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incorporated , as the several petty kingdoms which composed the heptarchy , were before that period . " But when only a portion of the supreme civil power is vested in one person or council for both , such as that of peace and war , or of deciding controversies between different States , or their subjects , whilst each within itself exercises other parts of the supreme power , independently of all the others ; in this case they are called systems of states ; which Burlamaqui defines to be an assemblage of perfi*ct governments , strictly united by some common bond , so that they seem to make but a single body with respect to those affairs which interest them in common , though each preserves its sovereignty , full and entire , independently of all others . And in this case , he adds , the confederate states engage to each other only to exercise with common consent , certain parts of the sovereignty , especially that which relates to their mutual defence against foreign enemies . But each of the confederates retains an entire liberty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty , which are not mentioned in the treaty of Union , as parts that ought to be exercised in common . And of this nature is the American Confederacy , in which each State has resigned the exercise of certain parts of the supreme civil power which they possessed before , ( except in common with the other States included in the confederacy , ) reserving to themselves all their former powers , which are not delegated to the United States by the common bond of Union . " A visible distinction , and not less important than obvious , occurs to our observation in comparing these different kinds of union . The kingdoms of England and Scotland are united into one kingdom : and the two contracting States , by such an incorporate union , are , in the opinion of Judge Blackstone , totally annihilated , without any power of revival ; and a third arises from their conjuncfion , in which all the rights of sovereignty , and particularly that of legislation , are vested . From whence he expresses a doubt , whether any infringement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself dissolve the union of those kingdoms ; though he readily admits , that in the case of afederate alliance , such an infringement would certainly rescind the compact between the confederate States . In the United States of America , on the contrary , each State retains its own antecedent form of government ; its own laws , subject to the // alteration and control of its own legislature only ; its own executive officers , and council of state ; its own courts of judicature , its own judges , its own magistrates , civil officers , and officers of the militia ; , and , in short , its own civil State , or body politic in every respect whatsoever . And by the express declaration of the 12th article of the amendments to the Constitution , the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . in Great Britain , a new civil state is created by the annihilation of two antecedent civil states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration is provided for the joint exercise of such of their several powers , as can be more conveniently exercised in that mode than any other ; leaving their civil state unaltered ; and all the other powers , which the States antecedently possessed , to be exercised by them respectively , as if no union or connexion were established between them . " The ancient Achaia seems to have been a confederacy founded upon a similar plan ; each of those little states had its distinct possessions , territories , and boundaries ; each had its Senate or Assembly , its magistrates and judges ; and every state sent deputies to the general convention , and had equal weight in all determinations . And most of the neighboring states which , moved by fear of danger , acceded to this confederacy , had reason to felicitate themselves . " These confederacies , by which several states are united together by a perpetual league of alliance , are chiefly founded upon this circumstance , that each particular people choose to remain their own masters , and yet are not strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such an agreement usually is , that they shall not exercise some part of the sovereignty there specified , without the general consent of each other . For the leagues to which these systems owe their rise , seem distinguished from others , ( so frequent among different states ) chiefly by this consideration ; that in the latter , each confederate people determine themselves , by their own judgment , to certain mutual performances , yet so , that in all other respects they design not in the least to make the exercise of that part of the sovereignty , whence these performances proceed , dependent on the consent of their allies , or to retrench any thing from their full and unlimited power of governing their own states . Thus we see that ordinary treaties propose , for the most part , as their aim , only some particular advantage of the states thus transacting ,  --  their interests happening at present to fall in with eaGh other ,  --  but do not produce any lasting union as to the chief management // of affairs . Such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1778 , by which , among other articles , it was agreed , that neither of the two parties should conclude either truce or peace with Great Britain , without the formal consent of the other first obtained , and whereby they mutually engaged not to lay down their arms , until the independence of the United States should be formally or tacitly assured by the treaty or treaties which should terminate the war . Whereas , in these confederacies , of which we are now speaking , the contrary is observable , they being established with this design , that the several States shall forever link their safety one with another , and , in order to their mutual defence , shall engage themselves not to exercise certain parts of their sovereign power , otherwise than by a common agreement and approbation . Such were the stipulations , among others , contained in the atticles of confederation , and perpetual union between the American States , by which it was agreed , that no State should , without the consent of the United States in Congress assembled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or enter into any conference , agreewent , alliance , or treaty with , any king , prince , or state ; nor keep up any vessels of War , or body of forces , in time of peace ; nor engage in any war , without the consent of the United States in Congress assembled , unless actually invaded ; nnr grant commissions to any ships of war , or letters of marque and reprisal , except after a declaration of war , by the United States in Con .. gress assembled ; with several others ; yet each State , respectively , retains its sovereignty , freedom , and independence , and every power , jurisdiction , and right , which is not expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled . The promises made in these two cases here compared , run very differently ; in the former thus : " I will join you in this particular war , as a confederate , and the manner of our attacking the enemy shnll be concerted by our common advice ; nor will we desist from war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the independence of the United States , be obtained . " In the latter , thus : " None of us who have entered into this alliance will m*d ( e use of our right as to the affairs of war and peace , except by the general consent of the whole confederacy . " We observed before , that these unions submit only some certain parts of the sovereignty to mutual direction . For it seems hardly possible that the affairs of different States should have so close a connexion , us that all and each of them should look on it as their interest to have no part of the chief government exercised without the general concurrence . The most convenient method , therefore , seems to be , that the particular States reserve to themselves *li // those branches of the supreme authority , the management of which can have little or no influence in the affairs of the rest . " - ( Mr . Calhoun proceeded . ) If we compare our present system with the old Confederation , which all acknowledge to have been federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the attributes which belong to that form of government , as fully and compktely as that did . In fact , in this particular , there is but a single difference , and that not essential , as regards the point immediately under consideration , though very important in other respects . The Confederation was the act of the State governments , and formed an union of governments . The present Constitution is the act of the States them*. selves , or , which is the same thing , of the people of the several States , and forms an union of thei*n as sovereign communities . The States , previous to the adoption of the Constitution , were as separate and distinct political bodies as the governments which represent them , and there is nothing in the nature of things to prevent them from uniting under a compact , in a federal Union , without being blende&amp; in one mass , any more than uniting the governments themselves , in like manner , without merging them in a single Government . To illustrate what I have stafed , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between agents ,  --  the present Constitution between the principals themselves : - or , to take a more analogous case , one is a league made by ambassadors , the other a league made by sovereigns ;  --  the latter no more tending to unite the parties into a single sovereignty than the former . The only difference is in the solemnity of the act and the force of the obligation . There indeed results a most important difference , under our theory of government , as to the nature and character of th' act itself , whether executed by the States themselves , or by their governments ; but a result , as I have already stated , not at all affecting the question under consideration , but which will throw much lKht on a subject , in relation to which I must think the Senator from Massachusetts has formed very confused conceptions . The Senator dwelt much on the point , that the present system is a Constitution and a Government , in contradistinction to the old Confederation , with a view of proving that the Constitution was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that our present system is a Constitution and a Government , and that the former , the ' old Confederation , was not a Constitution or Government : - not , however , for the reason which he assigned , that the former was a compact , and the latter not ; but from the difference of the origin , from which the two compacts are derived . // According to our American conception , the people alone can form constitutions or a government , and not their agents . It is this difference , and this alone , which makes the distinction . Had the old Confederation been the act of the people of the several States , and not of their governments , that instrument , imperfect as it is , would have been a Constitution , and the agency , which it created to execute its powers , a government . This is the true cause of the difference between the two acts , and not that in which the Senator seems to be bewildered . ' In the closing passage of this extract , the Ex-Vice-President appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their sovereign capacity , and not through the agency of their governmesits* is necessarily a constitution . It would be easy to show that , in regard to this matter , the party bewildered is not the Senator from Massachusetts . A State can act in its sovereign capacity , that is , as a State , only through its Government . If the individuals or other members composing a state , undertake to form a new constitution , they relinquish , ipso facto , their sovereign capacity , in order to make as individuals a new compact , by the effect of which they will recover that sovereign capacity in a new shape . Every such act is in its nature revolutionary , and must , of necessity , be performed by persons and parties in their individual character . But this is a point not at all material to the present purpose . As respects the reasoning contained in the above extract , it is only necessary to say , that the effect of every compact , whether made by states or individuals , must be determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the effect of other compacts , of a different character , made at other times and places , and in other conditions . States which form themselves into a confederacy , retain their political independence , and come under no other obligations , than . such as result from a league or alliance of this description . Such was the case with the United States under the old Confederation , and such were the cases to which the remarks of Burlamaqui , quoted in the above extract , were intended to apply . On the other hand , states which form themselves into one community under a common government , contract the obligations which result from a compact of this description . The opinion of Burlamaqui , ( in itself of little importance , ) is , therefore , not to the ptirpose . The only authority which accompanies the extract , as that of the author , Judge Tucker , a well-known partisan of // the State-right doctrine , in its false and exaggerated fornt In the remarks which Mr. Calhoun has added to the extract , he tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constitution , were separate and distinct political bodies , and that there was nothing in the nature of things to prevent them from uniting under a compact , in a Federal Union , without being blended into one mass . ' This is perfectly true ; the States were , in fact , united in a Federal Union , without being blended into one mass , under the old Confederacy : there was nothing in the nature of things to prevent them from making a new compact of the same description . But this is not to the purpose . What they might have done is one thing : what they did , another . The question is , did they , when they adopted the Constitution , form a new compact , similar in its character and effects to the articles of the old Confederacy ; or did they form a different one ? Mr. Calhoun himself gives us the answer in the same extract . I coilcede to the Senator , that our present system is a Constitution and a Government , and that the former , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Government . ' There was nothing in the nature of things to prevent them from adopting either of these systems at their discretion . If they had chosen the confederacy , they would have retained their political independence , and not been blended into one mass . As it happened , they preferred the Constitution , and took it , of course , with all the usual and necessary incidents . In this debate , as in most other discussions of the same question , the mystical terms sovereign and sovereignty performed their usual office of spreading confusion and uncertainty over the whole matter . Although the States , by the admission of Mr. Calhoun , have formed themselves into one great community , under a common Government , they still retain their sovereignty , and the Union is , of course , nothing more than a league or alliance of sovereign powers . In spite of all that has been said , I maintain , ' says he , in his speech on the Revenue Collection Bill , that sovereignty is in its nature indivisible . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well speak of half a square or half a triangle , as of half a sovereignty . A sovereign may delegate his powers to be exercised by as many agents as he may think proper , under such conditions , and with such limitations as he may impose ; but to surrender any portion of his sovereignty to another , is to annihilate the whole . ' // It is not a little curious , that the phrases which Mr. Calhoun here introduces as incongruous and self-contradictory , for the purpose of illustrating the supposed incongruity of a divided sovereignty , are perfectly correct and intelligible , and analogous to others , that are in familiar use . There is no more difficulty in conceiving of half a square , or of half a triangle , than there is in conceiving of a semi-circle , which every schoolboy has in his case of mathematical instruments . So much for the illustration , and as to the theory illustrated , it is obvious , that the sovereign power , that is , the power of making laws for all the *rdinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible of division into as many different parts , as there are laws to be made . The supreme or sovereign power in a State means , in the proper and natural acceptation of the term , the highest power ,  --  the power paramount to all others ; that is , the power of making and executing laws , which is inherent in all communities , and which is habitually exercised through the agency of the legislative , executive and judiciary departments of the Government . It is perfectly conceivable in theory , that a community should retain in its own hands the power of making a part of the laws , and surrender the power of making others , although it is apparent , that such a surrender could only be made with prudence and safety to a larger community , of which the one surrendering was itself to form a part . The existence of such a division is expressly provided for in the political system of the United States . Our institutions , State and Federal , recognise in the States the right of exercising legislative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great body politic , composed of all the States , the right of exercising these powers for certain other purposes . The sovereignty is therefore divided. , When Mr. Calhoun speaks of sovereignty as a thing in its nature indivisible , he probably attaches to the word some vague and indefinite sense , entirely distinct from that which it - bears in correct usage , and which he would find it difficult to render intelligible to himself or others . Mr. Tazewell is equally clear upon the point that sovereignty is indivisible . Sovereignty , like truth , is an indivisible unit . ' If the States have ever surrendered the smallest fractional part of their sovereignty , they thereupon ceased to be sovereign . Show me the transfer by the States of any portion of the sovereignty , and I willingly admit that all of it is lost. * This , however , is denied , on the groLmd that sovereignty is not one // 230 July , of the powers expressly granted in the Constitution , and that all  |p6wers  , not expressly granted in the Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People . If the author of this Proclamation had asserted , that the several States , by the Federal Constitution , had parted with much of their power , jurisdiction and authority , he would have asserted a fact , that no one ever has , or probably ever will deny ; because it is a truth obvious to all who read that instrument . The only question is , do the powers , thereby transferred , comprehend sovereignty ? If they do , then the Government of the United States , the assignee of these powers , is a sovereign . But if they do not , that government is not a sovereign ; and as this Constitution does not profess to transfer any power , jurisdiction or authority , to any other , than to the government which it creates , the former possessors must still retain their sovereignty , this Constitution non obstante . This results from the very nature of this Constitution , that all admit to be a grant of enumerated powers ; and which , therefore , can not convey what it does not enumerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say , such as are not granted in terms , but are necessary to give effect to others which are so granted , strictly speaking , do not exist under this Constitution . Because , all such powers are given , expressly , by the seventeenth paragraph of the eighth section of its first article ; and of course are not implied powers . Nothing could better illustrate the excessive jealousy that dictated the instrument , than this simple fact ; or prove more conclusively , that the sovereignty , which the Proclamation , in this part of it , concedes to have formerly abided in thc States , could not pass to the Government of the United States , under this Constitution . Because sovereignty is no where therein granted in terms ; and it can not be believed , that when powers actually " necessary and proper for carrying into execution " other powers granted expressly , are not left to necessary implication , but are made the subjects of a positive grant , that sovereignty , the greatest of all human powers , would he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant of a few only of its many incidents , and these not necessary to its existence . The shadow may follow the substance by which it is caused , but that substance can never follow its own shadow , except when hurried on by the crazed brain of a madman . But this is not all . Notwithstanding it was conceded on all hands , that the Federal Constitution was but a grant of enumerated powers , and of course would convey only what it enumerated , yet such was the jealousy felt by the States , that while // 1833 231 adopting it , a number of the different Conventions by whom it was ratified , to guard against the possible misconstruction and abuse of the powers therein granted , proposed various amendments to it . In consequence of this , the very first Congress which assembled under this Constitution , at its very first session , acting under the authority given to them by the fifth article , proposed these amendments to the Legislatures of the several States , by whom ten of them were ratified , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thereupon , became " valid to all intents and purposes , as parts of this Constitution . " Two of them , the ninth and the tenth , are in the following words : Nintlt. - ' - The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the People . Tentk. - The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the People . ' Our readers will , we think , agree with us , that it would be difficult to argue an important point in a less conclusive and satisfactory way . Sovereignty , ' according to the account given of it by Mr. Tazewell himself , is supremacy ; a sovereign is one who is over all his subjects ,  --  who may of right do within his own dominions all that is physically possible , and which does not contravene the will of his God . ' This definition , though not very precise or elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order to render it complete and intelligible , it is only necessary to add , that the will of the sovereign , in order to he obligatory upon the subject or citizen , must be declared in the form prescribed by the Constitution , written or unwritten , for this purpose ; and that , when so declared , it is denominated law . Sovereignty , therefore , or the supreme power in a State , is neither more nor less than the power inherent in every community of making and executing laws for its own government . It includes , under one comprehensive term , the legislative , executive , and judiciary powers , that are habitually exercised through the corresponding departments of the government , as these powers originally existt ogether in the hands of the people . This , we say , is Mr. Tazewell 's definition of sovereignty developed and completed ; and the meaning of the term being thus settled , it is easy to see whether the thing intended is , or is not indivisible , and whether it has or has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs no argument to show that the power of making laws is , // as we have already remarked , susceptible of division into a many parts as there are laws to be made ; and it is equally certain , that the power of making a very large portion of the laws necessary for the government of the country , is granted by the States in the Constitution , and is habitually exercised by the Government of the United States . It is granted , how-* ever , not to that Government , but to the great community , as Mr. Calhoun correctly calls it , of the United States . The remark of Mr. Tazewell , in the above extract , that the Constitution does not profess to transfer any power , jurisdiction , or authority , to any other , than to the Government which it creates , ' is singularly at variance with the real state of the case . Mr. Tazewell is himself the first to admit , or rather to proclaim and insist that the Government is a mere agent , exercising powers that belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exercised by the General Government , and provides the form in which this Government shall he con-* stituted by the States . What is this but a grant of this portion of the sovereign power by the States respectively to the United States , to be exercised , of course , by delegation , in the ordi-* nary way ? As Mr. Tazewell might possibly object to the manner in which we have d'eveloped and completed his definition of sove. * reignty , although we think it perfectly correct , and consistent with his own ideas , we will refer him to another test , furnished by himself , and which settles very decisively the question where the sovereignty actually resides . The right to create new , or to abolish former governments , is the sure index and test of sovereignty . Wherever a power exists in any country , which power is admitted by all of that country to possess the right of creating or abolishing the government of that country , this power must be superior to the government created by it. * self , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , the power of amending the Constitution , where ever it maybe lodged , carries with it the sovereignty . Where then does the power of amending the Constitution , and with it , the sovereignty , reside in our political system ? Mr. Tazexvell tells us himself , in the same connexion , that it is granted in the Constitution to the United States , to be exercised through the consent of three-fourths of the number . The great community of the United States is therefore , and accord . ' ing to his own account , the true , and only sovereign of th' // country ; and such is undoubtedly the fact . The Constitution recognises in the States , as distinct communities , the present possession of a certain portion of the sovereign power , and in the community of the United States the present possession of a certain other portion ; but in giving to the latter community a discretionary amending power , which may be exercised over each State without its consent , it , in fact , gives to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th' States , as distinct communities , of being always represented on a footing of equality in the Senate . This is , after all , the only division that really exists . Mr. Calhoun is pleased to say , that the amending clause is no more inconsistent , as has been supposed , with the sovereignty of the States , than any other contained in the compact , ' but has not condescended to illustrate or explain the remark , which will hardly be received for gospel upon the mere strength of his ipse dixit , in opposition to the plain and obvious truth of the case . For ourselves , we have no hesitation in repeating what we have already said in our preceding article on this subject , that if there were no other consideration applicable to it , the amending clause of the Constitution would be , of itself , entirely decisive of the whole question at issue . Having disposed , to his own satisfaction , of the matter of sovereignty , Mr. Calhoun finally reaches the last point in his doctrine , and the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose for which the claim of sovereignty is put in with so much zeal in favor of the States , is to secure to them the right of judging in the last resort , whether the acts of the General Government are , or are not obligatory , and of obeying them or annulling them accordingly , at discretion . On this point his remarks are as follows . Having now said what I intended in relation to my first resolution , both in reply to the Senator from Massachusetts , and in vindication of its correctness , I will now proceed to consider the conclusions drawn from it in the second resolution ; that the General Government is not the exclusive and final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to it , but that the States , as parties to the compact , have a right to judge , in the last resort , of the infractions of the compact , and of the mode and measure of redress . It can scarcely be necessary , before so enlightened a body , to premise , that our system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Governments ,  --  which , properly considered , form but one . The former , representing the joint authority of the States in their confederate capacity , . and the latter , that of each State separately . I have premised this fact , simply with a view of presenting distinctly the answer to the argument offered by the Senator from Massachusetts , to prove that the General Government has a final and exclusive right to judge , not only of its delegated powers , but also of those reserved to the States . That gentleman relies , for his main argument , on the assertion , that a government , which he defines to be an organized body , endowed with both will and power and authority , in proprio vigore , to execute its purpose , has a right inherently to judge of its powers . It is not my intention to comment upon the definition of the Senator , though it would not be difficult to show that his ideas of government are not very American . My object is to deal with the conclusion and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the right of judging of its powers , for which he contends . How then will he withhold , upon his own principle , the right of judging from the State Government , , which he has attributed to the General Government ? If it belongs to one , on his principle , it belongs to both , *  --  and if to both , , if they differ , the veto , so abhorred by the Senator , is the necessary result ; as neither , if the right be possessed by both , can control the other . The Senator felt the force of this argument , and in order to sustain his main position , he fell back on that clause of the Constitution , which provides , that " this Constitution , and the laws made in pursuance thereof , shall be the supreme law of the land . " This is admitted ; no one has ever denied that the Constitution , and the laws made in pursuance of it , are of paramount authority . But it is equally undeniable , that laws not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , . but are of no authority whatever ; being of themselves null and void ; which presents the question , who are to judge whether the laws be or be not pursuant to the Constitution , and thus the difficulty , instead of being taken away , is removed but onestep farther back . this the Senator also felt , and has attempted to overcome the difficulty , by setting up , on the part of Congress , and the Judiciary , the final and exclusive right of judging , both for the Federal Government and the States , as to the extent of their powers . But I contend that the States have a far clearer right to the sole construction of their powers , than any of the departments of the Federal Government can have ; this power is expressly reserved , as I have stated on another occasion , not only against the // several departments of the General Government , but against the United States themselves . I will not repeat the arguments which I then offered on this point , and which remain unanswered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of the views then taken , and which , if I am not mistaken , are conclusive on this point . ' Mr. Calhoun here quotes , in support of his opinion , passages from the ratification of the Constitution by the State of Virginia , and from the Virginia Resolutions of 1799 , which our limits compel us to omit , and proceeds as follows : But why should I waste words in reply to these or any other authorities , when it has been so c , Iearly established that the rights of the States are reserved against all and every department of the Government , that no authority in opposition can possibly shake a position so well established ? Nor do I think it necessary to repeat the argument which I offered , when the bill was under *iscussion , to show that the clause in the Constitution , which provides that the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity , arising under this Constitution , and to the laws and treaties made under its authority , has no bearing on the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court to decide a law to be unconstitutional , so far from being derived from this or any other portion of the Constitution , results from the necessity of the case , where two rules of unequal au thority come in conflict , and is a power belonging to all courts , superior and inferior , State and general , domestic and foreign . I have now , I trust , shown satisfactorily that there is no provision in the Constitution to authorize the General Government , through any of its departments , to control the action of the State , within the sphere of its reserved powers ; and that , of course , according to the principle laid down by the Senator from Massachusetts himself the Governmeiit of the States , as well as the General Government , has the right to determine the extent of ' their respective powers , without the right on the part of either to control the other . The necessary result is the veto , to which he so munch objects ; and to get clear of which , he informs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed . I know not whence he has derived his information , but my impression is very different , as to the immediate motives which led to the formation of that instrument . I have always understood , that the principal object was to give to Congress the power to regulate commerce , to lay impost duties , and to raise a revenue for the payment of the public debt and the expenses of the Governinent , and to subject the action of the citizens , individually , to // the operation of the laws , as a substitute for force . If the object had been to get clear of the veto of the States , as the Senator states , the Convention certainly performed their work in a most bungling manner . There was unquestionably a large party in that body , headed by men of distinguished talents and influence , who commenced early , and worked earnestly to the last , to deprive the States ,  --  not directly , for that would have been too bold an attempt , but indirectly ,  --  of the veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down every effort , however disguised and perseveringly made . I do not deem it necessary to give from the journals the history of these various and unsuccessful attempts , though it would afford a very instructive lesson . It is sufficient to say , that it was attempted by proposing to give Congress power to annul the acts of the States , which they might deem inconsistent with the Constitution ; to give to the President the power of appointing the Governors of the States , with a view of vetoing State laws through his authority ; and , finally , to give to the judiciary the power to decide controversies between the States and the General Government ; all of which failed ,  --  for tunately for the liberty of the country ,  --  utterly and entirely failed ; and , in their failure , we have the strongest evidence that it was not the intention of the Convention to deprive the States of the veto power . Had the attempt to deprive them of this power been directly made , and failed , every one would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of its existence . Now , I would ask , what possible difference can it make , in what form this attempt was made ? Whether by attempting to confer on the General Government a power incompatible with the exercise of the veto on the part of the States , or by attempting directly to deprive them of the right of exercising it . We have thus direct and strong proof , that , in the opinion of the Convention , the States , unless deprived of it , possess the veto power ; or , what is another name for the same thing , the right of nullification . I know that there is a diversity of opinion among the friends of State rights , in regard to this power , which I regret ; as I can not but consider it as a power essential to the protection of the minor interests of the community , and the liberty and the union of the country . It was the very shield of State rights ; and the only power by which that system of injustice , against which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arrested ; by which a system of hostile legislation , of plundering by law , which must necessariiy lead to a conflict of arms , can be prevented . But I rest the right of a State to judge of the extent of its reserved powers , in the last resort , on higher grounds ; - that the Constitution is a compact to which the States are parties , in their // sovereign capacity ; and that , as in all other cases of compact between parties having no common umpire , each has a right to judge for itself . To the truth of this proposition , the Senator from Massachusetts has himself assented , if the Constitution itself be a compact ,  --  and that it is , I have shown , I trust , beyond the possibility of doubt . ilaving established that point , I now claim , as I stated I would do in the course of the discussion , the admissions of the Senator , and , among them , the right of secession and nullification , which he conceded would necessarily follow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above remarks of the Ex-Vice-President , it is admitted that the Constitution , and the laws made in pursuance thereof , are of paramount authority . It is admitted , on the other hand , by all , that laws not made in pursuance of the Constitution are not binding , and the question is , therefore , narrowed down to this : who is to judge , whether the laws , made by the General Government , are or are not made in pursuance of the Constitution ? On this point , Mr. Calhoun appears to us to misapprehend a little the principles professed by the intelligent opponents of nullification . They do not , as we understand the matter , deny to the States the right of judging whether laws made by the General Government are or are not constitutional , nor that of judging of the extent of their own reserved powers . What they contend for is , that this power is to be exercised through the courts of justice , and that the courts of justice , whether State or Federal , are bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they may themselves declare to be made in pursuance of the Constitution , when they come into collision with those of the States . In our political system , the sovereign power ,  --  that is , the power of making and executing the laws ,  --  is divided between the great community ' of the United States , and the several States . In exercising the shares of the sovereign power respectively belonging to them , the United States and the several States proceed independently of each other , with a free and unlimited discretion as respects the extent of their powers . The Federal and State Governments make laws at discretion upon any subject , and in any way which they deem expedient . The Federal and State Courts decide , with equal freedom , upon the constitutionality of all these laws ; and having first settled the question , whether the laws applicable to the case , by whatever authority enacted , are or are // not constitutional , they then proceed to apply them , and if there be a collision between a Federal and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former , under the express provision of the Constitution . It is not true , therefore , that the opponents of nullification attribute to the United States an exclusive right of judging of the extent of their own powers , or deny to the States the right of judging of the extent of their reserved powers . They admit , with perfect readiness , the right of the States , to judge not only of the extent of their own reserved powers , but of the extent of the powers of the General Government . What they affirm is , that this judicial power can only be exercised by both through the appropriate department of the Government , that is , the judiciary . The nullifiers , on the contrary , claim for the legislative department of the State Governments , or for the inhabitants of the States assembled in convention in their individual capacity , the right of exercising judiciary functions in reference to the acts of the General Government . A proceeding of this kind may in an extreme case be substantially justifiable , but is clearly not contemplated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any regular government , and , whether justifiable or not , is essentially ex* tra-constitutional and of course revolutionary . In this , as in most other passages of his speeches and letters , there is much apparent inconsistency in the remarks of the Ex-Vice-President , and we can not well conceive in what way he can escape from the consequences of his own admissions . He tells us , for example , in the above extract , that the Governments of the States , as well as the General Government , have the right to determine the extent of their respective powers , without the right on the part of either to control the other . ' This is precisely the doctrine we have just laid down , excepting so far as the two governments exercise a mutual control over each other 's proceedings , through their respective courts of justice . But what follows ? The necessary result , says Mr. Calhoun , is the veto , to which the Senator* ( Mr. Webster , ) so much objects . By what process of reasoning a State veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrogate or annul the acts of the General Government , is made to be the necessary result of the principle that neither of the Governments has any control over the other , is to us , we confess , entirely incomprehensible . On the ordi ' nary modes of drawing conclusions , the necessary result of this principle would be , that neither Government had a right to // annul or confirm the acts of the other , and such we hold to be the case , excepting always the regular action of both through the courts . The General Government has no more right to annul an act of a State Government , than a State Government has to annul an act of the General Government . Each acts independently of the other , executes its laws by its own officers , and , in its ordinary proceedings , takes no official cognizance of the other 's existence . The State Governments often express opinions in the form of resolutions respecting the proceedings of the General Government , but no example has yet occurred of any attempt by any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding authority of a Federal law . Mr. Calhoun himself does not claim the abrogating power for the State acting through its Government , but for the State acting in Convention *n sts sovereign capacity ,  --  the only occasion , by the by , on which it does not act in its sovereign capacity . If the States really possessed any such power , they would , of course , exercise it through the appropriate department of their own Governments ; and they do , in fact , habitually exercise through their courts of justice the power of declaring the acts of the General Government , unconstitutional . In relying , for the exercise of the supposed abrogating or nullifying power , upon a form of proceeding , avowedly extra-constitutional and appropriated to the purpose of amending and altering the existing form of government , Mr. Calhoun tacitly admits , that the act contemplated is itself , as we have repeatedly described it , of an extra-constitutional , irregular and revolutionary character . In these , as in some of his former publications , Mr. Calhoun expresses the opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Courts jurisdiction over all cases arising under the Constitution , has no bearing on the question , and that the boasted power of the Supreme Court to decide a law to be unconstitutional , so far from being derived from this or any other portion of the Constitution , results from the necessity of the case , where there are two rules of unequal authority , and is a power belonging to all courts , superior and inferior , State and general , foreign and domestic . ' The general power of the Supreme Court to declare a law to be unconstitutional , is , no doubt , incidental , and possessed , as we have already said , in an equal degree by all the other Courts , whether State or Federal ; nor has it any direct bearing // on the question at issue . The obligation imposed upon the Supreme and all the other Courts , State and Federal , to consider the Constitution and the Federal laws , which they may themselves judge to be made in pursuance of it , as of paramount authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express provision of the Constitution : and that clause has a very important bearing upon the question at issue ; because it proves that all the Courts , State and Federal , are bound , in the regular exercise of their authority , and with the aid , if necessary , of the whole military force of the country to prevent and punish any attempt , made under pretext of State authority , to resist a Federal law . There are some other points of great interest , connected with this subject , to which we would willingly invite the attention of our readers ; but the length to which this article has already extended itself , reminds us that it is high time to draw it to a close . We have thought it the more necessary to discuss the question of the mutual relations of the Union and the States at this time , because the speech of Mr. Webster , which was justly regarded , in point of ability and importance , as the leading argument in defence of the constitutional side , did not appear to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , feel much diffidence in dissenting from the opinion of this deservedly eminent jurist and statesman , but the most powerful minds are subject to occasional error , especially when acting under the hurry and excitement that are necessarily incident to all debates upon matters of deep temporary interest . Of the speeches delivered in the Senate upon this subject , that of Mr. Rives , though inferior , perhaps , in power of logic and language to those of the two principal champions , is the one , which , in our judgment , approaches most nearly to a correct statement of the political doctrines applicable to the case . He holds , in substance , that the Constitution is a compact made by the States , as distinct communities , and binding upon them as such ; that by this compact , they formed themselves , for various important purposes , into one body politic or people7 under a common government , and granted to the body politic thus formed the share of the sovereign power , necessary for carrying these purposes into effect , reserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the remainder ; that , in the regular course of their proceedings , neither the States nor the Union have , as political bodies , any control over each // other , . exceptirrg through their respective courts of justice , and in particular , that the pretended right of the States to annul the ' laws of the General Government is entirely imaginary . These are substantially the principles which we have , however imperfectly , attempted to illustrate in this and our preceding article on the same subject . The most important of them , and those which have an immediate practical application , are held in common by all the opponents of the recently promulgated heresies . On some of the general principles , we have the misfortune to differ from gentlemen whose Opinion we habitually respect and commonly share . It is a satisfa9tion to us , that in regard to these points we are sustained by the concurrence of the illustrious Madison , perhaps on the whole the highest living authority on a question of constitutional law . His letter , appended to our article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think a correct exposition of the whole doctrine applicable to the case . It is expressly quoted by Mr. Rives , and seems to be the source from which he has derived his leading principles . We have heard it pronounced by competent judges the best of all Mr. Madison 's writings ; and , considering the advanced age at which it was pubiished , we can not but view it as one of the most remarkable productions of the day . We regard it as a fortunate incident in the course of our humble labors , to have furnished the occasion and the channel for bringing so valuable a document before the world . It will survive the present controversies , and be studied and admired hereafter as a simple , just , and elegant summary of the true constitutional faith : the quintessence in a few pages of the Federalist ; and the true exposition , by their author , of the often misrepresented Virginia Report and Resolutions . The remarks of Mr. Rives upon the importance of the States , considered as distinct communities , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are exceedingly judicious . At a period , when the federal principles of our institutions are violently attacked , there is some danger , that in the ardor of defending them , the value of those which regard the existence and political action of the States should be overlooked . Independently of the aid afforded by the States in the actual business of government , which could not possibly be carried on , at least under the present form , by one central power , Mr. Rives correctly describes them as furnishing , in their moral influence , a permanent peaceful check upon any tendency to en // croachment in the General Government , and in their ovganized military forces , a means of applying , with comparatively triflh*g inconvenience , the last remedy of an oppressed people ,  --  an actual revolution . Strong expressions of opinion by the States , upon the measures and policy of the General Government , far from being in any way objectionable , are among the most natural and healthy operations of our political system ; and should it ever become necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek redress by violence against the acts of the General Government , they would undoubtedly do it through the agen* of those of the States ; In the theory of our institutions , the States supply , as we think in a much superior form , the wholesome control over the operations and tendencies of the central government , which is furnished in other forms of government by orders of nobility , established churches , entails of property , and various other devices , all more or less inconsistent with natural justice . Nothing evinces more clearly the looseness of the notions of the Carolina statesmen upon this whole subject , than their attempts to confound the lawful exercise of state influence , to which we now allude , with their own illegal and unconstitutional pretensions . Thus the Resolves adopted by the Massachusetts Legislature at their last session , in which they denounced Mr. Verplanck 's Tariff Bill , then pending in the House of Representatives of the United Sttites , as ruinous to the interest of this Commonwealth , and subversive of the spirit of the Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heresy of nullification . A phrase , in the original report , which was struck out in the Senate , and which intimated that the passage of the bill might perhaps justify a resort to forcible resistance , was particularly objected to on this ground , even in Congress . A similar objection was made at the time to the Resolves of the same Legislature , in its preceding session , upon the North Eastern Boundary , which declared , among other things , that a cession by the General Government of any part of the territory of a State , without its consent previously obtained , would be null and void . It is hardly necessary to say , that whether the opinions thus expressed be correct or not , the expression of them by the Massachusetts Legislature was perfectly regular , and especially bore no resemblance or affinity whatever to nullification . The right of the people to express their opinion , // in any form in which they may choose to act , upon the politi* cal state of the country , and the measures of the Govemment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extreme oppression is equally so . The precise error of the partisans of nullification consists is clothing the States with a right ,  --  not of resisting in tases of extreme oppression , which nobody would contest ,  --  but of annulling , in the ordinary exercise of their own constitutional power , the acts of the General Government . It is sufficiently obvious that the proceedings of the Legislature of Massachusetts give no countenance to this pretension , and can be supposed to do so only by those who have no precise or correct notion of the character of either . We quote with pleasure , from the speech of Mr. Rives , the following remarks upon this branch of the subject . The moral interposition of the States , of which I have spoken , Mr. President , resting on the force of reason , and appeals to public opinion , will , I am persuaded , be found sufficient to re* dress every real grievance in the practical operations of our system , whenever it shall be resorted to by any respectable number of States , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this constitutional remedy does not merely depend 911 its intrinsic force , however great that must be in every free government ; but it derives a decisive efficacy from the knowledge of those ulterior , though dormant remedies , which lie in the hands of the States , above and beyond the Constitution . I refer , sir , to those natural rights and powerful means of self-defence and active resistance , which the States possess in their complete munleipal organizations , civil and military . It is in this view , that , in all the contemporary discussions on the adoption of the Constitution , the State Governments were constantly referred to as " affording , in every possible contingency , a complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the federal authority . " - Fed . No. 28 . They were to be ultimately not only the voice , but if necessary the arm , of the public discontent. - *Fed . No. 26 . The advanta- ' ges they possessed , through their civil and military organizations , for " combining all the resources of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicating with one another , and uniting their common forces for the protection of their common liberty , " " for collecting the public will , and directing the public force , " aU these advantages and means of self-defence , on the part of the States , were constantly referred to , and insisted on as demonstrating the extreme improbability of any serious attempt , by the General Government , upon the liberties of the people or the States , and the certain triumph of the public cause , should // such an attempt be made . The remedies , here alluded to , are clearly revolutionary ,  --  " above and beyond the Constitution . " They are such as , I do firmly believe , there never will be any occasion , in the progress of our system , to call into exercise . But their potential existence is of value , as giving certain efficacy to the moral remedies which are within the limits of the Constitution , whenever those milder remedies shall be resorted to by any respectable portion of the States ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must now terminate this protracted , we fear fatiguing article , and with it , we trust , for a long time to come , the dis cussion of the subject . The theory of government is undoulit .. edly the most important topic ( of a merely temporal character , ) that can engage the attention ; but after dwelling upon it with intense , at times almost agonizing interest , for several years , the community are now suite ready and well disposed to turn ,  --  were it only for variety ,  --  to c*thers , perhaps of less enduring consequence . Should the present fair prospects of general peace and prosperity continue , our citizens will probably , for many years to come , be more intent on inquiries connected with the direct practical improvement of their individual and social condition , than with any very deep researches into abstract theories* In the mean time , however , as we have already said , the results of the late discussions will remain on record , and will aid materially , in maturing the opinions of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis in the political affdirs of the country . They compose a wellfurnished arsenal , in which future patriots will find an armor of proo4 wherewith to defend the sacred entrenchments of the Constitution and the Union , against the attacks of future advocates of disorganization , under whatever specious name it may , for the time , be disguised . In the humble share , which we have ventured to take in these discussions , we have made it our principal endeavor to avoid the least appearance of exaggeration ; and to render the fullest justice to the rights and pretensions of the States , as well as to those of the Union . The slight* est disposition to ultraism on either side drives the other at once to the opposite extreme , and it is highly important to the success of the good cause , that it should always be defended , as far as may be , with the strictest moderation , and the nicest regard for conflicting interests , as well as with the necessary // vigor and decision . If , by our feeble efforts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public opinion upon a correct basis ,  --  to indicate a doctrine , which , while it provides a full security for the rights of the Union , may yet be received with some degree of favor by the moderate and ju .. dicious friends of State Rights ; we shall flatter ourselves that our labors have not been wholly in vain . Some of the distinctions on which we have insisted may appear to superficial readers insignificant and technical ; but all precise discussion wears this aspect in the eyes of those who are unaccustomed to it , or who feel no interest in the subject . The correct use of language is only another phrase for correctness of reasoning , and in questions involving such immense interests , a mistake in regard to the proper definition of a word may have an important bearing on the happiness of millions . Considered under this point of view , the observations we have made upon the distinction between a compact and a fundamental law , between a social and a constitutional compact , and upon the meaning of the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appear like merely verbal critici*m . The questions involved in these distinctions lie at the very foundation of political society , and accordingly as they are settled in one way or another , the whole fabric must assume a different shape and character . It is obvious , therefore , that a correct state of the public opinion respecting then , , is a matter of high importance to the successful operation of our political institutions . We are aware , however , that a correct state of the public opinion upon the theory of the Government , though doubtless important , is only one of the elements that contribute to keep it in successful operation . Constitations of government ,  - -  written or unwritten ,  --  as far as they have any pretension to substantial value and durability , are merely expressions of the condition of the community in which they are established , and the questions that arise in regard to the construction of written or unwritten constitutions are decided , not so much by mere discussion , although this is not to be neglected , as by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . If the Constitution of the United States , for example , was , at the time of its adoption , as we suppose , or rather know it to have been , a sort of compromise between the conflicting views of those who supported respectively the pretensions of the Union and the States , the extent to which // 246 The Union and the States . these pretensions may , in future , be admitted , and established , - in other words , the practical construction of the Constitution in this particular ,  --  . will he settled , not so much by reasoning upon the true meaning of the terms of that instrument , or the intentions of its framers , as by the progress of events and their influence on the comparative importance of the different elements , that make up the mass of our political institutions . If the tendency of events , as they occur , be to increase the importance of particular States as compared with that of the Union , and to keep the States apart from each other in feeling and interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Constitution will be construed in accordance with that doctrine . If , on the other hand , the tendency of events he to diminish the importance of the States , and to bring them constantly into closer union with each other , the popular sentiment , and with it the course of the administration of the Government will follow the same direction , and the Constitution will generally be construed in favor of the Union . Without undertaking to enlarge , at the close of a long article , upon a question which would furnish , of itself , an ample subject for a volume , we may venture to remark ,  --  and the view that we take of the subject is a source of much consolation and satisfaction to us ,  --  that the natural operation of almost all the changes and developments that are going on among us , is in favor of the Union . Take , for example , the continual increase in the number of the States , which is undoubtedly the most important and striking fact in the progress of our political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be composed only of the original thirteen States , and had , in other particulars , advanced as it has done and is likely to do , it is quite apparent that New York and Pennsylvania would have become at no distant period the Austria and Prussia of our confederacy , and that Congress would have rapidly degenerated into a mere German Diet , of no practical use , but to register the edicts of the Empire States . The constant accession of new members to the Union and the overpowering ascendency which some of them are acquiring in their giant youth over the mature greatness of the most powerful of their sisters , keep down the undue preponderance of the latter , and permit the principles that operate in favor of the Union to have their perfect work . Again : - if there were but little intercourse and communication for the ordinary purposes of life among the // 247 different sections of the country , the attachments of the people would naturally centre upon local objects : but when this intercourse and communication are exceedingly active , and yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constantly assuming a thousand new ramifications ; -.  - -  - when steamboats and rail-roads have almost annihilated time and space , and brought into daily or weekly contact places , that thirty years ago were considered as entirely out of reach of each other ; - when millions of newspapers maintain the most intimate sympathy through all the members of the body politic , so that a nerve which is touched at the centre vibrates almost simultaneously at all the extremities ; - when the whole North and East are pouring out one unceasing flood of emigration upon the West , and the whole West looking back with fond and heartfelt longing to the East , as a region hallowed by the most sacred and endearing associations ; - xvher1 , we say , all these living , substantial , and constantly strengthening bonds draw the States together , it is altogether idle to suppose , that any process of argument , any little fever of local excitement stirred up by personal ambition or inveterate prejudice , can put them asunder . It is easy enough for a skilful man to make the worse appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all is said , the seal remains upon the bond . If this counsel or this work be of men it will come to naught , but if it be of God ye can not overthrow it . If , as we believe to be the case , the progress of events , the force of circumstances , or ,  --  in more religious and truer language ,  --  the will of Providence has decreed that these States shall be united , it will require a power far greater than the eloquence of Calhoun or the chivalry of Hayne and Hamilton , to plant the palmetto or any other State or local banner upon the ruins of the Capitol . There is only one important circumstance in our condition , which may be expected to operate in a manner unfavorable to the permanence of the Union ; - we allude to the existence of slavery in the Southern States . This institution modifies very essentially the whole political economy of every society in which it prevails , and establishes , of course , a very marked line of distinction between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . If the interests of these two portions of the Union , considered as such , should ever be brought into collision , the necessary result would be an immediate separation . How far such a catastrophe is to be seriously apprebended , and what // will be the probable termination of the present excitement on the subject , in the English public on both sides of the Atlantic , are questions of the highest moment , which we have not now room to discuss , but which we hope to find some early opportunity of examining , with the attention they deserve . For the present , we can only say , that if the final triumph of the cause of liberty throughout the Christian world may fairly be considered as to a very great extent identified with the success of our political experiment , Liberty may well say , in the language of the Spanish proverb , Save me from my friends , and I will save myself from my enemies . ' Of the circumstances , that are likely to impede ,  --  perhaps defeat ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most threatening is the injudicious zeal of the advocates of the immediate abolition of slavery , especially in this country . If the question were confined to Great Britain , where it nffec*s immediately only a few remote and insignificant colonies , it would be of little moment ; and it is accordingly easy to conceive the apparent indifference , with which it is brought into view by the British ministry . In this country the case is different . Here the question involves interests of paramount magnitude ; it affects immediately the condition of half the Union ; it can not be agitated without shaking the whole political fabric to its foundation . We have been struck with alarm ,  --  we had almost said dismay ,  --  at the disposition , recently shown by some persons of intelligence and high respectability in this quarter , to encourage projects having in view the immediate abolition of slavery . It is not unnatural that reckless and unprincipled adventurers , who can only acquire consequence in times of trouble and confusion , should set such projects on foot ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share in the preservation of the public tranquillity , and who act habitually upon full deliberation , and with the best motives , should he so far deluded by a few specious phrases , as to lend them their names and influence . We entreat such persons to consider what they are doing , and to change their course , before it is too late . They may rest assured , that the formation and activity of a party in this quarter , avowedly bent upon the immediate abolition of slavery , would produce , in the Southern States , a feeling entirely incompatible with the existence of the Union . A separation of these States , we hardly need to say , would be attended with results , infinitely more disastrous to the cause of // freedom and humanity , than the continuance of slavery , as it now exists in this country , for a thousand years . But this is not the alternative presented . The institution of slavery contains within itself the principles of its own destruction , and will die a natural death at one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the use of any artificial expedients , is exceedingly doubtful . That it will not he expedited by the agitation of projects of immediate abolition in the free States , is a point that admits of no doubt , and one which we earnestly recommend to the attention of the real friends of humanity and the country*@@183058238.txt THIS 15 another precious specimen of the class of books with which John Bull is now regularly humbugged three or four times a year , under the name of observations on the state of society , manners and literature in the United States . There is one important omission in the titles of these works , which renders them in fact a complete fraud upon the public . If they were called , as they ought to be , observations on the state of society , manners , and literature in the taverns , steamboats and stage-coaches of the United States , honest John would know what he was buying , and whether he was likely to get his money 's worth .

" I was told , that a person in the States , who is dissatisfied* with his surname , ' ( Christian names can not it seems he al- ' tered ) can easily have it changed to another more suitable to his taste and inclination . It was a subject of'discussion some -- times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' person , as taking up his citizenship , needs only go to a particular office ' appropriated to this pui'pose , and having selected another appellation , get it registered as his family cognomen , whereby he and his children may be designated afterwards . This , if true , ' ( there is much virtue in this if ) must render the genealogies of families extremely difficult to trace : yet I must confess that it is very accommodating to persons of dubious* character , to whom a change of surname must be a great consideration . ' It is pretty plain that the Rev. Mr. Fidler was hoaxed in regard to this matter , and we incline to think that this was an accident which happened to him not unfrequently during his voyage to the States . His immediate friends must in fact have taken strange liberties with him in this way , as appears from the following anecdote , which he gives upon the authority of ' a divine ' of eminence . ' The clergy of America are prohibited by an act of the legis -- lature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not always the case , but was brought about after the following manner . One of the members of Congress , a clergyman , was very desirous that somepermanent provision should be made for the Episcopal Church , and was urgent with a friend of his , a member also , to use his endeavors to accomplish it .. This friend , probably annoyed by frequent solicitations , and being , as Americans in general are represented , a summer 's day friend , ( an evident improvement upon Gray 's summer friend ) ' promised ( upon ) his word of honor that he would do something for the church . Accordingly he mentioned this circumstance in Congress on the first opportunity , and , relating hix promise , moved that no clergyman should thenceforth sit in that House . The motion was carried by a vast majority , and clergymen , // with their golden anticipations , vanished from it forever . This was told me by a divine of eminence . ' After this , we shall doubtless hear no more of the famous journde des dupes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren probably amused himself with imposing upon the simplicity of our author as a piece of real history , is gravely quoted as such by the London Literary Gazette . It is time , however , to introduce our author more particularly to the acquaintance of the reader , who is not yet aware of his personal character and pretensions . We have the honor then to inform him , that the Rev. Isaac Fidler was intended for the church , although he has failed to obtain employment in his profession , and received his education under the Rev. James Tate of Richmond , whose name , ' he says , I found to be held in great esteem among scholars in America . ' We would suggest enpassant to Mr. Fidler , that there is a slight inconsistency between the purport of this passage , and that of another , in which he represents himself as telling Mr. John Pickering that he ( Fidler ) discovered the day after his arrival at New York , that there is no literature in the United States . ' Where there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no scholars , it is impossible that scholars can hold in great esteem the Rev. James Tate . For ourselves , we are free to say that we never heard of the learned gentleman , until his name was made known to us by the labors of his still more erudite pupil . The character and fortunes of the latter appear to resemble in some respects those of the celebrated tutor of Miss Lucy Bertram . The Rev. Mr. Fidler combines , in fact , the same pro-di-gi-ous e-ru-di-ti-on in the oriental languages with the same antique simplicity ,  --  to give it no other name ,  --  in regard to every thing that concerns the business of life , which distinguished the Rev. Mr. Sampson . He is not , however , quite so honest as the worthy Dominie , but evinces at times a decided disposition for drawing a long bow . He was educated , as we have said , for the church ; but not having obtained , and , as he tells us himself ' , not being likely to obtain preferment , undertook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men preparing for the service of the East India Company . In this occupation he also met with slight success , but does not inform us of the reasons of his failure . We only know , that finding no profitable employment at home , // he concluded to embark for this country , expecting to realize a rapid and brilliant fortune , by teaching Sanscrit and Uindostanee to the citizens of the United States . On arriving at New York , he determined , by way of recommending himself , to publish immediately a work , whether original or not does not appear , in the Sanscrit language , apparently forgetting that the people would not be able to read it , until they had first had the advantage of his instruction . This project was nipped in the bud by the wrongheadedness of the publisher to whom Mr. Fidler addressed himself , and who not only had no Sanscrit types at his disposal , but positively refused to import any , and even affirmed , that if Mr. Fidler would furnish him with a fount free of expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his opinion , was the demand for Sanscrit literature in this community . Our author 's other friends concurred in the main with the publisher , and advised him to give up the plan of a Sanscrit school and open one for the instruction of young men in Latin and Greek , and the other branches of a common liberal educa. * tion . This was a feasible common-sense scheme , which , had it been acted on , would doubtless have succeeded ; but after much inquiry and long deliberation , our author seems to have been fairly frightened out of it by a brother pedagogue , who gave him an alarming account of the loose state of discipline in the American schools , and of a battle royal which he had recently had with his own pupils . We extract the passage containing this account , which , in the newspaper phrase , is somewhat curious if true , ' but which merits confirmation . We incline to think that our author was in this , as in so many other instances , hoaxed by his fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more shrewdnesss than Mr. Fidler , and perhaps had it in view to keep a competitor out of the market . The story is as follows . I regret , " said he , " that I ever engaged in the school . I have been obliged to expel eight of my scholars . The noise and uproar of my school had been increasing every day , till at last it reached so high a pitch , that neither I nor my pupils could be distinctly heard . I reprimanded such as appeared most riotous , but some of them told me they would not be restrained by any English tyrant ; so I visited one of them with a stroke . Hereupon the whole school became a scene of anarchy . I was pelted on all sides , with books , and slates , and copies , and obliged to leave my seat . All the scholars pressed on , and endeavored // to strike or kick me . I was compelled to take refuge behind a pillar , against which I placed my back , and protected myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near enough I knock ' ed down , and kept the whole rabble of them at bay . At last , snatching a piece of wood out of the hands of the oldest , I put my pupils on the defensive ; and when I had completely subdued every appearance of resistance , I turned the ringleaders out of ' doors . Every symptom of insubordination has vanished ; but you can not conceive how much mortification I have ex , perienced* " ' The main difficulty with our author in regard to the establishment of a school , seems to have been an apprehension that he should not be permitted , by the usage of the country , to wield the birch with sufficient freedom , and should thus be materially abridged of what he appears to have regarded as the most enviable privilege of his office . We can not undertake to answer for the state of things in this respect at New York , but we can venture to assure him that in Boston , at least , be would have found no cause of complaint . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city schools , he would have no occasion to envy the whipping franchises of the masters of Westminster , Eton , or Harrow . Our boys are literally , what Sir Francis Bnrdett has so often declared his countrymen to be , a flogged nation . Such , if we are rightly informed , is the strictness of the discipline in our city schools , that the slightest failure in the performance of the literary exercises ,  --  an error , for example , in the spelling of a single word ,  --  is rewarded , argent comptant , by a most liberal administration of the birch or the ferule . A knowledge of this fact would have gone pretty far , we suspect , in removing the unfavorable impressions entertained by our author , respecting the state of professions , literature , manners and emigration in this country . For ourselves , with all our reverence for the ancient and venerable engines of scholastic rule to which we have just alluded , end*eared to us , as they are , by the tenderest recollections of early years , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cases in which there may be too much even of a good thing . We recommend it to the city authorities , ig as we greatly doubt , they honor us so far as to read our poor lucubrations , to take this hint , lest the people should in process of time give them another of a broader description . At the same time that he was making inquiry in regard to the practicability of establishing a school , Mr. Fidler , who has // more than one string to his bow , long as it is , was also endeavoring to procure a situation as a clergyman of the Episcopal Church , or a professor in a college . In these attempts , lie was not much more successful than in the other . Most of the persons to whom he addressed himself for advice and assistance , received his advances in a very discouraging style . He had brought , it seems , good recommendations from England ; but several persons hinted to him , that high recommendations from England are a man 's greatest detriment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number , assured him that such testimony is indispensable , ' and advised him to write home for more . This , in our opinion , is a much more plausible view of the matter than the other . Many persons , capable of giving correct information , candidly informed him that no man , whatever be his worth or acquireinents , has much chance of obtaining either collegiate or clerical promotion in the United States , unless he have personal influence with a majority of the electors . ' We must own that we do not well see how the case could be otherwise . Where places are conferred by election , it would seem that a candidate can only be successful by securing , in one way or another , a personal influence with a majority of the electors . He was repeatedly asked if he would accept a situation in Ohio , and as repeatedly declined such a place of exile . My habits had fitted me for other scenes , and required more domestic comforts than a wilderness can furnish . Besides , I was early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find for associates in places remote from the frontier . As I perceived that persons of the same standing , even in New York , are not the most amiable or liberable , I feared their manners would not be improved by contiguity to forests , bears , and Indians . ' This is rather an unkind cut at the reverend gentleman 's clerical acquaintance in New York , whose courtesy and kindness he elsewhere acknowledges in very warm terms . We would respectfully hint to Mr. Fidler that liberable , though it may doubtless pass for very good English at the school of the Rev. James Tate , has not yet gained admission into the American vocabulary . We would also suggest to him that , in the opinion of many discreet persons , Ohio is somewhat less remote from the frontier than New York . In the course of these inquiries the winter wore away , and our author , already discouraged by most of their results in regard to the probability of accomplishing his objects , finally met // with an English lady established at New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and return at once to England . This advice appears to have been decisive with him , and he accordingly made up his mind at once to leave this country . We may remark in general , that our author possesses a wonderful docility to counsels of any kind , and governs himself in most cases by the last he receives . At this period he met with another of l ) is countrymen , who advised him , before he returned , to visit Boston , which he forthwith did . We shall advert presently to his account of his adventures upon this excursion . On his return from Boston to New York , he waited on the British Consul , to obtain his assistance in making the arrangements for his departure , when the Consul strenuously urged him to try his luck in Canada . To Canada accordingly he went ,  --  coelum , si jusseris , ibit :  --  and by his account he found it in fact an earthly paradise . He had come out to the United States a thorough-going radical , ' but his experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tory , or in the modern phrase , Conservative : and as he could find nothing hut ignorance , selfishness , vice and misery in the Republic of the United Stauis* , hs w* quits* pr*epared to see every thing couleur-de-rose among our monarchical neighbors . On arriving in Canada , he accordingly forgets his fastidiousness about a residence remote from the frontier , among forests , bears , and Indians ; and after rejecting the pulpits of Ohio , actually accepts a missionary station at a place called Thornhill , on Yonge Street , on a salary of fifty pounds a year , where he established himself with his wife and family . This little place was too aristocratic to admit of the residence of any such plebeian characters as bakers or butchers , and Mr. Fidler 's lodgings being destitute of the accommodation of an oven , he was fain to subsist , as he best might , upon salted pork *nd unleavened bread . His lodgings were , in other respec ts1* , not of the most convenient description ; the upper rooms were merely lathed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the outside . ' Of furniture there was little or none to be had , and our worthy missionary would have been , to all appearance , obliged to rest his learned limbs upon the soft side of a deal board , had not the lady of the house where I remained all night on my first ramble up Yonge Street , accommodated us most obligingly with a good feather-bed , which she permitted us to use during our residence at Thorahill . ' Such accommoda // tionS , one would suppose , could hardly have been satisfactory to a family , which had just been luxuriating among the downbeds and flesh-pots of the boarding-houses of New York and London . Our author , however , in the ardor of his new-born loyalty , endeavors to put a good face upon the matter , and enlarges at considerable length upon the comforts of his residence , although he rather inconsistently lets out , in his account of a chance conversation with a neighbor , that ' we are quite ashamed to be found in such lodgings , and have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance that his lodgings , such as they were , were a palace compared with the apartment which I and my family occupy , ' and the Rev. Mr. Fidler , had he been left to himself , would probably have preferred to bear the ills we have , Than fly to others which we know not of ,  --  and remained for life the missionary of Yonge Street , near York in Upper Canada . In this case , the literary world would have lost the benefit of his Observations on Professions , Literature , Manners and Emigration in the United States . This severe dispensation was averted by the timely intervention of Mrs. Fidler , who seems to be a pretty important person in the establishment , the Rev. Isaac being , from his account of the matter , not much better than second dessus , or in the common phrase , second fiddle , in his own orchestra . Mrs. Fidler had been very impatient to enter the parsonage house , and had hastened him to take her from York into the country , even should the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish . ' But no sooner had they taken possession of their lodgings , than dissatisfaction evinced itself . She grew more and more a*rse every hour to continue , and her first impressions could never be effaced . ' Mrs. F. felt uncomforta ' 61e , and so frequently and loudly complained , that I often participated in her feelings when I should have experienced the reverse . ' There was , however , one agreeable circumstance about their situation , which served for a time as an off-set to all its inconveniences , and which throws much light upon the character of an interesting portion of the population of Upper Canada . The only thing during our Canadian residence , ' says our author , with which Mrs. F. seemed to be amused , was the frequent visits which the cows and sheep of our landlady // made into the forests and pnc4lires of other people , and which her neighbors ' cows and sheep made into hers . ' The interest felt by Mrs. F. in this reciprocated intercourse of cattle , ' seems to have extended itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss at some length the question , whether gregarious animals have any instinct which induces them to reciprocate the visits of other cattle . ' Without committing himself fully upon this subject , he has evidently a strong leaning to the affirmative , and of this he is certain , that the cattle and sheep of others were as frequently on our landlady 's grounds , as hers were in those of others . ' We beg the reader to remark , not merely the importance of the fact here announced , but the elegance of the language in which it is communicated . The cattle and sheep of others were as frequently on our landlady 's grounds , as hers were in those of others . ' It is clearly not in vain that our author had made himself familiar with the euphonic changes of the Sanscrit . ' A merely English ear would hardly have hit upon so rich and felicitous a cadence . The case of Mr. Fidler 's landlady was not in this respect a singular one . This did not happen peculiarly to one person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . ' With farmers in town , it would seem that the case was different . This reciprocated intercourse of cattle ' brings to Mr. Fidler 's mind an important incident that happened to us on our first commencement of house-keeping , ' and which seems to show that the practice in question is not confined to the sheep and cows of Canada , but prevails among some other kinds of animals . The lady , who had occupied the same dwelling antecedent to ourselves , had left a cat on the premises , which must have been famished during the nine months the house was empty , unless it had found a hospitable welcome among its kindred of the neighborhood . The moment it peyceived the house to be retenanted , it returned , and such numbers of cats followed it into our kitchen and pantry , that nothing eatable could be left open for a moment without being discovered by them and carried off . It is most probable , that this congregation of cats on the premises was nothing more nor less than the repayment of friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feline tribe , which is here alluded to by the excellent missionary , has been a subject of frequent remark with other writers , the exchange of ciVilities among these animals not being always conducted with the perfect discretion and // tranquillity , which probably marked that of the cows and sheep* of Upper Canada . Whether the congregation of cats on the premises of Mr. and Mrs. Fidler , soon after their first commencement of house-keeping , was , as our author supposes , a repayment of friendship , ' or had its origin in a warmer sentiment , is a point which future naturalists may perhaps consider as somewhat doubtful . Before leaving this subject , we would respectfully submit it to the consideration of the Rev. Mr. Fidler , whether , if it should be fully made out that gre-* garious animals have an instinct which induces them to reciprocate the visits of other cattle , ' there is not reason to expect that a certain British clergyman , for a short time missionary of Thornhill on Yonge street , near York , Upper Canada , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the broad honest faces of this portion of the population of Upper Canada looking in at the door of his own parlor . That he is 6*te enough to merit this distinction will hardly , we imagine , be called in question by any one , who has had opportunity to peruse the work before us . The interchange of civilities among the cattle of Upper Canada , however amiable in itself and amusing to the ladies of the missionaries , who happen to be located there , is , in our author 's opinion , on the whole , of evil tendency ,  --  at least , in the case of mileb cows . On this subject , he lays down the following proposition . When milch cows stray from home7 it must be injurious to themselves as well as to their masters . ' The necessity of this remIt is proved in a very satisfactory way . Not only do they give less milk , but also their udders , from too long distension , are liable to inflame . ' Having thus argumentatively made out his point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has to be sure rather a remote bearing on the question , but which is too interesting in itself to be omitted , and which seems to show that the experiences of the father of the Rev. Mr Fidler , in NatuAl History , are not less rich and instructive , than those of his son . My father , ' says the worthy missionary , had a cow which could draw her own milk . She was no doubt delighted with the flavor of it , for she practised the sucking of herself every day . She grew quite plump , and was a subject of wonder , at the small quantity of milk she yielded , and at her sleek appearance . She was detected one day in the very act , after which a wood collar was suspended round her neck , which prevented her continuing it . She afterwards gave more milk , but de // creased in fatness . Such cows are best fitted for Canadian pastures , when disposed to take holiday in the woods . ' We trust that whatever opinion may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other respects , the public xviii be duly sensible of the importance of his contributions to the science of Natural History . Among his other interesting discoveries in this branch of learning , may be mentioned the hitherto unobserved fact , that the horses in Canada have a natural instinct , which makes them sensible of danger from girdled pines . ' Such horses would be a very suitable monture for the watchmen of Messina , who , as the learned Dogberiy informs us , possess by a natural instinct the faculties of reading and writing . It will go bard with Mr. Fidler , if be do not attain the same eminence in physiology with the prettiest piece of flesh in Messina ; ' and we think that , at all events , be runs no risk of not being written down , in the way that seems to have been considered most desirable by that celebrated guardian of the night . Although we are not now speaking particularly of style , we can not refrain from quoting a passage that occurs in this connexion , and is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume . In addition to the numerous settlements and clearances , which serve as loop-holes of zEolus and Phwbus , and as gardens for the happy emigrants within , a poet would have found , last year at least , the harsh dissonance of cholera reports , of execrations of plundered Englishmen flocking from the States , and of the heart-rending shrieks of helpless Indians , whom American duplicity had robbed of their heritage , and driven from their homes. * Loop-holes of Aiolus and Phai5us ! As the learned Isaac seems to have been in the true Nick Bottom vei* when he indited this paragraph , we rather wonder that he did not adopt the orthography as well as the rhetoric of his model . The raging rocks , With shivering shocks , Shall break the locks Of prison gates , And Pldbbus ' car Shall shine from far And kindle war On many a star And make and mar The foolish fates . // As respects the heart-rending shrieks of helpless Indians , whom American duplicity has driven from their heritage , ' while we disapprove , as strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Georgia towards the Cherokees , to which Mr. Fidler appears to allude , we are glad to be able to inform him , that the laws of that State on the subject in question have been declared by the competent authorities in the Government of the United States to be null and void ; - that the Indians are under the protection of that Government ; - that they still dwell in the homes from which he supposes them to have been driven ; .  --  and that , if they have been led by the molestations they have already suffered , or may apprehend in future , to utter any heart-rending shrieks , ' the Canadian poets must have had pretty good ears to have heard them through the aforesaid loop-holes of A%lus , at a thousand miles ' distance . It is high time , however , to get back from these ArcadicoCanadian clearances , ' to the States . The reciprocated intercourse of cattle ' was , as we have seen , the only thing which our author 's better half found to amuse her in Canada , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interesting spectacle became tiresome , and Mrs. Fidler began to insist on an immediate return to England . Our author takes care to inform us , that this amiable person had given her consent to the settlement in Canada , only on the express condition that her husband would quit it at a moment 's warning , if requested . After the lapse of a period of four months the request was made , and Mr. Fidler , with a laudable fidelity to his engagement , forthwith agreed to it ,  --  .  - -  made his preparations for departure from Yonge Street , and after casting a longing , lingering look upon the comforts of lathed , but not plastered lodgings , a borrowed feather bed , fried pork and bannocks , the reciprocated intercourse of cattle , and the loop-holes ofEolus and Phoebus , made the best of his way back to New York , embarked at once with his family on board of a packet , and after a rapid passage of seventeen days found himself safe and sound at London , having accomplished all the marvellous adventures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within the compass of a single twelvemonth . Such is the outline of the history of the life and adventures of our author , as far as it can be collected from the work before us . The knowledge it affords of his character would be sufficient of itself to give a pretty correct idea of the value of his // Observations , and precludes in a great measure the necessity of a more particular examination . We shall , however , for the further edification and entertainment of our readers , make a few more extracts , accomparii*d by some occasional commentaries . It may be proper to observe here , that the materials employed in Mr. Fidler 's hook are disposed in part upon the old classical plan of an epic poem . The author plunges at once in medias yes , by an account of his arrival and adventures at New York ; and it is not till we reach the sixth chapter , that we are presented with some particulars of the occurrences during the voyage , under the novel head of Retrospective Incidents . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happy idea by a chapter of Gontemporaneous Reminiscences . I have said , ' says Mr. Fidler , in entering upon this episode , that I obtained considerable enlightment , ( another specimen of the improved English taught in the school of " my much revered preceptor , the Rev. James Tate of Richmond , " ) upon various points in the manners and opinions of the Americans , particularly from one native of the Union , who happened to be a fellow passenger with me . ' After this exordium , Mr. Fidler relates , upon the authority of his fellow passenger , the following anecdote , upon which he makes the annexed observation . The person this American spoke of , lie described as having embarked in business , without being possessed of a dollar ; and as trading for a time , according to the custom of his country , upon speculation and credit . A series of bills and promissory engagements , entered into with acquaintances similarly circumstanced , formed the chief means of these commercial speculations . When I expressed surprise at this sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American made answer , " Being in a profession , you are not yourself , Sir , much exposed to the difficulties of the world , and consequently do not know the contrivances which others feel it necessary to adopt . If any person in America should refuse to do a favor of this kind I speak of , for his friends , he would find similar accommodation withheld from himself . The friend of this gentleman was thus circumstanced , and soon failed , through the misfortune of another . During the period of his conducting business , however , he kept a carriage , and lived up to his imagined gains , without providing for the contingencies of an evil day . When all went wrong , his effects were disposed of for the benefit of his creditors ; and he was obliged to exchange a comfortable for a wretched state . As // he had married during his prosperity , and a family was the consequence , his greatest exertions were requisite to obtain even the necessaries of life . He was no longer regarded as belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded , and was obliged to perform the most menial offices . While in this condition , his brother , more successful than himself : , having made a fortune , died without issue , and bequeathed his property to a public seminary . " The American , who told us the story , strongly condemned the conduct of the deceased brother of his friend , calling him an unnatural monster , for having violated , in his opinion , every principle of duty and justice . Hereupon , a discussion ensued , and it was debated with considerable warmth , whether one brother , in such circumstances , had any natural claim upon the other . I made a remark , which kindled a burst of indignation . " In England , " I observed , " a man unfortunate , from no cause of his own , does not forfeit his place in society . And I should imagine there was some cause for the desertion of your friend by his brother and acquaintances . But , even supposing him perfectly worthy of their continued approbation , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his brother ; collateral branches of a family having no pecuniary claims from consanguinity . The only grounds for supposing that one brothec ought to render assistance to another , rests upon the probability , that if he does net , no other person will . " The American , hereupon , lost all government of himself ; and , brandishing his knife , for we were then at dinner , asserted that I had introduced this sentiment from motives of priestcraft ; and that if neither pay for schoolmasters , nor loaves and fishes for priests , bad been augmented by the bequest , I would have condemned it as well as himself . ' In the observation which our author here attributes to himself , we hardly know which to admire most , the elegance and correctness of the style , or the beauty of the sentiments . A person in distressed circumstances has no natural cl*im for assistance upon a brother : - collateral branches of a family , ' ( brothers and sisters it seems are collateral branches of a family ) have no pecuniary claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one brother ought to render assistance to another rests upon the probability , that if he does not , no other person will . ' It would seem that the school of the Rev. Mr. Tate is not less conspicuous for its improvements on the commonly received code of morals , than for its happy innovations on the usual forms of language . We would venture to suggest to the Reverend Gentleman , that he would obtain // considerable enlightment upon the subject of the duties iflcident to fraternal and other family and social relations , by recurring to an ancient work , entitled the New 7kstament , which is perhaps out of fashion at Richmond , but is still regarded with some respect in the United States . It is worthy of remark , that the heartless pedant who was capable of inditing the above paragraphs , attempts , in the very next sentence , to be severe upon Aracricanisms in the use of language ; and inveighs throughout his work with as much point as he can put into his style , ( which to be sure is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , and their steady pursuit of dollars , to the exclusion of every higher and more liberal object . The burst of indignation , ' with which , as he says himself , his unnatural doctrines were received by a large corripanv corn posed of travellers of all classes , is an honorable testimonial in favor of the state of public feeling among us , and would be more than sufficient of itself to counteract any unfavorable impression that might be produced by his invective , if such invective could be supposed to produce abroad or at home any other feeling , but that of contempt for its author. * But it is really wasting ammunition to pretend to be serious with the Rev. Mr. Fidler . We have already said , that before his expedition to Canada he made a short excursion to this city . He had whilst in England , procured letters to two literary gentlemen of Boston , the one a Professor in Cambridge University , and the other an author well known in that city . ' * While this article is going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Col. Hamilton 's Men and Manners in america , a work to which we shall probably call the attention of our readers in a future number . In the extracts alluded to , the Colonel says that he was led to form an unfavorable opinion of the moral charpcter of the Americans , by hearing , in the bar-room of the public house where be lodged , sentiments which he considered objectionable advanced by Americans and received by the persons present with apparent approbation . Whether the state of moral feeling in the bar-room of a single public house is a fair standard by which to judge of that of a community of thirteen millions , we will not inquire . We will merely retoark* that the Colonel gives no facts in support of his general assertion . In the anecdote related in the text by Mr. Pidler we have , at least , one example of a most immoral and unnatural sentiment , advanced in a large mixed company of Americans by a British Clergyman , and , according to his own admission , received by them with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual or national , a single well-authenticated fact is worth a volume of generalities , unsupported by any . // The well known author turns out to be Dr. Lieber , the editor of the Encyciopa*dia Americana , so that , of the two literary gentlemen of Boston to whom our traveller was introduced , one proves to be a native of Berlin in Prussia ,  --  and the other a Professor at Cambridge . The reader will naturally inquire , whether Mr. Fidler himself does not trace his origin to the Emerald Isle . It is however but just to him to add , that he is for once half right , as the Professor in question , though employed in Cambridge , resides at Boston , the college being only three miles distant from the city . The first visit of the Rev. Mr. Fidler was to the well known author , ' and is described in the following correct and elegant language .. I found the gentleman , who was a litterraire and an author , well known in Boston , reading some work on Egyptian Hyroglyphics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subject I bad never studied , 1 could not enter into its merits . ' It would seem that the reformers of the Richmond school have taken a wide range through almost all the departments of learning , and we can not wonder that our author came out with the expectation of employing more than ordinary acquirements for the improvement of the Americans . ' The use of litterraire instead of iitt&amp;ateur , and ' the mode in which the former word and hieroglyphics are spelled by our author , are certainly very extraordinary , though doubtless very great improvements on the common practice . If we are rightly informed , our author had not only not studied the work on Hyroglyphics here alluded to , which was one ofthe publications of Champollion the Younger , but had never before heard the name of that distinguished and lamented philologist . It was perhaps hardly to be expected that one , who is himself the author of so many brilliant discoveries in all the branches of learning , should take much pains to keep himself au fart of what is doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known author , ' proceeds as follows . At last , after many desultory observations on numerous topics , as rapid and evanescent as mental and lingual volidity could render them , we alighted on a subject of mutual interest , frequently discussed by persons I met with at Ne*v York . I had always observed , that native Americans do not enter into such debates with half the warmth and bitterness as European- refugees . The Americans appear to employ dependent strangers on the outworks of their republic to sound the political sentiments and principles of every approaching emigrant , and to convey to the // democratic sensorium a timely and accurate impression , before they welcome him into the capital of their patronage and support . ' The faculties of mental and lingual volidity , which the Rev. Mr. Fidler brought into use upon this occasion , are of course among the new discoveries of the Richmond school . It is deeply to be regretted , that our author 's early return should have deprived this community of the benefit of these more than ordinary ' improvements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same which forms the general subject of our author 's work , viz. Professions , Literature , Manners , and Emigration in the United States . We extract Mr. Fidler 's concluding observations . " To all this , " I replied , " that had I seen him on my first arrival in the States , J should have cordially agreed in his views and observations . I had harbored , whilst in England , bitter and aggravated sentiments against the aristocracy ; and had believed , that the country would be better without that privileged body . This opinion I might always have indulged , had I always lived in England ; but America is an infallible corrector of such erroneous judgment , in every mart of intelligence and capable of observation . I have never met with any person from Great Britain worthy to be called respectable , whose opinions , however radical before , did not become completely altered . You can not , when in England , " I added , " have obtained satisfactory information on these points ; otherwise your mind must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is certainly equal to the highest in the States . I am greatly mistaken , if any first rate professional man exists in all America . There are certainly men of eminence ; but they are eminent only among their own countrymen , and would not obtain a high rank in England . And although it is true , that many lucrative and important situations are held by noblemen , yet all such places are not exclusively so . England can enumerate more persons raised from a low to a high station , than any other country . In shoft , there is hardly any village in England , which does not possess residents of greater learning , and professional talent , than is to be found in almost any large town in the United States . Besides , that which is a low reward for literature in England , is a high reward in America . No man there , who possesses more than ordinary learning , can remain long unnoticed . His reward often depends upon himself . The nobility are bountiful rewarders of merit , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that no man who pos. ' // sesses more than ordinary learning can remain long unnoticed in England , ' and as our author candidly tells us himself , that he possesses more than ordinary acquirements , ' in addition to the faculties of mental and lingual volidity , which , though we can not pretend to conjecture what they are , must , we presume , be something of a very extraordinary character ,  --  we rather wonder why , as he also tells us himself , he has not obtained and is not likely to obtain preferment , ' and even found very little to encourage his ambition in the laborious profession of a teacher . ' We trust that Mr. Fidler will furnish a satisfactory solution of this somewhat difficult problem , in the next edition of his work . After the specitnen that be has given us himself of the literary taste and talent of a British clergyman of more than ordinary acquirements , ' it would be idle to question the correctness of his opinion , that a third rate talent in professions in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The interview with Dr. Lieber seems to have terminated rather unsatisfactorily , which is quite remarkable , considering the very guarded , discreet and good-tempered manner , in which our author carried on his share of the dialogue . I left this German author , ' he remarks , rather abruptly , some offence being apparent from the difference of our views and the tendency of our arguments , and went to deliver another letter of introduction I had , to one of the Professors of Cambridge University . ' At the house of the Professor , lie was made acquainted with Mr. John Pickering , who seems to have treated him with attention , and will doubtless be much gratified with the manner in which he is shown up in the Observations . Mr. Pickering introduced our author to a congregational minister , Dr. J. whom he represented as the best Orientalist in Boston . ' Our readers will be amused with Mr. Fidler 's account of his conversation with that gentleman , at two successive interviews . Dr. J. , after expressing the satisfaction it afforded him to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oriental learning , withdrew into his study , and returned with an armful of Persian , Sanscrit , Arabic , and Hindoostanee books . No sooner had I examined these works , than I began to think that I had already macic a premature estimate of American literature , and that what I had frequently heard in New-York must be tine . When , on my first arrival in the States , I mentioned to several scholars my surprise at the extremely low state of learning and the professions , I was always answered thus : " NewYork is not a literary , but a commercial city . if you are desir // ous of seeing the lions of American literature , go to Boston . " As I had long been engaged in such studies , and had lately arrived from London , the hot-bed of languages , arts , and sciences , I thought I could have little to apprehend from any Orientalist in the United States I therefore summoned up a fitting self confidence , expecting , with my new friend , a trial of skill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have some knowledge of them , " he replied , " but not very extensive . " He then took a German selection of Sanscrit passages from various authors , the first of which was the opening passage of the Laws of Menu . This he requested me to read , which I did , and when I paused , and perceived that he made no inquiries , nor added any observations , I began to suspect that he did not understand the language . I therefore requested him to tell me , if he knew the letters . His answer amused me ; " I have writtc*n them over several times ; but the truth is that they are so confoundedly difficult , that I could never remember them . I can not therefore read any of the words , nor have I ever before heard them read ; but have seen some accounts respecting the language , that it is a very engaging study . " To this latter statement I of course agreed ; adding , that the Sanscrit is certainly the most perfect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I am acquainted ; and its euphonic transformations the most accurately systemat.ic . Moreover , it is now thought by the best judges to he the origin of the Greek language . Many roots , and prepositions , and the numbers and voices , are nearly the same in both . Also every euphonic change in Greek , and in every other language , can be referred to the principles of Sanscrit . After having held a short conversation with Dr. J. , and discovered that his Oriental knowledge might be compressed into a nut-shell , he informed me , that some duties he had to perform required his absence , and requested I would call again on the following day . I promised to repeat my visit at the time he mentioned , and we took forthwith our de parture . ( As we were returning from this characteristic farce , Mr. P. informed me , that he had once resided in London , as secretary to the American Minister , and had seen the dignity and greatness which learning in England frequently obtains . " It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulates and encourages . In America , there is no inducement for enthusiastic perseverance in literature . Indeed we have no literature in this country . " To this I could not help adding , " A well educated Englishman will always make the same discovery , after the residence of a day . It is impossible to be concealed or disguised . " // On the day following , I paid a second visit to Dr. J. , and read over to him some Persian and Hindoostanee . I then requested him to allow me the pleasure of hearing his pronunciation of some Persian sentences ; but he begged I would dispense with his performance of it ; and then added , " This is the second time in my life , in which I have heard a Persian word pronounced . A young gentleman , who had been in India , once before indulged me in a similar manner with yourself ; but it is several years ago , and I have no recollection of the sounds . " The books he possessed must be considered as rarities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They must be , however , amusing companions to an American Orientalist . Had I not been well able to penetrate into the den of the Bostonian lions , and to estimate its profundity and extent , I might have quitted that celebrated place , with the erroneous impression , that it contains at least one extraordinary linguist . But I. must confess , that it appeared not a little amusing , that every thing of literature in the States , with which one grapples , dwindles into mere pretence , and vanishes into air . I observed , when in the Cambridge library , a copy of Dr. Wilkin 's Sanscrit Grammar , and found its pages free from the finger marks of transatlantic students . May it long continue so , and be a true index of university intelligence , where it has been so carefully preserved . Whilst literary honors and emoluments are so sparingly dispensed , there is no fear of its derangement or disfigurement . ' After the specimens which our readers have already had of Mr. Fidler 's literary qualifications , they will probably consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pass sentence ex cathedral upon its amount and value , at least as farcical , as any thing that occurred at his interviews with Dr. Jenks . Of the extent of that gentleman 's Oriental learning . we are not informed . We shall presently see that Mr. Fidler , during his stay in Boston , fell into , company with another gentleman , well known to the public both abroad and *t home by his writings as an Oriental scholar , and notwithstanding his fitting self-confidence , ' that he had little to apprehend from a trial of skill with any Orientalist in the United States , either shrunk from grappling with him , or has prudently refrained from informing the world of the results of the contest . Whether our author really possesses the profound knowledge of the Oriental languages and literature to which he lays claim , is , in our opinion , exceedingly doubtful . If his acquirements in this line were as extraordinary as he modestly represents them , he would not have met with so lamentable a failure at home . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are far from removing the impression created by the ill success of his school in England . He tells us , for example , in the above extract , that the Sanscrit is now thought by the best judges to be the origin of the Greek language . ' We hardly need to say that it is not thought by the best judges , ' but known to all who are moderately well informed upon the common topics of general philology , that the Sanscrit is the basis not . only of the Greek , but of the Latin , and all the Teutonic and Celtic tongues . Again : - Every euphonic change in Greek and in every other language may be referred* to the principles of the Sanscrit . ' In whatever sense the phrase euphonic changes may be here taken , which the reverend gentleman appears to employ in a manner peculiar to himself , the remark is equally absurd , and betrays either gross ignorance , or the silliest spirit of wanton exaggeration . Mr. Pickering , for example , could have told him a very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose the truth to be , that our author knows about enough Sanscrit and Arabic , to explain to students the grammar and vocabulary . If questioned upon any point of learning beyond this , we suspect that he would find himself as much at a loss , as he did when called upon to converse with Dr. Lieber upon the recent discoveries in Egyptian Hieroglyphics . Our readers will perceive , that Mr. Pickering is here represented as saying , that there is no literature in this country . Mr. Pickering is himself a literary man of distinction , known as such to the world by several works of acknowledged value , prudent and judicious in his statements , and quite incapable of saying any thing so utterly absurd . He probably made some observation upon the subject , in the tone of modesty with which men of education and refinement habitually express themselves , upon points involving in any way their own persof*al pretensions . The reply of Mr. Fidler must have satisfied him , that he was throwing his pearls in a direction expressly prohibited in Scripture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly well , that there is in the United States more literature , in the proper sense of the term , that is , more investigation and discussion in print of all subjects involving the great existing interests of society , such as Government , Religion , Education , Public and Private Economy , and the various elegant and useful arts of life , than , taking the whole together , there is in any other country . That son*e of the merely // ornamental and curious branches of learning are more assiduously cultivated and carried to higher perfection elsewhere , than they are with us , is probably true : but where this is the case , the practical part of literature is proportionately at a lower ebb , and if we can not have both at once , the shirt without the ruffle seems to be at least as important , as the ruffle without the shirt . The most amusing scene in our author 's adventures at Boston occurred at the hou5e of Mr. Pickering himself , where Mr. Fidler was invited the night before he left town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. P. invited me to take tea at his house . There were four literary gentlemen invited to meet me , but they were not all present at tea . Some of them came late in the evening . Dr. J. and the German gentleman I have already mentioned , were two , and besides a student and a young gentleman who had spent some time at the Levant , Mr. II . ' This young gentleman who had spent some time at the Levant ' was Mr. Hodgson , the person alluded to above as an Oriental scholar of distinction . He had for some years preceding been attached to the Consulate at Algiers , which , in the geography of Mr. Fidler , is probably situated in the Levant ; and at the period in question was about embarking at Boston for Constantinople , where he is now employed as Interpreting Secretary to the Legation . Mr. H. is known to the public as a linguist and Orientalist by his memoirs on the Berber language in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society , and by his translation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ' the interior of Africa , which was published at London in 1830 by the OrientaL Translation Society. * It is remarkable that with this translation looking him in the face , as one of the latest publications in his own branch of learning previously to his departure from London , Mr. Fidler has the hardihood to affirm , that there is not a person in the United States , who can read Arabic.t In charity to his moral qualities , we are bound to * See a notice of these works in the Review , Vol . XXXV. p. 54. * The Oriental languages and literature are taught as a regular branch of study in our principal literary institutions . The Professorship at Cambridge , the best-endowed chair of the kind in the country , was vacant at the time when Mr. Fidler visited Boston ; and had he possessed the requisite qualifications , might probably have been offered him . We happen to know that a gentleman , connected with the gov // suppose that our author takes so little interest in Oriental learning , as not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made under his own eye . Anxious , however , as he professes to have been , for a trial of skill with an eminent of the college , called upon him for the purpose of learning something about his pretensions and character , and with the intention of recommending him as a candidate for the vacant place , had he appeared to he a suitable person . Mr. Fidler , after a visit of about a week , had left Boston , and the account given of him by the few persons who saw him was not such , a to render it expedient to take any further steps in the business . As to the success with which the Oriental languages and literature are cultivated in this country , we believe we hazard nothing in saying , that the standard in this branch of learning is now , at least as high as in England . We are sustained in this opinion by the authority of some of the most competent judges in England , as appears from the following letters , which were published in the Biblical Repository @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that no name in England carries with it higher authority in Oriental learning than that of Professor Lee , who is really , what Mr. Fidler erroneously supposes himself to be , a person of more than ordinary acquiremnents . ' . Extract.from a letter addressed to the Editor of the Biblical Repository , by the Rev. Samuel Lee , Professor of arabic and Hebrew in the Urnversity of Cambridge , England , under date of London , June 5 , 1831 . My dear Sir , 1 am very much obliged to you for your kind letter of June 20 , which came duly to hand , and for the first number of your Biblical Repository . It will be a great satisfaction to me to open a correspondence with you , and to contribute all the encouragement , advice , &amp;c . I can , to your praiseworthy undertaking . It delights me and all my Cambridge friends to find , that our american neighbors are really outstrippi ; zg us in the cause of Biblical literature . May He , whose cause you are laboring to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite sure you will find no unholy rivalry here ; although I do hope you will find us endeavoring to keep up the race , as well as the contention necessary to secure that crown , which fadeth not away . I have seen a copy of the new edition of Professor Stuart 's hebreW grammar , and the industry of its author is new matter for my admiration of him . ' Extract from a letter addressed to Professor Stuart , of the andover Theologicat Institution , by the Rev. D. Henderson , Professor of Theology in Highbury College near London , under date of Feb. 22,1831 . My dear Sir , I can not proceed farther , without tendering to you my best thanks for the copy of the new edition of your Hebrew Grammar . I was already well acquainted with it , and quite agree with you as to the importance of the more condensed form in which it appears . Even as it is , it is , however , I am sorry to say , too formidablefor most of my countrymen , who have got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , or with them so superficially , that I fear few copies will be in demand . ' // American Orientalist , one would think that this interview with Mr. Hodgson would have been eagerly embraced for this purpose ; but whether he was wholly unacquainted with that gentleman 's reputation and writings , and considered him , as he describes him , as merely a young man who had spent some time at the Levant , ' too obscure to occupy for a moment the attention of a British clergyman of more than ordinary acquirements , ' or whether the results of the conversation ,  --  - if any took place ,  --  were not such as to awaken agreeable recollections of it in our author 's mind , certain it is , that he makes no other allusion to Mr. H. than is contained in the above passage . We have been given to understand , on sufficient authority , that Mr. Fidler displayed on this occasion , not nierely the general want of information and grossness of manner which distinguished him every where , but the most lament- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biblical Repository , as one of the most valuable periodical works , in the department of learning to which it is devoted , that appear in the country . The editor , Professor Robinson of the Andover Theological Institution , and his able coadjutors , particularly Professor Stuart , are entitled to the highest credit for the zeal , learning , ability and liberality with which they conduct this work . Though published at an institution commonly regarded as the head-quarters of orthodoxy , it has nothing sectarian about it , and does not exclude from its pages the views even of the ultra-liberal German rationalists . We noticed , for examole , in the last number . a translation from the German of De Wette 's Introduction to the Psalms . The same number contains an excellent article by Dr. Reynolds of this city , upon the best means of preventing and remedying diseases of the eyes . We sincerely regret that the multifarious and unwearied labors of Professor Robinson have seriously impaired his health , but trust that the visit to Europe , on which he is now absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh materials for use on his return . As to the state of Greek literature in this country , of which Mr. Fidler also expresses a very poor opinion , we need only*refer him to the beautiful Homer , with Flaxman 's Illustrations , and the translation from the German of Buttman*s larger Greek grammar , which have been published here this summer , the former by Professor Felton of Cainbridge , and the latter by the indefatigable Professor Robinson of Andover . We know of no publications of equal value , in this branch of learning , that have appeared during the present year in England . The translation of Buttman will no doubt be borrowed in England , as happened in the case of Mr. Everett 's translation of the smaller grammar of the same author . We hope , for the honor of the mother coputry , that the English publisher will not , in this instance , as in the other , in that of Mrs. Child 's Mother 's Book , and several cases of a similar kind , attempt to exalt his own merit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work republished appeared in America . // able ignorance of the ordinary learning of his own peculiar branch of philology . Instead of directing his conversation to Mr. Hodgson , our author seems to have fastened at once upon the young student . The student , a youth of sixteen , was in*roduced as a prodigy of learning , and an Arabic scholar . Mr. P. 's son had been employed two years in tuition , between his leaving the university , and engaging in the profession of the law . This youth had been his pupil , and was reported to be an extraordinary specimen of genius . Sir William Jones ' Persian Grammar was produced , and I desired him to pronounce a few of the first words of the story of the Bulbul . He commenced spelling the first word , as a child does his a-b ab 's . " Can you not read the words , " inquired I , " without mentioning the letters ? " To which he answered , that he knew most of the letters , but could not pronounce the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic , to which he answered , two years . I then explained to him the discipline of our schools in England , which is generally so strict as to preclude the possibility of a student 's time being so long occupied , in acquiring the characters of a language . " You must many times , " continued I , " have endured the infliction of chastisement , for such unprecedented neglect and idleness , had you been educated in England . " I perceived that discipline and chastisement sounded harsh upon his ears , and he retired from the party at an early hour . ' It appears from this passage , that in order to ascertain what progress had been made by a young man , who had been studying Arabic two years , Mr. Fidler examined him in Persian . Had he been studying Sanscrit , the worthy divine would probably have set him to reading Chinese . This is really too good . The power of reading and talking one language , after studying another , is doubtless one of the results of the newly discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have recollected , that the organs corresponding with these faculties are not yet developed in the American cranium , and have taken compassion upon our imperfect state of civilization . Finding that the student could not stand this test , Mr. F. , it seems , informed him in substance , that if be were in England , he would be soundly flogged for his negligence . You must many times , ' continued I , have endured the infliction of chastisement for such unprecedented neglect and idleness , had you been educated in Engiatid . ' Truly a most agreeable and civil speech for one gentleman to address to another , whom // he happens to meet in the ordinary intercourse of society ! Str2nge as it may seem , the student does not appear to have been particularly delighted with it . I perceived that discipline and chastisement sounded harsh upon his ears , and he retired from the party at an early hour . ' The poor student probably thought that a person , who was capable of saying such a thing , would be likely enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the best course he could take to prevent an attack upon his rear , as Mrs. Trollope elegantly has it , would be to effect an imm2diate retreat from the field . Having thus cleared the room of the student , Mr. Fidler next applied his locomotive faculties to the well-known German author , ' who was also of the party . The German author , who had before vented his indignation against the aristocracy of England , now resumed the same subject ; and repeated many accusations entirely unfounded , and which nothing but prejudice could dictate . This he did , to demonstrate his attachment to a republican form of ' government , and to expose my political views . He dwelt particularly on the pride and immorality of our nobles . I ventured to dispute his statements and inferences , thus unnecessarily obtruded and reiterated ; and witnessed also his hasty and untimely exit . ' The following anecdote , which is extracted from another part of the work , shows that our author 's conversation was of a not less moving character on other occasions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was so much at a loss how to conduct myself properly , as at an American table . Sometimes a few observations are made , but they always end abruptly , unless rendered palatable by flattery . A physician of some eminence boarded at the same house , and ate at the same table with ourselves ; he one day asserted , that literature and scholars in America wer*m infinitely raised above those of Europe , and of England in particular . I mentioned to him my experience in America , and what I had noticed at Boston . He grew rather warm at my narrations and remarks , and said , " You must admit , at the least , that American physicians are above those of England , in sound knowledge , and in physic U ' " I could hardly conceive , " I replied , " that , in a country so recently peopled , and so sparing in pecuniary and honorary recompense to professional talent , any first*rate physicians could be found . Were American institutions on so excellent a plan , as to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their possessors would never be satisfied with the state of things in their own country , but would emigrate to climates more congenial to their acquired perceptions , where their talents might he appreciated and rewarded . " " You have slandered our country , " he indignantly exclaimed , " and could never gain a comfortable living in it . " " Some of your own clergy and professors were of a different opinion , " said I , " and encouraged me to open a school , at respectable terms . I have contented myself with making inquiries respecting professions in general , and my own in particular , and have discovered that America has nothing to confer which could allure my stay . " lie shortly after left the table , and for three days seated himself at another place , where he could exchange neither words nor looks . To return , however , to the party at Mr. Pickering 's the company was now reduced to Dr. J. and Mr. Hodgson ; and Mr. Pickering , if he expected to take much comfort in their society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return the ingredients of the poisoned chalice to our author 's own lips , by showing him the way to the door . Whether this was in fact done , we are not informed , but it would seem that Mr. Fidler , on reviewing the next day the transactions of the evening , felt that he had an account of some sort to settle with Mr. Pickering , and addressed him the following letter . Your friend , Dr. L. , appears to have imbibed either in England or elsewhere , notions of our aristocracy , which do himself no credit , and them no harm . They arc not likely to be injured by illiberal observations made in a sweeping manner against their order , by persons who could never have an oppor* tunity of knowing their real character . As to their being the proudest aristocracy in Europe , it is true ; and it is equally true that the very shop-keepers of respectability in Lor*lon are , in talents , education , and wealth , higher , generally speaking , than the aristocracy of any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , what her aristocracy is among the aristocracies of the earth ; she stands supreme , and will do so , for generations yet unborn unless she persists in her present infatuation , forgetful of her high state , and of the Being who conferred it . ' I perceive , that a foreigner , to gain the favor of the American public , must vilify his own nation , and ccndemn all hereditary rule . The native Americans sit wrapped up in self-complacency , and inhale the grateful fragrance of slavish adulation . // The swindler , the profligate , the idle , the disaffected ,  --  they who have deprived others of their property , or who have squandered their own , find that the price of American patronage is cheaply paid : they flatter and falsify . A person of nigher principles , who is able by his talents and industry to maintain himself in Europe , will never stoop to this sort of * Considered as a parting letter to a native American , who had spontaneously and without Mr. Fidler 's having the slightest claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy , it must be owned that this is a most judicious and civil production . It appears , that our author had imbibed in England the same opinion of the aristocracy which he attributes to Dr. Lieber , having been , as he says himself , a downright radical , ' and having changed his views only in consequence of his ill success in this country . As Dr. Lieher has , we understand , succeeded very well here , he has not of course had the same motive for reforming his political creed , which prevailed with our author , and we can not consider it as fair or reasonable in the latter to he angry with him for not having done so . The intimation , that because Dr. Lieher has succeeded xvhere Mr. Fidler did not , the former must necessarily he a profligate , idle , disaffected swindler , who has deprived other people of their property , or squandered his own , ' and the latter a person of higher principles , who is able by his talents and industry to maintain himself in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' is as incorrect as it is unhandsome . Mr. Fidler himself admits , that he was not able to maintain himself at home ; and if he will reflect a little , he can not but be sensible that a person of talent , address and an amiable and conciliatory deportment , without practising any unworthy arts , may very well succeed under circumstances , in which another of inferior accomplishments and repulsive manners would entirely fail . The fact , that Mr. Fidler*s presence regularly cleared the room where he was of all other company , ought to have given him considerable enlighitment upon the causes that prevented his success . He should have applied to his own case , mutatis mutandis , his remark upon the Americans , and when he found that no really respectable and well informed person weuli ' ecritinue in his company longer than his business or the purposes of travelling required , should have concluded that something not entirely attractive pervaded his personal character . ' // His remark , that the vecy shopkeepers of respectability in London are , in talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aristocracy of any other nation , ' is a good specimen of nationality run mad ; hut we can not find it in our hearts to be very severe upon our author for it , when we recollect that no less a personage than Lord Chancellor Eldon , if correctly reported in the newspapers , declared , in a speech before the House of Peers , that he felt to the bottom of his heart , that the meanest subject of the king of Great Britain was better than the highest of any other sovereign on the globe . ' The Infantados , Esterhazys , Chartoriskis , and Sheremetieffs of the continent would , however , be rather surprised to learn , that they are outdone even in wealth , ( to say nothing of education and talents , ) by the respectable shop-keepers of Holhorn and the Strand . Our author is not aware that in civilized countries , where there is no middling class , and where the mass of the people are in a degraded condition , the aristocracy must necessarily possess a proportionally greater share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages are more equally distributed . Under such circumstances , they are also , in general , as much more accomplished and energetic , as they are more powerful and wealthy than the same classes in a mixed government , where experience shows that they commonly sink into sloth , and give up all care even of their own property . We may say , perhaps , without fear of contradiction , that the Russian nobles of the present day are the most accomplished , high-minded and effective , as well as the most powerful and wealthy aristocracy in Europe . We extract , in illustration of these remarks , and by way of relief to Mr. Fidler 's J6r*miades , the account given by a recent writer of good authority , of his reception at the residence of Count Potocki at Toulchin in Poland . In the course of our experiences among the shop-keepers of Jfondon , we have met with no one that kept an establishment of the same extent . The narrative is taken from a work entitled the Journal of a Nobleman at the Congress of Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly called the palace of Tonlchin , is one of the most splendid edifices in Europe . It is built in the most elegant style of modern architecture , and is furnished in a manner suitable to its external magnificence . Over its portico is written , in large gold letters , the following sentiment , in the Polish language : // The wish therein expressed is no doubt praiseworthy ; but its application would have been more suitable to the house of Socrates , than to a palace in Poland . Having been formerly known to the Countess Potocki at St. Petersburg , where she had given me a pressing invitation to visit her at Toulchin , I hastened , on my arrival there , to pay my respects to her . My companion was a still older acquaintance of hers than myself and we proceeded together to the palace . We met with the most friendly reception from the countess , who rebuked us for not having gone straight to her house , to take up our abode there during the stay we might feel disposed to make in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , and baggage to be brought from the place at which we had left them , not suffering us even to go and fetch them ourselves . As the Countess Potocki made this her chief place of residence , Toulchin might have been called the El Dorado of Poland . The time we spent there , though only limited to a few weeks , forms one of the most agreeable periods of my existence . Besides the members of the family , consisting of the countess , her eight sons and daughters , and her daughter-in-law , the young and amiable Countess de Witt , a great number of ladies were attached to the household , either as relatives , or dames de cornpagnie . There were also two foreigners of considerable merit , retained as instructers to the sons of the countess ; one was the Abb6 de Chalenton , a French emigrant priest , who had been preceptor to the Counts Armand and Jules de Polignac ; the other was Mr. Allan , the English historical painter , who was commissioned by the countess to execute for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace , besides teaching the art of drawing to her children . A suite of apartments and two attendants were assigned to each guest and each inmate , and it was the established rule that every one should consider himself at home , asking for all he wanted , keeping amy hours most convenient to him , disposing of his time as he pleased , and not even appearing at the public dinner table , if it best suited him to dine in his own apartments . This , however , was only done in cases of indisposition , and the countess 's dinner table was always attended by all the family and visiters . Indeed the charms of conversation were never more attractive , than during the sumptuous banquets which constituted the ordinary fare at the palace of Toulchin , and no one would willingly have foregone their enjoyment . The interval between coffee and tea was usually spent in walking in the extensive gardens , or riding out either in open carriages or on horseback . After tea , music , cards , and conversation // went on among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the juniors , who not unfrequently tempted even the gravest among us to join them in their juvenile sports . I recollect one evening the game of blindman 's buff becoming so universal , that , among the numerous persons present , none but the countess had abstained from taking an active part . One of the most remarkable features of a protracted residence in the palace of Toulcbin , was the frequent and almost uninterrupted appearance there of persons of eminence and celebrity in Russia and in Poland , as well as of travellers of distinction from various parts of the world . None came within thirty or forty wersts of Toulchin , without deviating from their regular course in order to pay their personal respects to the countess ; and parties of her friends and acquaintance came all the way from St. Petersburg , Moscow , Warsaw , and other distant parts , for the express purpose of visiting her . There was therefore a constant succession of arrivals and departures , which , far from giving that annoyance of which one would suppose so much bustle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratification to the amiable hostess . With her , in fact , it was as if she re sided in one of the capitals of the empire . Her acquaintances were almost as frequently under her roof , as if they only resided a street or two from her residence . Here , however , she was enabled to receive them without that restraint , more or less imposed by the regulations of social intercourse in great capitals , and their visits thereby became far more agreeable . To convey an idea of the manner in which time was disposed of in the palace of Toulchin , I will give some account of the manner I spent mine , during the whole month of July that I participated in its friendly hospitalities . I got up between seven and eight in the morning , and proceeded to bathe , sometimes in an artificial river which has been made to run through the garden , and at other times in one of the Turkish baths , of which several are always ready for immediate use . I breakfasted at ten in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betweep that time and one o'clock , at which hour I always proceeded to the countess 's private sitting room , to pay my respects to her . After remaining with her about an hour , passed in the most agreeable conversation , I proceeded to the apartments of others , either inmates or visiters like myself , with whom I generally stayed till three , when the dinner bell summoned us all to the banqueting hall , where a table with fifty covers was always prepared . This dining room was laid out in a manner which answered the purpose of a museum of works of sculpture , and a conservatory of odoriferous plants indigenous to almost every part of the globe . // The dinner generally lasted an hour and a half . On getting up from table , we proceeded to an extensive orangerie , to which three glass folding doors opened , where coffee and ices were served . Here the arrangements for the evening promenade were discussed and settled , after which the ladies retired to their chambers to prepare themselves for going out , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing . At six , a sufficient number of open carriages and saddle horses were ready , and we rode out till half past seven . At eight we all took tea in one of the suite of drawing-rooms , where we remained till eleven , at which hour supper was announced . Most of the company retired at half past twelve , and at one in the morning I went to bed . ' It is but just to our author to say , that in one or two instances , the cloud of discontent and ill-humor , which commonly enveloped him , cleared away , and permitted him to witness , with some satisfaction , what was going on around him . On these occasions , his mode of expressing his approbation , and the causes which he assigns for it are even more curious , than the grave dissertations of his darker hours . We have , in fact , in the course of our reading , met with nothing to be com pared with the gaiety of the Rev. Isaac Fidler , excepting , perhaps , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on discovering himself to be , by some mysterious intervention of Providence , arrayed in a new suit of apparel . The reader has already had a specimen of our author 's sportive mood , in his remarks upon the reciprocated inter .. course of cattle ' in Canada , and will find another in the following account of the manner of observing the return of New Year 's day at New York , on which occasion the natives , it seems , practise the sino*ular custom ' of exchanging visits . Mr. Fidler is apparently not aware , that this practice als6 pievails in every other part of the United States , andy in all parts of every other country on the globe , from China to Peru . There is a singular custom , which prevails in New-York , but , I am informed , in no other part of the Union : on New-year 's IDay , all gentlemen call on their female friends , to renew or perpetuate their friendship . A lawyer , with whom I had contracted an intimacy , introduced me on that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , occupied our time from nine in the morning till seven at night . In *Imost every house we entered , we found other gentlemen on the same errand . It would be regarded as unpardonably rude in any lady , to treat with indiffer // ence a gentleman , who had honored her with his call . This is often the commencement of new acquaintances , or the reconcilia .. tion of former ones which were broken off ' , or discontinued . All the ladies we called on , as is universally the case , had prepared cakes , sweetmeats , wines , cordials , &amp;c. , in great profusion , in readiness to exhilarate and regale their visitors . They were them .. selves , in general , very elegantly decked out and beautified . All appearance of mercenary business was wholly laid aside , and calculating penury had its annual slumber . Many gentlemen jaunted about in sleighs , a kind of carriage which slides upon the snow , to pay their devotions to the fair recluses ; ladies on this day not being permitted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scene to me was as gratifying as it was new . All was animation , cheerfulness , and friendly feeling . The Americans seem , on this occasion , to have light hearts and buoyant spirits , and fulfil as much as any nation the command , " Take no thought for the morrow . " Thus some traits in their character are extremely pleasing to a foreigner . This was the only occasion , on which I saw the bright side of American sociability . In the midst of this joyous and festive gaiety , my fancy whispered , that the Americans are really a pleasant people . But the day , with all its pleasures , passed away , and I was forced to moderate my flattering conclusions ! ' We must now take our leave of the Rev. Isaac Fidler and his Observations , to which our readers will probably think that we have already devoted more attention than they deserve . We have noticed his book , because we consider it as a curiosity in its way ,  --  a sort of reductio ad absurdum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written . It is quite singular , that this should have been furnished by a traveller , whose education and profession would have justified us in expecting from him , with more confidence than from almost any of his predecessors , not only the more than ordinary acquirements ' which he makes no scruple of formally claiming , but thc ( manners and feelings of a gentleman . It would of course be a waste of time and labor to undertake to answer seriously any charges against the national character , contained in such a work as the one before us . There is , however , one view of the subject , which we think must suggest itself very forcibly to the mind of any person of the slightest reflection , and on which we propose , in conclusion , to say a few words . We allude to the complete opposition between the representations given in the work before us , and in most others // of the same class , of the English and American characters , which , from the nature of the case , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The worthies who indite these books , while in the act of pouring out the bitter vials of their wrath upon the Americans , are constantly professing the highest admiration , respect , esteem and love for England and the English . ' Mr. Fidler , for example , as we have already seen , represents England as standing supreme among the nations . ' Her very shopkeepers are higher in talents , education and wealth , than the aristocracy of any other nation . ' A third rate talent in ( the ) professions , ( in England ) is certainly equal to the highest in the States . ' Such is the uniform burden of ' the song , and in one of the closing chapters , we find the whole summed up in the following magnificent eulogium on the English charagter . This great reformation in the moral world has , . under Providence , been principally achieved by the English nation , and can not but be contemplated , by every traveller possessing British feelings , with peculiar interest and pleasure . He will find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have emigrated thither , and introduced with themselves a portion of the arts and sciences of their paternal land . He will find them , wherever they locate , converting the barren wilderness and the almost impervious forests , into smiling and fertile regions , producing supplies fo* their own necessities , and enabling them to contribute , by the channels thus opened to trade and commerce , to the employment , and consequently to the comfort and h*ppiness of tens of thousands . The English , by their enterprise and skill , and by unwearied perseverance , impart energy and lif*i to those around them , and serve as an example to the whole world of what , under Providence , may be accomplished by a nation influenced in an eminent degree by the principles of honor , integrity and virtue and giving expression to those principles by unpa4*aIlelcd exer : tions , and widening the sphere of their utility . Wherever they advance , the rigors of despotism cease , the savage loses the ferocity of his nature , . and adopts the habits of civilized man . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too spiritual to be comprehended by men whose minds are swayed by ignorance and superstition , and have founded seminaries of instruction in all countries over which their empire is extended . In short , they appear to have been placed as lights in the world , as a centre from which the whole earth might be irradiated , and have been chiefly instrumental in producing a moral and religious // reformation in pagan countries . Those , ifl every countt'y , who speak their language , and have access to their literature , imbibe , more extensively than others , the spirit of civil and religit*us freedom , and are distinguished in dignity of sentiment and action above the rest of mankind . The nearer any nation approaches to the laws , the constitution , and the customs of England , the nearer it approaches to perfect freedom ; and every deviation from these is , in general , a deviation from dignity and greatness . ' Now , without stopping to inquire how much of all this is strictly true ; - and , for ourselves , we Are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - we would , for the present , merely ask of this learned Theban , how , supposing this to be a correct representation of the English character , the Americans can possibly be the base , worthless , selfish , degraded , ignorant horde of sharpers , which he is pleased to represent us ? Is not the American Enolish ? Is he not of all Englishmen the most English ,  --  a Hebrew of the Hebrews ? Is he not precisely the Englishman , directly and particularly alluded to in the above extract , as emigrating to foreign countries , and introducing with him a portion of the arts and sciences of his paternal land - converting the barrett wilderness and almost impervious forest into smiling and fertile regions , ' producing supplies for their own necessities , and enabling them to contribute hy the channels thus opened to trade and commerce , to the employment , and consequently to the comfort and happiness of tens of thousands : -* imparting energy and life to those around him , ' - . ' giving expression to his principles by unparalleled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all countries over which their empire extended ? ' If the whole English race are to be exalted to the third heaven upon the strength of what the Americans have done , it is rather hard that these same Americans should be sent without ceremony in a body to the opposite region , merely be6ause they did not exhibit quite so much alacrity as might have been wished , in learning Sanscrit of an itinerant British pedagogue . The most compendious , and at the same time accurate description of the American character which we recollect to have met with , was contained in a remark which we heard hi conversation some years ago , from an intelligent native of the continent of Europe. * C Les Am6ricains , ' said he , sont d2esAnglais * The Chevalier de Rayner , whom the writer bad the pleasure of knowing as the Minister of the King of Naples at the Court of the Netherlands . // renforc6s . ' Literally , . -. -  --  the Americans are Englishmen reinforced : - in other words ,  --  the Americans are more thoroughly English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the English race , in which the characteristic qualities of the common stock display themselves in a fuller state of development , than in that which remains in the mother country . Of these qualities , the principal one , and that which determines the existence of the rest , is a hold and lofty spirit of independence , which leads the individual to insist with uncompromising steadiness , at all hazards , upon the security of his personal rights , and which has resulted , even in the mother country , in the establishwenlof the freest government , at least upon any thing like so large a scale , that the world had ever seen before the formation of* ours . The same noble spirit , exhibiting itself in a still more determined and vigorous form in this country , in the first place effected our political emancipation , and afterwards gave us a form of government still more free than that of Eng*fand . The tendency of free institutions , which afford at the same time a full security for personal rights and property , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enterprise and the moral qualities , such as temperance , prudence and fidelity in the ordinary social relations , to which these habits naturally lead . These are accordingly the prominent traits in the English character on both sides of the water ; and we probably hazard nothing in saying , that they are still more prominent here than in England . The English have been for two or three centuries the most industrious , active , and enterprising nation in Europe . This is amply attested by their superior success in policy and war , in trade , and manufactures , and in almost every department of public and private alTh.irs . Certain as this is , it is not less so , that the Americans have been at least equally industrious , active , and enterprising with their brethren abroad , and , in proportion to their means , have perhaps accomplished even more . If the English , during this period , have greatly augmented their wealth , population , and political influence ; - have raised their government from the rank of a second or third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonwealth ; - have , in fact , rendered a little island on the North-west coast of Europe one of the leading States of the world , the Americans , on their side , have founded , in an unexplored wilderness , a magnificent empire , which , in every thing that constitutes the real greatness // and glory of a community , already approaches , and , in all proba .. bility , will shortly surpass , the parent State . The equal , if not superior activity , industry and enterprise of the Americans , is evinced in a more familiar way , by the gene ' . rally acknowledged fact , that , in the business transactions between natives of the two countries , the American is commonly found to succeed better and to realize a larger profit than the Englishman . This fact is confirmed by the testimony of our author . He represents himself as having conversed upon the subject with a great number of his countrymen , who all agreed that an American could twist an Englishman round his finger ; could see farther into matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both his eyes open ; could make a fortune by selling the same merchandise by which an Englishman would become bankrupt , and could always gain a living where an Englishman would starve . ' This , ' says Mr. Fidler , as far as my own experience goes , or my inquiries could reach , is perfectly accurate . ' - He accounts for the fact , on the supposition that Englishmen commonly possess more capital than Americans ; as if , in the transaction of business , the possession of capital were a disadvantage . The reason of it , ' says he , is self-evident . Americans have rarely much capital : an Englishman with capital is not likely to gain much from an American wit/tout any . Money , if they continue long together , will always change hands ; but no inspired prophet is needed to foretell into whose pocket it will g&amp; Our author 's political economy is as great a curiosity as his natural history . He seems to belong to the same school with the author of the President 's Veto on the Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievously impoverished and injured by being allowed the use of foreign capital . The old-fashioned doctrine on the subject has always been that the possession of capital is an advantage , and if this be the case , the want of it is a disadvantage , which the Americans *ave had to contend with , and have overcome , whenever in any branch of business they have met with greater success than the English . When Mr. Fidler says , that an Englishmen with capital is not likely to gain much from an American without any , ' instead of solving the question , he only states it anew , in a still more difficult form than before . Nor can it be solved on the puerile supposition , that the success of the American is the effect of trick and fraud . In all sorts of business , honesty we all know is the best policy , and the only one that in the long run and on a great scale is attended with profit . The sharper Jenkinson , // in the Vicar of Wakefield , cheats honest Flamborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the annual fair came round , notwithstanding which , Jenkinson goes through life as a poor sharper , and Flamborough as a thriving , prosperous and independent franklin . In the same way , Figaro , in the play , employs more genius in intriguing for his master , than would be required for the government of the thirteen kingdoms of Europe , and gets as his reward the wages of a domestic servant . These are true pictures of the course of things in real life , where steady attention and habitual uprightness are the only principles of permanent success , which will of course be more or less brilliant , according to the degree of activity and enterprise by which they are accompanied.x The former qualities belong alike to the English and Americans , perhaps in equal degrees , and both nations have accordingly met with the success , which those who possess them deserve and will always secure . If the success of the English in America has been even more remarkable than that of the English in England , it can only be , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , as we trust , equally stable and protecting constitution , have exhibited in a still higher degree the activity and enterprise to which free government naturally leads . Look , for example , at the state of the carrying trade between the two countries . The distance from New York to Liverpool is just as great as from Liverpool to New York . The navigation act , which is supposed to have wrested the peaceful sceptre of maritime ascendancy front the Dutch , and placed it in the hands of the English , operates with the same relentless spirit of exclusion upon us , as it does upon C the swag-bellied Hollanders . ' Wages are always higher in this country than they are in England . The comparative want of capital is a disadvantage on our side . Why is it , then , that from three-fourths to nine-tenths of the trade in question always have been and are now iv* the hands of the Americans ? There is no room here for even a suspicion of trick or fraud . Every accidental circumstance is against us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while England has almost the whole of the carrying trade with every other nation with which she deals , with us , and us alone , the case is reversed in this extraordinary way ? We know no other rational answer than that our ship-builders , ship-owners , and mariners , notwithstanding the disadvantages under which they originally labored , and to a certain extent even now labor , have , by superior activity and enterprise , overcome the competition of Eng // land , driven her out of the common market , and taken the whole trade into their own hands . This is the simple common sense view of the subject , and , in our opinion , the correct one . The same circumstances , which have developed the valuable traits in the common English character to a greater extent in this country than in England , have also brought out the weak points in bolder relief . A stern spirit of personal independence , and a restless activity in matters of merely economical concern , are naturally attended , when they run at all into ex* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference to the charities and graces of social life , which throw an air of rudeness over the exterior of society . This has accordingly been always noted by friends and foes as the prominent defect in the English character , as exhibited in Europe , and the justice of the censure seems to be apparent in the general consent with which the homely title of John Bull , invented by the wits of Queen Anne 's time , has been adopted and sanctioned abroad and at home . This defect ,  --  if we can place any confidence at all in the strictures of our transatlantic friends ,  --  has not been softened by the process of transplantation . But the most decisive proof , that the English character has , in fact , been reinforced on this side of the Atlantic , and exhibits itself here in a more active , complete and vigorous form than it has ever done before , is to be found in the nature and probable results of the political struggle now going on in England . It will hardly be disputed by intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors may still disguise the fact from themselves , that this struggle is at bottom a war between American and British principles of government ,  --  between Representative Democracy , with its equality of personal rights , its universal suffrage and its elective magistracies on the one hand , and the British Constitution , with its privileged orders , and established church , its parked House of Commons , and its hereditary King and House of Lords on the other . We say not at present whether the American principles are better or worse in themselves than the British , nor whether it is or is not expedient to attempt to introduce them into England ; we only affirm , that these American and British principles are respectively the real watch-words of the two contending parties ; and that , if the reformers ultimately obtain complete success , the British Constitution will go down , and the banner of pure representative demQcracy wave in triuniph on the towers of Westminster Hall . It is needless to enlarge // on this view of the subject , which we have already set forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain of which had the fortune to meet the assent of the most intelligent members of both the political parties in England . The present struggle in the mother country , considered under this point of view , is , therefore , a warfare between the American and English minds * or rather between the Eaglish mind , as expanded , developed , invigorated , reinforced by exercising itself in untrammelled freedom for more than two centuries in the boundless field of action presented by the New World , and the same mind , as modified by being to a certain extent cabined , cribbed , confined , bound in , ' to the narrower sphere of the little old fast-anchored isle and the British Constitution . This struggle , so considered , is the third in which the same antagonist forces have appeared in hostile array , contending with each other for the ascendancy on different fields and in d*ifferent forms ; but thus far always with the same success . In the first , which was the War of Independence , the American mind disputed with the British , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory ,  --  in fact , its existence ; for with the loss of its scene of action , the spirit itself must have soon become extinct . In the second , which was the War of 1812 , the hattIe-field was the . oeean ; and now the *t*u*lc , a*-suming for the present the form of a merely political and moral controversy , has been carried home to the head-quarters of the enemy . The comparative strength of the two antagonist forces was pretty well tested in the two former trials , and the opinion on that head , to which their results would naturally lead , is not , from present appearances , very likely to be contradicted by that of the pending one . The American mind appears to have already achieved an entire victory over that of England , even on English ground . The whole British community ,  --  the living , thinking , feeling , moving , *cting mass , denominated The Public , is thoroughly penetrated , imbued , saturated ,  --  if we may use the expression ,  --  with American principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts ;  --  the restraints on the Catholics ;  --  the bloodstained criminal code ; - colonial slavery ;  --  the Chinese monopoly , and above all , the old constitution of the House of Commons . Proximus ardet Ucalegon. - They are now fast undermining the Bank ; . -. the national debt ; // .  --  the Church ;  --  the Peerage and the Throne . They already carry all before them in the House of Commons , the real seat of the Government ,  --  occupy the ministerial benches , and thence issue their decrees , in the name of the king . The great modem engine for maintaining political influence , which has been - well described as a Fourth Estate , more important and powerflil than the other three put together , . - .. the Press , *-is almost wholly with them . The adversary still presents a feeble show of resistance in the House of Lords , and a few journals hang out here and there the grand hailing sign of distress . It is even rumored that the conqueror of Waterloo is buckling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of domestic conquest . But what can a few gouty old gentlemen effect , against the almost unanimous will of the people ? Even Wellington ; though **32;506;TOOLONG Christopher North ,  --  and no one can estimate the talent and efficiency of either of these champions of legitimacy more highly than we do ,  --  would find himself as powerless , in such a contest , as the renowned Knight of La Mancha and his squire in their encounter with the windmills . Mr. Fidler may call it infatuation : - possibly it is so : -. but whether for good or for evil , the decree has gone forth and it must be executed . It will not answer , therefore , for British writers to continue much longer to disparage the form in which the English character presents itself on this side of the Atlantic , now that Jonathan has , by a sort of Kentish common law , acquired , ( morally speaking ) possession of the old homestead , and become of course the principal representative of the family . Great let me call him , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be among the last to depreciate the value of the common English character , as exemplified in England , or to dwell with any other feelings than respecp , admiration , and delight , upon the long glories of British history . In representing the American principles of polity as superseding , even in England , the British Constitution , we mean no disparagement to that celebrated model of government , which was well described by one of the most illustrious of our own statesmen , . - before the Constitution of the United States existed ,  --  as the most stupendous fabric of human invention . ' Such , in fact , it then was . Of all the works of man , a real ( not paper ) constitution of government is by far the highest in order and impor // tance ; and of all constitutions of governmenb prior to ours , the British was beyond comparison the best ; the one which most successfully combined the security of the common body politic with an adequate protection for individual rights and liberty . This noble creation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of a thousand years . It had , as we said before , rendered a little island in the German ocean one of the leading powers of the world . It had scattered , wherever its influence extended , the seeds of liberty , humanity , civilization and religion . Under its influence , more had been achieved in philosophy , poetry , and all the useful arts and sciences , than had ever been done before by any one community . But , in the general mutability of all human things , it could not be expected that even this noble monument of wisdom , virtue and fortune would endure forever . It was predicted more than a century ago by one of her greatest admirers , that England would finally lose her political institutions , and perish as Rome , Sparta , and Carthage had perished before her. - This fatal period seems to have arrived , somewhat more sudde*ly than had been anticipated ; and if the signs of the times are at all to be credited , the British Constitution , after surviving , apparently unhurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now breaking up under the operation of a deeply-seated internal principle of destruction . Should this in fact happen , its memory will be always venerated by the friends of liberty , and its history carefully studied as one of the most interesting chapters in the book of political science . In saying that the principles embodied in it have been superseded even in England by those which prevail in this country , we do not even affirm that the latter are in themselves better , that is , truer to the nature of man and society . It remains for America to prove , by centuries of successful practice ; by a thousand years of social order , holding the protectiqg shield over regulated liberty ,  --  that her creations are as durable and as fortunate , as those of the parent country . Should she succeed in this , she will then have added to the numerous glories of the British form of government that of having left to the world , as its natural offspring , another superior even to itself ; - matre yulchrd filia pulchrior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Constitution of the United States is no other than the British , improved and adorned by the results of the experience of more than ten centuries.
