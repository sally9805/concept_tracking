txt THE biography of this Senator from Ohio , is but another illustration of the power of intellect , in struggling with and overcoming all obstacles , with which birth , fortune , and situation seemed to have clogged it . It is therefore instructive and interesting . And , while it instructs and interests , it stamps a denial upon , and a refutation of , the charges of those men who have attempted to prejudice the people of the United States against the Senate , by comparing it to the British House of Lords , and representing its meml ) ers as princes , dukes , and nobles ; so that , one would almost suppose , from their description , that at least every Whig Senator was a nobleman , sprung from royal blood , adorned with stars , garters , and ribbons , and wearing all the robes of royalty . The biography of Mr. Ewing- of TOM EWING , ' as be is faIniliarly called , at the Salines , in Virginia and Ohio - will set all this matter right . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , near Greenwich , Cumberland County , New-Jersey , where the old family-mansion is still to be seen . George Ewing , the father of the Senator , was born there in 1754 . In 1775 , the father enlisted in the New-Jersey line , where he obtained the rank of a lieutenant , in which he continued till 78 , when he resigned and left the army . Whilst in the army , he sold , on credit , the property which had descended to him ; but , when the bonds became due , continental money , then a legal tender , was rapidly depreciating . Nevertheless , he was obliged to take it , in payment ; but , in a short tune , it was worth nothing . Thus reduced in circumstances , with the prospect of a large family , he removed to the western side of the Alleghanies , in 1786 , and settled on a small farm , near West Liberty , Ohio County , Virginia , where Thomas Ewing , the Senator , was born , in December , 1789 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Olive-green Creek , on the Muskingum River . About the year 1795 , the Indians rising in all directions , they were obliged to take refuge in a block-house , at Olive-green , to avoid the danger of being massacred . An elder sister had taught young Ewing to read ; and , while he was in the garrison , he very assiduously cultivated * This is the first of a series of sketches of some of the prominent members of the United States Senate .

Old INirs . Seely - well known , upon the Zanesvilie and Marietta road , as an enterprising and talkative landlady - delights in recounting her recob lections of ' Tom Ewing , ' while in the block-house . He was not , she says , like other boys - for , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chimney-corner , it was always with a book in his hand . He was , according to her account , constantly reading something . In 1797 , he was taken back to West Liberty , and there went to school about seven months - at the expiration of which time , he returned to his father , who had then removed to the waters of Federal Creek , into what is now Athens County , Ohio . The spot selected by his father , was then in the wilderness , and seventeen miles beyond the frontier settlements . Here , for nearly three years , they were shut out from any intercourse with the world . Young Ewing , during this time , read the Vicar of Wakefield , ' and The Fool of Quality . ' These , and the Bible , were all the books , which , up to that time , he had been able to procure . In the year 1800 , a few other families , from NewEngland , had settled on Federal Creek ; and , in the winter of that year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cutler , a Cambridge graduate , who was succeeded by Moses Everett , from the same College . Ewing studied , one quarter under each , the rudiments of a common English Education , and this was the total of his schooling , ' until 1812 . This little enterprising community of New-Englanders , that were then settled upon Federal Creek , had but few books ; and , to procure a further stock , they formed a library association , and raised a small fund , by subscription . This literary fund ( in all probability , the first that was ever formed in the north-*vestern territory ) was sent to one of the eastern cities , and invested in books . The whole collection was brought across the mountains on horseback , in a sack . With the exception of Goldsmith 's works , the books were not well selected - consisting principally of the novels then fashionable , such as Amanda , ' the Romance of the Forest , ' and dull treatises on controversial doctrines of divinity . Subsequent additions were made to the library , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Darwin 's Zoonamia , and Locke 's Treatises on the Understanding . Young Ewing fell upon these , with a literary avidity , which none can understand but those who , under like circumstances , have felt it ; and he devoured the whole - reading , at all his leisure hours , and principally at night , by the light of hickory bark . From the age of thirteen , the life of Ewing was laborious . Then he became a substantial assistant to his father , upon his farm ; and by and by , he had the principal management of it . // Still , he found time to read , as all can find , who have a thirst for knowledge ; but , as he grew older , he had less time to read , than when a boy . The little he had learnt , however , but inflamed him with the desire of learning more . The love of knowledge was the prevailing and all-absorbing passion of his soul . To be a SCHOLAR* was then the summit of his highest ambition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then within his reach ; but this only taught him how little , in fact , he knew ; and was far from allaying his burning thirst for knowing more . Knowledge there was , he knew ; but how to reach it , was more than he could tell . Poverty stared him in the face . Obstructions thickened upon him . The father and his farm anchored him at home ; but his buoyant spirits led him off , on a thousand plans - through many aerial castles , and in many delightful visions . Calculations were made , but made in vain . Plans were formed , but they were soon but air . A world was abroad , but what it was , the eager student hardly knew . And yet , the more he knew of it , the more he panted to act his part in it . But , the more he thought of his situation , the more he despaired . Reflection , at last , ripened into actual suffering . His feelings became intensely interested . The bitter and melancholy conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes , forever . But , in the summer of 1808 , he was awakened from this stupor , by a youth , nearly of his own age , whom his father had hired , for a few months , to assist him in farming - and who had rambled about and seen much of the world . The narrations of this young man , and of many of his adventures , awakened Ewing ; and , as money was what he wanted - in order to obtain the means of pursuing his studies - he was induced to go with him to the Kanawha Salines , in Western Virginia , in order there to try his fortunes . He obtained the consent of his father , and left home , early in August , with his knapsack on his back , and but little spending money in his pocket . He got on board of a keel-boat , at Marietta , bound for Kanawha , and made his way to the new El IDorado of his imagination . During the three or four months lie was absent , he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was tolerably successful ; but the greatest satisfaction he had was , that he could do something in future . He returned home , in the winter , with about eighty dollars , the amount of his wages , leaving his companion behind , whose roving disposition prompted him to rove still more . This money , Ewing gave to his father , to assist him in paying for his land . The surrender of this little and hard-earned treasure , to his father , for the purpose of enabling him to save his land from forfeiture , was no ordinary sacrifice - as it postponed , for a year , all prospect of prosecuting his studies , and condemned him , for a while , to stifle the high hopes he then nourished in his bosom . // Early in the spring of 1809 , Mr. Ewing set out again for the Kanawha salt-works . The whole of this season , until November , he spent in more assiduous labor , and he succeeded *vel1 - the profits of the season being about four hundred dollars , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his father 's land . He spent the winter at Athens , then a flourishing academy , but irregular in the course of studies ; as it left the student to pursue such a course as he might think proper . At the end of about three months , he left this academy , and returned to Kanawha - after receiving there such encouragement , from the the President of the institution , and such a stimulus from others , as fixed his determination to procure the means of obtaining an education . The two next years , he devoted to this object ; and he returned from the Kanawha , in November , 1812 , with about eight hundred dollars , in money ; hut , with his health considerably impaired , by severe hard labor . This sum , he supposed would be sufficient to enable him to go through the preparatory studies , and acquire a profession . His health , however , was so much injured , that he was unable to recommence his studies . But he again fell upon the library , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , from the repose given him , and the leisure spent in reading such authors as Don Quixote , he laughed himself into such good health and spirits , that , in December , he was able to go back to Athens , where lie continued to be a most indefatigable student , until the spring of 1814 . His progress , during this time , was very rapid . He became familiar with many of the best English authors ; and , as his judgement matured , he easily obtained a knowledge of English grammar , rhetoric , and logic . Mathematics , however , was his favorite study , for which he had a natural inclination - and hence , Euclid was the favorite author . The philosophy , which depended upon mathematical demonstration , he studied with care and pleasure - and in it , made much proficiency . He also studied the Latin , but determined to omit the Greek . In 1814 , Mr. Ewing became satisfied that his funds would not hold out , and he took a school in Galliapolis . Not liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he relinquished it , and returned to Kanawha - the old scene of his labors - to collect a small sum that was due him , and to see what could be done towards adding something to his funds . He threw off the dress of the student , and again went to work at the Salines . He hired a furnace , and in one month of incessant toil - the severest he ever undertook - he improved the state of his finances , so that he felt confident they would bear him through his studies . At some period of his labors , at the Kanawha salt-works - and it was probably this - he labored twenty hours , out of the twenty-four ; and he was often found , during the four hours allotted // to sleep , walking with open eyes , but still asleep , between the two rows of boiling salt kettles , where a false step would probably have destroyed life ! With this hard-earned treasure , be returned to Athens ; where he continued till the spring of 1815 . At the examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution voted him the degree of A. B. ; being the first , with one other , upon whom this degree was conferred , by a college in Ohio . The circumstances which decided Mr. Ewing 's choice of profession , were probably these . In 1810 , he took a boat-load of salt to Marietta . While there , accident led him to the Courthouse . The court of Common Pleas was in session ; and he entered a Court-house , for the first time in his life . It happened that an interesting criminal trial was going on . The attention of the young salt-boiler was riveted to the scene ; nor did he quit the room until the case was closed . He had witnessed a high intellectual effort ; he had listened to an advocate ( the late lElijah B. Merwin ) of uncommon ability . Hitherto , he had not known or felt the power of eloquence . We may suppose , that , along with this admiration of intellect in another , there was associated a consciousness of his own mental powers , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exclaim - after gazing , for the first time , upon the picture of Raphael - I , too , am a painter ! In truth , this must have been so ; for he turned away to pursue his toilsome occupation , with the fixed purpose of becoming a lawyer . After he left college , he spent a few days with his relatives and then began his legal studies , in the office of General Beecher , at Lancaster , Ohio - a man of sense and intelligence ; and , for several years , a member of Congress , from Ohio . General Beecher discovered the merit , and approved the efforts of Mr. Ewing . He received him , as a student , into his office ; and , immediately upon his admission to the Bar , took him into partnership . While Mr. Ewing was pursuing his law studies , he was an indefatigable student - devoting to his books every hour , that was not required for necessary repose . In the year 1816 , he was admitted to the Bar ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Courthouse , at Marietta , where , but six years before , he had received his impulse towards the legal profession ; and was there to exert his own powers , in conducting a criminal defence . The charge was larceny , without positive proof ; but , it was supported by a chain of circumstances , that established it beyond doubt . The secret removal of the accused , about the time the goods were missed , was among the circumstances most strongly relied upon by the counsel for the State . In the cross-examination , Mr. Ewing inquired of the witnesses , whether his client had not been // 887 convicted of a similar offence , and punished at the whipping-post . This turned out to be the fact ; and it was a matter of surprise to the Bar and the bye-standers , that he should have been so much off his guard , as to elicit this condemnatory fact . He then directed his examination , almost exclusively , to the manner of removal ; and re-examined the witnesses as to that - and gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all his efforts to the contrary , the proof , in respect to it , remained clear and indisputable . The evidence was closed - the case seemed to be hopeless ; especially in that aspect of it , which the course of examination had made the most important . The counsel for the State fell into the snare which was laid for him . Hardly noticing the other facts , be dwelt alone upon the controverted fact of secret removal . Confidant that the proof was with him , as to that , he magnified its consequences , and made the guilt or innocence of the accused depend upon its existence . This was precisely what the young advocate desired ; and , in his address to the Jury , he at once admitted , to the surprise of all , that the proof of absconding was undeniable . Unless it could be satisfactorily accounted for , he agreed that it was conclusive . He then , with admirable art , addressed himself to the task of explaining it away , consistently with the innocence of the accused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , he had been pnblicly disgraced , at the whipping-post . He had become an object of scorn and derision to the neighborhood . It was not likely that he would remain among those who had witnessed his degradation ; or that , when he had fixed the time of his departurc , he would be surrounded by his neighbors . He would go , just as it appeared he had gone , shunning the sight of those , who had no sympathy for him , and no regret that he was about to leave them . He would depart in silence and secresy . In this way , the effect of this prominent circumstance , upon which the case had been made to depend , was successfully removed . Mr. Ewing 's rise at the Bar was rapid . He entered , almost immediately , into full practice , in the counties of Washington , Athens , Fairfield , Pickaway , Licking , and Knox ; and , as they were subsequently created , in the new counties of Meigs and Perry . Although this circuit embraced a territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a small affair , when compared with the labors of the territorial lawyers , who practice , annually , in Marietta , Cincinnati , Detroit , Vincennes , and Kaskaskia . Mr. Ewing has been distinguished at the Bar , for sound judgment , careful investigation , and the happy faculty of seizing upon any circumstance , occurring during the trial , and moulding it to the purposes of his case . In keeping with the character he // displayed , in the appropriation of his first savings , at Kanawha , he expended his first accumulations at the Bar , in the purchase of a fine tract of land , in Indiana , upon which he settled his father and family . Mr. Ewing finished his collegiate studies at so late a period , and was , subsequently , for some years , so constantly devoted to his profession , that his attention was never turned to political concerns , until the animosities of the old parties of our republic had been healed , by the balmy influence of Mr. Monroe 's administration . He was , consequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party designations ; and hence , he read of and judged of those parties , as he would read and judge of any other matter of history . His election to the United States Senate , was honorable to the legislature of Ohio . Wholly without family influence , and equally destitute of political influence , he was elected from a strong and just sense of his eminent qualifications . Before Mr. Ewing had taken his seat in the Senate , or reached Washington , his reputation preceded him . But , the reputation a Senator may have at home does not always stand examination , when contrasted with the brilliant and powerful minds , with which he comes in contact , upon the enlarged area , where the whole Union meet . A man who is great in a single county , or mighty in his town , may dwindle into insignificance , when his taper is to burn amid the brighter luminaries of the Senate . Not so , however , with Mr. Ewing . He has but shifted the theatre of his reputation , and augmented that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are , more eloquent in manner than he is - to whom , nature has given a finer voice , or a more captivating oratory ; but few are more powerful in thought , few with more resources , few who have more , or better weapons , in any logomachic tilt . At once , he took a high stand , which he yet sustains , and daily strengthens . His speech on the tariff , in 1832 , commanded attention , and had a wide circulation . The same session , Mr. Ewing engaged in the debate upon Mr. Clay 's bill , providing for the distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands , for a limited time ; in which , lie advocated the passage of that bill , with great ability and effect . In the session of 1833 , he made some remarks upon the Force bill , which he supported at the same time that he voted for the Compromise bill of Mr. Clay . These speeches , together with an address to the students of the Miami University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable for its sound sense and excellent advice - and an oration , at the commencement of the Ohio canal , on the fourth of July , 1825 , are all the published speeches or addresses , which have come under our observation , previous to the last session of Congress . // in the agitating session of the last winter and spring , ( 1835 , ) Mr. Ewing bore a conspicuous part . The legislature of Ohio , which , like the legislatures of Maine and New-Jersey , had become suddenly inspired upon the deposite question , so as to see , in a twinkling , through the constitutional and legal questions , which cost other minds days and weeks of painful investigation , at once instructed him to sustain the President . The right of the legislature thus to iustruct , Mr. Ewing did not assent to . The people , he argued , were his constituents , not the legislature . 1'lemorials , almost innumerable , sustaining him , were sent from different parts of Ohio ; and few , and far between , were the memorials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length , upon this deposite question , in April ; and , at various other times , on presenting memorials , he discussed the subject , and the effect of the disordered state of the currency , upon the State , which he in part represented . But , the great object , upon which he was engaged during the session ; the one in which he , in common with his colleagues , Messrs . Clayton and Knight , did the most service to their country - and , of course , thereby brought upon themselves the peculiar abuse of that new department of the Government , commonly known as the Kitchen Cabinet - was the searching investigation made into the affairs of the Post-office Department . Suspicion , three years ago , fell upon that Department . Mr. Clayton , the Senator from Delaware , and Mr. Holmes , the Senator from Maine , both averred , then on the floor of the Senate , that , if the Senate would give them power , they would unfold corruptions and frauds in that Department , which would strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Jackson , however , then prevailed in the Senate , and they dodged this inquiry , by resolving that it was illegal to inquire into impeachable matter ; for , if the Postmaster-General was proved guilty of fraud , the Senate , in its judicial character , might be called upon to impeach and try him ! During the past winter , different auspices prevailed . The Whigs had a majority in the Senate , and upon the Post-office Committee , there was a majority of Whigs , though Mr. Grundy , of Tennessee , was Chairman . This Committee prosecuted the inquiry into the affairs of the Department , with zeal and ability ; and upon Mr. Ewing , who stood next to Mr. Grundy , in the Committee , devolved the duty of making the report . Before this report came out , public expectation was highly excited . Rumors of delinquency in the Post-office Department , were spread far and wide . That corruption and favoritism cxisted , many believed . But , the extent of that delinquency , the magnitude of that corruption , the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the report , signed by // Messrs . Ewing , Clayton and Knight , was published , the whole public was shocked ; and even the most daring defenders of the Administration , staggered under rhe blow . Abuse was lavished upon the Committee , of course , and Mr. Ewing came in for more than his shave . The whole kennel of extra-allowance men , whose abuses he had exposed , were let loose upon him . The implements of that new branch of the Government , of which we have before spoken - the shovel , the tongs , the poker , the spit of the kitchen - were in lively commotion . The Post-office had been their chief instrument , by which this branch of the Government had created itself , and established its reign ; and hence , it was in a tempest of indignation , that any man should dare invade their premises , and drag their deeds to light . But , nevertheless , Mr. Ewing and his associates , boldly entered the Augean stable . Hercules himself , could not have cleansed such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public view , and upon them the public voice is pronouncing its verdict . The first resolution reported by the Committee , condemning the borrowing of money , as illegal , and , of course , without law , was passed by the unanimous voice of the Senate . In the searching investigations , which Mr. Ewing made into the corruptions of this , the most powerful and the most extended , department of the government , he deserves great praise ; and great praise he has received from all . It required great firmness and much heroism of character , to grapple with a power so gigantic , yet so corrupt - a power , that holds all the avenues of intelligence , in this great country ; and that can poison them all , or stop them up , at pleasure ; where sentinels are located almost everywhere , from the islands oii the Atlantic sea-board , to the remotest settlement of the far West ; a power , that enters at every man 's fire-side - upon which almost all are dependent and from whose blows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The moral courage , to ferret out the abuses of this tremendous engine for good or evil , it is fortunate for the country , that Mr. Ewing possessed . He shrank from no responsibility . He bearded the lion in his den . Under the authority of the Senate , he entered the Department itself , and ventured , as it were , into the very penetralia - dragging to light whatever was dark or mysterious , and exposing all to public view . How far corruption would have gone , if he had not thus rebuked it , no one can tell . To what extent the Department would have been involved in debt , what bounds its favoritism would have been contented with , or where it would have stopped , no one could predict . Certain it is , that Mr. Ewing rendered a most essential service to his country ; and one , which the community can not soon forget . // Thus , the reader has seen from what a humble and unpromising beginning , Mr. Exving has reached his present dignified and exalted station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high orderindustry , persevering and unconquerable - and a happy adaptation of means , to accomplish certain ends - no one can doubt . Obstacles , apparently almost insurmountable , he has overcomethus teaching a lesson to all , who , in the outset of life , may be discouraged by dark and gloomy prospects . And , for his industry and exertion , he is reaping a rich reward - not only in the agreeable retrospect of the past , and in the consciousness that he is acting in a sphere , in which nature destined him to move , and is thus doing good to his fellow-men - but in the tribute of thousands of admiring friends ; and there , too , upon the very spot where be acted the humble part of a per diem laborer - a common salt-boiler ! No longer ago than August last , a public dinner was given him , at the Kanawba salines , attended by a large and highly respectable company , where he was greeted and welcomed by his early acquaintance , who had known bim before only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with intense interest , watched his course , as the statesman , the patriot , tbe lawgiver , the accomplished and powerful advocate . All this must have been highly gratifying , and doubly so , in consideration of th' fact , that he was the artificer of his own fortune - and that his old associates were now awardin him the praise for his perseverance and labor . A dinner was also given Mr. Ewing , in Chillicothe , in August last . Mr. lEwing , in person , is large and stoutly built - so that be is , physically as well as intellectually , a strong man . In his early bard labor , in felling the forests of the West , and in feeding the furnace , at the salt-works , his figure must have been developed and strengthened much more than if , in early life , he bad been devoted wholly to sedentary pursuits . To this day , he looks as if be could chop more wood than any other man , as well as chop more logic than the great mass of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leveling the tall trees as for lopping off the excrescences of Post-office patronage and Post-office corruption . His manner of speaking is not graceful , but yet , it commands attention . He is powerful , however , from his matter , rather than in his manner . Plain , open , straight-forward , fearless , with little or no attempt at rhetorical flourish , lie lays hold , with all his might , upon whatsoever his hands find to do . His eye is fixed upon a point , and it is impossible to swerve him from it . His logic is of a mathematical cast , and thus partakes of what was his favorite study . But , be seems to be well informed on every point , that arises in debate , whether it be a matter of history , a matter even of poetry or criticism ; thus shewing , that he has read much , and has not read in vain . How instructive is the life // of such a man - and with what force does it commend itself to every young American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix his ambition bigh , and to gratify it only in the path of virtue , integrity , and honor ; and thus to win that reputation , that abides and outlasts the corrosive rust of Time ! Honors ever seek him , in the virtuous days of a republic , who deserves them ; but , that is not honor , which is won by meanness and intrigue , amid the contempt of the world . Groveling ambition tarnishes and stains whatever it touches ; but , an ambition , like that which animated the bosom of Ewing , dignifies and ennobles whatever it wins.
