txt MR . HALIBURTON , the author of these volumes , we understand , is a citizen of Annapolis in Nova-Scotia , a young lawyer of respectability , and a member of the House of Assembly . He has given us a history and description of his native province , which not only do great credit to himself , and to Nova-Scotia , but will safely hear a comparison with any of the works of a similar kind , that have appeared in the United States . Making use of Mr Haliburton 's work , and of some little knowledge derived from personal observation , we will proceed to lay before our readers a few particulars respecting that province . The continent or mainland of North America was discovered by Sebastian Cabot . He first descried land on the twentyfourth of June , 1497 . There is reason to believe , that the point which he then made was a part of Nova-Scotia . More than seventy years , however , elapsed before any attention was paid by England to the discovered territory . // In 1578 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering , occupying , and peopling such portions of it as were not at that time possessed by Christian people . He sailed from England on the eleventh of June , 1 583 , and arrived at Newfoundland on the eleventh of July . He took formal possession of the whole country as the representative of the English sovereign . Sir Humphrey Gilbert set sail on his return during the month of August of the same year . The vessel in which he embarked foundered at sea , and every soul on board perished . In the year 1607 , Sir John Gilbert , although far advanced in years , in prosecution of his brother 's enterprise sailed for America . He arrived at the mouth of the Kennebec River ; but his fate was equally disastrous with that of Sir Humphrey . Having commenced a settlement upon that river , he fell a victim to the seventies of the succeeding winter . This melancholy event broke up the colony , and the people all returned to England entirely disheartened . The discovery by Cabot , the formal possession taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Gilbert , are the grounds upon which Great Britain places her original right to her North American possessions . In the mean time the French had undertaken many voyages , for purposes of trade , to different parts of the coast ; and in the year 1598 , a formal attempt at colonization was made by them under the direction of the Marquis de la Roche . He attempted a settlement upon the Isle of Sable , which is thirty-five leagues from the main land , or from any other island . It is a dreary and solitary spot , far out in the *cean , barren and uninhabitable , covered with briers , sand hills , and small fresh-xvater ponds . Its length is thirty miles , and its breadth not more than one and a half . It presents the shape of a bow . It seems to answer no other purpose than to afford a sporting ground for seals , and other marine animals . It is covered with a race of exceedingly wild horses , and has heretofore been infested by large numbers of ferocious hogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolate reef of sand , has been the grave of innumerable mariners . The government of Nova-Scotia support a family upon it , and provide them with the means of affording the requisite aid and supplies to wrecked vessels and their tinfortunate crews . This ocean-desert having been absurdly selected as its site , it followed of course that the colony of the Marquis de Ia Roche soon came to a miserable end . // 1 *3 In 1603 Monsieur de Monts was appointed by Henry the Fourth , governor general of the country . On the seventeenth of March , 1604 , he sailed from Havre de Grace , accompanied by Champlain , afterwards celebrated as the founder of Quebec , be Poutrincourt , and by other gentlemen volunteers and adventurers . After having explored the outer shore of Nova-Scotia , they sailed up the Bay of Fundy ; and entering a strait , found themselves enclosed in a spacious and beautiful bay . So delightful was the scene around them , that Pourrincourt determined to establish himself there ; and having received a grant of it , he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first visiters were so much charmed by the aspect of this place . As the voyager is coasting along the bold and elevated shores of the southeastern side of the Bay of Fundy , he is suddenly brought to a narrow passage through which the tides rush with great violence and rapidity ; the banks rising on either side , with almost a perpendicular , and sheltered bay , large enough , it would seem , to hold the navies of the world . The circuit of the horizon is traced on every side by ridges of mountains , richly wooded to the very summit ; the lowland is spread out in wide prairies ; and there is no visible outlet to the sea , the narrow strait being entirely concealed by the projecting hills and lofty forests . At the head of this noble harbor , the Annapolis River , after having flowed through an extended valley of uncommon beauty and amenity of aspect , and watered as rich a soil as any in this part of the continent , alternately pours itself forth in a rapid current with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing tide . Here , in 1605 , was laid the foundation of the first permanent settlement in all British North America . Under the name of Port Royal , this ancient town was the scene , for more than a hundred years , of the most interesting and romantic military adventures and vicissitudes . And now under the name of Annapolis Royal , two centuries and a quarter from its foundation , it presents , in its beauti ftil and expansive scenery ; in its apparent seclusion from the world ; in its historical recollections ; in its ancient fortresses , its deep and verdant moat , anti narrow draw-bridge , and mouldering batteries ; in its rich and prosperous back country ; in its peaceful tranquillity ; and above all , in its amiable and intelligent // gent population , one of the most interesting villages in North America . It is probable that no place in the new world has passed through so many and so remarkable changes , as the little town of Annapolis . It was twice deserted by its inhabitants in the earliest years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten times ; five times had it surrendered to the prowess of the English , and again been restored to France , when by the treaty of 1713 , it was finally ceded to Great l3ritam . It has repulsed five assaults ; the Indians having invested it unsuccessfully three times , and the French twice . Louisburg , so celehrated in American history , is within the limits of the Province of Nova-Scotia . It is memorable as having been the scene of two remarkable sieges ; and its fortifications were so skilfully arranged , and combined great advantages of position with such formidable batteries , that it was for a long time considered as impregnable . It was reserved however for New-England troops , provincial and undisciplined , to remove this impression . It was an army from Massachusetts and the surrounding provinces , that first bid defiance to all its artillery and surmounted all its intrenchments ; an army , as Mr Haliburton happily observes , composed of husbandmen and merchants , and pursuing its operations in conformity to a plan which was projected by a lawyer ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly been regarded as one of the most daring and brilliant military achievements on record . It was besieged again , some years afterwards , by a large army of British regulars and a powerful fleet , and was once more captured . Great skill and courage were displayed on this occasion also . This place , so famous in the annals of colonial warfare , where the hardy inhabitants of New England prepared themselves , as in a school , for the gallant part which they were afterwards called to bear in the conquest of Quebec , and finally in the war of their own independence , is at present nearly destitute of inhabitants ; a few fishermen pursue their humble calling on its banks , but its massive fortifications are all demolished , and its lofty towers are reduced to a level . There is a sublime and affecting contrast between the desolation , which now marks its unpeopled site , and the proud armies that once shone on its ramparts , and busy crowds that once thronged its streets ; between the deep silence which broods over its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst along its bosom from embattled navies. // The most remarkable event in the history of Nova-Scotia is the seizure and transportation of the Acadians . The fortune of war had often thrown this l ) 1'ovmce into the hands of the British , previous to its final surrender to them by treaty . Circumstances , however ' , of various kinds , bad prevented its colonization by English people . The French were the first occupants , and had established themselves wherever an opening had been made into the wilderness ; and the strong antipathy , incidental to the rivalry between these two nations , rendered the English reluctant to settle with the French , and the French unwilling to receive them . The Indian tribes had been made to sympathize with the French in their peculiar hostility to the English , so that it was extremely dangerous for any of the latter people to reside near them . It was accordingly found , when the country was finally ceded to Great Britain , that the inhabitants were mostly of French descent . As their countrymen gave the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were called Acadians . They spoke the French language , were Roman Catholics , and naturally entertained a strong affection towards the country , which had been the home of their fathers . After the cession of Nova-Scotia to England , they were required to take the oath of allegiance to their new sovereign or to quit the province . They agreed to take the oath , provided it was guarantied to them , that they never should be required to take up arms against their former country , France , or their ancient allies , the Indians . The governor of Nova-Scotia assured them that the condition which they ( lemanded would be assented to ; and accordingly they took the oath . The government m England , however , refused to sanction the assurance given them by the governor of the province , and peremptorily required that they should unconditionally take the oath . This they unanimously and invariably refused to do ; and thus matters stood from year to year , for nearly half a century . It so happened , that in the of wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , many individuals of the Acadian population were found several times fighting with the latter ; and although it is quite evident , that the great body of the Acadians were sincerely peaceable , and had endeavored to keep as much as possible aloof from all contention , yet it was very certain that their sympathies were // prone to direct themselves towards the enemies of the province , and it was well understood that the French missionaries were unwearied in using their influence over them , which was great , in opposition to the English . It is not at all surprising , therefore , that the officers of the British government regarded the presence of the Acadians as highly injurious to the peace , and dangerous to the safety , of the province ; and although it was a strong measure , it is perhaps still the opinion of many , that they were authorized to decide , as they did , L1*Ofl the expulsion of this unfortunate people from Nova-Scotia . But , let that he as it may , it was secretly determined to drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their removal to Canada would only strengthen the power of the great enemy , it was resolved to transport them to different parts of the British American Colonies , and distribute them in such small numbers in the various provinces , that they would not be able to combine together , and would soon become mingled and lost in the great mass of the English population . Before we advert to the execution of this severe decree , let us take a view of the character and condition of the devoted race . In describing them we have no occasion to do more than quote from Mr Haliburton 's narrative . Hunting and fishing , which had formerly been the delight of the colony , and might have still supplied it with subsistence , had no further attraction for a simple and quiet people , and gave way to agriculture , which had been established in the marshes and low lands , by repelling with dikes the sea and rivers which covered these plains . These grounds yielded fifty for one at first , and afterwards fifteen or twenty for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they likewise produced rye , barley , and maize . There were also potatoes in great plenty , the use of which was become common . At the same time these immense meadows were covered with numerous flocks . They computed as many as sixty thousand head of horned cattle ; and most families had several horses , though the tillage was carried on by oxen . Their habitations , which were constructed of wood , were extremely convenient , and furnished as neatly as subtantial farmers ' houses in Europe . They reared a great deal of poultry of all kinds , which made a variety in their food , at once wholesome and plentiful . Their ordinary drink was beer and cider , to which they sometimes added rum . Their usual clothing was in general the produce of their own flax , or the fleeces of their own sheep ; with these they made common linens and coarse cloths . If any of // them had a desire for articles of greater luxury , they procured them from Annapolis or Louisburg , and gave in exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing else to give their neighbors , and made still fewer exchanges among themselves ; because each separate family was able , and had been accustomed , to provide for its own wants . They therefore knew nothing of paper currency , which was so common throughout the rest of North America . Even the small quantity of gold and silver which had been introduced into the colony , did not inspire that activity in which consists its real value . Their manners were of course extremely simple . There was seldom a cause , either civil or criminal , of impoftance enough to be carried before the Court of Judication , established at Annapolis . Whatever little differences arose from time to time among them , were amicably adjusted by their elders . All their public acts were drawn by their pastors , who had likewise the keeping of their wills ; for which , and their religious services , the inhabitants paid a twenty-seventh part of their harvest , which was always sufficient to afford more means than there were objects of generosity . Real misery was wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every misfortune was relieved , as it were , before it could be felt , without ostentation on the one hand , and without meanness on the other . It was , in short , a society of brethren ; every individual of which was equally ready to give , and to receive , what he thought the common right of mankind . So perfect a harmony naturally prevented all those connexions of gallantry which are so often fatal to the peace of families . This evil was prevented by early marriages , for no one passed his youth in a state of celibacy . As soon as a young man arrived to the proper age , the community built him a house , broke up the lands about it , and supplied him with all the necessaries of life for a twelve-month . There he received the partner whom he had chosen , and who brought him her portion in flocks . This new family grew and prospered like the others . In 1755 , all together made a population of eighteen thousand souls . Such is the pic .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raynal . By many , it is thought to represent a state of social happiness , totally mncon* sistent with the frailties and passions of human nature ; and that it is worthy rather of the poet than the historian . In describing a scene of rural felicity like this , it is not improbable that his nar* rative has partaken of the warmth of feeling for which he was remarkable ; but it comes much nearer the truth than is generally imagined . Tradition is fresh and positive in the various parts of the United States , where they were located , respecting their guileless , peaceable , and scrupulous character ; and the descendants of those , whose long cherished and endearing local attachment // induced them to return to the land of their nativity , still deserve the name of a mild , frugal , and pious people . ' Vol. i. pp. 170-173 . As it would have been impossible for the English to get them into their possession , if the design of carrying them away had been made known ; and as it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the reach of detection in the recesses of the forest , secure , as they were , of the alliance and sympathy of the Indians ; it became necessary to devise the means of collecting and taking them by stratagem . It was determined that a proclamation should he issued requiring their attendance at specified places , in their several settleruents , on the same day . The proclamation was so framed in its phraseology , that the design could not be discovered , and so severe in its penalties , that none would dare to disobey . By this cunning contrivance , nearly the whole population was surprised simultaneously throughout the province . The reader may form an idea of the scene presented on this fatal day throughout the Acadian settlements , by the following account of the proceedings at Grand Pro , in King 's county . Colonel John Winslow of Marshfield , in Massachusetts , was entrusted with the management of the affair at this place . He is described by Mr Haliburton , as an officer of great humanity and firmness . Having issued his proclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1755 , at three o'clock in the afternoon in the church at Grand Pro , the unsuspecting and innocent Acadians , to the number of four hundred and eighteen able-bodied men , were found , at the appointed hour , in the appointed place . Colonel Winslow , accompanied by his officers , standing in the centre of the church , addressed them to the following effect . Gentlemen ; I have received from his Excellency Governor Lawrence , the King 's Commission1 which I have in roy hand ; and by his orders you are convened together to manifest to you , his Majesty 's final resolution to the French inhabitants of this his Province ofNova-Scotia ; who , for almost half a century , have had more indulgence granted them than any of his subjects in any part of his dominions ; what use you have made of it you yourselves best know . The part of duty I am now upon , though necessary , is very disagreeable to my natural make and temper , as I know it must be grievious to you , who are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to animadvert , but to obey such orders as I receive , and therefore , without hesitation , shall deliver you his Najesty 's orders // and instructions , namely-that your lands and tenements , cattle of all kinds and live stock of all sorts , are forfeited to the Crown ; with all other your effects , saving your money and household goods , and you yourselves to be removed from this his Province . Thus it is peremptorily his Majesty 's orders , that the whole French inhabitants of these Districts be removed ; and I am , through his Majesty 's goodness , directed to allow you liberty to carry off your money and household goods , as many as you can without discommoding the vessels you go in . I shall do everything in my power , that all those goods be secured to you , and that you are not molested in carrying them off ; also , that whole families shall go in the same vessel , and make this remove , which I am sensible must give you a great deal of trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hope that , in whatever part of the world you may fall , you may be faithful subjects , a peaceable and happy people . I must also inform you , that it is his Majesty 's pleasure that you remain in security under the inspection and direction of the troops that I have the honor to command . ' Vol. i. pp. 176 , 177 . After this address , Colonel Winslow declared them the king 's prisoners . Mr Haliburton adds , that The whole number of persons collected at Grand Pr6 , finally amounted to four hundred and eighty-three men , and three hundred and thirty-seven women , heads of families ; and their sons and daughters , to five hundred and twenty-seven of the former , and five hundred and seventy-six of the latter ; making in the whole one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three souls . Their stock consisted of one thousand two hundred and sixty-nine oxen , one thousand five hundred and fifty-seven cows , five thousand and seven young cattle , four hundred and ninety-three horses , eight thousand six hundred and ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As some of these wretched inhabitants escaped to the woods , all possible measures were adopted to force them back to captivity . The country was laid waste to prevent their subsistence . In the District of Minas alone , there were destroyed tw6 hundred and fifty-five houses , two hundred and seventy-six barns , one hundred and fifty-five out-houses , eleven mills , and one church ; and the friends of those who refused to surrender , were threatened as the victims of their obstinacy . ' Vol. i. pp. 177 , 178 . In consequence of their earnest entreaties , the men were permitted , ten at a time , to return to visit their wretched families , and to look , for the last time , upon the beautiful fields of their loved and lost homes . // They bore their confinement , and received their sentence , with a fortitude and resignation altogether unexpected ; but when the hour of embarcation arrived , in which they were to leave the land of their nativity for ever  --  to part with their friends and relatives , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dispersed among strangers , whose language , customs , and religion were opposed to their own , the weakness of human nature prevailed , and they were overpowered with the sense of their miseries . The preparations having been all completed , the 10th of September was fixed upon as the day of departure . The prisoners were drawn up six deep , and the young men , one hundred and sixty-one in number , were ordered to go first on board of the vessels . This they instantly and peremptorily refused to do , declaring that they would not leave their parents ; but expressed a willingness to comply with the order , provided they were permitted to embark with their families . This request was immediately rejected , and the troops were ordered to fix bayonets and advance towards the prisoners , a motion which had the effect of producing obedience on the part of the young men , who forthwith commenced their march . The road from the chapel to the shore , just one mile in length , was crowded with women and children ; who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their tears and their blessings ; while the prisoners advanced with slow and reluctant steps , weeping , praying , and singing hymns . This detachment was followed by the seniors , who passed through the same scene of sorrow and distress . In this manner was the whole male part of the population of the District of Minas put on board the five transports , stationed in the river Gaspereaux ; each vessel being guarded by six non-commissioned officers , and eighty privates . As soon as the other vessels arrived , their wives and children followed , and the whole were transported from Nova-Scotia . The haste with which these measures were carried into execution did not admit of those preparations for their comfort , which , if unmerited by their disloyalty , were at least due in pity to the severity of their punishment . The hurry , confusion , and excitement , connected with the embarcation , had scarcely subsided , when the Provincials were appalled at the work of their own hands . The novelty and peculiarity of their situation could not but force itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of a beautiful and fertile country , they suddenly found themselves without a foe to subdue , and without a population to protect . The volumes of smoke , which the half expiring embers emitted , while they marked the site of the peasant 's humble cottage , bore testimony to the extent of the work of destruction . For several successive evenings the cattle assembled round the smouldering ruins , as if in anxious expectation of the return of // their masters ; while all night long the faithful watch-dogs of the Neutrals howled over the scene of desolation , and mourned , alike the hand that had fed , and the house that had sheltered them . ' Vol . I. pp. 179-131 . A similar scene was presented throughout all the Acadian settlements . In many places the most desperate resistance was attempted , but all was unavailing ; they had been ensnared by stratagem , and were overpowered by numbers . The inexorable decree was carried into complete effect . The whole population , amounting to eighteen thousand souls , were suddenly and violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared and cultivated , and on which they were born and had hoped to die ; were robbed of their most valuable property ; were separated from their families and friends , and crowded , as in slave-ships , into small vessels , at the rate of two persons for each ton ; were transported to distant provinces , and scattered , in humiliation , in poverty , and with broken hearts , in communities hostile to their religion and country , and averse to their manners and customs , without knowing each other 's fate , and without the least ground of hope , that they should ever meet again on earth . The following instance will enable the reader in some degree to realize the misery produced by the consummation of this cruel edict . Those Acadians , who had uniformly befriended the British authorities , were treated in the same manner as the rest ; no exception was made , no dispensa-. tion granted , no favor , no meritorious service remembered . There was a notary public , named R6n6 Leblane , who had formerly suffered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried into captivity by the Indians , and kept a p'risoner four years , solely on that account . At the time of the expulsion of the Acadians , he was still living , having attained a venerable age . He had twenty children , and about one hundred and fifty grand-children . They were all transported like so many convicts . They were compelled to embark in different vessels , and were scattered in distant provinces . The unfortunate old man was put on shore at New York , with his wife and his two youngest children only . Bent as he was by the infirmity of age , and overpowered by the weight of affliction , his parental affection still prompted him to seek out his lost children . He reached Philadelphia . There he found three of them . But his strength was exhausted , and he could go // no farther . His misfortunes were greater than he could bear . He despaired of discovering his remaining children , and in penury , obscurity , and sorrow , sunk into his grave . It may be questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident than the exile of this amiable and happy people , or a more sad and affecting spectacle , than the desolation of their depopulated homes ; their moaning flocks and herds ; their rich and waving meadows turned into a desert ; and the smoking ashes of their houses and barns . While the traveller contemplates the noble dikes reared by their industry , by means of which whole regions have been won from the rivers and the sea ; while he walks beneath the shade of their abundant orchards , and stands over the ruins of their cottages , or muses among their graves , his imagination goes back to a scene of rural felicity and purity , in which the fables of antiquity were realized ; his heart melts in sympathy with the sudden misfortunes and the dreadful fate of the poor Acadians . Nova-Scotia is remarkable for the number of spacious and sheltered harbors along the whole line of its , northern , eastern , and southern coasts . It is intersected by many beautiful rivers , and is dotted by lakes of every variety of size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and point out the routes of several canals , which have already , under the direction of the public-spirited legislature of the province , been explored , and will soon , without doubt , by means of the patronage and aid of that body , be completed . Throughout the circuit of its shores ( and it is connected with the continent by a very narrow isthmus ) , the sea affords an abundant supply of fish . Some parts of its soil are barren , but a large proportion is rich and fertile , and in several districts equal to any in the Atlantic States . There are few , if any , better agricultural townships in America , than Cornwallis and Horton in Nova-Scotia . Beneath the soil there is an abundance of lead and iron ore : indeed the natural advantages of the province are uncommonly great , and it can not be doubted that under the judicious and liberal administration of the local legislature , they will be rapidly and fully improved . Halifax , the capital of the province , is one of the most convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and private dwellings present an aspect remarkably neat and agreeable to the eye . Mr Haliburton speaks with // great enthusiasm of the Navy Yard and the Province House . The latter indeed is a remarkably fine structure , and although we are disposed to hesitate in admitting that they surpass everything of the kind in North America , we can not take offence at his positive and unqualified assertion to that effect . The political condition of the northeastern British American provinces , is in many respects favorable . The legislature consists of a Governor and Council , deriving their places and authority from the crown , and a House of Assembly , elected by the qualified voters among the inhabitants . The House holds the purse of the province , and controls the expenditures of the civil department of government . The whole sum derived from the customs goes into the province treasury , and is subject to the disposition of the House of Assembly . The consequence is , that but little is needed from the people in the way of direct tax . Mr Haliburton rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect with that of the people of the United States . Yet the records of the proceedings of the legislature of Nova-Scotia exhibit several instances of a great waste of money . The House of Assembly , merely to gratify Lord Dalbousie , granted several thousand pounds towards erecting a college in Halifax , which Mr Haliburton acknowledges is not needed . There are too many instances of votes granting large sums of money to be expended upon swords and stars for the British generals and admirals , who have happened to be in command there . It is very undignified and quite discordant with the principles of their own constitution , for the popular and native branch of the legislature to pay this obsequious court to a foreign executive . There is a college at Windsor , established by a charter from the king , and supported by the unremitted and profuse bounty of the Assembly . It is beautifully situated , possesses an excellent library , and has the reputation of giving a very good classical education to its pupils . But although it has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons the degree of bachelor of arts . This is probably owing to the untoward circumstance , that the doctrinal test of the Church of England is imposed upon its students . There is also an excellent academy at Pictou , for the education of dissenters ; but the legislature , by refusing to continue to it any patronage , seem to be disposed to permit it to languish The Council , ( leriving their // seats from the British government , have determined to negative any law granting assistance to this dissenting institution ; and the representatives of the people in the House of Assembly , although three quarters of their constituents are opposed to the English Church , still continue to grant a large annual sum to the Royal Episcopal College at Windsor . Mr Haliburton has added much to the value of his work , by prefixing to it a large and well executed map of NovaScotia , by inserting several plates , representing the aspect and outlines of places of interest , and by some very useful and instructive statistical tables . Among the latter is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nova-Scotia , as they were ascertained by means of a census . Among the principal evils of a colonial condition , is the want of a stirring spirit of enterprise in the mass of the people , and the degradation of the civil and professional pursuits , produced by the glare and glitter of an elegant and imposing military life , as it is exhibited in the finely arrayed British regiments , that are quartered in the provincial garrisons . In closing our remarks upon Mr Haliburton 's work , we would again recommend it to those who are interested in American history . It is written with clearness , spirit , industrious accuracy , and with great candor and justice . It needs a more copious index , and is perhaps rather deformed , than improved by the chronological table of events from 1763 ( where the history terminates ) to 1828 . It must necessarily be very defective , and , brief as it is , it contains much useless matter . What connexion , for instance , is there between the history of NovaScotia , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born June 5 , 1771 . ' Still , notwithstanding these slight blemishes , the Historical and Statistical Account of NovaScotia ' is a valuable work , honorable to its author , and worthy of the thanks of his native province , which have so handsomely been communicated to him by the speaker of the House of Assembly , in compliance with a vote of that body . It is very desirable that the people of the United States and of the British Provinces should become better acquainted , and be led to take a more lively interest in each other . Their fathers were united by the bond of a common country ; and it needs no spirit of prophecy to foresee that the time must come , when , in the natural course of events , the English colonies on our borders will be peaceably dissevered from the re // 135 mote mother country , and the whole continent , from the Gulf of Mexico to the coast of Labrador , present the unbroken outline of one compact empire of friendly and confederated states.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
