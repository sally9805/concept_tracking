txt THE evils of the existing dynasty are not yet consummated . Our merchants and manufacturers have not yet suffered sufficiently from the blessings of government . Society has not yet been sufficiently shocked by proscription , by usurpation , by violence , by menace , by corruption . The cup is not yet full . The catalogue is not yet complete . To domestic dissention , and the bitterness of party animosity , we are to add , in all human probability , the calamity of foreign war ; a war , idly , rashly , and wantonly induced . The French government oxved monies to the United States , as an indemnity for spoliations committed upon our commerce during the convulsions which ushered in the present century , and shook Europe , and the world , to its centre . The French Executive acknowledged the debt , and became party to a treaty in which it promised to pay a liquidated sum . The treaty was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for its approval , with a view of securing the requisite appropriations to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many members entertained an impression that the ministers had been deceived , and had stipulated to pay what was notreasonably due . Arguments were brought forward , which might well incline a disinterested person to doubt as to some of the concessions of the government . A full , temperate , and able discussion of the whole subject ensued ; our claims were fairly advocated , with zeal and eloquence , on the part of the minister , who had allowed them ; they were combated with equal zeal and eloquence , by members who thought they had reason to dispute their justice . It resulted in the rejection of the Bill to carry articles of the Treaty into effect , by a vote of one hundred and seventy-six to one hundred and sixty-eight . Much excitement prevailed at the time , and the Chamber immediately adjourned . Now , in all this , we have no doubt that the Chamber acted in good faith ; that its members honestly intended to pay all that was honestly due , and were resolved not to pay a cent more . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment of our present administration , to ask nothing that is not clearly right , and to submit to nothing that is wrong . ' If that sentiment be laudable in President Jackson , it is equally praiseworthy in the Chamber of Deputies . They had a constitutional and legal right to reject the treaty of the ministers , if they considered it unjust ; they were bound to do so , by every impulse of honor and patriotism . Objections were started in the course of that debate , which might well make it the duty of the Chamber to take more time ; to insist on a delay , until the objections could be removed , and the difficulties explained - and all this too , without subjecting themselves to the charge of ill faith . The King of France promised to pay money - with the proviso , of course , which most kings must make , that his subjects would give him the wherewithal to pay . The representatives of the people veto the treaty of their monarch . Must both king and people have acted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through their representatives , grant a recharter to an existing corporation ; subject , of course , to the will of the executive . The President puts his veto on the grant of Congress . Is there any ill faith in this difference of two branches of government ? Can the corporation accuse Congress of deception and injustice , because their charter is not confirmed ? Can our government justly accuse , or fairly suspect Louis Phillipe of a designed fraud , because the Chamber of Deputies desire time to investigate his agreement to pay money , before they furnish him the money which he has agreed to pay ? Still , however , France oxves us money , and we must get it . Under the circumstances as above described , with the assurance on the part of the King and his ministers , of a strong desire to pay the whole amount of the claims - and the intention to urge their immediate settlement strongly on the Chamber of Deputies - what course ought our government to pursue ? What course has it pursued The very course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims ; and which places this country in an awkward position , if it do not by war compel a settlement . A menace is thrown out . The Chamber of Deputies is told by our President , if you do not pay , I will make you . I shall advise my Congress to grant me power to issue letters of marque , and my ships of war and privateers shall cut off your commerce in every sea . ' For what purpose was this menace thrown out ? It could not have been to effect a settlement . Will the French Chamber of Deputies , in the eyes of all Europe , place themselves under the suspicion of being driven into the execution of a treaty , whose justice they had previously denied ? To avoid the shadow of such a suspicion , would they not be justified in assuming a // hostile attitude , and telling our government that they had placed the matter on an entirely new basis ? Was the threat thrown out as a salvo to national honor ? Either the national honor has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been wronged or insulted , there is no time to be lost in punishing the wrong-doer . War should be at once declared . Every hour that we delay , adds to the weight of our disgrace . If we have not been injured , is it not uncourteous and unjust to an old ally , to accuse her openly of a desire and intention to commit injustice ? Is it not most unbecoming in the chief magistrate , to recommend prospective legislation on an anticipated injury ? And what kind of prospective legislation ? Is a course advised , that is likely to answer the purposes designed by all retaliatory measures - to benefit ourselves , and injure onr enemies ? Not at all . The inhabitants of the United States will be the only large sufferers , by the adoption of the system of reprisals . France has a small commercial marine , but a numerous and wellappointed navy ; we have a small , though skilful and gallant navy , but a commerce that whitens every sea with its sails . In a fair contest then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the largest amount of property exposed . For every dollar which France has exposed , the United States have thousands . France will be comparatively a small loser , while the planters , and merchants , and manufacturers of this country , will have a great market closed upon them , and will be open in every part of the globe to the depredations of cruisers and pirates of every name and nation under Heaven . The national prosperity will be sadly and suddenly arrested : but this will be by no means the greatest evil . Is there nothing in the privateering system recommended by the President , which tends to demoralize and degrade our people ? To foster the too prevailing spirit of violence ; to feed rapacity , to beget crime ? Is it not calculated to inflame a thirst for rapine , to aggravate a passion for plunder ? On what principles is privateering usually conducted ? From a desire of gain , not honor ; of profit , not renown ; to swell the leaf of a ledger , not to inscribe a page of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any length of time , leave the morals of any nation in a worse state than it found them ? We do not hesitate , then , to pronounce the suggestion of the President , in every respect unworthy and injudicious ; unworthy , because it is a gross attack on the integrity and honor of a nation which was our earliest ally , and to which we have been attached by no ordinary relations of amity ; injudicious , because it must frustrate the very purpose for which it was intended , and beause it proposes an ineffectual remedy for an evil which , in all probability , // it can not but induce . If the Chamber of Deputies have not yet confirmed the treaty , we can anticipate only a most awkward and ridiculous dilemma . It will refuse to grant the stipulated indemnity . The President then must follow up his menace . Then will come the system of reprisals , the consequent shock to our national industry and enterprise , and the ultimate loss of the whole amount of our claims . If he recede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of having thrown out a threat which he lacked the ability to carry into execution . To what then may be reasonably attributed the course of the *resident ? To the spirit of quarrel and violence which has marked every measure of his administration ; to a passion for renown , an unsatisfied appetite for GLORY . Having exhausted all the sources of domestic excitement , he seeks a new theatre for the indulgence of his passion and the display of his powers . This spirit must be checked , and peremptorily checked . The stern and sober rebuke of a reflecting people must be put upon every measure , designed to invest him with additional military power . The insane and wicked adulations of worthless sycophants have swollen him with an idle admiration of his own per sonal greatness . He has been told , day by day , in the columns of his official journal , that the battle of New-Orleans is the greatest triumph recorded in history , and that he is himself the greatest conqueror of the age in which he lives . He has imbibed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath - and the country may yet have reason to learn , from the saddest experience , that as sycophancy , subservience to power , and popular delusion , did not disappear with the empire of Rome , so ambition , and unhallowed lust of glory and dominion have not been buried in the tomb of Cmesar.
