txt THE most instructive chapter in the comprehensive records of philosophy , is example . There its principles are illustrated in action ; its spirit typified in life . By this agency has the divine Being most perfectly revealed himself : arid by it , in the moral economy of his universe , are the virtuous energies of humanity continually renewed . The happiest inspiration of which society is the source , is the influence diffused through it , in various attractive forms , by its most distinguished members . Coleridge has beautifully , and , with his accustomed significance , remarked , that " it is only by celestial observations that even terrestrial charts can be constructed scientifically . " To gaze steadfastly at the intellectual and moral lights of the world , is at once the criterion and pledge of our own advancement ; and in that constellation there are for all of us , some bright , particular stars , which , on account of their proximity to the region of our peculiar circumstances and sympathies , should be most earnestly and studiously regarded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , as it furnishes the example of one who lived and died the active denizen of a commercial community like our own ; of one whose native endowments were by no means brilliant , and whose circumstances , as far as they were prosperous , were created by himself ; of one who , thus situated , nobly won and modestly wore the wreath of literary honor , the credit of self-denying probity , the name of a philanthropist ; and who accomplished this by the simple but sublime energy of his character , by the " power of virtue in the human soul . " // If any extrinsic circumstances could augment the satisfaction with which we shall review the life and comment upon the character before us , they may be found in the fact that we are indebted for our sources of information to the son of him we contemplate . The volumes mentioned at the head of this article , are an offering of filial respect and gratitude . And notwithstanding the delicacy of the duty , it has been most happily performed . William Roscoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mount Pleasant , in , or near the town of Liverpool . His parentage was humble , and his early years blessed with maternal fidelity , but unmarked by any indications of intellectual precocity , and not favored by influences superior to his condition . His own memory could suggest but one or two characteristics of his infant days , and the most prominent of these were a deep and instinctive dislike to restraint , and a fondness for solitary rambling along the river of his native town . At the age of twelve years the discipline of a common school education was exchanged for a course of life involving a degree of physical effort , and an opportunity for communion with nature , the genial effects of which , upon so susceptible a being , were such as circumstances of more apparent advantage might have failed in producing . Young Roscoe was called to assist his father in the business of agriculture and the sale of its products ; the intervals of leisure which occurred during these employments , were devoted to reading . Doubtless , the three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and mind are so liable to receive permanent impressions from slight causes , were very influential in giving solidity to his constitution , and in fitting his intellect and feelings for that maturity of action which so happily followed . " This mode of life , " says he , in a letter to a friend , " gave health and vigor to my body , and amusement and instruction to my mind ; and to this day , I well remember the delicious sleep which succeeded my labors and from which I was again called at an early hour . If I were now asked whom I considered to be happiest of the human race , I should answer those who cultivate the earth by their own hands . " At fifteen , when called upon to adopt a profession , that of a bookseller was at first chosen , and even entered upon ; but in a very brief period , attendance upon the shop proved weansome , // and in the end he was articled for six years to an attorney . The duties of his clerkship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they possessed continually increasing claims in his view , as upon his future success in the pursuit he had chosen , his family mainly depended for support . Yet from these labors he would ever and anon turn to those less practical , but more attractive subjects of attention , which cheered the sterile and often irksome walks of duty , and turned the springs of thought to finer issues . Shenstone became successively his beloved companion and admired model , till the author of the Deserted Village shared the empire of his young but fervent literary love . A few but choice intimacies were formed ; these gradually ripened into friendships which seem to have been singularly productive of mutual good . Under their benign incitement and cheering companionship , Roscoe studied the ancient languages , and was induced by the counsel and aid of one peculiarly gifted and proportionally beloved , to devote that attention to the Italian language and literature which , in after life , was the foundation of his literary success . At this time commenced his habitual cultivation of poetry , in which he acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , and imparted a cheerful and elevated excitement to his whole pilgrimage on earth . Yet with all these expanding and improving tastes the direct business of his youthful years received his first and most faithful care . " It is true , " he remarks , " the amusements of poetry , and the incense of praise constitute of themselves some degree of happiness , and , it may be said , happiness should never be slighted . But , alas I am a traveller , and before 1 intend to indulge myself , I propose to get to the end of my journey . If every beautiful prospect and every shepherd 's pipe must allure me out of my road , what probability is there that I shall ever find myself at rest ? " His poetical compositions , written before the age of manhood , indicate the benevolent enterprizes toward which the ardent energies of opening life tended , and to which so fair a portion of its noon and evening were devoted , - the abolition of the African Slave Trade , and the intellectual elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many spirits of inferior philanthropy , but in relation to the second , he evinced , even in the morning of life , a deep and discerning benevolence . Then , as ever after , he recognized // the necessity of an element that should modify the influences of the commercial world , and cherish the latent sentiment of human nature among the bustling members of a mercantile community . That he was well aware of the requisiteness of an agent more effectual than mere taste in the process of improving society , that he owed his moral growth and the power and purity of his mental efforts to a deeper principle , is not alone evidenced by the general tone of his life and recorded views . At this time he was the author of an able and forcible tract upon religious duty , the sentiments of which were directly deduced from the teachings of Christianity . During the year 1774 , Mr. Roscoe commenced practice , being admitted to the King 's bench . His assiduity and conscientious spirit in the early , and therefore , most anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his correspondence with Miss Jane Griffies , whose destiny it was to become the companion , and minister to the happiness of a life , which derived its deepest and most constant satisfaction from domestic influences . These letters ( which , it may be observed , passed between the parties while residing in the same town , - with the few exceptions , occasioned by the temporary absence of the latter , ) breathe a most confiding affection ; but it is an affection dignified with a religious and intellectual sentiment , that deepened , while it embalmed it ; it was a love evidenced chiefly by an earnest interest in the legitimate good of its object , - a love based on similarity of taste and sympathy of purpose ; a love which inspired only to improve . " 1 can not help pleasing myself ( says Mr. R. in one of the first of his epistles , ) with the reflection , what an infinite variety of subjects this intercourse will give rise to . Convinced of the perfect confidence that exists between us , how freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might cause some little attention to the mode of expression , whilst the certainty of mutual indulgence would prevent us from being apprehensive about trivial inaccuracies. * , The first incident which broke in upon the quiet routine of his life , after his marriage , was a professional visit to London . On this occasion , he experienced , in no small degree , a trial which seems the nearest conceivable approach to the situation of Tantalus , - that of being surrounded with the luxuries of literature and art , with the quiet impulse of taste , whetted // into a keen appetite by their alluring presence , while the want of means condemns it to remain unsatisfied . The additions to his library and collection of prints , were made , therefore , very gradually , and the extreme conscientiousness with which he indulged so innocent a taste , must have greatly enhanced their value . The introduction of some original sketches into the exhibition of a Society of Art in Liverpool , in 1784 , indicates his increasing interest in its practice ; but this is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers to its promotion . During the next year he delivered a course of lectures on the subject , and by means of a poem on the Origin of Engraving , and several valuable contributions of a more fugitive character , labored to propagate correct notions of the principles of art , and excite an interest in its elevating pursuits . But , perhaps , his feelings and efforts in regard to these objects , are most happily associated with that ready appreciation of the works of art , in all their variety , and that earnest sympathy with and friendship for professed artists , which is so beautiful a feature of his life and character . Three years after , however , his philanthropic spirit was engaged in an enterprize involving results of a more momentous nature , and demanding no small measure of perseverance and moral courage . Its success involved the utter annihilation of one of the most lucrative branches of the commerce of Liverpool ; and those pledged to its advancement , were forced , to a greater or less extent , to come forth from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and engage in a contest calculated to excite strong feelings of personal and political animosity . These circumstances were so diametrically opposed to the temper and taste of Mr. Roscoe , that had it been a cause of less moral importance , he might have been excused for transferring the responsibility of its defence to others . But intimately allied as was the issue with the cause of humanity , the triumph of Christianity , and the character of his native land , it appealed to the highest principles of his nature ; and with him such an appeal was never in vain . In the course of this year , therefore , appeared a poem entitled the Wrongs of Africa , - a pamphlet demonstrating the injustice and impolicy of a traffic in her children ; and , soon after , a most masterly reply to a specious attempt to prove its lawfulness on the authority of Scripture . By these // and similar writings , by personal intercourse and correspondence with Wilberforce , and other enlightened friends of this great cause , and especially by creating a Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , Mr. Roscoe contributed largely to the happy result with which the enterprize was eventually crowned . It can not be supposed that the progress of an event which riveted the attention and divided the opinions of the civilized world , failed to attract the anxious attention , and elicit the thoughts and feelings of Roscoe . Accordingly , we find him at the opening of the French Revolution , acting under the influence of that love of man , and that faith in the ultimate supremacy of his higher nature , whence only springs aui enlightened attachment to the principles of freedom . Of all the occasional products of his muse , none have been more popular or excellent in their kind , than those induced by the first brilliant stage of this event . Of his intelligent sympathy and conduct , at this period , his correspondence and public course furnish the most honorable testimony . In his case , as in that of many others , it was the primary means of drawing into political life and effort talents and sympathies , which , but for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more retired interests of literature . But it was not his case , like that of many of his contemporaries , when the dark era of the Revolution came on , to lose his faith in the blessedness of genuine political freedom . He discriinmated between the effects of a long-sustained state of moral degradation upon the people , and the legitimate spirit of genuine political independence . Both he believed subject to the eternal laws of truth , and therefore deemed it as unphilosophical as sinful , to refer the recklessness and atrocity of a debased populace , to the pure and generous impulse of true liberty . Attention to the language of Italy , to which Mr. Roscoe 's mind was , as before stated , early directed , soon introduced him to an acquaintance with her standard authors . The study of these , during the whole period we have cursorily reviewed , formed one of the principal sources of his literary recreation . In perusing the historians , particularly Machiavelli and Ammirato , who wrote the Florentine annals , his primitive interest in the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently cherished purpose of writing his life , confirmed . The utility of such a work , if successfully // executed , none could better understand than himself ; yet , even he did not apparently anticipate the numerous indirect benefits of which it was productive . The numerous historical events and interesting ciscumstances , collateral with the main subject , the attractive form in which the literature and associations of Italy were brought into view , in the course of the work , and the iml ) ortant epoch in the world 's history embraced in the period to which it referred , all tended to enhance its practical worth , and the gratification to be derived from its perusal . The chief difficulty in the way of his design , was the want of adequate materials . Happily , this was removed , by the aid of a friend in Italy , who undertook to forward him the necessary transcripts from original documents , and such works as were not attainable in England , while the sale of two extensive libraries furnished him with yet other resources . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high literary character , as well as that of his numerous personal friends enlisted in the enterprize , he commenced and assiduously prosecuted it at intervals of leisure . Upon the publication of the work , in 1796 , its success , in every respect , was complete . For the full evidence of this , we must again refer to the correspondence of the author , introduced so largely into the history of his life . Seldom do labors of this nature meet with such a degree of contemporary appreciation , or elicit more sincere and universal testimony to their worth . If ever an author had reason to feel satisfied with the result of his efforts , as regards their immediate reception by the literary public , that one was Roscoe . If he did not altogether escape the critical acumen of the times , he lived to improve by its just strictures , and to lose the memory of its unjust severity , in the various and noble tributes of praise and gratitude which were poured in upon him . He lived to see his own portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to amend and pass it through the press to a perfect edition , and to behold it , like a radiant message , bearing his name through many lands , and awakening attention to those sources of intellectual pleasure , of which he had drank so deeply , and whose renovating waters he would fain see a common well-spring on the dusty highway of life . From the individual encomiums passed upon Mr. Roscoe , on this occasion , it is difficult to select one , all being , either // from their origin or character , peculiarly pleasing . We can not but notice , however , the allusion to the subject by the author of the Pursuits of Literature , as being from a political opponent , and , consequently , induced solely by a sense of the intrinsic excellence of the work . " But hark ! what solemn strains from Arno 's vales Breathe rapture , wafted on the Tuscan gales ! Lorenzo rears again his awful head , And feels his ancient glories round him spread ; The Muses , starting from their trance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and live . " From what has now been said , it is evident that the mere business of his profession had for Mr. Roscoe few attractions . He was engaged , too , in company with another gentleman , in a project which , soon after the publication of his work , began to assume a promising aspect ; this was the draining and cultivating an extensive tract of peat-moss in the neighborhood of Manchester . Looking , in a good measure , to this source of income , for support , and with a view of gradually bringing his affairs to a close , and retiring to the more complete enjoyment of his taste , in the course of the year 1796 , he relinquished his profession . How singly and sincerely he regarded professional occupation as a means subordinate to a great end , may be inferred from his reply to a friend who rallied him upon his withdrawing from its responsibilities . There is something peculiarly like a home-thrust in its applicability to ourselves . " Surely man is the most foolish of all animals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his curse ; and to prevent the contingency of evil , he makes life one continual evil . Health , wisdom , peace of mind , conscience , all are sacrificed to the absurd purpose of heaping up for the use of life more than life can employ , under the flimsy pretext of providing for his children , till practice becomes habit , and we labor on till we are obliged to take our departure , as tired of this world as we are unprepared for the rational happiness of the next . " He now resumed his Italian reading and this with the study of Botany , his favorite science , a translation of the Balia , of Luigi Tansillo , his agency in instituting the admirable Athen*um of Liverpool , and the issuing of a new edition of Lorenzo , with other labors of a desultory nature , // occupied his time and attention , until the spring of 1799 . And then it was , in pursuance of that design of retirement so congenial to his nature , and so promising of intellectual fruits , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Liverpool . There he at once renewed his literary labors , in the field where his recent laurels were won . In preparing the history of Leo X. lie but still further developed , under additional advantages , the subject so happily begun in the life of Lorenzo . Scarcely a year had elapsed , when the claims of friendship called him from his elegant retreat into a scene of action more truly business-like , in its nature , than the one whence he had lately retired . The family of that friend whose exertions abroad had so signally aided Mr. Roscoe in obtaining interesting and necessary historical documents , had asked his counsel and personal assistance in re-arranging the affairs of their extensive banking establishment . Circumstances and his sense of duty , in the end , devolved the conduct of this concern chiefly upon himself , and , in a great measure , identified his pecuniary interests with its success . The next social and benevolent enterprise in which he seems to have engaged was the establishment of a botanical garden near town . And his pen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , in testimony of which several interesting instances occur in his letters and communications to Botanical Societies . The influence of Mr. Roscoe in the private circles , and , indeed , through the whole range of society around him , frequently afforded him opportunities of most happily directing the public mind , and rendered his political opinions well known . This was a prominent cause of his activity during the excitement in relation to the movements on the other side of the channel , to which we have briefly alluded , and contributed , at the approach of an important political crisis in his own country , to direct towards him the expectant regards of his townsmen. in 1806 he was returned , by the freemen of Liverpool , as a representative in parliament , and , in accordance with the sense of public duty which characterized his life , he obeyed the call , and carried into the halls of legislation the highmindedness , perseverance and loyalty to principle which had secured him the suffrages of his constituents . Here he enjoyed the high satisfaction of urging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personal influence afforded , the passage of the bill for Catholic Emancipation and the Abolition of the Slave Trade . The plan of a Reform in Parliament , the principles of which he subsequently most ably defended , was a measure , the happy fulfilment of which he lived to witness . During the next two years , though not officially engaged , he was much occupied in political writing , particularly in recommending peace with France . Soon afier his retirement from public life , he appears , from additions and improvements made upon his estate for the better accommodation of his library and collections , as well as from the literary projects he then conceived , to have meditated a yet more complete devotion to intellectual labor . The most important of his plans were a life of Erasmus and several translations from the Italian of high interest . Subsequent circumstances induced him to relinquish these designs . He , however , derived much pleasure , at this time , from collating and arranging several additional illustrations of his biographies , and especially from a visit at Holkham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rare works , belonging to his friend Mr. Coke , who assigned to him the pleasing task of rescuing them from the disorder into which they were plunged , and reproducing their distinctive characters . But that universal principle , vicissitude , was about to bring upon Mr. Roscoe a series of discipline whereby his moral strength was destined to be severely tested . The banking concern with which he was so intimately connected , - owing to the demands of the times and the scarcity of specie , produced by the opening of the American Trade ,  --  was forced to suspend payment . Mr. Roscoe 's honorable feelings obliged him to assume the entire care of the interest of his creditors . By a well-devised plan and temporary compromise , be was confident of being able to discharge all the debts in the space of six years and still sustain the establishment . Many untoward circumstances , - particularly an unfortunate investment of a large part of their funds , rendered the prospect , at the termination of this long and anxious season of uncongenial toil , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , he determined upon a sacrifice that can be duly estimated only by him who understands that fellow-feeling for the master minds of our race and the forms in which they have become familiar , // which springs up and grows strong in the bosom where it is habitually cherished ; - by him who knows , in its full measure , the happiness of collecting about him the gems of literature and art , connecting them with associations of feeling and circumstance , gazing upon them as upon the faces of friends , and into them as into the oracles of truth ; - hy him , in a word , the idea of whose usefulness , honor and daily enjoyment is associated indissolubly , in his own mind , with books , and products of art , - not in their general aspect , - but as they have been gathered by the slow accumulation of careful expenditure , and become endeared by years of blessed and ministering companionship , in his own cheerful study . Who will deny to Mr. Roscoe , in the sacrifice of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religious principle worthy of human nature ? The general character of that library may be inferred from his pursuits ; and its value from the catalogue prepared , with minute exactness , by his own hand , indicating its numerous varieties and treasures . It is worthy of remark that no volume or print was reserved , but such as were the sacred tokens of friendship ; and although a few of his friends bought , at the sale , what they conceived he chiefly wished to retain , he would derive from this considerate act , no other advantage than the liberty of re-purchasing , and when this was actually done , his conscientiousness led him to dispose of them to Mr. Rathbone , by whom they were presented to the Athen*um , where they still occupy a separate position . We can not forbear quoting the Sonnet suggested by this event . Fan*iiliar as it may have become , it is and will ever be a beautiful evidence of the not undignified regret of the literary enthusiast relieved by the manly cheerfulness of the intellectual christian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his loss , yet hopes again erewhile To share their converse and enjoy their smile , And temper as he may affliction 's dart , - Thus , loved associates ! chiefs of elder art ! Teachers of wisdom ! who could once beguile My tedious hours , and lighten every toil , I now resign you ; nor with fainting heart , - For pass a few short hours , or days or hours , And happier seasons may their dawn unfold , And all your sacred fellowship restore ; // When freed from earth , unlimited its powers , Mind shall with mind direct communion hold , And kindred spirits meet to part no more . " When , therefore , the dreaded bankruptcy did occur , the only consolation of which such a case admits , was happily ever present to alleviate the sufferings of his delicate mind , - a deep sense of conscientious integrity . Perhaps the most general principle involved in the leading interests of the age , is the principle of integrity . It is this which lends an aspect of high moral dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are engaged . In England and this country , commercial enterprize being the predominant ob .. ject of pursuit , uncompromising integrity is the virtue , for the exercise of which there is especial and often grand occasion . And while public opinion has been on the advance respecting the legal course proper to be pursued in relation to bankruptcy , the want of a high moral tone in regard to this subject is lamentably obvious . Were it not so , failures , which have bereft hundreds of half their just dues , and left the author of their suffering independent , would not be regarded , as they now are , with any degree of complacency ; nor would an individual of this sadly numerous species , be allowed daily to parade himself or the tokens of his pecuniary superiority before the eyes of his abused and remediless creditor . In view of such considerations , enforced as they must be by the experience and reflection of every individual , it is morally refreshing to mark and appreciate the simple integrity of William Roscoe . And now the cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his days had gone before to her rest , and his feet were treading the declivity of life . He had put the finishing touch to an edition of Pope 's works , and the Holkham catalogue was completed ; what remained , then , for one who had so well sustained the burden and heat of the day , but that he should dedicate its close to recreative employment and repose ? With his diminished resources , increased by the grateful contributions of friendship , he accordingly released himself from all bustling or laborious employments , and passed into retirement . Here he prepared for the press a final edition of Lorenzo , and a work of long standing upon Monandrian plants , - efforts which equal the most vigorous of an earlier period . And although with these his literary labors may be said to have // closed , his intellectual and moral activity was beautifully exerted until another world became the scene of its ceaseless exercise . The lovely flowers with which he had bestrown the pathway of his being , were bright and fragrant to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as has been significantly said in another connexion , - that they smiled up to him as children to the face of a father . The perception of physical beauty , the intelligent love of nature , the philanthropic spirit , the literary taste , which were the day-stars of his youth , continued their ministry in age ; and the holier presence of domestic sympathies , of well-founded friendships , of blessed remembrances , was blending its cheerful influence with the deeper and more inspiring spirit of religion . How applicable to a life so happily passed , and so peacefully closed , are the wellremembered lines of our favorite poet ! " That life was happy : every day he gave Thanks for the fair existence that was his ; For a sick fancy made him not her slave , To mock him with her phantom miseries . No chronic tortures rack 'd his aged limb , For luxury and sloth had nourish 'd none for him . " And I am glad that he has liv 'd thus long ; And glad that he has gone to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Softly to disengage the vital chord ; When his weak hand grew palsied , and his eye Dark with the mists of age , it was his time to die . " We have spoken of the character of William Roscoe as a morally valuable example , and we have seen how little it is indebted to extraordinary occasions for its manifestation ; it is as interesting to observe that it owes as little to any singular endowment or unnatural endeavor for its intrinsic worth . To the legitimate culture and exercise of the natural emotions and best impulses of the soul , we can not but ascribe all that is good or beautiful in its aspect . That process of induration , so proverbially general , never bronzed the sensibilities of Roscoe ; the dew of nature was not suffered wholly to evaporate in the heated atmosphere of worldly strife , nor to congeal in the frigid air of an artificial existence . That quality , so deep and morally auspicious , - susceptibility , - the sharpness of the mental appetites , the yearning of vigorous energies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coals upon the // soul 's altar , which a little musing sufficeth to kindle , - susceptibility , this he ever possessed , or rather never lost , or the richly freighted influences of improvement would have passed by him as the idle wind . We confess ourselves disposed to attribute no inconsiderable importance to this view of our subject . If improving agencies are dispensed as liberally through the intellectual and moral universe , as the elements of physical nature , and are designed to minister to something beyond themselves , to develop mind , they constitute the common birthright of humanity . Like the air and light , they freely and equally occupy space , ranging the wide expanse on the broad wings of universal love , and restrained in their holy mission by nought but human perversity . And is not the essential condition by which alone their rich benefits can be experienced , susceptibility ? The piercing beams of the sun bear no images of beauty to the closed eye , and the evening breeze wafts no refreshment to the brow unbared to its breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes fail to awaken the spirit steeled by indifference , or shrouded in sin ? In the life and character of Roscoe , we see nurtured , with a beautiful and holy care , - those first affections , Those shadowy recollections , Which , be they what they may , Are yet the fountain light of all our day , Are yet a master light of all our seeing ; Uphold us , - cherish , - and have power to make Our noisy years seem moments in the being Of the eternal Silence ; truths that wake To perish never ; Which neither listlessness nor mad endeavor , Nor man nor boy , Nor all that is at enmity with joy , Can utterly abolish or destroy . " * The most remarkable peculiarity in the character of Roscoe , is its rare combination of active with quiet virtues , - of reflective with practical excellence , - of refined sentiment and thought , with perfect simplicity of manner and *The noble ode of Wordsworth , from which these lines were taken , was recited by the late S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much surprise that it was the work of a living English poet , declaring he should have attributed it to the age of Elizabeth . // effort . Its distinguishing good , as an example , is the lesson of just self-development which it so pleasingly unfolds . Throughout that long life of more than eighty years , in its early struggles , amid its honorable fame , and during the various periods of literary , political , or professional activity , by which that character was tried and formed , we behold the native supremacy of the moral nature uninvaded . And it is impossible not to recognize in this the true secret of Roscoe 's success , - the source of those intellectual and moral results which have hallowed his memory , - the means and the method by the aid of which , in comparatively ordinary circumstances and with comparatively common capacities , he identified himself with all the leading benevolent enterprises of the day , rendered valuable contributions to the literature of his native country , and drew , in broad relief , even from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathless lineaments of an harmoniously beautiful character . And , he it remembered , that this active and equable spirit , - this happy balance of the several faculties and sentiments , - was ever calmly and prevailingly operative . We feel that the stripling , who mourned over the dying agonies of the bird his own hand had destroyed on the banks of the Mersey , and the aged man who years afterwards stood beside a bed of lilies in his little garden , and compared their frailty with his own , is one and the same being . In opposition to a very popular prejudice , he succeeded in uniting literature and business and general philanthropy with domestic duty , without detriment to either . He was an amateur and a literary man ; but benevolent sentiment was intimately associated with the enjoyments of both . While carrying on a correspondence which connected him with the master spirits of the age , he could yet be sedulously attentive to the interests of an unfriended artist ; sympathizing in the magnanimous character of a cultivated Florentine nobleman , and deeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was his fidelity to nature , and how bountifully did she reward that allegiance ! It was in her invigorating embrace that his young spirit waxed strong , and , freed from the baneful excitements of modern education , it knew no precocious development , no premature decay . The cares of business could not supersede an habitual communion with her influences , nor studious zeal allure him from obedience to her laws . He possessed a delightful inheritance in the // kingdom of letters , and ever and anon retired thither ; but the field of effort assigned him by the Creator , was the world ; he mingled in its strife , and shed abroad the blessedness of an improving activity . Yet beneath the agitated or listless tide of his common existence , swelled and deepened an under current of meditative being . He imbibed tbe nutritive elements of spiritual life , as they came forth with the solemnity and effulgence of the starry host , from the deep teachings of experience , - burst in gladness , as tributary streams , from the converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mists of the ocean , from the wide domain of nature , - sitting meekly , the while , at the feet of Jesus of Nazareth . Such is , indeed , one of those beings whom no nation can appropriate ; universality characterized his philanthropy , and now that the " natural canonization " of death has hallowed his example , it is , and should be regarded as a common blessing . His countrymen have felt most nearly its holy influence , and among them will forever be the local memorials of his glory . Italy , though her classic ground was never pressed by his pilgrim feet , recognizes in his works the beautiful evidences of a deep and philosophical interest in her literature , admiration for her great men , and sympathy in her woes . And to us there is a new scene of meditative enjoyment in our father land . Before we reach the sacred precincts of Westminster , or stroll along the green banks of the Avon , we shall linger with respectful and moving interest beside the monument to the memory of William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
