txt /q/uch transactions ; and yet it can not be doubted that the effect of the scene , which is before him , is lessened by its own dimensions , , is diminished by its very vastness- The man , , who is thinking of the sufferings of forty or fifty thousands , can have no very distinct conceptions o ( the sufferings of a particular individual in that vast number . If he could take a full and distinct view of the sufferings of each one in that great multitude ; if he could see the tears and the /z/ agonies in each particular case ; and by some process of intellectual and sentient arithmetic could bring them all into one sum , and place them all before the mind at once , what a vast amount ! what unparallelled wretchedness ! with what torture would it fill the soul ! But this can not be ; the structure of the human mind is such as not to admit of it . And it is for this reason , that we will turn away a moment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mere general features , for the purpose of seeing it in its parts , its fragments , its particular instimces . There was a certain Captain Cooke in the British army at the battle of New Orleans , who has recently given to the public some interesting incidents , which took place under his own eye in that memorable engagement . And it is tncufent , the facts in which individuals are concerned , the insulated details of a battle , and not the whole , assimilated and contemplated in one broad mass , which is to give us the precisely true conception of the miseries , which are endured on such occasions . On the morning of the eighth of January the officer above referred to saw three companies of soldiers , about two hundred and forty in number , advancing on the high road to New Orleans , for the purpose of attacking what was called the crescent battery . Among other persons he  --  aw lieutenant Duncan Campbell , with whom he seems io have been particularly acquainted , and asked him where he was going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then ,  --  aid Captain Cooke , " you have got into what I call aood thing ; the far famed American battery is in front at a  --  hort range ; and on the left this  --  pet is flanked at eight himdred yards by their batteries on the opposite side of the river . " At this piece of informalion the lieutenant laughed heartily . Captain Cooke advised him to take off his blue pelisse coat , in order /q/ to be like the rest of the men ; but he promptly refused , uttering at the same time some expressions of defiance against the Americans ; and having embraced the captain , went onward . He was a young officer of twenty years of age , of a fine personal appearance , and had fought in many bloody encounters in France and Spain . But what was the fate , which war had reserved for one so young , so interesting in appearance , and towards whom undoubtedly the affections of many friends in a distant land were fondly directed ! Near the close of the battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen to our left running about in circles , first staggering one way , then another , and at length he fell on the sod helplessly upon his face , and again tumbled , and when he was picked up , he was found to be blind from the effects of grape shot , that had torn open his forehead , given him a slight wound in the leg , and had also ripped the scabbard from his side , and knocked the cap from his head . While being borne insensible to the rear , he still clenched the hilt of his sword with a convulsive grasp , the blade thereof being broken off close at the hilt with grape shot , and in a state of delirium and suflfering he lived for a few days . " Here is an incident which may be called a common one ; he died much as any other soldier on the field of battle may be supposed to die ; but this is the cause of the difference in our feelings ; we single him out from the rest of the multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his suffering in the vague and indefinite idea of suffering in the mass ; and while we are too often unmoved , in consequence of our inability to combine a particular and a general view , by the general statement of thousands having suffered , we at once exclaim , when our eye is fixed on a single case Kke the one before us , what a shocking death is this ! What barbarity there is in war ! What insanity in men , /z/ that they should butcher and tear to pieces one another ! " For five hours , ( continues the narrative of this officer , ) the enemy plied us with grape and round shot ; some of the wounded , lying in the mud or on the wet grass , managed to crawl away , but every now and then some unfortunate man was lifted off the ground by round shot , and lay killed or mangled . During the tedious hours we remained in front , it was necessary to lie on the ground to cover ourselves from the projectiles . An officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through both his knees ; at first he sunk back faintly ; but at length opening his eyes and looking at his wounds , he said , Carry me away , I am ehiUed to death ; and as he was hoisted on men 's shoulders , more round and grape shot passed his head . Taking off his cap , he waved it ; and after many narrow escapes got out of range , suffered amputation of both legs , but died of his wounds on board ship , after enduring all the pain of the surgical operation , and passing down the lake in an open boat . " There was an individual present at the naval battle of Trafalgar , who relates some things that came under his personal notice . From the account abridged and prepared for the second volume of the Harbinger of Peace , we make the following extract .  --  " Now that the conflict was over , our kindred feelings resumed their sway . Eager mquuies were expressed , and earnest congratulations exchanged at this moment . The officers came to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast a gloom over the scene of our triumph . I have alluded to the impressions of our first Lieutenant , that he should not survive the contest . This gallant officer was severely wounded in the thigh , and under went amputation ; but his prediction was realized ; for he expired before the action had ceased . The jtmior /q/ lieutenant was also mortally wounded on the quarter* deck . These gallant fellows were lying beside each other in the gun room preparatory to their being committed to the deep ; and here many met to take a last look of our departed friends , whose remains soon floated in the promiscuous multitude , without distinction either of rank or nation . In the act of laundiing a poor sailor over the poop he was discovered to breathe ; and after being a week in the hospital , the ball which entered the temple came out of his mouth . I notice this occurrence to show the probability , that many are thrown overboard when life is not extinct . The upper deck presented a confused and dreadful appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragments of wreck were scattered in every direction : nothing could be more hcnrible than the scene of blood and mangled remains with which every part was covered , and which , from the quantity of splinters , resembled a shipwright 's yard strewed with gore . From our extensive loss , thirty-four killed and ninety* six wounded , our cock-pit exhibited a scene of suffering and carnage which rarely occurs . I visited this abode of suffering with the natural impulse which led many others thither , namely , to ascertain the fate of a friend or companion . So many bodies in such a confined place , and under such distressing circumstances , would affect the most obdurate heart : my nerves were but little accustomed to such trials , but even the dangers of the battle did not seem more terrific than the spectacle before me . On a long table lay several anxiously looking for their turn to receive the surgeon 's care , yet dreading the fate which he might pronounce . One subject was undergoing amputation , and every part was heaped with sufferers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault of misery ; and even at this distant period the heart-sickening picture is alive in my memory . ' * /z/ SUFFEaiNGS OF THE History , as it is generally written , is nothing but an outline , a skeleton , a mere anatomy ; and it gives us scarcely a more perfect idea of the events it undertakes to describe , than the human skeleton does of the symmetry and beauty of the human form . If we wish to go beneath the siu-face , if we wish to know things as they are , we must look into what are sometimes called the documents of history ; private letters , biographical notices , personal memoirs , and incidents , which aspire to no higher honor , than that of being chronicled in a newspa per . A person may read Voltaire 's history of Lewis XIV. , and yet have but a very feeble conception of the miseries of war ; but not so , when he reads the memoirs of Madame De la Rochejaquelein . The one deals in outlines ; it leaves merely a general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a single event , gives its minute facts , and we see it distinctly and graphically just as it was ; and what is more , we feel it . We could give passages from this little book , but if we made a beginning , we should not know where to end ; and we merely mark it down as a document to be referred to in all times to come , in proof of the inexpressible miseries , which men are bringing upon themselves by resorting to arms . Of the books with which we are acquainted , one of the best calculated to give an impression of the immediate evils of war distinct and vivid , an impression corresponding in some degree to the reality , is Labaume 's Narrative of the campaign in Russia . There were two hundred and sixty thousand soldiers present at the battle of Borodino , nearly all of whom were engaged in it ; In the two armies there were two himdred pieces of cannon , and according to some accounts a much greater number , constantly employed ; and forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode over the /q/ bodies of the lifeless and the wounded , and dyed the hoofs of their horses in human blood . The battle commenoed on the 7th of September , at 6 o'clock in the morning , and continued till night . The loss in both armies has been estimated at eighty thousand . Labaume gives an account of what fell under his notice the day after the battle . " In traversing the elevated plain on which we had fought , we were enabled to form an estimate of the immense loss that had been sustained by the Russians . A surface of about nine square miles in extent , was covered with the killed and wounded ; with the wreck of arms , lances , helmets , and cuirasses , and with balls as numerous as hail-stones after a violent storm . In many places the bursting of shdls had overturned men and horses ; and such was the havoc occasioned by repeated discharges , that mountains of dead bodies were raised . But the most dreadful spectacle was the interior of the ravines , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these unfortunate wretches , lying one upon another , destitute of assistance , and weltering in their blood , uttered the most horrid groans . Loudly invoking death , they besought us to put an end to their excruciating torments . As our medical means of relief were insufficient , our fruitless compassion could only lament the calamities insarable from a war so atrocious . " On his return with the retreating army from Moscow , this writer gives us another impse of the same field of battie . My consternation was at its height cm finding , near Borodino the 20,000 men who had been slaughtered there , lying where they fell . The half-buried carcasses of iften and horses covered the plain , intermingled with garments stained with blood , and bones gnawed by the dogs and birds of prey , and with the fragments of arms , drums , helmets , and cuirasses " // " As we were marching over the field of battle , vre heard at a distance a pitiable object , who demanded our assistance . Touched by his plaintive cries , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their great astonishment , they observed a French soldier stretched on the ground , with both his legs broken : * I was wounded , ' said he , on the day of the great battle , and finding myself in a lonely place , where I could gain no assistance , I dragged myself to the brink of a rivulet , and have lived near two months on grass and roots , and on some pieces of bread which I found amongst the dead bodies . At night I have lain in the carcasses of dead horses , and with the flesh of these animals have dressed my wounds , as well as with the best medicines . Having observed you at a distance , I collected all my strength , and have advanced sufficiently near to make myself heard . ' Whilst we expressed our surprise at the event , a Generic , who was made acquainted with a case , as singular as it was afiecting , ordered him to be placed in his own carriage . " * It is from such circumstantial details as we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miseries actually endured by the French in their retreat from Moscow .  --  " Overwhelmed , " says this writer in another place , " by the whirlwinds of snow which assailed him , the soldier could no longer distinguish the main road from the ditches , and often fell into the latter , which served him for a tomb . Others , eager to press forward , dragged themselves along with pain ; badly clothed and shod , having nothing to eat or drink , groaning and shiv- * It appears from Count Segur 's History of the Expedition into Russia , ' Chap . XIII , that the dead of the Russians had either been buried or carried off . The same writer estimates the number of Frenchmen who were found unburied on the field of Borodino , at thirty thousand . /q/ ering with cold , they gave no assigtance , neither shewed any signs of compassion to those who , sinking from weakness , expired around them . " " Many of these miserable creatures , dying from exhaustion , struggled hard in the agonies of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adieu to their brethren and companions in arms ; others with their last sigh pronounced the name of their mother , and of the country which gave them birth . The rigour of the cold benumbed their stiffened limbs , and soon reached their vitals . Stretched on the road , we could only see the heaps of snow that covered them , and that formed undulations in our route like those in a grave-yard . Flocks of ravens , abandoning the plains to take shelter in the neighbormg woods , croaked ominously as they flew over oiur heads ; and troops of dogs , which had followed us from Moscow , and lived solely on our bloody remains , howled around us , as if desirous of hastening the moment when we were to become their prey . " At the retreat of the French from Liadoui in Lithuania , the town , as seems to have been the common practice in this savage war , was set on fire . " Amongst the burning houses were three large bams filled with poor soldiers , chiefly wounded . They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one in front , which was on fire ; the most active saved themselves by leaping out of the windows , but all those who were sick or crippled , not having strength to move , saw the flames advancing rapidly to devour them . Touched by their shrieks , some , who were least hardened , endeavored in vain to save them : we could only see them half buried under the burning rafters . Through whirlwinds rf smoke , they entreated their comrades to shorten their sufferings by depriving them of life , and from motives of humanity , we thought it our duty to comply with their /z/ wishes . As there were some who , notwithstanding , still survived , we heard them with feeble voices crying , Fire on us ! fire on us ! atthe head ! at the head ! donotwiisP These heart-rending cries did not cease till the whole were consumed . " Before the French had completed the passage of the river Berezina , the Russians made a furious attack upon their rear-guard . Un the heat of the engagement many balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been pressing round the bridge , and even some shells burst in the midst of them . Terror and despair then took possession of every heart anxious for self-preservation ; women and children , who had escaped so many disasters , seemed to have been preserved to experience a death still more deplorable . Leaving their Carriages , they ran to embrace the knees of the first person they met , and implored him with tears to take them to the other side . The sick and wounded , seated on the trunk of a tree , or supported on crutches , looked eagerly for some friend that could assist them ; but their cries were lost in the air , every one thought only of his own safety . " " On seeing the enemy , those who had not crossed , mingling with the Poles , rushed towards the bridge ; artillery , baggage , cavalry , and infantry , all endeavored to pass first . The strong threw into the water the weak , who impeded their advance , and trampled under foot the sidi and wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushed under the wheels of the artillery : others , who had hoped to save themselves by swimming , were frozen in the river , or perished by slipping from the ice . Thousands and thousands of hoeless victims , notwithstanding these sorrowful examples , threw themselves into the Berezina , where they neariy all perished in convulsions of grief and despair . /q/ " The division of Girard succeeded by force of amis in overcoming all the obstacles that retarded their march , and , scaling the mountain of dead bodies that obstructed the road , gained the opposite shore , where the Russians would soon have followed them if they had not immediately set fire to the bridge . Many of those , who were left on the other bank with the prospect of the most horrible death , attempted to cross the bridge through the flames , but midway they threw themselves into the Tiver to avoid being burnt . At length , the Russians having made themeslves masters of the field of battle , our troops retired ; the passage of the river ceased , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let those , who have been accustomed to merge the sufferings of individuals in those vague and indefinite views , which we take of sufiering when contemplated in the mass , notice the following passage .  --  The road was covered with soldiers , who no longer retained the human form , and whom the enemy disdained to take prisoners . Every day furnished scenes too painful to relate . Some had lost their hearing , others their speech , and many , by excessive cold and hunger , were reduced to such a state of stupid phrenzy , that they roasted the dead bodies for food , and even gnawed their own hands and arms . Some , who were too weak to Uft a piece of wood , or to roll a stone towards the fire , sat down upon their dead companions , and with an unmoved countenance , gazed upon the burning logs . When they were consumed , these livid spectres , unable to get up , fell by those on whom they had been seated . Many , in a state of mental alienation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet into the fire ; some , with a convulsive laugh , threw themselves into the flames , and uttering shocking cries , perished in the most horrible /z/ contortions ; others , in a state of equal madness , followed their example , and shared the same fate ! " But some will say perhaps , that these battles and this retreat were extraordinary , out of the common course , something unheard of before ; and that they give an exaggerated and erroneous idea of the miseries attendant upon war . But so far as we are able to learn , this suggestion does not appear to be sustained by the facts of history . From the earliest periods of the human race there have been wars and series of wars , continued for years and almost for generations , that have been marked from beginning to end with inexpressible sufferings and with the most dreadful atrocities ; such as the second Punic war , the war which terminated in the destruction of Jerusalem , the recent war of the Greek Revolution , the wars civil and foreign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , some of the wars between Russia and Turkey and Russia and Poland , the early Revolutionary wars of the Dutch Republic , the wars of the invasion of Spain by Bonaparte , the so called Thirty Year 's War , which involved almost all Europe and was signalized by the death of Gustavus Adolphus . In the dreadful war last mentioned , the city of Magdeburg in Prussia was taken by assault by the imperial commander , Count de Tilly . And here are some of the results . " Before noon , all the works were carried , and the town was in the hands of the enemy . Two gates were now opened by the besiegers for the entrance of the army , and Tilly marched part of his infantry into the town . He immediately occupied the principal streets , and , with pointed cannon , drove the citizens into their dwellings , there to await their destiny . They were not long held in suspense ; a word from Tilly decided the fate of Magdebiu'g . " Even a more humane general would have vainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once made the attempt . The silence of their general left the soldiery masters of the lives of the citizens , and they broke , without restraint , into the houses to gratify every brutal appetite . The prayers of innocence excited some compassion in the hearts of the Germans , but none in the rude breasts of Pappenheim 's Walloons . Scarcely had the massacre commenced , when the other gates were thrown open , and the cavalry , with the fearful hordes of the Croats , poured in upon the devoted town . " And now began a scene of carnage , which history has no language , poetry no pencil to pourtray . Neither the innocence of childhood , nor the helplessness of old age ; neither youth , sex , rsmk , nor beauty , could disarm the fury of the conquerors . Wives were dishonored in the arms of their husbands , daughters at the feet of their parents ; and the defenceless sex exposed to the double sacrifice of virtue and life . No condition , however obscure , or however sacred , could afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women were found beheaded in a single church . The Croats amused , themselves with throwing children into the flames ; Pappenheim 's Walloons with stabbing infants at their mothers ' breast . Some officers of the League , horror struck at this dreadful scene , ventured to remind Tilly that he had it in his power to stop the carnage . ' Return in an hour , ' was his answer , ' and I shall see what is to be done ; the soldier must have some recompense for his danger and toils . ' These horrors lasted without abatement , till at last the smoke and flames stopped the course of the plunderers . To increase the confusion , and break the resistance of the inhabitants , the Imperialists had , in the commencement of the assault , fired the town in several places . A tempest now arose , which spread the flames with frightful rapidity through /z/ the town , till the blaze became universal . The confusion was deepened by the clouds of smoke , the heaps of dead bodies that strewed the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the streams of blood which rwi along the streets . The atmosphere glowed ; and the intolerable heat at last compelled even the murderers to take refuge in their camp . In less than twelve hours , this strong , populous , and flourishing city , one of the finest in Germany , was a heap of ashes , with the exception of two churches and a few houses . The Administrator , Christian William , after receiving several wounds , was taken prisoner , with three of the Burgomasters ; most of the officers and magistrates had already met an enviable death . The avarice of the officers had saved four hundred of the richest citizens from death , in the hope of extorting from them an exorbitant ransom . This piece of humanity was owing principally to the officers of the League ; and even this questionable clemency , when contrasted with the blind and ruthless butchery of the Austrians , made them be regarded as jfuardian angels by the citizens . " Scarcely had the flames abated , when the Imperial soldiers returned to satiate anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town . Many were suffocated by the smoke ; many found rich booty in the cellars , where the citizens had concealed their valuable effects . On the ISth of May , Tilly hunself appeared in the town , after the streets had been cleared of ashes and corpses . Horrible and revolting to humanity was the scene that presented itself . The living crawling from under the dead , children wandering about with heart-rending cries , seeking their parents ; and infants still sucking the dead bodies of their mothers . More than five thousand bodies were thrown into the Elbe , to dear the streets ; - much greater number had been /z/ consumed by the flames .  --  The entire amount of the slaughter was calculated at thirty thousand . " * It has been our object , in the extracts which have been made , not only to give a general idea of the miseries of war , but in particular to free the mind from that illusion , to which it is so liable to , be subject , when it contemplates things in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little interested , to look into their elements . Well does the author of Recollections of the Peninsula say , " when the history of any individual , who has fallen , is brought before us , we feel deeply , but wander over ground , covered with corpses about whom we know nothing , with comparative indifference ; yet if we knew the history attaolied to each lifeless body , on which we gazed , with what tales of sorrow should we not become acquainted ! " In this very writer , who was himself an officer in the English army of the Peninsula , and who seems to have been sufficiently partial to a soldier 's life , we have a number of affecting instances fully illustrative of this just remark . What recompense had the pomp and splendour of military life to that wretched captain of , the 29th regiment , who , dreadfully lacerated by a ball , lay directly in the path of his comrades , and with a heart-rending accent of grief , cried for water , or that they would kill him ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glitter of an epaulette and the sound of the spirit-stirring fife for that mangled and lifeless youth , not yet eighteen years of age , the darling child of a fond mother , who mourned in brokenness of heart on the banks of the murmuring and peaceful Loire ! What balm was it in the power of earth to furnish to that miserable man , who , coming upon the field of Victoria and inquiring for his two sons , the only remains of his beloved family , found them both dead ! Who can /z/ In exhibiting the evils of war , more attention has generally been paid to the immediate horrors of the battle field , than to the less marked and more remote evils , which have been felt from this source in domestic life . So many attractions , addressed both to the sight and the imagination , throng aromid the memorable spot , where large armies meet and engage in battle , that , notwithstanding the inexpressible horrors of such a scene , men seldom turn away to contemplate the insulated objects of interest , scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelt with excited imaginatiouB , and with a sincere feeling of deep commiseration , on the carnage of Austerlitz and Waterloo , to whom it has never occurred to turn to the distracted sister , mourning in her distant home over her fallen brother ; or to the mother weeping in solitude over her beloved son ; or to the wife , lamenting with inexpressible grief , the untimely death of her husband ! We propose , therefore , in the remarks which we are to follow in this chapter to indicate some of the unpropitious bearings of War on domestic life . And in doing this it is hardly necessary to remark , that in domestic life we are to look for a large share of what yet remains of earthly quiet and happiness .  --  The philanthropist and the Christian find much in the present /q/ State of things to perplex their faith , to create doubt , and to fill them with despondency ; but when they turn their eyes to the domestic circle , especially when it is blessed with the presence of the serious and benign spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one bright and illuminated spot in the surrounding darkness . But the horrors of war , dreadful and intense as they are on the field of battle , are experienced , with less display indeed but with still greater intensity , in these distant abodes of peace and happiness . The soldier dies upon the field of battle ; and however great may be the anguish he experiences , it is generally soon over ; but the desolate hearts of his parents , and of his wife and children , are filled with sorrow and hopelessness and lamentation for years . But these things are not made matters of history ; in the emblazonment of the achievements of the battle field they are entirely passed over and forgotten ; it seems to be no part of the business either of the ephemeral gazette , or of the more serious and permanent page of history , to keep a record of tears shed in private and of hearts that are bleeding and broken in retirement . But they ought never to be forgotten by the philanthropist , the Christian , the friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils , which are now referred to , are not imaginary , every child and parent , every one , who sustains the various domestic relations , has the testimony in himself , in the instinctive suggestions of his own bosom , whether he has actually experienced the evils in his own person or not . In the time of the American Revolution , a young gentleman by the name of Asgill , a captain in the English service , though only nineteen years of age , was selected by lot , by the Americans to whom he had fallen prisoner , to be put to death in retaliation for some atrocities committed by the enemy . When the news reachr /z/ ed England , his mother . Lady Asgill , with her whole family , was thrown into the deepest distress and sorrow . In her inexpressible aifliction she had recourse to the sovereigns of France , through the medium of the minister Count de Vergennes , although France was at that time at war with England .

Surrounded as r am with objects of distress , bowed down by fear and grief , words are wanting to express what I feel , and to paint such a scene of misery ; my husband , given over by the physicians some hours before the arrival of the news , not in a condition to be informed of it ; my daughter attacked by a fever , accompanied with delirium ; speaking of her brother in tones of wildness , and without an interval of reason , imless it be to listen to some circmnstances to console her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my profound , my inexpressible misery , and plead in my favor ; a word , a word from you , like a voice from heaven , would liberate us from desolation , from the last degree of misfortune .

The marquis of Vaydes was a distinguished Spanish nobleman , who had resided twentythree years in America ; having been nine years governor of Chili , and fourteen years viceroy of Peru . Having accumulated an ample fortune , he was now returning to enjoy his riches and honors in his native land ; animated doubtless with all those fond anticipations of happiness , which are so apt to inspire one who has been many years absent from the home of his ancestors and of his childhood . He had in the vessel with him , his wife , and seven children ; the eldest , a daughter , contracted to the son of the duke of Medina Celi , and the youngest not more than a year old . It is not easy to conceive what delightful and transporting emotions swelled the bosoms of this prosperous and happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved Spain , where all their hopes were centered and all their blissful visions were soon to be realized . But they were sadly disappointed ; an unhappy and unnecessary war was then in progress between Spain and England ; and the vessel of the marquis was attacked and taken . During the battle , which was severe , and in which this vessel alone /z/ lost an hundred and ten men , she took fire . The wife and eldest daughter of Vaydes fell into a swoon , and , together with one of the sons , perished in the flames . The unhappy father had an opportunity to escape ; but overcome with feelings of despair at the horrid fate of his beloved wife and children , he voluntarily plunged into the flames and died with them. *  --  We leave this affecting incident , ( only one among a thousand others of a scarcely less marked and distressing nature , to be found in the annals of war , ) to the reflections of the serious and benevolent reader . Is it possible for any one to reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents and children who died in this unexpected and horrid manner , or in relation to the poor orphan children who survived , without feelings of the deepest compassion ? Can the father and mother , as they behold around them their smiling oflspring , dear to them as their own life , think of this dreadful scene without profound and overwhelming sensations of grief and horror ? We take the liberty to introduce another affecting incident , tending to illustrate our subject . Among the distinguished men who fell victims in the war of the American Revolution , was Colonel Isaac Hayne , erf South Carolina ; a man , who , by his amiability of character and high sentiments of honor and uprightness , had secured the good will and affection of all who knew him .

A great number of persons , both Englishmen and Americans , Interceded for his life ; the ladies of Charleston signed a petition in his behalf ; his motherless children were presented on their bended knees as humble suitors for their beloved father ; but all in vain . During the imprisonment of the father , his eldest son was permitted to stay with him in the prison . Beholding his only surviving parent , for whom he felt the deepest affection , loaded with irons and condemned to die , he was overwhelmed with consternation and sorrow .

To-day I die . And you , my son , though but young , must shortly follow us . ' Yes , my father , ' replied the broken hearted youth , * I shall shortly follow you , for indeed I feel that I can not live long . ' And his melancholy anticipation was fulfilled in a manner more dreadful than is implied in the mere extinction of life . On seeing his father in the hands of the executioner , and then struggling in the halter , he stood like one transfixed and motionless with horror .

Under the system of Conscription , which has so long prevailed in France , two brothers of this family were required to leave their home , and enter the army . They had joined the army but a short time , when they were called into action . In the heat of the engagement , one of these young men was killed by a musket ball , as he stood by the side of his brother . * ' The survivor , petrified with horror , was struck motionless at the sight .

My sympathetic feelings , ( says M. Pinel , who at that time had charge of the Bicetre Hospital and has given the account , ) have been frequently arrested by the sad wreck of humanity , presented in the appearance of these degraded beings ; but it was a scene truly heart-rending to see the wretched father come to weep over these miserable remains of his once enviable family . " Such instances as have now been given , show us how exceedingly those are mistaken , who imagine that the horrors of war are chiefly limited to the person of the soldier , and the boundaries of the battle-field . Happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might indeed consider ourselves as having great occasion to rejoice , if it could be satisfactorily shown that none but the poor soldiers with their mangled limbs and dying agonies are doomed to sufler in consequence of wars . But the soldier , vicious and degraded as he too often is , has yet his friends and relatives , who have watched over him and perhaps prayed over him , with the deepest affection and solicitude ; some father , grey-headed and bowed down with years , some mother , in whose withered and decrepid form the passion of maternal love still glows with its inherent intensity : some sister , who , amid the distressing perplexities ' and contumelies of life , consoles herself with the recollection , that there is one , who , although less worthy than he ought to be , she can still call a brother .

Many are the individuals , doomed to fall on the fields of battle , over whose accomplishments and virtues , rival nations , that could agree in nothing else , have united in shedding the tear of heart-felt sorrow . But what can be their grief , who have beheld the lustre of those accomplishments and virtues only in the dim distance , compared with the sorrow of those near friends and relatives , in whose arms they first budded into life , and on whose bosoms they have shone from infancy !  --  Writers have from time to time given us the statistics of armies ; it would perhaps be no difficult task for them to furnish the statistics of battle-fields , prison-ships , and military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without whom not even a sparrow falls , to give the statistics of the sighs and tears , the groans and the broken hearts of wretched parents , of mourning brothers and sisters , of desolate widows and orphans ! We close this article by giving an extract from Grahame 's British Georgics . Poets have often done injury by clothing the pomp and the heroic achievements of war in the enchantments of verse , and thereby encouraging a military spirit ; happy will it be , when their lyre , so fall of delight , and so potent in its influence , shall be attuned to the celebration of the arts of benevolence and peace ; and happier will it be than it now is , when , as in the present instance , they paint the sufferings and blighting influence , rather than the factitious charms and glories of international strife .

And stretch myself , and die upon the grave . " /z/ The evils of war , in almost every possible point of view , have been pointed out . One form of those evils , however , has not arrested that attention , to which it seems to be justly entitled ; we refer to the influence of war on the moral and religious character of the soldiers themselves . It is not necessary to assert , that the evil which is now referred to , is one of the greatest resulting from a state of war ; but it is certainly an evil so consid- /z/ erable as richly to deserve the notice of the philanthropist . In making this remark , we do not permit ourselves to forget , that the moral and religious improvement of the human race is one of the greatest objects , to which the attention of mankind can be directed . Certainly , when we consider , that this object was one of the most effective in bringing the Son of God down from heaven , this statement will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can it be pretended , that the moral and religious improvement of the soldier is less important than that of other men ? On the supposition , therefore , that the moral and religious interests of the soldier are not less real and urgent than those of other classes of persons , we are prepared to enter into an examination of the circumstances , in which he is placed , considered in their bearing upon moral and religious character . And accordingly we do not hesitate to assert , that the life of a soldier is decidedly adverse to sound morals and particularly to religion . In proof of this assertion we might rely , without going into particulars , on the prima facie evidence , which is every where presented . Who has ever supposed , or believed , that large armies were remarkable for the purity and strictness of their morals ? Who has ever heard , with some rare and marked exceptions , of special attention to religion in the military encampment ? Undoubtedly there have been at various times some distinguished soldiers , who have been men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Col. Gardiner , who was killed at the battle of Preston Pans . And such probably was the character of many of the soldiers and officers , ( among others , Fleetwood , Harrison , Goffe , Whalley , and perhaps Cromwell himself , ) who bore a conspicuous part in the great English Revolution of 1640 . It is almost literally true , that the soldiers on the Parliament /q/ or Commonwealth side fought and prayed at the same time , with the sword in one hand and the Bible in the other It is a fact , probably without a parallel in the history of war , that early in the contest an attempt was made to raise some new regiments for the Parliament 's army , to be composed chiefly of truly religious men . This was done at the suggestion of Cromwell , who , as he held at that time a subordinate military station , proposed the measure to the celebrated Hampden . The latter at first thought the plan impracticable , but stiU seems to have carried it into effect by means of Cromwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into engagement , he saw his men beaten on evmtj side ; but afterwards , when he had " raised such mijn as had the fear of God before them and made conscience of what they did , " he was always successful against the enemy . ' * But these are obviously rare instances , and are justly to be regarded as exceptions to the general statement . As a general thing , it is true beyond all question , that among soldiers , particularly in large armies , there is a deplorable laxity both of moral and religious principle and feeling . But it is certainly a reasonable conclusion , that such a state of things could not so generally exist , unless there were something in the very situation of a soldier , which is opposite and fatally opposite to the cultivation of principles and feelings of this kind . But without resting satisfied with this general statement , it is proper to enter into the examination of some particulars . And in the first place , the soldier is removed from those many favorable and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general relations of society . The young man , who remains at home beneath his father 's roof , surrounded by his relatives and friends , is encircled on all sides by chords , in- /z/ visible indeed to the eye , and so light in their pressure as to be scarcely perceptible , which have an immense power in restraining the ebullitions of the passions and improprieties of conduct . He knows , that the ever watchful and affectionate eye of his father and mother is upon him ; he knows that a sister 's love is feelingly and deeply alive to every thing he says and docs ; he knows that his numerous relatives and friends , whom he meets at almost every hour of the day , have an interest in his deportment and character , which he can not disregard , without a violation of every sentiment of honor . and benevolence . The influence from these sources is far stronger than is sometimes imagined ; and we should hardly go too far in saying , that it constitutes one of the greatest sureties and supports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great measure at least , beyond the reach of this propitious control . Separated from his home , and from all those restraining and regulative influences , of which home is the great centre and source , he finds himself in a situation , where he can indulge his passions without being subject to any observation of which he stands in awe , and give loose to improprieties of deportment , without so clearly perceiving and feeling , that he himself is dishonored , and that his dearest friends are injured by it . He is transplanted from a scene and a situation , where every thing is rendered sacred by domestic affection , and oftentimes by the observances and benign spirit of religion , to a soil and atmosphere , that give birth and nourishment to every thing noxious and pestilential . No father 's warning voice checks him in his mad career ; no mother 's tear gives strength to the suggestions of virtue ; no brother 's or sister 's hand compulsively yet kindly withholds him from the haunts of dissipation and vice ; but on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE MORALS OF SOLDIERS . 4l ocean of temptation and vice , under a full press of sail , and left at the entire mercy of the winds and waves . But the soldier is riot only removed from those influences of domestic life , so favorable to a course of virtue ; but is placed directly under the pressure of other influences of a wholly opposite character , tending directly to vice . In other words , he is surroimded by men , whose character is essentially vicious , and constantly breathes the deleterious atmosphere of their example and advice . It is a just remark of Dr. Doddridge in respect to the military life , " the temptations are so many , that it may seem no inconsiderable praise and felicity to be free from dissolute vice , and to retain w:hat in other professions might be regarded a mediocrity of virtue . " * It is. not our object to go into the particulars of those vices , which are undoubtedly prevalent , in a very high degree , in all armies . It is suflicient for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which display themselves openly and are constantly disseminating their pernicious contagion , are intemperance , profanity , gambling , sabbath-breaking , &c.; which of themselves , without being accompanied by others of so depraved and impiu-e a nature as hardly to admit of being named , are enough to corrupt and ruin any body of men . A young man is taken from the bosom of a family , where he had been accustomed to hear the name of God mentioned with reverence , where the Sabbath had been seriously and scrupulously regarded , and where every thing around him had breathed of uprightness and purity , and is plunged at once in this sea of sin* And can we expect , that he will remain there , without deep and dreadful contamination ? We do not say , that it is absolutely impossible . But can we rationally expect it ? His ear becomes habituated to profaneness ; the Sabbath 's light , /z/ that once had a degree of sacredness , has ceased to bring its customary stillness and its solemnity and its religious instructions ; every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vicious indulgences ; and after some feeble efforts to sustain a propriety and decency of character , he falls the ruined victim of the pernicious influences , under which he is placed . Furthermore , there is something in the very nature of a military life , even if all the concomitant influences were unexceptionable , which tends to moral evil .  --  Even if it could be shown , that war is in some cases justifiable and right , ( a matter upon which we do not here propose to express an opinion , ) it would still remain true , that the military life has , in itself considered , a pernicious tendency . The appropriate business of the soldier is bloodshed , the taking away of human life . But this sanguinary business , whatever plausible reasons may sometimes be brought forward to justify it , jars violently upon all the finer feelings and susceptibilities of our nature . If a person can be made to feel , that it is right to cut down his fellow-man , to mar and destroy that image which God alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that any thing and every thing whatever may be either right or wrong ; in other words , to believe that the doctrine of moral distinctions is altogether tmfounded and false . But the fact is that a large proportion of the soldiers , perhaps nine tenths of them , never form an opinion , founded on a careful and candid examination of all the facts in the case , of the justice or injustice of the war , in which they are engaged . They slay their fellow-men , without having formed any deliberate opinion whether the action in that particular case is right or wrong .  --  They imbrue their hands in blood with much the same carelessness and indifference , with which a butcher sheds the blood of an ox or a lamb . To a large /q/ portion of the soldiers it is butchery , and nothing but butchery ; and from their inability to inquire into the full merits of the war , must necessarily be so . Military Ufe , therefore , when we properly analyze it , becomes to the common soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nothing more and nothing less . Now we assert , that this business , so abhorrent to all the kindly feelings of our nature , necessarily tends to imdermine the moral character . It requires no remarkable clearness of perception to see , that the butchery , the ' putting to death of our fellow beings in the way which has been mentioned , will fill the mind with a sort of instinctive abhorrence . No soldier , who fights without haying satisfied himself of the entire rectitude of his cause , ( a state of things which as we have seen is for the most part wholly out of the question , ) slays another in battle for the first , second , or third time , without hearing a warning voice within him , which denounces it as a deed of murder . Nature will be found to assert her rights , even in the bosom of military men . She will not fail to speak , and to speak in such a manner as to make herself heard ; but her remonstrances will be in vain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attitude of resistance ; the pressure of his situatii will compel him to harden himself against the calls of sympathy and of moral right ; and , although they are heeded for a time , as they must necessarily be , they are ultimately silenced . This is the natural , and we may add , the tnemtable course of things . The life of a soldier is necessarily a continued and rapid process of moral induration ; 80 much so that not unfrequently he , who went forth from his father 's home a human being , endued with human feelings , returns with the guilt and cruelty and stupidity and hardness of a monster . It is not our intention here , nor in any part of this work , to make statements at /z/ hzaard , nor to assert any thing , which is not abimdantly warranted by the facts of history . In the wars of Vespasian , ' a common soldier , says Tacitus , belonging to the cavalry , averred , that , in the late engagement , he killed his brother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand a recompense . " In the same civil wars , Julius Mansuetus , a member of the legion Rap ax , ( a significant and appropriate name for a Roman legion , ) was slain in battle by his own son . The son , who was yet young and in whom the process of moral hardening had not reached the highest point , was sensibly affected on the discovery of what he had done . He opened a grave , and with filial affection raising the body in his arms , buried it . But what is the commentary of Tacitus on this event ? " This pathetic scene did not escape observation . A few drew near , others were attracted , and in a short time the fatal deed was known throughout the army . The soldiers heaved a sigh , and with curses execrated the frantic rage of civil discord . And yet with those sentiments , they toent the next momefU to plunder their elavghiered friendi , their relations and brothers . They called it a cfimey and yet repeated what their hearts condemned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we appeal to those , to whom the history of wars , particularly of civil wars , is familiar , and we assert without the fear of contradiction , that the military life is not capable of being sustained , on the part of the great body of soldiers , without a prostration , to a very considerable extent , of the great elements of our moral nature . And under these circumstances it would certainly be in vain to expect from them any marked regard for religion . In addition to all that has been said , we proceed to remark further , that soldiers are left destitute , in a great degree , of that moral and religious instruction , which is necessary to the full developement of man 's moral and ON THE MORALS OF SOUHERa 46 religious character . It is true , that chaplains are sometimes provided for regiments and garrisons ; but this is done only to a small extent . Of the chaplains actually employed , whether more or less in number , is it uncharitable to assert , that there is a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep religious feeling , which is requisite to the successful discharge of the duties of that office ? The fact is , that men deeply imbued with the spirit of religion and filled with earnest desire to win souls to the Savior , are expeedingly unwilling to place themselves in a situation , where there is so little prospect of doing good . They know that the influences of military life are in themselves positively and powerfully adverse to impressions and influences of a moral and religious kind . Even admitting the lawfulness of their calling , which is very questionable as we shall hereajfter have occasion to see , still they find their nfiinds burdened and almost entirely prostrated , as to all effective effort , by the oppressive conviction , that they are casting pearls before swine ; that their admonitions are like water spilt upon the ground , that will never be gathered up . What , then , viewing the subject in all its bearings , must be the moral and religious prospects of a man , who enters upon a course of military life ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more unfavorable to the existence and growth of those moral and religious principles and habits , which are requisite to the perfection of our nature in this life , as well as to the happiness of the life to come ? Is it not almost certain , that , under the constant and deplorable pressure of such a multitude of adverse circumstances , the great body of the soldiery in every country will become vicious in principle and practice ; and that , even after their return from the military ranks , they will be utterly lost to their friends and society , as well as to themselves i And are we permitted . /z/ as men and as Christians , wholly to disregard this melancholy state of things ? While we are doing something for the slave and the prisoner and the benighted heathen , shall we turn no eye of sympathy towards the moral condition of the soldier ? But it will be said perhaps , that the evil now complained of is and must be small , inasmuch as soldiers make but a small portion of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show the magnitude , rather than the smallness of the evil . Even at this moment of comparative peace and quietude in the civilized world , what immense armies are kept on foot ! The standing army of Russia may , without any exaggeration , be estimated at 700 , 000 men , and it has sometimes been placed as high as a million . The standing army of France may be estimated at a number , varying from 350 to 400,000 . The number of the effective men of the standing army of Spain is given by Malte Bran at 50-000 ; but he adds , if the invalids , pensioners , and men on the sick list be included , the whole number may amount to 120,000 . The army of Great Britain is 100 , 000 in time of peace ; increased to 300 , 000 in time of war . According to Weimar 's Statistical Almanack for 1830 , the standing armies of all the European States in war , ( and it is to be recollected that either actual war , or a careful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European States , ) is 4,578,430.  --  And will any one say that the moral and religious interests of so vast a body of men is a concern too small to occupy the notice and to elicit the benevolence of the philanthropist ? Let us remember , that the soldier , corrupted as he is by immoralities , and stained by crime , is still a human being , that he has an immortal soul , that he has vast interests at stake , that he is subject , in common with others , to the great destinies of our race . Let us /q/ not turn from him with unmixed scorn and reproach , and haughtily leave him to his fate ; but let us feel for him , and act for him , and pray for him , as for a brother . We are aware that this view of the subject may not be so attractive as that which deals more in the horrible . It is certainly less exciting to the imagination ; but we may well doubt , whether it is less important . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an estimate of the great mass of evils attendant upon war , ought not to be overlooked , as has too often been the case . /z/ INFLUENCE OF WAR ON NATIONAL PROSPERnY . In endeavoring to give some idea of the evils of war , we do not feel at liberty to let pass unnoticed its injurious effects on the national wealth and prosperity .  --   - -  Wars tend not only to deprave the national moralsi but to diminish the national resources . The supplies in the hands of the sovereign are at such times rapidly consumed ; and hence it is necessary that constant drafts should be made upon the people ; and those , who would otherwise possess a competency , are often reduced to great want and suffering . It is probably true , and we would not be understood to deny it , that some men are made rich by war . And this in a great degree accounts for it , that in seasons of war there are always some persons and classes of persons , from whom larger and more generous views would be naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Jay , who was sent as Envoy to England in /z/ 1794 , states in his Miscellaneous Correspondence , that he was invited to partake of a public dinner , in company with about two hundred British merchants , who were concerned in the American trade . Towards the conclusion of the feast , being asked for a toast , he proposed what he considered a neutral one , as follows ; A saft ( mi honourable peace to all the belligerent powers ; referring probably in particular to the war then raging between France and England . " You can not conceive , he remarks to his correspondent , how coldly it was received , and though civility induced them to give it three cheers , yet they were so faint and single , as most decidedly to show that peace was not the thing they wished . They were merchants , There are always such men to be formd in time of war , some classes of merchants , some manufacturers , some speculators in the public funds , some agents engaged in furnishing the military supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular , because , such is their peculiar situation they happen to be made rich by it ; men , who , m . he language of Johnson , " rejoice , when obstinacy or ambition adds another year to slaughter and devastaticm ; and laugh from their desks at bravery and science , while they are adding figure to figure , cypher to cypher , hoping for a new contract from a new armament and computing the profits of a siege or tempest . " But these persons are so few in number , scarcely one in a thousand of the whole population , that they are hardly to be thought of . We must look at the majority of the people , at the great mass ; and not at a few grasping individuals , whose interests happen to lay in a different direction from that of the great body . And accordingly we may assert with entire confidence , with the unimportant exception just referred to , that war can not exist for any length of time , without certainly and rapidly bringing upon the nation engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIRST place , the expense of supportmg armies and navies is immensely great .  --   --  M. Thiers , recently a distinguished member of the French Chamber of Deputies , estimates the annual expense of each soldier in France at 733 francs or 131 dollars , of each soldier in Austria at 653 francs or 117 dollars , of each soldier in Prussia at 1000 francs or 180 dollars . The expense a maintaming each English soldier he estimates much higher , than the expense of an Austrian , Prussian , or French soldier . And whether it be owing to this circumstance or not , it seems to be the fact , that , while other nations are greatly burdened and depressed by the expenses in cident to the maintenance of large armies , England is burdened and down in a still greater degree . Some years since a statement was made in the London Weekly Review , of the wars , in which England has been engaged and of the expenses incurred in consequence of them , which is worthy of particular attentkm* " Of 127 years , terminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace . The war of 1688 , after lasftw ing nine years , and raising our expenditure in that period to thirty-six millions , was ended by the treaty of Ryswick in 1697 . Then came the war of the Spanish sucr cession , which began in 1702 , concluded in 1713 , and absorbed sixty-two and a half millions of our money . Next was the Spanish war of 1739 , settled finally at Aix-laChapeUe in 1748 , after costing us nearly fifty-four millions . Then came the Seven Years ' War of 1756 , which terminated with the treaty of Paris in 1763 , in the course of which we , spent one hundred and twelve millions . The next was the American War of 1775 , which lasted eight years . Our national expenditure in this time was 136 millions . The French Revolutionary War began in 1793 , lasted nine years , and exhibited an expenditure of 464 millions . The war against Bonaparte began in 180a /z/ and ended in 1815 . During those twelve years , we spent lt59 millions ; 771 of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolutionary War we borrowed 301 millions ; in the American , 104 millions ; in the Seven Years ' War , 60 millions ; in the Spanish War of 1739 , 29 millions ; in the War of the Spanish succession , 32 1-2 ntillicms ; in the War of 1688 , 20 millions :  --  total borrowed in the seven wars during 66 years , about 834 millions . In the same time we raised by taxes , 1189 milli ( ms ; thus forming a total expenditure of 2023 millions ! ' ' AeooTiUng to a recent publication , showing the extent , f ) 8jatitt , revenue , and debt of the principal States of Ii  --  ljfqjlbir 1829 , the debt of Russia was at that time 38,560,000 , of Austria 78,100,000 , of France 194 , - 400,000 , of Spain of Netherlands , mduding Belgium 148,500,000 , of Prussia , 000 , of Great Britain These enormous masses of debt were incurred in consequence of wars . Great na* tions have been reduced to the necessity of going from city to city , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their merchants . And it must be recollected , that during the whole period , in which these debts , incurred for military purposes , have been accumulating , the people , harassed and bleeding at every pore , have been compelled to pay excessive taxes for the same object . Can a nation in such a condition , burdened with such debts resulting from war , and at the same time overwhelmed with taxation for direct military purposes , be regarded as otherwise than miserably exhausted and wretched ! And can there , so far as the national resources and wealth are concerned , be any reasonable doubt as to the injurious and destructive tendency of wars ! ' England and France , ( says Bonaparte in one of his Conversations at St. Helena , ) held in their hands the fate of the world , and particularly that of European civiliaation. /q/ What iigury did we not do to each other ! What good might we not have done ! Under Pitt'a syatem , he says nothing of his own guilt , we desolated the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax of fifteen hundred millions of francs and raised it by means of Cossacks .

" * In this last inquiry , by whatever jealousy of spirit it might have been prompted in Ncqxleon , there is something worthy of the attention of the friends of England . Great Britain , with all the wealth of her cities and the grandeur of her nobles , with all the resources of her commerce , and the unrivalled skill of her manufactures , finds it difficult to conceal it from the world , that her giant footsteps are treading on the brink of bankruptcy . If she falls , it will be the result g war , of nielcriaut war ; for war is destructive to the victors , as well as the vanquished . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily on the resources of her genius and the endurance of her patriotism , where is the recompense , either in the past or the present , for her starving operatives , her beggared peasantry , the millions of her ignorant and wretched population , whose cry and wailing , amid the hum of her manufactures and the roar of her mighty cities , so often comes up , as if from the interminable depths , and thrills in the heart of philanthropy in the distant comers of the world ! In the SECOND place , we must take into view the loips , suffered by the community , in conseqaenoe of the abstraction of the vast numbers , that are employed in armies and navies , from profitabk employments . A nation 's /z/ resources are to be considered as diminished , not only by what it is compelled to pay , but also by what it might have saved to itself from its own efforts by taking a different course . The loss , in this point of view , is immense . In time of war , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion to remark , amount to 4,578 , 430 . And yet this vast body of men , consisting precisely of that portion which is most active and efficient , depend wholly upon others for their support ; they do nothing of themselves towards this object ; th &; whole burden of their maintenance is thrown upon others . As to all positively beneficial purposes , aside from the benefits which are commonly though erroneously supposed to be connected with war , they are mere drones in the social and political hive , utterly useless . If these men were required to beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning-hooks ; if they were permitted to remain in a situation , where they could apply themselves to the business of agriculture , to the fisheries , to navigation , and the common Brts of peace , what beneficial results would speedily follow ! The inhabitants at home would not only be freed from the immense expense attendant upon supporting them in idleness ; but there would be a positive and rapid accession to the resources and wealth rf the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all classes of people and all branches of industry .

What sterile and desolate tracts of country would be rendered fertile ; what marshes would be recjaimed ; what numbers of canals would be opened and railroads erected ; what an increase of the productions of the earth neces-sary for man 's subsistence ; what an impulse would be . ; giveil to commerce ! The great cause of humanity , embraced in the gospel /q/ principle , thou shalt love tht neighbor as thtself , is but very imperfectly understood . Mankind are but just awaking to a perception of its glory . They begin to feel for their brother man ; they ben to pity the heathen and td send to them the missionary and the Bible ; they begin to sympathise in the wretchedness of the slave and are striving to break his chains ; they begin to explore prisons and dungeons and to shed the light of benevolence on those abodes of darkness ; but this is only the first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length and breadth of which the most glowing philanthropists have but imperfectly explored . It is indeed right , that we should begin with those , whose condition is the most debased and hopeless ; but as the noble cause of philanthropy rolls on , it will be found that there is also a great work to be done at home . Every man must be filmished with his farm or his workshop ; the means of moral and religious education must be brought to every man 's door ; every man must have it in his power to reap some enjoyment even in the present life , not indeed as a brute animal rioting in the excess of passion , but as a rational and moral being ; so that happy faces , radiant with intelligence and virtue , may be seen looking out from the humblest cottages and even from workshops and manufactories . But in vain shall we look for the realization of this delightful vision , so long as wars continue to exist . In consequence of the abstraction of soldiers from profitable pursuits , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least aid from the military portion of the nation , to bear the immense amount , requisite for the support of armies and navies , in addition to the no small burden of the ordinary taxation . The number of those who pay is diminished , while they are compelled to pay /z/ a greatly increased sum . And this they are less able to do than they would otherwise be , in consequence of the direct destruction of their property , the devastation rf their lands , and particularly the interruption of commerce and other civic pursuits by reason of a state ot war . Scarcely able to support their families , and utterly unable to obtain for them many things exceedingly desirable for their convenience , and especially for their intdlectual and moral improvement , they nevertheless find it impossible to evade the demands of the taxgatherer , which are multiplied upon them in every shape . Their lands are taxed , their houses are taxed , their cattle are taxed , their persons are taxed , their clothing is taxed , their bread and salt and tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of an impost on windows is ted ; indeed , it is not easy to mention anything , which is free not merely from taxation , but from excesswe taxation .

And what are these inevitable consequences ?

" Now what hope is there of competency and happiness , or even of a tolerable degree of comfort , for a man , in the common ranks of life , surrounded by the wants of a rising family , if the little he earns is to be thus plucked from his hands ! It is individuals , that constitute the nation ; and if the resources of individuals are diminished , those of the nation are diminished also . There is no fallacy more dangerous and perhaps none more frequently committed , than to separate between the nation and the citizens of the nation . If the people are in mourning , if their fields and vineyards are desolate , if their children are slain on the field of battle , or prisoners in foreign lands , no magic of illuminations , of monumental piles , and of triumphal processions will make such a nation happy . Rachel will still mourn for her children , and refuse to be comforted . And here , as we have already had occasion to intimate , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at things in the aggregate , and do not contemplate them in /z/ their elements ; we behold the whited sepulchre of na* tional glory , and do not look at the death and horror within . The situation of the great mass of the people who are the real constitutors and essence of the nation is wholly overlooked by the promoters and advocates of war . The leaders of the nation , too rich and too elevated to feel the effects of the storm , which must smite somewhere with unmitigated fury , contemplate the splendor of their armies and the proud banners of their floating military castles , and consider themselves increased in goods and glory , while the condition of the great body of citizens , for whom in particular government was instituted , is one of disappointment , poverty , and wretchedness . The vast majority of the community , in those nations that have plunged deeply into the practice of war , are compelled to drag on their days without comfort for the present , and with as little hope for the future . Peace is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light from their countenances , because their time and strength and substance , to say nothing of the blood frequently poured out by the members of their own families , are invaded and exacted to support a vicious and idle multitude , whose business it is to consume and destroy without producing . These are the legitimate fruits of war ; these are the evils flowing from a violation of the laws of God and nature by shedding a brother 's blood ; these are the results to the miserable people , while kings and military chieftains and rulers of every grade are either indifferent to their condition , or rioting in their own abundance make an open mockery of their wretchedness. - /z/ INFLUENCE OF WAR ON THE PROGRESS OF aVIUZATlON . In adverting to the evils of war , and in endeavoring to impress them upon the mind of the reader , it is important to take into account its unpropitious influence on what may be termed in a single word civilization . The leading elements of a truly and highly civilized state of society are various , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite arts , literature , the domestic relations and duties , civil and religious institutions , &c.; If we had it in our power to examine at some length each of these elements separately , we could not fail , with the utmost distinctness , to perceive the deleterious influence of war on that complex civilization , of which in a great degree they constitute the parts . Instead , however , of that minute examination of the subject , which would perhaps be desirable , we shall be obliged to leave it with the reader with a few suggestions , made as briefly as possible . I ,  --  The cultivation of the soil , if we look at the subject with candour and with a suitable regard to all its relations , will justly be esteemed an indispensable element of civilization . As men rise in the scale of being , as they more and more bring themselves under the influence , of just and benevolent principles , the earth itself , as if conscious of so propitious a change , will begin to /z/ put forth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ; the soldier is called rom his plough , and the vine of his cottage droops till his return . But this is not all ; whole provinces have been laid waste at once ; houses , lands , cornfields , vineyards , all at once , as if by an overflow of lava or a blast of the sirocco . It would not be difficult to adduce instances and facts , that would fill volumes . What was the result of the eruptions of the Huns and Vandals into Italy in this respect , as well as in others Before that time , historians inform us , that this beautiful country was cultivated to the highest pitch ; but afterwards large tracts of land , not naturally barren or of little value , were coyered with forests and marshes of vast extent . * Repeat* edly , in the course of European wars , has the whole Palatinate been laid waste ; not merely cities , but villar ges , country-seats , cottages , fields , gardens , every thing . The Ukraine during the last century was laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russia . Almost the whole of La Vendee , thickly peopled as it was with an industrious and rural population , and every where bearing the marks of a high state of culture , was subjected during the French Revolution , to a most horrid and complete devastation . The devastation of the Peninsula by the armies of Napoleon was almost as great . " Affecting traces , ( says a writer who was there at the time , ) of the invasion of this smiling country were ev  --  ry where to be seen . Cottages all roofless and untenanted , the unpruned vine , growing in rank luxuriance over their ruined walls , gardens , the shells of fine houses destroyed by fire , ****** all proclaimed , silently , but forcibly , that I was travelling through a country , which had been the theatre of war . " f * Robertson 's Charles V , Historical Illnstratioiis , Note Y. t Recollectioiis of the Peninsiila , Phil . Ed. p. 180. /q/ It 18 unnecessary to recapitulate the horrid scenes of the.Carnatic , of St. Domingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , of Scio , of the Morea , and of other parts of Greece in the recent Greek war . On few has the hand of war borne more heavily than on the cultivators of the 8 ( h1 ; and perhaps in no period of the world have they suffered more than in the last half century . In peaceful countries the husbandman quietly moves behind his plough , or tends his flock in the shade of his native hills , but when war rages it is too often the case , that they find themselves without flocks , fields , or hmne . With hearts bleeding under the experience of human crime and cruelty , they are obliged to adopt the language of Virgil 's unfortunate shepherds , Nos patriflB fines et dulcia liDquimug arra . " II ,  --  Not to speak of the useful arts , which , although less splendid in their pretensions , are not less propitious in their influence on the progress of civilization , it will sorely not be maintained , that war has been otherwise tham unfavorable to the progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the like . The time has been , when Athens and Corinth , not to mention other distinguished cities of Greece , displayed the proud testi* mcmials of their refinement in their temples , paintings , tokd statues . And we know not , that any satisfactory reason can be given , why it is not now as it was then , except it be the devastations of war . In the year 410 , the city of Rome was taken and pillaged by the Goths and Huns of Alaric . After the streets had been strewed with tbelead of every age and condition , a violent as-aolt was commenced i:q ) on the works of art .  --  ' The pdlaces of Rome , ( says Gibbon in his history of the Dedine and FaU of the Roman Empire , ) were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture . The sideboards of massy plate , and the variegated wardrobes of /z/ silk and purple , were irregularly piled in the waggons , that always followed the march of a Gothic army . The most exquisite works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials ; and many a vase , in the division of the spoil , was shivered into fragments by the stroke of the battle-axe. "  --  And yet Gibbon gives his readers to understand , and Robertson does not hesitate to confirm the statement , that far greater outrages than ' these were committed , when at a much later period the city of Rome was assaulted , and during several months was subjected to every species of cruelty and depredation by the soldiers of Charles V. So far as we have been able to perceive , the works of art have not , in any country or in any age of the world , been respected by the invading and conquering army , whenever the riemoval or demolition of them was supposed to promote their objects . Mr. Southey in his History of the Peninsular War , speaking of the Castle of Benevento , which he represents as superior to any thing of the kind in EngiMid , observes ; " Every thing combustible was seized . Fires were lighted against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works perhaps of the greatest Spanish masters , and those of other great painters , who left so many of their finest productions in Spain , were heaped tcether as fuel . " * And what is remarkable , tfhis was done , not by the enemies of Spain , butl ) y those English allies , who had come to defend her . So late as the year 1814 , the British army , that entered the city of Washington , burnt down the Capitol , the President 's House , and the public Offices , destroying with them the national library , and a multitude of papers and documents of great value in a civil and historical point of view . /z/ III ,  --  Science and literature too , as well as the arts , sufFer from a state of war . It is , indeed , said one of the philosophers of Germany , that he calmly pursued his researches in the immediate neighborhood of the battle of Jena , undisturbed by the horrors around him . And there is an old story of Archimedes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the present inquiry , ) that he was deeply engaged in solving a mathematical problem , ignorant of the fact tliat Syracuse had been assaulted and taken by the Romans . But however this may be , no one will pretend , that the ability to engage the mind in philosophic and literary researches at such a time is often possessed . It is absurd to suppose , that the intellect can be kept steadily and profitably at work , while the heart is excited and rent by the angry passions . And such a state of excitement and anger is almost always attendant upon war , even when its thunders are heard at a distance , and its fires do not smite upon our own favored dwellings . The history of all literature abundantly shows , that quietude and retirement are favorable to the developements of refined intellect . It was amid the shades of Mantua , that Virgil composed the neid ; it was in the solitary vales of Vaucluse , that Petrach drew the breath of poetic inspiration ; it was when blindness and misfortune had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not amid the bustle of politics and the conflict of arms , that he wrote his Paradise Lost . But we will not pursue this interesting topic further than merely to add , that it is an ancient idea , almost as old as the world itself , and is no doubt founded on observation and reflection , that the Muses , prompted by the instincts of their own high nature , flee from Confusion and strife . If those , who have solicited their favor , have not mistaken their character , they seek retirement ; the bustle and /z/ turmoil of arms grate horrible discord to their ears ; they love to listen to rural sounds , the breath of winds , and the dash of waterfalls ; they delight in the solitude of forests and the contemplative silence of Mgen &a; grottos . IV ,  --  Civilization may be understood to suffer in all cases , where there is an interruption of the prindiples and institutions of Social life . And this is always the case in that numerous class of wars , more cruel and terrific as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look into the Jewish and Roman wars of this description ; and see how family ties were sundered ; mark how brother was arrayed against brother , and father was arrayed against son . We have already given instances from Tacitus ; the following , of an earlier date but of the same character , is from Valerius Maximus . " The father erf Caius Toranius , ( says this historian , ) had been proscribed by the triumvirate . Caius TcmpWEdus , coming over to the interests of that party , discovered to the officers , who were in pursuit of his father 's life , the place where he concealed himself , and gave them withal a description , by which they might distinguish his person when they found him . The old man , more anxious for the safety and fortunes of his son , than about the little that might remain of his own life , began immediately to inquire of the ( cers who seized him , whether his son was well , whether he had done his duty to the satisfaction of his generals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , " so dear to thy affections , betrayed thee to us ; by his information thou art apprehended , and diest . " The officer with this struck a poniard to his heart , and the unhappy parent fell , not so much affected by his fate , as by the means to which he owed it . " * We see here the effect of war upon social life ; how it enters into the sacred retreat of families ; how it sunders /z/ the most sacred ties ; and converts bosais , that were formed for mutual love , into the repository of the most hateful passions . What was the condition of social life and of social institutions in France during the progress of the French Revolution ! Every man stood in fear of his neighbour ; the great principle of sociaUty was brok- /z/ en at the foimtain ; suspicion , and mistrust , and terror were written upon every countenance ; the smile that enlightened the domestic hearth was quenched ; even the members of the same family lost confidence in each other ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the exclusion of those tender and amiable sentiments which are the basis of social happiness ; one dark image constantly haunted their troubled imaginations , the vision of the Revolutionary Tribunal and the spectre of the bloody Guillotine . The French invasion of Russia in 1812 fiumishes abimdant instances of the efiect of war upon the social feelings . " Hence forward , ( says Count Segur , ) there was no fraternity in arms , there was an end to all society , to all ties ; the excess of evils had brutified them . Hunger , devouring hunger , had reduced these unfortunate men to the brutal instinct of self preservation , the only understanding of the most ferocious animals , and which is ready to sacrifice every thing to itself . A rough and barbarous nature seemed to have communicated to them all its fury . Like savages , the strongest despoiled the weakest ; they rushed round the dying , and frequently waited not for their last breath . When a horse fell , you might hme fancied you saw a famished pack of hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which they quarrelled among themselves like ravenous dogs . " V ,  --  The Religious life and Religious institutions , which constitute another of the great elements of civilization , as well as the social life and social institutions . /z/ are made to feel the depressing and destructive influences of war . Without dwelling upon this topic , it will be sufficient to indicate a single view . We have reference to the well-known fact , that armies take no cognizance of the Sabbath . Fortifications are erected on the Sabbath ; soldiers are paraded on the same holy day ; in Europe the Sabbath is said to be more frequently selected than any other day for great military musters ; armies are marched from place to place without any regard to the Sabbath ; battles , as was the case at Waterloo , have been frequently fought on that day , probably more frequently than on any other ; and both officers and soldiers are taught to regard the strict observance of the Sabbath , as not only inconsistent with the necessities of war , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no place in minds of a more liberal turn . In this country for more than a century the Sabbath was observed by our conscientious forefathers with a great degree of strictness , and unquestionably with the most favorable results ; but the French war , about the middle of the last century , and the Revolutionary war , which followed soon afterwards , caused a great change in this respect . Since those wars , there has been a great relaxation in the observance of the Lord 's day , which is acknowledged and lamented , but which it i  - -  not easy to recover from . VI ,  --  All Civil and Political institutions , as well as social and religious , are unfavorably affected by a state oStWT . War always has been , and so long as it continues to be practised , always toill be , the bane of freedom . The liberty of Rome was overthrown by a skilful warrior ; it was the power , which military command and influence gave him , that enabled Cromwell to dissolve the the parliament of England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , centered in the person /z/ of Napoleon , which enabled him successfully to subdue and to hold in subjection the liberty of France ; and it is the evil influences of a military life , which at this yery moment disturbs , and perplexes , and casts a deep shadow over the cause of freedom in the Republics of South America . When do we find the fundamental Laws and Constitutions of a State invaded ? When do we find prisons filled with persons , guflty of nothing which in the ordinary condition of the community would be considered a crime ? When do we hear of proclamations of martial ' law , a measure oftentimes bearing more severely upon ' the citizen , than upon the enemy ? When do we hear of suspensions of the trial by jury , and of suspensions of the writ of Habeas Corpus ? All these things , bearing directly and most injuriously upon the cause of liberty , ar the results , and almost the necessary results of war . Plutarch says of Philopcemen , " Nature , indeed , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only how to govern according to the laws , but he knew haw to gwem the laws ihemuhes ; " a species of knowledge , with which many other military leaders , of less talent and less principle than the Achcean commander , seem to have been familiar . It is the testimony of Plutarch also , that ' the bloodthirsty Marius , who makes such a figure in man history , studied to raise new commotions in the Roman commonwealth , because he perceived , that alt hte greatness arose from war . It was a saying of his , iMet armd rikni leges . Civil and politided liberty lis perhaps more perfectly enjoyed in this country , than in any ol er . But ask any intelligent American citizen , whether our liberties would long continue , if we were obliged to suiq ) ort a standing army of an hundred , or even of fifty thousand men , and he will promptly answer : , it woulcf be a hopdess experiment . Nor is this mere republican* jealousy . Enlightened , men of other nations have ex /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man no less distinguished than Sir James Mackintosh , that " an army with the sentiments and habits , which it is the system of Modern Europe to inspire , is not only hostile to freedom , but incompatible with ft. " * VII ,  --  An enlightened Humanity is to be regarded , as one of the elements , and we may add , one of the marked and prominent elements , of high civilization . It will avail but little , that the arts and literature are cultivated , and that civil institutions are erected on just and liberal principles , if the heart is at the same time to be infected with strife and cruelty . Can that be regarded as truly a civilized state , where men disregard the ties of nature , resist the appeals of suffering , and learn to sneer at scenes and situations , over which unbiassed nature would weep ! But war always sooner or later leads to this ; it tends , beyond all question , to restrict and to crush the operation of all the kindly sensibilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , which he made against the queen of Hungary , he one night gave orders that every light in his camp should be extinguished by eight o'clock . Walking out at that time , in order to see for himself if all were dark , he noticed a light in the tent of a captain Zeitern . He entered the tent , just as that officer was folding up a letter . " Zeitern knew him and instantly fell on his knees to entreat his mercy . The king asked him to whom he had been writing . He answered that it was a letter to his wife , in qtjfleT to finish which he had retained the candle a few moments . Frederic coolly ordered him to rise and write one line more , which he would dictate . This line was to inform his wife , without any explanation , that , by such an hour the next day , he should be executed . The letter was then sealed , and Frederic himself took charge of * Yindicise Gallicse , 2d Lond . Ed. p. 286. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain was shot . " * Is this civilization , or rather utter and unmitigated barbarism ? It will b6 said perhaps , that war has its necessities . We grant it . But the question here is , not whether there are necessities in war , but what are the results of those necessities ? Do these necessities tend to promote or to depress civilization ; to render men humane and benevolent , or hard-hearted and cruel in the highest degree ? Look again at the conduct of one , with whom this same Frederic was impiously associated in the dismemberment of Poland , the empress Catherine of Russia . " The cruelties , the massacres , executed by the Russian Commanders , under the express orders of their ruthless and blood-stained sovereign , the female Tiberius of modern times , make humanity shudder . Not content with the torrents of blood shed by her own semi-barbarous armies , she also incited the Zaporavians , a tribe of the most atrocious banditti , who dwelt among the cataracts of the Borysthenes , to massacre the Poles in the Ukrcdne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too happy , with the prospect of impunity , to execute the wishes of the empress . The Ukraine was entirely laid waste , and the inhabitants put to death by means of the most inhuman and revolting tortures . The lowest calculation of the number of human beings , who lost their lives in this indiscriminate massacre , is 60,000 ; the highest , 200,000. " f If a person wishes to know , whether war is , or is not destructive of those feelings of humanity and benevo- * Ladd*8 Eflflays on Peace and War , No. 15 .

V. who refers here for his authority to Rnhliere 's Anarchic de la Pologne. /z/ t lence , which constitute so prominent an element of civilization , let him read the history of the wars , occasioned by the eflTorts of the Netherlands to secure their independence . Such was the complete demoralization atattendant upon this war , that the Spaniards in often repeated instances threw their Dutch prisoners overboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sea . This greatly exasperated the Dutch ; so much so that the State 's General gave orders to Hautain , one of their naval commanders , to retaliate in the same cruel manner . It was not long before this officer took some Spanish soldiers , whom he found on board of certain English and German vessel ; and in obedience to his orders , jbe eampaftie  --  of them uere tied togeAer in pmrsj and alagioeB iigndl weretkrovm ( dive into the ocean . * It it needless to multiply instances further , or to add ftny thing more on this general topic . As war in its very nature involves that hostility and violence , which are characteristic of barbarism , so it effectually tends to make men barbarians ; it tends to eradicate all the kindly and generous sensibilities ; it throws men back in the scale of civilization ; and reduces them to a condition of recklessness , stupidity , and cruelty , characteristic of the lowest and vilest brute animals . Nor are we sure that this language is strong enough . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct , that we find ourselves not di3pp8ed to object to one of the aphoristic sayings of Colexidgie .

It is not one of the least evils of war , numerous and aggravated as they are , that it is a great obstacle in the way of the successful prosecution of the Missionary enterprise . The Missionary comes to the heathen , with that simplicity and purity of views appropriate to his character , and announces a new and better religion , full of benignity , love , and peace . It is undoubtedly a great announcement , calculated to startle and arouse the attention of the most ignorant and prejudiced . But unfor* tunately for the Missionary , the heathen whom he addresses are already too well acquainted with the character of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announces to them as one great element of the Grospel , that it induces men to renounce strife and contention , to love each other , and to treat all mankind as their brethren . But they at once exhibit their incre duHty ; they state to him , that the people from whom he comes , and who have heard the disclosures of the Gospel from their childhood , are continually in conflict ; they themselves have heard the roar of their cannon ; they have seen the flash of their swords ; nay more , their own families have been assaulted ; their own houses have been rifled ; their own beloved children have been torn away and carried into captivity by men , who called /z/ proffer of the Gospel with the other will be attended with any adequate success ? Have they any reason to believe , that God looks upon such a course with approbation ? They may depend upon it , that the world will not be converted , nor will any marked success attend the Missionary cause , which even now , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be obstructed and languishing , until this great question is settled . But some will perhaps object , that these are solitary and exempt cases ; and that a great portion of the heathen world are not thus acquainted with the vices and crimes of Christians . We wish it were so , but it is not . The roar of Christian cannon , and the flash of Christian musquetry , and the hyana outcry of the Christian military onset have been heard and seen , wherever there are men . We are sending missionaries , not only to our own heathen tribes and to Syria and Palestine , but to India . Does India know nothing of the character of Christian nations , and of the hostility of that character to Christian principles ? Have not the armies of England at different times and under different leaders laid waste her fairest provinces , burnt her villages , and exemplified , to an extent deeply painful to every feeling heart , the tremendous crimes , which are capable of being found in association with the sacred but perverted names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a celebrated English orator , speaking of one of the principal agents in the transactions of British India then on trial , ) to be found in the history of human turpitude ; nothing in the nervous delineations and penetrating brevity of Tacitus ; nothing in the luminous and luxuriant pages of Gibbon , or of any other historian , dead or living , , who , searching into measures and characters with the rigour of truth , presents to our abhorrence depravity in /q/ its blackest shapes , which can equal , in the grossness of the guilt , OP in the hardness of heart with which it was conducted , or in low and grovelling motives , the acts and character of the prisoner . " *  --  And such are the pioneers of the Gospel ; such are the men , who , in the lamentable ubiquity of human avarice and crime , have ever been destined to present to the hungering and thirsting nations of heathenism the ante-past of the religion of purity and peace .  --  And has this great evil been sufficiently contemplated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great evil ; not only because it is so in itself and in its own nature , but because it is great in its application ; because it is found every where ; pervading every island and every continent and every country and every name and tribe under heaven . It is a fatal mistake which some will be likely to commit , that , though the evil is aggravated in its nature , it is limited and curtailed in its application ; and consequently of no great moment . Fleeing from the abominations of America and India , we direct our attention to the immense regions of Africa . As the Missionary passes along that benighted coast with his announcement of the glad tidings of salvation and peace , can it be supposed , that the countless wrongs and contumelies , suffered for three centuries at the hands of Christian nations , will at once be forgotten ? Undoubtedly the Missionary will find in the recollection of these wrongs an obstacle of the most serious kmd to his benevolent efforts . The untutored Africans will experience the greatest difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian principles and known Christian practice ; and so long as this is the case it can not be expected that their hearts will be thrown fully and frankly open to the re- /z/ ception of divine truth . We give you the Gospel , says the Missionary ; we come to you in peace ; and we pray you to listen to us , and to become Christians . " Oh , says the bereaved and heart-broken mother , rather give me my wretched sons and daughters , whom you Christians have torn shrieking from my arms , and have plunged into the ocean , or have enslaved in distant lands . " And now what is to be done ? Have we not by our misconduct erected a Chinese wall in the way of the prcess of the Gospel ? Can we reasonably expect to purify the world without a purification of ourselves ? Undoubtedly missions will be established , and will be attended with some degree of success , but we draw our conclusion without looking closely and seriously enough at the premises , if we suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great stumbling block out of the way . Ships of war must be laid up ; armies must be disbanded : the militia system must be given up ; fortifications must be demolished ; cannon must be melted - into bells for churches ; swords must be beaten into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks ; and then what light will beam from the brow of the Missionary , as he stands the messenger of the Prince of peace on heathen soil ! He will come not only with the gospel , but with a practical Commentary on its principles , so full , so striking , so overwhelming , as to carry conviction at once to the heathen heart . /z/ It would be an interesting topic , if our limits would permit us to enter into a full examination of it , to show on how very slight causes wars generally depend . We sometimes find an alleviation of our regret at the issues of events , by a consideration of the causes , which led to them . It is a common remark , that we ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how very seldom does this source of consolation exist in the case of wars . We shoirid naturally anticipate , that war , involving as it does such a vast amount of human life and happiness , would not be commenced , except for the most urgent and weighty reasons . But nothing can be further from the truth than such a supposition . Some years since the Peace Society of Massachusetts appointed a Committee to inquire into this subject . In the Report , the inquiry is " confined to wars , in which civilized nations have been engaged , since they became christian , or since Constantine assumed the reins of the Roman empire : omitting a great number of petty wars , in small nations of antiquity ,  --  temporary insurrections , or trivial hostilities  --  and a multitude of wars which have been carried on between christian and savage nations , such as the Aborigines of Asia and America . The report relates to 286 wars of magnitude , in which christian nations have been engaged . These are divided into the eleven following classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain extent of country . 22 Wars for plunder , tribute , &c.; 24 Wars of retaliation or revenge . 8 Wars to settle some question of honor or prerogative . 6 Wars arising from disputed claims to some territory . 41 Wars arising from disputed titles to crowns . 30 Wars commenced under pretence of assisting an ally . 23 Wars originating in jealousy of rival greatness . 5 Wars which have grown out of commerce . .65 Civil Wars . 28 Wars on account of religion , including the crusadeB against the Turks and heretics . " /z/ We should naturally infer from the most superficial view of the causes enumerated in this Report , that many of them are very slight . But a more full examination would probably fill us with astonishment . Examine , for instance , those wars , which have arisen from a jealousy of rival greatness , or from a determination to settle some question of honor or prerogative , and it will be seen how little truth , justice , and a due consideration of the consequences have had to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modena was involved in war . It originated in consequence of some soldiers of that State running away with a bucket from a public well , belonging to the State of Bologna . The bucket was of course of very little value , and was taken perhaps in the mere wantonness of sport ; but the circumstance of its being thus taken had the effect to wound the pride of the Bolognese , and to kindle up a long and bloody war . We do not propose , however , to go into a narrative of facts ; we appeal to the historical recollections of /q/ the reader himself , from the ten years ' war of Troy , down to the bloody contests of England and Holland for the nominal supremacy of the ocean . Although we are sometimes obliged to take the statements of Dean Swift , who understood the art of making a thing ridiculous by skilful exaggerations , with some grains of allowance , there is no need of any abatement in what he has said of the causes of war . " Sometimes , ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedde which of them shall dispossess a third of his dominions , whereto neither of them pretend to any right . Sometimes one prince quarelleth with another , for fear the other should quarrel with him . Sometimes a war is entered upon , because the enemy is too strong ; and sometimes because he is too weak . Sometimes our neighbors want the things that we have , or have the things that we want ; and we both fight till they take ours , or give us theirs . " There is one aspect of this subject , which seems to demand a moment 's further attention . It is a most melancholy truth , that the human race , with all their unspeakable interests , have been made the mere sport and things of those in power . It is not generally the case , that the nation itself , the great mass of the people , plunges into war by its own choice . It is the work of their rulers ; sometimes from pure malignity and cruelty , but still more frequently from a cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleasures , and ambition . Machiavel has somewhere given an account of a dispute concerning the making of a pair of gloves , in which a certain royal personage was involved , which had the effect to change the aspect of afiairs in all Europe . And an incident almost as trifling as this , the most trivial aflair imaginable , one which in private life should not have been esteemed important enough to /z/ set two neighbors at variance , has often plunged nations in blood . That truly distinguished philosopher , Dugald Stewart , in giving an Account of those Principles in men which lead them to action , has some remarks to this effect , that the cruelties , which boys so frequently practise upon inferior animals , are not so much owing to a really malevolent disposition , as to their love of activity and the pleasure they take in the exercise of power . And does not this remark , as well as what we know of the ambition and of the malevolent tendencies of the human heart , suggest the explanation of a multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind , kill their subjects , and set their subjects to killing each other , and bring upon them , directly and indirectly , the deepest poverty and wretchedness , not because they in in all cases , or even generally , love to witness suffering for suffering 's sake , but because they wish to have something to do , because they love to be in motion , because they take a pleasure in activity and the exercise of power ; in a word , because they think only of themselves and of their own personal gratifications and of nobody else . There is a passage in Voltaire 's History of Louis XV on this subject , worthy of some notice . Speaking of the war of 1756 , in which the French nation had been engaged , he remarks , " this nation lost , in the course of this unfortunate war , a great part of the flower of its youth , more than half of the current money of the kingdom , its navy , commerce , and credit . It was believed , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving up to the English a little piece of litigated ground towards Canada . But some ambitious persons , to make themselves necessary and important , plunged France into this fatal war . It was the same in the year 1741 . The selfishness of two or three individuals is sufficient to desolate all Europe . " The same writer informs us , /q/ that Louis XIV once gave orders fop the entire laying waste and destruction of the whole Palatinate , a beautiful country in the heart of Europe . The blame of this inhuman transaction was attempted to be thrown upon the Marquis de Louvois , one of his ministers . But Louis himself , whom history so incorrectly and unwisely styles the Great , was the criminal . " He signed the order , ( says Voltaire , ) at his palace of Versailles , because he saw nothing in such a command except his power and the unhappy right of war . And thus it is . Rulers little think , in the midst of their abundance gathered up from the spoils of the people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song , how many hearts of the poor , by such a mere dash of the pen , they have broken ; how many peasants ' cottages they have made forever desolate ! /z/ We have thought it a matter of some consequence to attempt , in the preceding chapters , to give some idea , ( a very imperfect one we are aware , ) of the Evils of war . If the statements which have been made , can lay no just claims to novelty , they may yet perhaps have power to refresh the memory , and to bring before the imagination pictures , which had begun to fade away . In view of the evils of war , the inexpressible calamities to individuals * Voltaire'i Age of Louis XIV , Chap . 16.  --  See also Lonia XV , Chap . 36- // and communities which ever attend it , we may earnestly appeal both to the humanity and the interests of mankind . If they have any kindly and generous feelings remaining , any emotions of pity , any compassion for their fellow-men , any bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions of this amiable and ennobling part of our nature , and cease to practise those arts of destruction , which for six thousand years have deluged the earth with tears and blood . Or if , hardened against the kindly and sympathetic sensibiUties , they consult merely the considerations of interest , we still take courage to entreatthem to look upon their ruined habitations and wasted fields , and to learn war no more . But there is a still higher part in man 's nature . We do not feel at liberty to stop short with an appeal to men 's sympathies , or to those views of an interested or prudential kind , which they may entertain ; but entering into that more elevated portion of the soul , which may be characterized as the sanctuary of duty , we put the question to their conscience and their religion . We ask them , whether as moral and religious beings , as beings subject to the regulation of the two-foldlawof nature and of revelation , they have the right to destroy each other ? Accordingly this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now propose to enter , not whether war is consistent with the dictates of humanity or the claims of common prudence and interest , but whether it is right , whether we can engage in war without sin , in any case whatever ? We say , in any case tohateverj because we do not propose to make any distinction between offensive and defensive war . If it can be proved , that defensive wars are allowable , it would be altogether useless to pursue the inquiry any further , because under the name and pretext of defensive war , national contests of every des- tHE LIGHT OF NATURE . 81 cription , would be carried on . Every belligerent nation , with scarcely a single exception , scornfully rejects the imputation of being the original aggressor , and professes to prosecute its warlike measures for purposes of selfprotection . And so long as we admit , that defensive wars are allowable on Christian principles , so long we grant , for all practical purposes , every thing which the advocates of war wish . The true doctrine is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , as one and as many , is inviolable ; that it can not be taken away for any purpose whatever , except by explicit divine permission ; and that war , in every shape and for every purpose , is wrongj absolutely wrongs wholly wrong . Any doctrine short of this will fall altogether power less and useless upon the broad surface of the world 's crimes and miseries ; it will dim the light of no sword ; it wSl wipe the tear of no widow and orphan . The question of the right of war , including in the term . Defensive as well as Offensive war , may be examined in a threefold point of view , ( 1 ) by the light of nature , ( 2 ) by the principles of the Old Testament , ( 3 ) by the principles of the Gospel . This is the course , in the examination of this subject , which is taken by Grotiusin the first Book of his Law of Nations ; a method of reasoning upon it , which is at once simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether war , in any of its forms , is permitted by the light of nature . The light of nature is nothing more nor less than the light of natural reason and conscience . But as the light of nature is understood to embrace in its influence all mankind , and of course to be accessible to the perceptions and convictions of all , the common view , which is taken of it , is , that the doctrines , which it developes and establishes , , are easily perceived , are almost intuitioe ; that the preparative steps of reasoning are few , convio- /z/ tion being flashed upon the mind at once . Accordingly if any one will take the trouble to inquire , he will find that writers on Natural Law , ( a portion of Law which is understood to rest , not upon enactments , treaties , or conventions , but upon nature , ) seldom introduce long and abstruse trains of reasoning . On the contrary , the propositions , which they lay down , involving as they often do immense consequences , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitive common sense and common feeling of mankind . In the dispensation of the elements , the leading principles of moral duty , nature has made no distinctions , has constituted no aristocracy ; but has showered them down upon the learned and the imlearned , much as the rains are said to descend , without regard to character , upon the just and the unjust . To determine right and wrong is of more consequence than to comprehend the doctrine of the planetary system ; but while it required , in order to unfold the wonderful laws of the planets , the gigantic intellect of Newton , the higher gift of the determination of right and wrong is bestowed upon the simplest peasant , upon the man , who can not repeat the enumeration table . To determine , therefore , whether a thing is agreeable or not to the light of nature , all we have to do , is , to determine whether it is agreeable to the common sense and common feeling of mankind . The prevalent sentiment of mankind , even if it should he interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be likely to be an erroneous one . Let us then take the simplest case . Is it right , merely for our own gratification , to put a man to death , who has not injured us personally , nor done injury to the community No one will pretend , that on such a question there is need of laboured argument ; the decision is made at once ; promptly , intuitively , and unanimously . /q/ Again , is it right to put a man to death , who has merely committed an offence against property , the crime of theft ? The reply , notwithstanding the strange practice of some nations , is equally prompt and decided . Furthermore , is it right to put a man to death for some assault upon and injury to our person , which does not go so far as to aftect life ? In all these cases , the answer , resulting from the common perception and the common feeling of mankind , can not be mistaken . We have here , not indeed the light of a long deductive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature . On questions of this kind the ignorant man pronounces his opinions , as promptly and decisively as the philosopher . It is his nature which speaks . If he is asked to give the reason , why a man should not be put to death for nothing , or for theft , or for a blow upon his person , his answer is , that he has no reason to give , ex* cept that such is his conviction , founded upon the instinctive suggestions of his nature . It is his nature which controls his conviction ; there is something deeply abhorrent to his natural and moral sensibilities in the shedding of blood ; there is a voice within him , coming up from the sacred depths of the conscience , which pronounces it wrong . Kindness , benevolence , abhorrence of the shedding of blood is an attribute of humanity . So fully are we persuaded of this , that we can not deny , that we have no great respect for the sensibiUties of that man , who can look upon the butchery of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference . How much analogy is there between the feelings of such a man and the benevolence of that God , who hears the ravens when they cry , who gives their meat to the young lions , and without whose notice not even a sparrow falls to the ground ? But when we see the knife applied to the throat of a human being , or the guillotine suspended /z/ over him , or the bayonet plunged into his breast , the remonstrances of nature are loud and overwhelming ; and the man , who can be indiiSerent there , who feels at such a time no instinctive oppositions of heart and conscience , has but little claim to be regarded or treated as a man . But there are perhaps other cases , which are attended with more difficulty . We will suppose , that an individual attacks us with dangerous weapons and with an evident intention to killj and that at the same time we are not in a situation to make our escape . Shall we not in that case defend ourselves ? To this question we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now do from the light of nature , undoubtedly we may . Not only the prompt decisions of reasoning and the dictates of conscience would permit us to make such defence ; but we are also strengthened in our opinion of the propriety and rectitude of such a course by the consideration , that we have within us naturally the principle of resentment . This principle like all the other principles , coming under the general head of the Natural Sensibilities , has a two-fold operation . It operates in the first place instinctively . When children , for example , are accidentally hit by a stone or a Savage by an arrow , they feel a momentary , instinctive rage against the inanimate object , and smite it or break it to pieces . And it can not be doubted , that our Maker exhibits his beneficence , in giving this instinctive form of operation to this principle . It is the object and the result of Instinctive resentment to place us suddenly on our guard , and in the attitude of self-defence , against unforeseen and unexpected attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were obliged to wait for the more tardy results of reasoning , we should infallibly sufier . There is another operation of resentment , distinct from its instinctive operation , which Mr. Stewart properly calls deliberate . It appears more /q/ slowly ; always implies the exercise of the reasoning power ; and is more permanent than instinctive resentment . But , in both its forms , it seems to be an original principle , and is understood to be implanted for necessary and beneficent purposes . Now with such a mental constitution we can not suppose , when left to the mere instructions of the light of nature , that we are prohibited from defending ourselves when thus attacked . But the question yet more difficult arises here , whether , in acting on the principle of self-defence , we may not only repel our adversary , disarm him , disable him , and confine him ; but whether we may also take his life f And here we may assert without hesitation , ( and are sustained in the opinion by some of the illustrious names of imchristianized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , in our efforts at slf-defence , to the mere line of present and future protection , and no further , except it be for the good of the aggressor himself . The principle of resentment is a protective , and not an aggressive principle ; it was designed to preserve ourselves , and not to bring suflering on others . Such is the original constitution of the human mind , that , in its unbiassed and just action , it condemns and proscribes decisively and forever all retaliatory and revengeful feelings . In all cases , therefore , where we can preserve our own life without the extinction of that of our adversaries , we are bound , on the basis of enlightened conscience and reason to preserve both . We come , then , to an ultimate case . We will suppose ourselves unable to disarm our adversary , and that we are morally certain , if we do not take his life , he will take ours . Here we suppose , although some minds would be slow in coming to the conclusion , that mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of putting to death their antagonist .  --  And on this basis , reasoning from in- /z/ dividuals to nations , the light of Nature would seem to authorize war in those extreme cases , where we are obliged to choose between our own destruction and that of our assailant . So far as this , arguing the subject from the light of nature alone , we feel disposed to concede to the advocates of war . We do not deny that if the code of nature were the only code , which binds its requisitions on the human race , the prospect of universal and permanent peace would be altogether a hopeless one . But we would beseech the advocates of the right of war not to forget , as seems to be too often done in arguing on this subject , that we are not left in this situation . It is not true , ( and we ought to be grateful that we are permitted to say it , ) that we are left to the guidance of the light of nature alone . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every candid mind will be ready to confess , that the light of nature is often dim and uncertain ; and just so far as we have the purer and brighter radiance of Revelation , we are under obligations to follow it . /z/ If we examine the subject of war , as it appears in the light of nature , we may perhaps be obliged to admit , that , in some extreme cases , which very seldom occur , it is allowable . But in addition to the light of nature , as we have already had occasion to say we have the purer and brighter light of Revelation . The mere fact of a Revelation from God implies , that those unaided suggestions of natural reason and conscience , which are indicated by the phrase light of nature are not enough for us in the actual circumstances of our situation . Accordingly we naturally anticipate , that there will be found in the Scriptures principles and practical requisitions , different from and above the principles and requisitions of nature . Revelation embraces the natural divisions of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other by time , by events , and by principles , that there is no danger , in the examination of the subject before us , of their being confounded together . We proceed , therefore , to the examination of the subject of war , as it is presented to us in the Old Testament . In the first place we admit , that wars were frequently carried on during those periods , to which the Old Testament particularly relates , and that religious men , such as Abraham , Joshua , and David , participated in /z/ them . There is no question as to the fact . The question is in respect to the principle . On what grounds did this happen ? What were the reasons , which led to this state of things ? We can not doubt , that the wars of the Old Testament , so far as they were entered into and conducted by pious men , were understood by them to be fully authorized by the permission of God , either express or implied . It will be recollected , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God was in the habit of holding communications with his chosen people . Their government , even so far back as the time of Noah , may properly be denominated theocratical . In other words , God was their civil and political , as well as moral governor . By dreams and visions of the night , by symbolic appearances , by the mouth of his prophets , by Urim and Thymmim , and by the agency of angels , he condescended to make manifestations of his will to his people and their rulers . The subjects of those communications were more or less important ; some of them have been handed down to us , but some in all probability have not been made matter of historical record . But certainly it would be unreasonable to suppose , that the subject of the destruction of human life and of war was wholly passed by . If we had no express testimony to to the fact , we should certainly conclude from the nature of the case , that the pious servants of Jehovah would not feel at liberty to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will in so important a matter . They consulted him in other things ; they were in the habit of regulating their conduct by his directions and advice ; and is it at all probable , that , in so responsible business as that of shedding human blood , they would either refuse to seek his counsel , or would disregard it when given ? The first war particularly mentioned in the Bible , as /z/ having been carried on by those , whose example would have any weight in this discussion , is that , which was commenced by Abraham for the rescue of Lot . In regard to this case we admit , it does not appear from the record which we have of those events , that any divine permission was expressly given to Abraham . And yet from a knowledge of his character , and particularly of his entire reliance upon God , we are naturally led to conclude , that , if he had not an express revelation on the subject , he yet had such evidence &^; and intimations in regard to it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course he pursued . His reply to the proposition of the king of Sodom , that he had lifted up his hand unto the Lord , the Most High God , &c,; seenur to indicate very clearly , that he had not engaged in this warlike enterprise for mere worldly purposes , nor without a reference to the will of that great Being , in whom he believed . Especially when we consider , that he was blessed for his conduct by Melchisedeck , the priest of the Most High God ; and that both before and after thisevent he had direct communications with God himself . If we examine the wars , which took place in the times of Moses and Joshua , we shall find more decisive evidence that they were commenced and carried on , as a general thing , under the divine direction . On a certain occasion the Israelites proposed to make an attack upon the Amalekites ; but what was the language of Moses ? " Go not up , /or the Lord is not among you ; that ye be not smitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , when Arad the Canaanite opposed the passage of the Is raelites through his territories , that " Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord , and said , if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will litterly destroy their cities . And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Canaanites . " When the king /z/ of Bashan came out against the Israelites to give battle at Edrei , " The Lord said unto Moses , fear him not , for I have delivered him into thy hand , and all his people , and his land . " The wars , which were waged after the death of Moses , under the direction of Joshua , were commenced and carried on with the divine permission and approbation . After directing him to arise and pass over the Jordan , God says to Joshua , " Every place , that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have I given unto you , as I said unto Moses . From the wilderness and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrates , all the land of the Hittites . " In other instances too numerous to repeat here , we find that God kept in his own hands the direction in this matter ; and that nearly in proportion as his people revered him and loved him and were disposed to do his pleasure , they consulted him in all measures of a warlike nature . This at least is found to be so frequently the case , that in those instances where no record of such consultation has come down to us , we may reasonably infer , that it was not in fact omitted . And this is what we should naturally expect from a consideration of the immense consequences involved in war ; and particularly after the solemn announcement on Mount Sinai , Thou shalt not kill . The sixth Commandment furnishes a key to the interpretation of the whole of the Old Testament on the subject of the inviolability of human life . By keeping this key in our hand , we may unlock it and explain it in entire consistency with itself from beginning to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have no idea , that this command , ihau shalt not kiUj was limited , as some imagine , to cases of manslaughter and murder . We are aware , that some distinguished names would impose this limitation . Even Rosenmueller translates it by the Latin expressions , ne homicidium committitk ; /q/ thus limiting the prohibition to the crime of murder in its various forms . But we venture to assert , it will not be maintained by Biblical critics , that this limitation of meaning is found in the verb itself , which is unquestionably one of the most general import . The meaning of the passage , taken by itself , is simply this ; Thou shalt not take life ; life is sacred , inviolable . Nor does anything in the connection , so far as we can perceive , suggest any such limitation , as has been contended for . The true connection and relations of the passage are to be found in the chapter , in which it is contained . There is a clear line of distinction both between what goes before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeniable , that no limitation of the terms in question is either made or even suggested , excepting we may infer from the general objects and manner of the communications made at this time , that the prohibition refers to the taking of human life , and not to that of brute animals . It is not denied , that a portion of the Jewish civil Code was communicated at the same time , or nearly at the same , with the announcement of the Tables of the Moral Law ; and that in this Code , the punishment of death is required to be inflicted in certain cases . But what precise time elapsed , and what explanatory or other communications took place between the announcement of the Moral and Civil code , we have now no means of knowing . We may reasonably suppose , however , that enough was communicated to the Jews to remove from the course of Divine proceeding all inconsistency and obscurity . God , it may be supposed , gave his peoJe to understand , that the prohibition of the sixth commandment was binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not upon himself ; that no man was at liberty to destroy the life which heconld not give ; and that consequently it could not be taken in any case whatever , /z/ without his express permission . And accordingly we find him , in his capacity of civil and political nller , granting this permission to some extent ; not because it was 00 in the beginning , not because he designed it to be so in the end , but undoubtedly for the reason applicable in the case of polygamy and divorce , viz , on account of the hardness of their hearts and their sins . The prohibition , therefore , contained in the sixth commandment , stands out in all its distinctness and solemnity , sanctioned by all the impressive circumstances , which attended God 's appearance on Mount Sinai , and to be obeyed in all situations whatever , except where God by a special interposition is pleased to suspend it . As God is the author of life , we naturally feel , that no one besides himself has a right to take it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last chapter , viz , where our own life comes in direct and certain conflict with that of another ; and even in that case no one pretends to deny , that it is his right , when he sees fit to exercise it , to determine who shall fall . His command po  --  esses the prerogative of overruling even our natural feelings of resentment . Whatever may be true on the 49ubjeGt of taking human life when we are left to the light of nature , it is certain , that God , when he undertaken to reveal his will and to legislate in addition to and in com ' - pletion of the light of nature , may lay down such regulations in regard to the inviolability of life as he sees fit . He has said , thou shalt not kill ; he has made use of the most general terms , clearly asserting the inviolability of human life in all cases whatever ; he has promulgated this command in the most solemn manner ; he has incorporated it into the specific and glorious code of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonial and political regulations , is sanctioned and established forever by the Mediator of the New Covenant . /q/ This , therefore , is the conclusion at which we arrive on this part of our subject . In the periods of the Old Testament , life was taken and wars were carried on by those , who are represented in the Epistle to the Hebrews as having lived and died in the faith , not on the ground of natural right , ( for they were now placed under a theocracy or economy above that of the light of nature , ) but on the ground o permission , God , as the great arbiter of life and death , had once in his righteous anger drowned the whole world , had sent down fire and consumed the corrupt cities of Sodom and Gomorrah , had - opened the earth and swallowed up Korah and his company , and in repeated instances he smote and destroyed his own people and thdr enemies with some deadly disease ; but he saw fit for wise reasons , which we are not at liberty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his indignation . When he saw a nation occupying lands belonging to another , as was the case with the Canaanites in their occupancy of Palestine ; when he saw them unjustly attempting to destroy his own beloved people ; when he beheld them given up to every species of idolatry and moral corruption , he determined to secure the great ends of justice and beneficence by destroying them in war . It is true , he might have effected his object by other means , but he chose this . If his people in some instances , either in their forgetfulness or their sin , seized the sword and took life without his permission , ' we find that they did not always escape his rebukes and chastisements ; and certainly this unauthorized and sinful conduct is no suitable precedent and authority for us. * * There is one passage of the Old Testament , Gen. 9 : 6 , " Whoso sheddeth man 's by man shall his blood be shed , " which might have been introneed here . Bnt in order to prevent repetition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Capital Punishment . /z/ But it is worthy of particular notice , that , while the taking of life and the practise of war were permitted during the periods of the Old Testament dispensations , we have repeated intimations in the Old Testament itself of a better state of things ; of a day when war and its attendant miseries shall cease . The ceremonial institutions and rites seem to have had a meaning , prefigurative of that better , purer , and more peaceful state . Even the tabernacle and the temple had their spiritual import . And it is worthy of remark , that David , with all his success and glory , was not permitted to build the Temple , because ' he had shed jblood abundantly aid made great wars . This certainly looks , as if the shedding of blood was not a thing pleasant ' in the sight of God ; but was permitted , in the wisdom and supremacy of his Providence , in consequence of the peculiar situation of mankind . But there are express predictions on this subject . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now referred to . A few will afford ample matter for profound reflection .  --  Isa. 2 : 3 , 4 . " And many people shall go and say , Come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways , and we will walk in his paths ; for out of Zion shall go forth the law , and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem . And he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people ; and shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks ; n ( Uion shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn uar any more . And again in the same prophet , chap . 9:6,7 , " For unto us a child is bom , unto us a Son is given ; and the government shall be upon his shoulder ; and his name shall be called Wonderful , Counsellor , the mighty God , the everlasting Father , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peace , there shaU be no end . " And again , chap . 11 : 1 , 5 , 6 , /z/ 7 , 8 , 9 , " And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse , and a branch shall grow out of his roots . And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins , and faithfulness the girdle of his reins . The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb , and the leopard shall lie down with the kid ; and the calf , and the young lion , and the fatling together ; and a little child shall lead them . And the cow and the bear shall feed ; their young ones shall lie down together ; and the lion shall eat straw like an ox . ' And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp , and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice 's den .  --  They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy mountain ; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " See also the prophet Micah 4 : 1  --  5 . In view of these passages and others of a like import , it can not be doubted , that we are fully authorized to anticipate the actual existence of a day , whether it shall be slow or rapid in its advent , when wars shall cease , when contentions shall exist no longer . The day of aggression and of retaliation will certainly come to an end . But can this universal diffusion of harmony consist with the principle , that it is right and justifiable to do acts of injury and violence ! What sort of a millennium would the bright period referred to prove to be , if every actual or supposed injury might without impropriety call forth other acts of violence in repelling them , or in retaliation of them ! Who has ever associated in his conceptions of the serenity , quietude , and love of the millennial period , the recognition , either practical or theoretical , of the belligerent dogma , " an eye for an eye , a tooth for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case , that the principle of non-resistance , based upon emotions of true and heart-felt love , must be the forerunner , the attendant , and the grand security of that blessed state of the world . So that while Jehovah , in the exercise of that theo- /z/ oratical sovereignty , of which we have the particular ac* count in the Old Testament , permitted wars in the existing state of things , he at the same time teaches his prophets to inform us by the peculiar methods of prophetical communication , that this is only the temporary and not the permanent feature of his administration ; that war shall ultimately cease ; that the great doctrine , thou SHALT NOT KILL , shall at last gain a practical ascendency ; and that human Ufe , with the exception of his own authority over it , shall stand , in all the possible circumstances of its earthly existence , inviolable and sacred . /z/ If we examine the subject of war by the light of nature alone , unaided by anything in the form of a divine communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , in a few extreme cases , justly carry on war . So far as this , for the reasons already given , we concede to those , who differ from us on this great subject . If , in accordance with the plan laid down , we proceed to examine the subject in the light of the Old Testament , we maintain , ( taking the acknowledged ground , that God 's chosen people were from the beginning under a Theocracy more or less fully developed , ) that human life is held inviolable ; and that this great principle can not be suspended , except by God himself , the author of life . And if we can at the present day make ourselves sure of an /q/ express Divine permission to take life , as Moses And Joshua and other Old Testament saints did , we are undoubtedly at liberty to take it . But we are to keep in view , in this part of our inquiry , that the Old Testament itself holds out the prospect of a different and better state of things ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts and wars shall cease . But having passed upward from the ground of Nature to the ground of the Old Testament , we are now prepared to take a step higher and to place our feet upon the plain of Bethlehem , beside the cradle of the great Chris- ' tian Legislator , with an illuminated sky above us , and hosts of angels uttering in strains unknown before , peace ON EARTH , GOOD WILL TO MEN , It is iu the ' Ncw Testament , and under the Christian Dispensation , of which Jesus Christ is eminently and emphatically the author , that we must settle permanently this interesting question . Before attempting to show from the New Testament , that war , in no shape whatever , is allowable , it may be of some importance to premise , that in making this attempt we labour under great disadvantages . We can not reasonably expect an entirely candid hearing . Even those , who imagine that they may be fully prepared to receive the truth on this subject , may nevertheless be under the influence of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural and unholy feelings of mankind are against us . If a man is greatly injured , he has a natural feeling , a sort of instinctive impulse , that it is right for him to defend himself ; and under certain circumstances and to a certain extent , to attack , to retaliate , to charge home , to carry the war into the enemy 's territory . And accordingly when our doctrine of the entire inviolability of human life in all cases whatever is proposed to him , he instinctively sets himself /z/ against it ; and it is an hundred to one that he is not m a proper situation to listen attentively and candidly to the arguments , by which it is supported . We mition this unfavorable state of things , in order that the inquirer into the truth of our doctrine may scrutinize his own feelings , and may use alL suitable efforts to put himself in a situation , where every well-founded consideration will have its due effect . And we may add further , that it is highly important and a duty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and does it too in the full purpose and sincerity of his heart , we frankly acknowledge we have no hope of a favorable issue . Our present argument addresses itself , it will be perceived , not to the Atheist , who believes in no God , nor to the Deist , who rejects the Divine Word ; nor to the mere Moralist , who weaves from the elements of his imperfect reason the web of a spurious and unsound ophy ; nor to the mere speculative believer , who gives a nominal assent to the Gospel without imbibing or reoognizing its spirit ; but to the real , the devoted , the humble Christian ; to him who makes Christ his great example , and truly desires to be animated by the same epitit of sublime charity , benevolence , and forgiveness , which glowed so brightly in the bosom of the Saviour . And here we entreat the inquirer on this subject to put the question to himself . Do I in fact receive , and am I truly willing to receive the Gospel in my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reigned in Christ , whatever it may be and however humbling in the estimation of the world , may teign in my own bosom ? Am J truly of that pure , meek , quiet , benevolent temper , which is appropriate to the Christian character , and of which the Savior , whom I profess to follow , furnishes so illustrious an example ? It can not be doubted , that every thing depends upon the answer , which shall be given to these queetions. /q/ It is a great truth , which can not be too often and seriously insisted upon , that the Church , that the jhtofessed followers of Christ must take the lead on this subject ; must investigate it and form an opinion on it find . While Christians are careless and stupid and hesitating in this great business , it is a matter of course , that the unbelieving world , carried away by its unholy passions and subject to its ten thousand lusts , will scoff at the doctrine of the inviolability of life and the unlawfulness of war . Let every Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him comp to the investigation ndth a humbled heart , with true meekness of disposition . If Christians come to this inquiry in the spirit of war , it will not be surprising if they imagine they find war ; if they come in the spirit of peace they will undoubtedly find peace ; and as Christians go , the world , the ulhoU world will , either sooner or later , go with them . In proceeding now to examine the subject of war in the light of the New Testament , we remark in the first dace , that war in all its forms is opposed by those numerous passages , which require men to love their fellow men .  --  Mat. 22 : 37 , 8 , 9 , " Jesus said unto him . Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with an thy soul and with all thy mind . This is the first and great commandment . And the second is like unto it , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. "  --  The Savior himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are to understand by our neighbor . The commentary of the Saviour authorizes us to understand the term as including all mankind , every class and condition of men ; however they may be separated from us by difference ( rf* language , by distance of country , by diversities of opinion , religion customs , government , and political interests ; however they may be , from some unHTopitiaus drcumstanoed , arrayed even in actual or sup- r*v fi /z/ posed hostility . Tfiere is not , even under these circumatajices , a release from the law of love . The remarks of the apostle on this subject in the 13th of Romans are f kindred import . " Owe no man anything but to love one another ; for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law . For this , Thou shalt nor commit adultery , Thou  --  halt not kill , &c,; is briefly comprehended in this saying , namely , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . Love WOTeth no ill to his neighbor ; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Charity suffereth long and is kind ; icharity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ; doth not behave itself unseemly ; seeketh not her aufjL ; is not easily provoked ; thinketh no evil , Bearieth all thingSy believeth aU things hopeth all things , endureth all things . It must be admitted , that these pacific principles are but too little accordant with the common feelings and practice of mankind . If one maji reviles another , or takes his property , or injures him in his person , we may certainly expect to see decided indications of anger and retaliation . But are not such feelings and conduct in.consisteit with the passages , which have been quoted ? Is he , who returns anger for anger , smiting for smiting , blow for blow , justly to be regarded as imbued with the spirit of that heaven-born love , which seeketh not her own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil , suffereth long , beareth cdl things , hopeth all things , endureth all things ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words the spirit of war , for whatever object it may be carried on , is rebuked by those numerous passages , in which a peaceful deportment is commended , and in which the duties of peace are urged upon the early Christians . Let the reader observe carefully , and with a sincere desire to imbibe their true spirit , the expressions /q/ of our Savior in his Sermon on the Mount .  --   --  " Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . Blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit the earth . Blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy . Blessed are the peace-makers , for they fihall be called the children of God . "  --  " Have peace one with another , " Mark 9 : 50 . " But the fruit of the Spirit is lavty joyj peaUy long'Sufferingj gerUkness , goodnesSy faith , meeknessj temperance . " Galat. 5 : 22 , 23 . " Follow peace with all men , " Heb. 12:14 . " But the wisdom , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle and easy to be entreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy . And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace , " James 3 : 17 , 18 . " Finally , brethren , farewell . Be perfect , be of good comfort , be ol one mind , live in peace ; and the God ( rflove and peace shall be with you , " 2 Cor. 13 ; 11.  --  Now let it be considered what course we are to pursue , and what spirit we are required to cherish in these passages . We are to be poor in spirit , to be meek , merciful , peaceable , long-suffering , gentle , and easy to be entreated . And can we seriously and candidly reflect upon the real import of such expressions , without admitting that they are altogether at variance with that temper of mind , which would prompt to acts of violence and hostility even in what we might be disposed to consider sl just cause ! If we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these expressions , if he were described to us as a man of great hirniility and meekness of spirit , as a peace-maker , as merciful , gentle , and long-suffering , we certainly should receive the impression , that he would not be disposed to resort to acts of hostility , even if injurious and uncalled for attacks had been actually made upon him . It is to be noticed , in the third place , there is anoth- /z/ er olass of passages , in their import nearly identical , though opposite in expression from those which have just been brought forward , viz. those which reprove and condemn a spirit of contention and strife .  --  " Who will render to every man according to his deeds ; unto them that are eontentiousj &c.; tribulation and anguish , " Rom. 2 : 6  --  9 . " Let us walk honestly as in the day , not in rioting and drunkenness , not in chambering and wantonness , m Hrtfe and etivyitig ' , " Rom. 13 : 13 . " Let nothing be done through strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each esteem others better than themselves , " Philip , 2 : 3 . " But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , glory not , and be not against the truth . This wisdom descendeth not from above , but is earthly , Bensual , devilish . For where envying and strife is , there is confusion and every evil work , " James 3 : 14 , 16 , 16.  --  It may perhaps be said here , that in the act of selfdefence we may attack , smite , and injure another , and at the same time be under the influence of truly pacific and benevolent feelings , rather than those of a different /z/ character . We do not absolutely deny the possibility of this ; but we assert without hesitation that it is seldom the case . Writers on the philosophy of the mind , ( among others Mr. Stewart who is exceedingly cautious in the expression of his opinions , ) givesustoimderstand , that human nature is so constituted as to involve , as one of its fundamental laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there is anger within , there is naturally a correspondent expression in the gesture , vcrice , eye , countenance . And on the other hand any violent action , or violent and agitated exinression of the countenance naturally calls up an unpleasant and violent feeling within . So that if a person uses violence and enters into strife , on any occasion whatever , he may calculate upon it as something but little short /q/ of certainty , that he will have the spirit of strife . So that the direction , requiring us not to contend and strive , even when we are injured , is wonderfully adapted to the structure of the human mind , and undoubtedly operates to the good of the individual , on whom it seems at the first sight to impose a disadvantageous restriction . Under this head it is proper to observe , that in the New Testament we have some practical examples , some instances in real life , illustrating the manner , in which the Savior designed , that the peace-principles should be applied . On a certain time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Samaritans , but they refused to receive him . Luke 9 : 64 , 56 , " And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said . Lord , wilt thou , that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them , even as Elias did ? But he turned , and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner ofspirU ye are of . And again we have a practical illustration of the peace principles in Mat. 26 : 61 , 2 . " And behold one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest , and smote off his ear . Then said Jesus unto him , Pui up again thy eword into its place ; for all they thai take the eword , shall perish with the sujord . Fourthly .  --  Wars of every description are rebuked , discountenanced , and condemned by that numerous class of passages of Scripture , which enjoin forbearance and patience under the trials and suflerings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and return blow for blow , where is the propriety or pertinency of such passages as the following ; Luke 21 : 17  --  19 , " and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake . But there shall not an hair of your head perish . In your patience possess ye your Miib . " The Apostle Paul prayed to God for the Colossians , that they might be " strengthened with all might , /z/ according to his glorious power , unto all patience and long " suffering with joyfulness . Wliat can be more striking or pertinent to the matter in hand than the following explicit passage ; 1 Peter 2 : 19  --  2S , " For this is thank-worthy , if a man for conscience toward God endure grief , suflTering wrongfully . For what glory is it , if when ye be buffetted for your faults , ye shall take it piatiently ? But ij when ye do well and suffer for i7 , ye take it patiently this is acceptable with God . For even hereunto were you called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example , that ye should follow his steps ; who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth ; who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , he threatened not , but committed himself to him , that judgeth righteously . " It is not necessary to repeat other passages of the same import , nor do they require any comment .  --  Their spirit is too express and obvious to be mistaken . Fifth .  --  Those passages , which assert a change and renovation of our natures , obviously imply the subjection or eradication of those principles , which are of a hostile and retaliatory tendency .  --  2 Cor. 5 : 17 , " Therefore if any man be in Christ , he is a new creature ; old things are passed away ; behold , all things are become new . " It appears bbviously from the following passages , that one of the elements of the new life , one of the characteristics of the new creature just spoken of , is a quiet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For ye are yet carnal : for whereas there is among you envying , and strife , and division , are ye not carnal , and walk as men " ? Gal . 6 : 19  --  22 . " Now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these , adultery , &c,;  --  hatred , variance , emulation , wrath , strife , sedition , heresies , envyings , murders , drunkenness , revellings , and such like , of the which I tell you before , as I have told you in time past , that /z/ they , which do such things , shall not inherit the kingdom of God . But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , long-suffering , gentleness , goodness , faith . " James ' iv : 1 . " From whence come wars and fightings among you ? Come they not hence , even of your lusts that war in your own members ? " It is obvious from these passages and others like them , that the spirit of violence and strife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth , ) is an element of the old man , whom we are required to put off with his deeds ; and that a truly pacific disposition , is an element of the new man , an indispensable characteristic of a state of regeneracy . Let us , in the sixth place , set before us the example of our blessed Savior , and see what that will teach us We presume it is not necessary to go into details , in order to show what this example is . The Savior came into the world on an errand of mercy ; from his early childhood he went about doing good ; he every where , at all times and in all places , exhibited the most tender compassion and benevolence ; he healed the sick , unstopped the ears of the deaf , restored the sight of the blind , raised the dead ; when reviled , he reviled not again ; but in every situation , and under the greatest insults and injuries , he exhibited the most wonderful patience , meekness , and love . When hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he took no other measures of resistance or of retribution , but simply to escape from them . When the disciples were disposed to employ violent measures in his defence , he disapproved of the course they proposed to take . He told Peter to put up his sword into his sheath ; and healed the servant of the High Priest , whom that disciple had wounded . When Pilate reproached Him with being delivered up by the people and priests of his own nation , he answered in these remarkable and decisive words , /z/ which ought to be deeply engraven on every one 's memory , My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world J then would my servants fighty thai I should not be delivered to the Jews ; but now is my kingdom not from Amee . " Amid all the agonies of the garden and the Cross , he exhibited no disposition to complain against his enemies . His language was , ( in strict accordance with his own divine precepts , ) " Father , forgive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we are told , that Christ is set before us to be our example ; we are required to walk in his footsteps ; we are directed to consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession , who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , lest we be wearied and faint in our minds . And how a man , who truly takes Christ for his example , can engage in war of any kind whatever , is more than we can understand . It is impossible . Seventh .  --  If it is necessary to say anything further in order to convince the humble and candid inquirer of the unlawfulness and iniquity of all wars , we may introduce also , as still more decisive than those already brought forward , the numerous passages , which require forgiveness of injuries , and the love of our lemies.  - -  We request the particular attention of the reader to the three following passages . Coloss. 3 : 12 , IS.  --  " Put on , therefore , as the elect of God , holy and beloved , bowels of mercies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forbearing one another and forgiving one another , if any man have a quarrel against any : even as Christ forgave you , so also do ye . " Romans 12 : 19 , 20 , 21 , " Dearly beloved , avenge not yourselves , but rather give place imto wrath ; for it is written , vengeance is mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord . Therefore , if thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink ; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head . /z/ Be not overcome with evil , but overcome evil with good . " Matt. 6 : 88  --  46 . " Ye have heard that it hath been said , an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . But I say unto you , that ye resist not evil ; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also . And if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile , go with him twain . Give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee , turn not thou away . Ye have heard that it hath been said , thou shalt love thy neighbor , and hate thine enemy . But I say unto you , love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you . That ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven ; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .  --  For if ye love them that love you , what reward have ye ? " Eighth .  --  It might perhaps be objected to the numerous passages , which have been brought forward , that they do not directly condemn and forbid war , but only condenm and forbid those dispositions , which lead to war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have but little weight , when it is considered , that it is an obvious dictate of common sense , that , if the means , which are absolutely requisite to a particular end , are condemned and forbidden , the end itself is forbidden . Now we are required to be meek , patient , foiving , not to avenge ourselves , and to love our enemies ; and if these dispositions are obviously and absolutely inconsistent with war , as they undeniably are , then war is just as much forbidden , as if it were said so in the most express and the fewest terms possible . The objection has not the least weight . /z/ But this is not all . We may take the higher ground , that war is not only indirectly but directly forbidden . The express commands to love our enemies , not to avenge ourselves , when smitten on the one cheek to turn the other , and to recompense to no man evil for evil , are not on any fair construction of them , to be regarded as commands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct and positive prohibitions ; they lay the axe at the root ; they prohibit as decisively and positively , as any thing can , all acts of retaliation and violence . But there is one command more , which will perhaps come nearer to the popular notion of a direct and positive prohibition . It is . Thou shdli not kill . Something has already been said in relation to this conunandment ; but we shall take another occasion , in connection with capital pimishments , to remark more fully upon it . All we have to say now is , that this command was first given in the Tables of the Moral Law , and given too without limitation . It expresses the absolute inviolability of human life , subject only to the permission and control of the Supreme Being . That God , acting as the civil ruler of the Jews , subsequently gave permission to take life in certain cases , and to carry on war for certain pupposes , is not denied . But it will be recollected , that this command is reenacted and solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any exctpturn whatever . Mat. 5.21 , " Ye have heard , that it was said by them of old time . Thou shall not kill ; and whosor ever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment ; but I say unto you , that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment ; and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council ; but whosoever shall say . Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell-fire . " Now the exceptions in the Old Testament to the great command of the /q/ Decaloe , upon which we are remarking , are to be found in the political and civil code of the Jews . In resject to this code , no one doubts , that it was designed to be temporary . At the coming of Christ , so far as it was a matter of divine enactment and rested upon divine authority , it was wholly done away ; and the original law of Mount Sinai , after it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thou shalt not kill , therefore , is binding upon all since the time of Christ ; it is as obligatory upon the present , as upon any preceding generation ; and in vain do we look in the New Testament for any suspension of its action , or any mitigation of its import . Nor are these the only passages , which may be regarded as express prohibitions . " Since the time , ( says the learned Erasmus , ) that Jesus Christ said . Put up thy sword into its scabbard . Christians ought not to go to kot . Christ suffered Peter to fall into an error in this matter , on purpose that when he had put up Peter 's sword , it might remain no longer a doubt , that war was prohihittd. ' ** Nor is this all . The saying of the Savior to Pilate , that , if my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants fight , is equivalent to saying , that my servants do not fight , because my kingdom is not a worldly kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely an indirect prohibition of war . qwq peace with your own countrymen , but may fight with a foreigner ; that you must be at peace with your friend , but may kill your enemy . No such thing as this . But you must follow peace with all men . You are not at liberty to make distinctions and to say , I will be at peace /z/ with one man , and will contend with another ; the command is as wide as the world ; it embraces all classes of men ; it requires us to be at peace with all without any exception whatever . But furthermore , there is something peculiar in this precept , as it stands in the original . The Greek verb is diokete . It is the same , that is used by the Apostle Paul , where he speaks of jprcmng towards the mark . It expresses , not only the doing of a thing , but doing it with zeal , with energy , with the whole power of heart and intellect . The expression is one , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charioteers of the great Grecian games . What earnestness there is in their countenance ! How every nerve and muscle is urged to the highest exercise ! How they bend forward as upon the wings of the wind ! Life itself is nothing in comparison with the object before them . It is in this manner we are required to practise peace ; not to submit to it merely as a burden to be borne , but to seek it as an object of the greatest love ; not to abandon it , because it will sometimes cost us inconvenience and expense , but to pursue it at every outlay of exertion and at every hazard of life . The charioteers of Greece would joyfully have died , rather than have lost their object ; and so we must die , lose any thing and every thing , rather than lose the triumphal crown of peace . Finally In addition to what has been said , we shall j5nd a further and powerful argument in support of the doctrine , that all wars are prohibited by the precepts and spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prayer is a duty which our natural reason tells us we owe to the Supreme Being , and which we should be bound to perform , even if we were destitute of Revelation . But in the Scriptures it is constantly enforced upon us ; we are required by the word of God to pray al- THE PRINCIPLES OF THE GOBPEL . Ill ways ; to perform all our intelligent and moral acts in the spirit of supplication . And we do not hesitate in the remark , that to an enlightened and conscientious Christian prayer may be made one of the most certain tests of the rectitude of the course , which he proposes to take . If such a person can not pray over what he propeses to do , if he can not ask God 's blessing upon it , he may safely come to the conclusion , that there is something wrong in it . And it may be asked , therefore , with great emphasis and great meaning , what sort of a prayer could a soldier offer , when going into battle ? We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offered , not in the spirit of the light of nature , perhaps we may say not in the spirit even of the Old Testament , but in the spirit of the Gospel . And what spirit doea the Gospel require us to exercise towards others , even those whom we correctly regard as our enemies ? We have already seen . " Love your enemies . Do good to them which hate you . Bless them that curse you , and pray for them , which despitefully use you . And ye shall be the children of the Highest ; for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evU . Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father is merciful . Dearly beloved , avenge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath , for it is written , Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord . Therefore , if thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink . Be not overcome with evil , but overcome evil with good . " God commands the soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who hate him , to love his enemies , to be merciful , not to avenge ; but , in compliance with that gre &t; requisition , which is also binding upon him as well 88 upon others , to pray , and to ask God 's blessing on all we do , he asks , ( or rather he hypocritically professes to ask , ) the divine blessing in smiting , piercing , maiming , /z/ Btriking to the earth , and sending into eternity those , whom he is expressly required to love , to feed , and to pray for . Can such a prayer be accepted ? Can it be oflTered with the least sincerity by one , who has any correct understanding of the New Testament ? Will it not freeze and wither upon his lips ? It is not long since , that we were looking over the life of the celebrated Suwarrow ; and our attention was attracted by certain directions to soldiers , commonly known as Suwarrows Catechism , It would be well for the advocates of war to compare this celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian armies , with the Savior 's Sermon on the Mount . What the sermon on the Mount is , every one knows ; it breathes nothing but meekness , peace , and love . But what says the Catechism of Suwarrow ? " Push hard with the bayonet . The ball will lose its way ; the bayonet never . The ball is a fool ; the bayonet a hero . Stabb once ! And off with the Turk from the bayonet ! stabb the second ! stabb the third ! A hero will stabb half a dozen ! If three attack you , stabb the first , fire on the second , and bayonet the third ! " This is the spirit of war . These are the directions of a great warrior . And now we ask again , can the spirit of humble , penitent , and benevdient supplication exist in connection with such a temper of mind as is indicated here ? In view of the considerations and the passages of Scripture , which have been brought forward in this Chapter , we put the serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether as believers in that new and glorious Gospel which he came to announce , we are not to regard all wars as entirely prohibited , and as utterly wrong and sinful ? We are aware it is easy to cavil ; it is easy to make objections , where the path is as clear as meridian day ; but we address ourselves now to THE PRINaPLES OF THE GOSPEL . 1 13 those , who truly take the Grospel for their guide , and who , with a humble and prayerful spirit , are willing to go , wherever it may lead . We have no doubt what answer they will give . Let them , then , speedily awake on this momentous subject . We fear that Christians have been sadly blinded , not only on the subject of war in general , but in respect to all acts of retaliation and violence . We entreat them to pause as one man , to take the Bible into their hands , ( particularly the exalted and completed Revelation of the New Testament , ) and examining it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they have been going , and what they have been doing . /z/ In the last chapter it was made to appear by a reference to the New Testament , that wars of every description are unlawful . We are aware , however , that some few things may be said , not altogether destitute of plausibility , by way of objection to what has been adduced . In the first place , it is objected , that the precepts of the New Testament are of individual , and not of national application ; that they relate to men , in their private and not in their social and corporate capacity .  --  We need not be at a loss for an answer , ( and what we conceive to be an ample and satisfactory answer , ) to this objection . /z/ The answer is to be found in the arrangements and methods of reasoning , adopted in those Treatises , which especially relate to the duties and intercourse ol nations . In all complete Treatises on the Law of Nations , we find the distinction , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in others , ) into the Natural and Conventional Law . The natural law of nations is that portion of the Law of Nations , which is founded in nature ; by which is universally understood to be meant , that it is founded in the constitution or nature of man . In other words , the whole reasoning , running through this portion of the Law of Nations , is based upon this single principle , that , as nations are composed of individuals , whatever is right or wrong in individuals , is also right or wrong in nations , acting under similar circumstances . The natural reason and conscience of man , judging as to what is right or wrong in his own individual conduct , is the standard , which the writer on this portion of the Law of Nations constantly refers to , in attempting to prescribe the path of international action . But since the introduction of the Gospel , men are placed under a new dispensation , superadded to , and far above that of mere unaided nature . If there are some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are forbidden by the Gospel , no one can doubt , that their conduct in their individual capacity is now to be regulated , not by the permission of nature , but by the prohibition of Revelation . They are now placed on a higher position ; not only more elevated than that formerly occupied by them , but enveloped in light ; they are under a new law infinitely transcending any , of which the unai* ded human intellect is the source . Now what we claim is , the right to reason and to apply principles of action , in the same way in which writers on the Law of Nations have always reasoned and /q/ applied principles of action . They have reasoned from individuals to nations , and have applied to nations principles of action , which they claimed to be just and obligatory in the case of individuals . But if the law of individuals is altered , if God has seen fit to impart a light additional to the light of nature , thereby developing and requiring a course of conduct beyond and above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only what has hitherto been done , and reason as men have hitherto reasoned , when we extend these higher principles of action , which are now acknowledged to be binding upon individuals , to those communities and nations , which these individuals have formed by associating with each other . In other words , if the principles of the Gospel are binding upon men in their individual , they are also binding upon them in their social capacity . Secondly .  --  The following passage of scripture , uttered by the Savior himself , is to be regarded in the opinion of the opposers of the non-resistance doctrine , as authorizing war .  --  Luke 22 : 36 . ' ' Then said he unto them , But , now , he , that hath a pvirse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip ; and Ae , that hath no stoordy kt him sell his garment and buy one . " In regard to this passage we admit , that , if its import were not qualified by what took place and was said at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the practice of war . It appears from what is said in the connection , that the Savior meant this saying , and that he was understood by his disciples to mean it , as a direction for inmiediate action ; as a requisition to array themselves against the onset of some danger near at hand . Accordingly they answered him , and said , " Behold , here are two swords . " And what was the answer of the Savior " And he said wUo Ifcetn , it ii enotigA . " Now it is to be noticed , that there wer eleven persons present besides ' Jesus ; and they /z/ were directed , as they understood his words , to prepare for immediate warlike action . And what then could they make of his remark , that , when the danger was obviously urgent and there were eleven men prepared to meet it , two swords were enough . Does this look like serious military preparation ? Must not the disciples have considered the Savior a singular commander , who certainly meant to carry on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current in the world ? In a word , does not the remark of the Savior , that two swords were enough , of itself intimate to us , that he required his disciples to get swords , in order to give them , and with no other object whatever , a living , practical , and visible illustration of the use , which his followers must make of their military arms , whenever they might happen to have them in possession ? Soon afterwards a great multitude came out against the Savior with swords and staves ; and Peter in the heat of his military zeal made an attack upon the opposing party , and wounded the servant of the high priest . The Saviour undoubtedly foresaw this result of his direction to his disciples to obtain swords , and he permitted it in order that he might on the spot , and in the midst of bloodshed , the more strikingly and emphatically express to his disciples and to the world his abhorrence of all resort to violence ; and that he most seriously intended , that the pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into practical effect , even under the most trying circumstances . Mark his language to Peter , as we find it recorded in the different evangelists , when he saw him using violence against the servant of the high priest . And Jesus answered and said , " suffer ye thus far ? Put lip thy sword into the sheath ; the cup which luy Father hath given to me , shall I not drink it ? All they , which take the sword , shall perish by the sword . And /q/ he touched his ear of the wounded servant and healed him . "  --  We will not delay longer upon the passage , which has given occasion to these remarks . Certain it is , if we take it in connection with what follows , it affords no encouragement to acts of violence . If it may seem to authorize us to purchase a sword , the remarks subsequently made by the Savior evidently require us to keep it in the sheath , or at least not to use it for belligerent purposes . Thirdly.  --  It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to engage in war of any kind , that John the Baptist did not condemn the employment of the soldiers who asked of him what they should do , but merely required of them a more upright and circumspect course of life in the discharge of the duties of that employment . Luke 3 : 14 , " And the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , and what shall we do ? And he said unto them . Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages . " In reply to this objection we may remark , among other things , that the authority of John the Baptist , who at most had but a dim and imperfect conception of the purity and exalted nature of that dispensation of which he was the forerunner , is of no account , when placed in opposition with the precepts of Christ . We are fully justified in this remark by what the Savior himself says of John the Baptist , Matt. 11 : 11 , " he , that is least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " John the Baptist belonged , in many respects at least , to the preceding state of things ; his moral system , although some glimmerings rf the rising light broke in upon his mind , was that of the law ; he spoke in the awful and denunciatory tone of the Prophets , rather than in the forgiving and benignant utterance of the Gospel . And if it be true , that his directions to the soldiers seem to recognize their calling /z/ as a lawful one , we must still regard them as among those things which have now passed away . And furthermore , have we not a right to lay some stress upon those remarkable expressions , ( remarkable certainly when addressed to soldiers , ) do violence to no man . Does it not seem , ( at least we will hazard the conjecture , ) as if his mind was suspended and oscillating between the spirit of the two systems ; that to which he himself belonged and which he knew was passing away , and that , which was in the dim distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are some mystical and shadowy announcements , made clear not by what goes before , but by what comes after , both in the Old and New Testament , ( and perhaps this is one of them , ) where , as Milton says of certain sage and solemn poets of allegory , " more is meant than meets the ear . " Who is prepared to say , that these expressions were not designed to be the shadowy anticipators and forerunners of that great announcement of the Savior , My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world , then toould my servants fight ; but now is my kingdom not from hence ? Fourthly .  --  The following passage in the 13th of Romans , where the apostle is speaking of the duty of obedience to rulers , is often brought up , in opposition to the doctrine of non-resistance . " For he is the minister of God to thee for good . But if thou do that which is evil , be afraid ; for he beareth not the sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil . "  --  The reader is requested , if he wishes to have a right understanding of this passage , to read carefully this whole chapter , taken in connection with the latter part of the 12th chapter . If he will do this , he will find that this exceedingly interesting portion of scripture teaches something very different from a /z/ spirit of strife and contention . The leading ideas contained in it are evidently these ; ( 1 ) We are to exercise love and forgiveness towards all men , and under all circumstances , whatever their conduct maybe towards us ; ( 2 ) In the exercise of this spirit of love and forgiveness , it is incumbent upon Christians to render entire submission to the civil and political administration of the country where they reside .  --  Now when we consider , that the primitive Christians lived , in many instances at least , under administrations of government , which were exceedingly unjust , perverse , and cruel , the explicit and urgent directions , contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedient to those in authority , must be regarded as anything rather than contentious and belligerent . Such directions are obviously the natural and true result of those doctrines of love and peace , which the Savior himself had so earnestly inculcated . If any people in the world ever had occasion for complaint against those in authority , and strong motives for resistance to them , it was the primitive Christians at certain periods and in certain countries ; but they were required not to resist , not to return evil for evil , to endure every indignity and suffering even to death itself , rather than lift the hand against the civil rulers . It is in connection with the announcement of the duty of unreserved submission to rulers , that the magistrate is spoken of as being the minister of God , and as not " bearing the sword in vain . " These last expressions are obviously figurative , and convey the simple fact and nothing more , that the magistrates were both able , and had the disposition to enforce the civil and criminal jurisdiction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably in ninety nine out of an hundred , the sword was not used as an instrument of punishment ; which of itself , independently of the obvious spirit of the whole passage , requires us /z/ to understand the words in question in a general sense , and as expressive , not of a particular mode of punishment , viz. by the sword , but of the mere general fact of the efficiency of the established civil and criminal jurisdiction .  --  That jurisdiction was not to be trifted with ; the laws of the land were to be conformed to ; civil society in its great outlines was to be maintained ; it existed with the approbation of God ; its authority was to be scrupulously obeyed by Christians , not because that authority was exercised in all respects as it ought to be , but because resistance on the part of Christians , when the magistrate was armed with the sword or had power to enforce it , necessarily implied violence , which was inconsistent with Christian principles . Fifth .  --  It may be objected further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command , thou shalt not kill , is repeated and enforced , the Greek verb phoneuo does not express the mere fact of putting men to death , and that only ; but conveys the additional idea of premeditated and criminal homicide . But the truth is , that this term is used in both ways ; sometimes to express the mere feet of putting to death without any additional intimation ; and sometimes the putting to death in that particular way , which constitutes the crime of murder . Schleusner , who may be regarded as good authority on such a subject , expressly applies it , not only to the person who is guilty of murder or criminal homidde , but to one , who is the cause of death in any manner whatever , auctor mortis alicujus quocunque modo . " In this latter sense ' it is used frequently in the Septuagint . See Nrunb. 35 : 6 , 11 , 12 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 30 , Deut. 4 : 42. 5 : 17 , 19 : 6 , Joshua 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 21 : 13 , 21 , 27 , 32 , 38 , sepond Chron. 25 : 3 , Ps. 62 : 3 , Prov. 22 : 13 . Biblical scholars , who are familiar with the characteristics of the Greek of the New Testament , will understand the pK priety of this reference to the Septuagint. /z/ Bat the passage in the 5th of Matthew , which has been particularly referred to , is in strictness to be regarded as a mere translation of the 6th Commandment ; and any question in respect to this passage is to be determined by a reference to the Hebrew verb used in that Commandment . The remark , already made in respect to the Greek verb phoneuo , will apply equally well to the Hebrew verb ratzah , which is there used ; viz , that it sometimes means to kill , in the general and unlimited sense of taking life , and sometimes to murder . In proof of the meaning first mentioned , we may properly refer among other passages to Prov. 22 : IS . The slothftd man saith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets . " Here the Hebrew verb ratzah is used in the passive form . But this certainly , the death occasioned by a lion , can not be regarded as a case of criminal homi- cMe , but of mere extinction of life . Numb . S5 : 80 , " Whosoever killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death . " The word murderer and the phrase put TO DEATH are the same words in the original , both being only different forms of the Hebrew verb in question ; the first expressing criminal homicide , the second putting to death without guilt .  --  See also Numb . 35 : 11 , 12 , 19 , 21 , 25 , 26 , 27 , Deut. 4 : 42 , 19:6 , Joshua 20 : 5 , 6 , 21 : ISy &c.-;  --  Both terms , therefore , the Greek phoneuo and the Hebrew ratzah mean primarily to kill , although they not unfrequently mean to murder , or to kill with evil intention . And it seems proper to use them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection whidi satisfactorily indicates , that they are to be employ6d in the more limited one . Sixth .  --  There is one other passage , which requires to be noticed . Rev. 13 : 10 , ' fTe , that kadeth into captivUiff Aall go into captivity ; he , that killeth by the sword j mtui be IfUed byf the sword . Here is the patience and the faitk of /z/ Mtin ( i . " In order to understand this passage , we must look at the connection . The author of the Apocalyptic vision saw the symbolic representation of one of the most dreadful persecutions , which Christians were ever called to endure . The idolaters of the Roman empire were permitted to make war " with the saints and to overcome them . " And profane history relates , with what cruelty they prosecuted their victory , and what indescribable sufferings were inflicted upon those , who bore the blessed name of the Savior . It is in this connection , that the attention of the whole Christian world is particularly requested by that impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book of Revelation , when any thing of importance is to be announced , viz , " If any man have an ear , let him hear . " Then follow the words , to which we are attending , " He , that leadeth into captivity , " &c.; And what is the objtict of this announcement thus solemnly mad i It was to let christians know , that , amid all their unspeakable sorrows , their God had not forgotten them ; that the day of retribution would surely come ; that those , who now so cruelly wasted them with the sword and the chain , would , under the administration of God 's righteous Providence , be doomed in their own turn to suffer the miseries , which they were now so cruelly inflicting on the innocent followers of Jesus Christ . This interpretation seems to be rendered clear by the concluding pieuragraph , viz. " here is the patience and the faith of the saints. ? ' The word , which is rendered Acre , will bear the interpretation herein or on this account ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say , in consequence of the announcement , that the sword and captivity will ultimately in God 's righteous Providence overtake their unholy persecutors , the saints are to continue to exercise faith and patience . And by implication the passage evidently /z/ quires them not to resist their enemies , but to submit quietly and meekly to the dreadful inflictions , to which they were subject , trusting all their troubles into the hands of God , as their great and ultimate avenger . In other words , their faith and patience are based and stand firm in this , viz , there is a just God and a day of retribution coming upon their enemies . In other words , " Avenge not yourselves ; vengeance is mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord . " The foregoing are the prominent objections , so far as we have been able to learn , which have been brought forward , in opposition to the Christian doctrine of the unlawfulness of all war . It is true there are some others , but they are so obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cause they are introduced to support .  --  For instance , it is said , that Fsol , when certain Jews laid in wait for him to take away his life , accepted , ( or as Grotius has it , ) " did not refuse " the protection of a body of soldiers , and did not state to the Tribune and soldiers , that the bearing of arms was displeasing to God , which he ought in good conscience to have done , if he believed it to be so .  --  Upon this shadow of an argument , it is enough merely to say , that it was not in the option of Paul either to refuse or not to refuse . He was in close custody , as an accused person ; and far from being in a situation to prescribe terms of action or forbearance of action to such civil and military rulers as the Romans . He well knew , that he had nothing to do but to submit , and to submit quietly , which was in accordance with his own doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that it was undoubtedly his duty to preach peace , love , forbearance , and forgiveness on all suitable occasions ; and there is no evidence that he neglected to do so on the occasion now referred to ; on the contrary it is rather 124 oBJEtrnoNs drawn from pnobable , if it is worth while to offer mere conjectures and guesses in this matter , that , as he himself was in his own person the subject of unjust detention and violence , he took the opportunity to impress on his attendants the cruelty and unlawfulness of their warlike calling . Again , it is said , that the Centiu*ion in the 10th chap , of Acts , who is so favorably spoken of for his prayers and alms , was baptized and was recognized as a Christian , without being required to lay aside his military It will be noticed , that this argument , if such it may be called , is based , like the preceding , not upon any thing poritwely done or said ; not upon any precept or injunction expressly given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of testimony . Such an argument may have just as much weight , or as little weight as any one - chooses to give it , since it is in its very nature wholly conjectural . Whether the apostle Peter , who was 00 person commissioned to instruct the Centurion in the principles of the Christian religion , did , or did not attempt to explain to him the inconsistency of the practice of war with those principles , canot now ' be known . It is probable , that the Centurion was amply instructed in respect to the pacific natiu*e of the Gospel ; that it implied iinspeakable love in its Author and required perfect love in those who adopt it ; and if he was left to make the practical application of these instructions to his particular situation and calling , it was certainly nobody 's fault bat his own , if he lived any longer a soldier . We now leave the subject , so far as it depends on the doctrines of the New Testament , to the candid concaderation of the reader . As the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ultimately upon the Gospel , we ask him to examine it in the $pinl ofth$ Gospel Let him subdue the elements of war in his own bosom ; let him discipline his wayward heart to the /q/ high doctrine of perfect love ; and then , in the spirit of deepT humility and fervent prayer , let him take up the New Testament , and see how much warrant he will find for the shedding of human blood ! How much authority he will discover for that course of hostility , violence , and revenge , which have made this fair world one great Aceldama , one vast and horrid place of execution , a reeking and smoking slaughter-house . We doubt not , that the time will sooner or later come , when there will be but one opinion on this all-important subject . And shall Christians any longer delay the investigation of it ! Shall they sit supinely in their easy chairs , or walk softly and mincingly to their pulpits , and dream pleasant dreams , and utter soft sayings as when one playeth on a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the garments of their brethren are still rolled in blood ! Let them pause and consider ! The Gospel has an impress of its own ; it is a distinct entity , a grand and effective fact in the administration of the universe ; it has its own character and relations ; and is not , as some would seem to imagine , a mere Metempsychosis of heathenism , ushering itself into the world under the patronage of a new and lovely name . /z/ We hold the argument from the New Testament to be entirely satisfactory and conclusive in itself . We maintain , that it stands , unshakenly immovable on its own basis , without depending on collateral and adventitious aid . But still we are not at liberty to reject such aid ; but are to avail ourselves of every incidental circumstance , which may tend to communicate light and strength . The minds of different individuals are in some respects differently constituted . And in the conflict of argument , a single circumstance , ( perhaps a slight and unimportant one in itself , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without that particulajr view of the subject , would never have arrived at it . Hence before quitting the subject , we are led to suggest another consideration . We naturally inquire , how did the Primitive Christians understand the subject ? What was the impression of those , who stood nearest to the tunes of Christ , as to what was expected of his followers ? Did they , with the example of the Savior and of the first disciples and Apostles so directly before them , feel at liberty to gird on the sword and to engage in the dreadful business of shedding human blood ? If they did not , then the conclusion at which we have arrived , unanswerably strong as it is in itself , receives new strength . /z/ and we are encouraged to act upon it with the greater confidence . The statements , which follow , are taken from Clarkson 's Essay on the Doctrines and Practice of the early ( iristians as they relate to War . They conclusively show , that the early Christians generally considered war te unlawful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there are some expressions in Tertullian and Eusebius , that escaped the notice of Clarkson , which seem to indicate , that , about the year 174 , there were some Christian soldiers in the Roman army . But such instances were exceptions to the general rule . Tfhey sWom occurred ; and for the first century and a haH* at least , we may undoubtedly pronounce the Christian Church as a body , although there were some exceptions , clear of the unspeakable sin of slaughtering their fellow men in war . The extract which follows relates to two distinct points , viz , the Opinions or Doctrines of the early Christian writers on the subject of war , and the Priactice of those who became Christians . First .  --  " With respect to the Opinions of the first Christian Writers after the Apostles , or of those who are usually called the Fathers of the Church , relative to War , I believe we shall find them alike for nearly three hundred years , if not for a longer period . Justin the Martyr , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war as unlawful . He makllis , also , the devil the aur thor ofaUwar . Tatian , who was the disciple of Justin , in his oration to the Oreeks , speaks in the same terms on the same subject . From the different expressions of Clemens , of Alexandria , a contemporary of the latter , we collect his opinion to be decisive also against the lawfulness of war . Tertullian , who may be mentioned next in order of /z/ qwq more enormous the size of the wickedness is , so dtoicb the greater is the chance of impunity. " * - These are the sentiments of Crian ; and that they were the result of his views of Christianity , as taken from the divine writings , there can be no doubt . If he had stood upon the same eminence , and beheld the same flights , previously to his conversion , he would , like - en have neither thosight pira'cy dishonorable , nor war iigloriou9. - , ' Lactantius , who lived some time after Cyprian , in his Treajtis concerning the true worship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a righteous man to go to war , whose warfare is in righteousness itself . " To these may be adcled Archelaus , Ambrose , Chrysostom , Jerom , and Cyril , all of whom were of opinion , that it was unlawful for Christians to go to war . Second .  --  With respect to the Practice of the early Christians , which is the next point to be considered , it may be observed , that there is no well authenticated instance upon record of Christians entering into the army for nearly the two first centuries ; but it is true , on the other hand , that they had declined the military profession , as one in which it was not lawful for thfn to engage . The first species of evidence to this point may be found in the following facts , which reach from about the year 170 , to about the year 195 . Cassius had rebelled . against the Emperor Yerus , and was slain in a short time afterwards . Clodius Albinus in one paii ; of the world , and Pescennios Niger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both were slain . Now suspicion fell , as it always did . in these times , if any thing went wrong , upon the Christians , as having been concerned upon these occasions . But Tertullian tells us , in /z/ 13 ( y TESTIMONY AND PRACTICE his * ' Discourse to Scapula , " that this suspicion was totally groundless . " You defamed us , " ( Christians ) says he , " by charging us with having been guilty of treason to our emperors , but not a Christian could be found in any of the rebel armies , whether commanded by Cassius , Albinus , or Niger . " These , then , " are important facts , for the armies in question were very extensive . Cassius was master of all Syria with its four Legions ; Nigef , of the Asiatic and Egyptian Legions ; and Albinus , of those of Britain ; which Legions together contained between a third and a half of the standing Legions of* Rome : a ! hd the circumstance , that no Christian was to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the same Tertullian , Christianity had then spread over almost the whole of the known world . A second species of evidence may be collected ffbHo , expressions and declaration in the works of certain authors of those times . Justin the Martyr , and Tatian , make distinctions between soldiers and Christians ; and Clemens , of Alexandria , gives the Christians , who were contemporary with him , the appellation of the " Peaceor Ale , " thus distinguishing them from others of the world ; and he says expressly , that the " Peaceable " never used sword or bow , meaning by these the instruments of war . A third species of evidence , may be found in the belief , which the writers of these times had , that the Prophecy of Isaiah , which predicted that men should turn their swords into plough-shares and their spears into . pruning-hooks , was then in the act of completion . Irenffius , who flourished about the year 180 , affirms that this famous Prophecy had been completed in hirf* time ; ' * for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords and their lances into instruments of peace , and they kmw not haw to fight . Justin the Martyr , who vroM contemporary with Irenseus , asserts the same thing . /z/ which he could not have done , if the Christians in his time had engaged in war . " That the Prophecy , " s'liys he , " is fulfilled , you have good reason to believe ; for tre , ' teAo tift times past killed one another j do not now fight with our enemies . And here it is observable , that the Greek word " to " does not mean to strike , or to beat , or to give a blow , " but actually to fight as in war ; and the Greek word " enemy , " does not mean a private adversary , or one who has injured us , but an enemy of the State ; and the sentence , which follows that which has been given , puts the matter out of fidl doubt . Tertullian , who lived after both , speaks in these remarkable words  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into plough-shares ) are the things prophesied of , when you see what you see , or that they are the things fulfilled when you read what you read ; but if you deny neither of these positions , then you must confess that the Prophecy has been accomplished , as far as the practice of every individusd is concerned , to whom it is applicable . " We might go from Tertullian even as far as Theodoret , if it were necessary , to shew that the Prophecy in question was considered as in the act of completion in those times . The fourth and last species of evidence may be found in the assertions of Celsus , and in the reply of Origen to that writer . Celsus , who lived at the end of the second century , attacked the Christian Religion . He made it one of his charges against the Christians , that they revised in his times to bear arms for the Emperor , even in the case of necessity , and when their services would have been accepted . He told them further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , it would soon be overrun by the Barbarians . Now Celsus dared not have brought this charge against the Christians , if the fact had not been publicly known . But let us see whether it was denied by those who were of opinion that his . /z/ work demanded a reply . The person , who wrote against him in favour of Christianity , was Origen , who lived in the third century . But Origen , in his answer , admits the facts as stated by Celsus , that the Christians WDuId not bear arms in his time , and justifies them for refusing the practice on the principle of the unlawfulness of war . And as the early Christians would not enter into the armies , so there is good ground to suppose that , when they became converted there , they relinquished their profession . We find from Tertullian , in his ' Soldier 's Garland , " that many in his time , immediately on their conversion to Christianity , quitted the military service . We are told , also , by Archelaus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Roman soldiers , who had embraced Christianity after having witnessed the piety and generosity of Marcellus , immediately forsook the profession of arms . We are told , also , by Eusebius , that about the same time numbers laid aside a military life , and became private persons rather than abjure their religion . " Here then is a collection of evidence and facts , all tending to show , that for nearly the first two hundred years after the introduction of Christianity into the world , none of those , who professed to be Christians , would either take upon themselves , or continue the profession of soldiers . " Mr. Clarkson then considers an objection , which will be likely to be made , viz , that the military oath , which the Roman soldiers were required to take , was full of Idolatry ; that the Roman standards were considered as gods , and had divine honours paid to them ; and that the Christians of that time refused to serve as soldiers , not because they objected to war in itself , but because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits , that there is some weight in this obj t ) F THE FRnffmrE CHRIErnANS 133 tion ; he does not deny , that the idolatrous customs and tests of the Roman armies operated to the exdusion of Christians ; but he very properly maintains , that this was not the only cause of their exclusion , and goes on stiU more fully to show that a leading cause was the belief of Christians in the unlawfulness of war in He remarks as follows .  --  " Every Christian writer cf the second century , who notices the subject , makes it unlawful for Christians to bear arms . And as this belief seems to have been universal , so it operated as an impediment to a military life , quite as much as the idolatry that was connected with it , of which the following instances , taken by way of illustration , though at somewhat different periods , may suffice . The first I propose to mention shall be , where there was an objection to entering into the military service upon this very principle . Maximilian having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Soldier , Dion , the Proconsul , asked him his name . Maximilian , turning to him , replied , " Why wouldst thou know my name I am a Christian and can not fight . " Then Dion ordered him to be enrolled , and when he was enrolled , it was recited out of the Register , that he was five feet ten inches high . Immediately after this , Dion bade the officer mark him . But Maximilian refused to be marked , still asserting that he was a Christian ; upon whi Dion instantly replied , " Bear arms , or thou shalt die . " To this Maximilian answered , " I can not fight , if I die ; I am not a soldier of this world , but a soldier of God . " Dion then said , " Who has persuaded thee to behave Aus ? ** Maximilian answered , ' My own mind , and he who called me . " Dion then spoke to his father , and bade him persuade his son . But his father observed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was best for him to do . After this had passed , Dion addressed Maximilian , again in these words , " Take thy arms , and receive the mark . " " I can receive , " says Maximilian , " no such mark . I have already the mark of Christ ; " upon which Dion said , " I will send thee quickly to thy Christ : " " Thou mayest do so , " says Maximilian ; " but the glory will be mine . " Dion then bade the officer mark him . But Maximilian still persisted in refusing ; and spoke thus : " I can not receive the mark of this world , and if thou shouldst give me the mark , I will destroy it . It will avail nothing . I am a Christian , and it is not lawful for me to wear such a mark about my neck , when I have received the saving mark of the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the living God , whom thou knowest not , who died to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Him all we Christians obey .  --  Him we follow , as the Restorer of our life , and the Author of our salvation . " Dion instantly replied to this , " Take thy arms , and receive the mark , or thou shalt suffer a miserable death . "  --  " But I shall not perish , " says Maximilian , " my name is already enrolled with Christ ,  --  I can not fight . " Dion said , " Consider then thy youth , and bear arms . The profession of arms becomes a young man . " Maximilian replied , " My arms are with the Lord . I can not fight for any earthly consideration . I am now a Christian " . Dion , the Proconsul , said , " Among the Life Guards of our masters , Dioclesian and Maximilian , and Constantius and Maximus , there are christian soldiers , and they fight . " Maximilian answered , " They know best what is expedient for them ; but I am a Christian , and it is unlawful to do evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despise not the profession of a soldier , lest thou perish miserably . "  --  " But I shall not perish , " says Maximilian ; " and if I should leave this worlds my soul will live with Christ the Lord . " Dion then ordered his name to be struck from the roll ; and , when this was done , he proceeded , " Because out of thy rebellious spirit , thou hast refused to bear arms , thou shalt be punished according to thy deserts , for an example to others ; " and then he delivered the following sentence : " Maximilian ! because thou hast , with a rebellious spirit , refused to bear arms , thou art to die by the sword . "  --  Maximilian replied , " Thanks be to God . " He was twenty years , three months , and seventeen days old ; and , when he was led to the place of execution , he spoke thus :  --  " My dear brethren , endeavor with all your might , that it may be your portion to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Crown ; " and then , with a pleasant countenance , he said to his father , " Give the executioner the soldier 's coat that thou hast gotten for me ; and , when I shall receive thee in the company of the blessed martyrs , we may rejoice together with the Lord . " After this he suffered . His mother , Pompeiana , obtained his body from the judge , and conveyed it to Carthage , and buried it near the place where the body of . Cyprian the martyr lay . And thirteen days after this his mother died , and was biu-ied in the same place . And Victor , his father , returned to his habitation , rejoicing and praising God , that he had sent before such a gift to the Lord , himself expecting to follow after . We shall only observe upon this instance , that it is nearly pure and unmixed , or that it is but little connected with idolatrous circumstances ; or rather , that the unlawfulness of fighting was principally urged by Maximilian as a reason against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a case , where , when a person waa converted in the army , he left it , pleading this principle again , as one among others , for his dereliction of it . Marcellus was a centurion in the Legion called Trajana . On a festival , given in honor of the birth-day of Galerius , he threw down his military belt at the head of the Legion , and , in the face of the standards , declared with a loud voice , that he would no longer serve in the army ; for that he had become a Christian . I hold in detestation , " says he , addressing himself to all the soldiers , *'the worship of your gods ; gods , which are made of wood and stone ; gods which are deaf and dumb . " So far Marcellus , it appears , seems to have been influenced in his desertion of a military life by the Idolatry connected with it . But let us hear him further on this subject  - -  * It is not lawful , " says he , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord , to bear arms for any earthly consideration . " After a delay of more than three months in prison after this transaction , which delay was allowed to the purpose of sparing him , he was brought before the Prefect . There he had an opportunity of correcting his former expressions . But , as he persisted in the same sentiments , he suffered . It is remarkable that , almost immediately after his execution , Casaian , who was the notary to the same Legion , refused to serve any longer , by publicly throwing his pen and acccHnptbook on the ground , and declaring , at the same time , that the sentence of Marcellus was unjust . When taken up by the order of Aurelianus Agricolanus , he is described by the record preserved by Ruinart , to have avowed the same sentiments as Marcellus ; and like him to have suffered death . Let us now find a case where a converted Soldier left the army , pleading the same principle . Martin , of whom Sulpicius Severus says so much , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conversion to Christianity , declined it . In the answer , which he gave to Julian the Apostate for his conduct on this occasion , we find him making use of these words , " I am a Christian , and therefore I can not fight . " And here it may be observed , that though the noble Martyrs now mentioned , grounded their apology for declining the military service , some on account of the idolatry which belonged to it , and others of the unlawfulness of fighting ; yet that , which was more usually set up by them , when they were brought before the tribunals , was comprehended in the simple declaration , that , having now become Christians , they could be no longer Soldiers . Let us quote the instance of Tarachus , another military man and martyr , and let this serve for all . Tarachus underwent his examination at Tarsus in Cilicia . Numerianus Maximus sat as the President on the judgment-seat . " What is your name ? " says Maximus . " I am called Tarachus ( says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Victor . " The President goes on : " And what is your condition ? " The prisoner replies , " I have led a military life , and am a Roman . I was born at Claudiopolis , a city of Isauria , and , because I am a Christian , I have abandoned my profession of a Soldier . " Such was the answer usually given to the tribunals on such occasions , without any specification as to which of the two principles had influenced the conduct of those who were brought before them : and , whenever we hear of such general apology or answer , we can not doubt that they , who made use of it , were actuated by both . The unlawfulness of fighting was as much a principle of religion in the early times of Christianity as the refusal of sacrifice to the Heathen Gods ; and they operated equally to prevent men from entering into the army , and to drive them out of it on their conversion . /z/ Indeed these principles always went together , where the profession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , who refused the profession , on account of the idolatry connected with it , would have refused it on account of the unlawfulness of fighting . And he , who. refused it on account of the guilt of fighting , would have refused it on account of the idolatrous services it required . Both and each of them were impediments , in the early part of Christianity , to a military life . " To these extracts , ( the reader will excuse the length of them for the interesting matter they contain , ) we take the liberty to add another on the same topic from Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . " The Christians were not less averse to the business than to the pleasures of this world . The defence of our persons and property they knew not how to reconcile with the patient doctrine which enjoineid an unlimited forgiveness of past injuries , and commanded them to invite the repetition of fresh insults . Their simplicity was offended by the use of oaths , by the pomp of magistracy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their humane ignorance be convinced , that it was lawful on any occasion to shed the blood of our fellow creatures , either by the sword of justice , or by that of war ; eveii though their criminal or hostile attempts should threaten the peace and safety of the whole community . It was acknowledged , that under a less perfect law , the powers of the Jewish constitution had been exercised , with the approbation of Heaven , by inspired prophets and anointed kings . The Christians felt and confessed , that such institutions might be necessary for the present system of the world , and they cheerfully submitted to the authority of their Pagan governors . But while they inculcated the maxims of passive obedience , they refused to take /z/ or THE PRiMrnvE christians . 139 any active part in the civil administration or the military defence of the empire . Some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to those persons who , before their conversion , were already engaged in such violent and sanguinary occupations ; but it was impossible that Christians , without renouncing a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magistrates , or of princes . " There is one fact worthy of notice , because it is further back in the history of the Primitive Christians , than any thing which has been mentioned . The city of Jerusalem , it will be recollected , was utterly destroyed in about forty years after the crucifixion of our Savior , and the whole nation were overthrown in a most wonderful and unparalleled manner . The Savior had foretold this destruction ; the Christians , who were now very numerous , ( for there were many thousands of them so early as the period when Paul attended the meeting of the Elders at Jerusalem , ) distinctly saw the approach of a contest , which would overwhelm their beloved city and country . But it does not appear from any thing said in Josephus or by any writer of that time , that they took any part in that dreadful contest . On the contrary , knowing that their principles were inconsistent with the bloody scenes which were at hand , they entrusted themselves to the divine protection , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could . A great body of them , as we learn from Eusebius , ( Bk . Ill , Ch. 6 , ) * resorted to a village of the name of Pella , beyond the river Jordan ; and secured by nothing but their benevolent and pacific principles , were preserved safe amid the desolations and bloodshed around them . In the conclusion of this topic , we would briefly remark that we do not wish to be understood as maintain- /z/ ing , that the doctrines and practice of the Primitive Christians are absolutely and in all respects binding upon us . We know that they are not , whenever they ape at variance with the doctrines of the Gospel , and with the practice which the Gospel requires . If they had been more united and harmonious in their abhorrence of war and in their repugnance to military service than they appear to have been , even that would not have rendered an appeal to the Gospel unnecessary . Every one is required to make up a judgment for himself on the infallible testimony of the Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a circumstance calculated to confirm our faith and to give substantial encouragement , that apparently so large a number of the primitive followers of Christ , amid all the warlike prejudices of their age and under the frown of Roman tyranny , refused to bear the sword against their fellowmen , because they considered it to be inconsistent with their Christian profession . Blessed and glorious words of Maximilian , " / am a Christian and can not fight , /z/ There is one view of this subject , which has almost entirely escaped notice ; but which , while it must be exceedingly interesting to every one , will perhaps on soine minds make a stronger impression , than any other aspect in which it has been contemplated . It is this . War in all its forms is obviously inconsistent with the Millennial state . In the first place , what do we understand by the Millennium or the millennial state of the world ? We mean a state , where the principles of the Gospel will be recognized , felt , and put in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship God and will truly and ardently love each other ; where there will be no contention , no jealousy , no acts of retaliation , no strife . This is the view we entertain of it ; and which , if we do not misinterpret them , we are authorized to entertain by the Scriptures . In every age of the world , since the coming of Christ there has been essentially but one opinion on this subject . Amid all the trials , which the Church has passed through , amid all the thick darkness , in which she has been occasionally involved , the faith of the devoted Christian has always invincibly attached itself to this great result . He has believed , and firmly and unalterably believed , that a day of universal peace and puri- /z/ ty would at last come ; a day , " when they shall not hurt nor destroy in all the holy mountain . " Beneath its trees , that spread their blooming light , The spotted leopard walks ; the ox is there ; The yellow lion stands in conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little child doth take him by the mane . And leads him forth , and plays beneath his breast . Nought breaks the quiet of that blest domain . Nought mars its harmony and heavenly rest ; Picture diyine and emblem of that day . When peace on earth and truth shall hold unbroken sway . In the second place , how shall this result be secured and perpetuated ? Are we to expect a new code , and a new system of methods of operation ? Are we to expect a new Savior , a new Crucifixion , a new and amended edition of the New Testament ? Certainly not . The doctrines of the Millennium are the doctrines of to-day ; the principles of the Millennium are the very principles , which are obligatory on the men of the present generation ; the bond , which will exclude all contention , and will bind together all hearts , will be nothing more nor less than the Gospel of Christ . The Gospel is a book of principles ; of great , operative , and unchangeable principles . Men condemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians may be fairly charged with treating it with no small degree of disregard , because in their worldliness they have neglected to estimate its heights and depths . If heaven could be brought down to earth , if Europe and America and all other continents and parts of the world could , at the present moment , be peopled with angels and with seraphic natures , the Gospel , just as it stands , would be sufficient to guide and govern them . The blessed companies of the heavenly world , unlike the children of men , would /q/ ask no higher and better code . But can we regard it as allowable , could we conceive of it as allowable , under any assignable circumstances , for an angel to retaliate upon an angel , for a seraph to exercise hostility upon a seraph , for one of these holy beings to hold in his own hands the right of extinguishing the life of another ? What sort of heaven would that be , which should be characterized by the admission of such a principle ? And we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , which shall be characterized , either practically or theoretically , in the same way ? When men are fully restored to the favor of God , whether in heaven or earth , is there to be one code , one set of governmental principles for them , and another for other holy beings ? Certainly not . In all the great matters of right and duty , the law of seraphs is the law of angels , and the law of angels is the law of men . If it is utterly and absolutely inconsistent with our conceptions of the heavenly world , that the power of life and death should be taken from the hands of Jehovah , and that angels and seraphs should have the right of extinguishing each other 's existence , it is equally difficult to conceive of such a right in the Millennium . And if it will not be right for the men of the Millennium to exercise the power of life and death over each other , it is not right for them now . We have the same code of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Testament now , and we shall have it then ; and not only that , we shall understand it better and love it more . Nothing will be added to it ; nothing will be taken from it . If it does not now consider human life inviolable , it never will ; if it does not now proscribe all wars among the human species , it never will ; the right of taking human life , if it exists now under the Christian code , will exist as a legal and authorized characteristic , ( painful and even horrible , as /z/ the mere thought is , ) of the pure , blessed , and angelic state of the Millennium . On the supposition , therefore , that life will be inviolable in the Millennium , and that it will not be considered right for one man to put another to death for any possible reason , we argue that it is not right now . And this form of reasoning is applicable to any other analogous case whatever . If it will not be right to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ; if it will not be right to be intemperate in the Millennium , it is not right to be intemperate now ; if it will not be right to hold slaves in the Millennium , it is not right to hold slaves now ; if it will not be right to take life and carry on war in the Millennium , it is not right to take life and to carry on war now . The principles , which will be acknowledged as authoritative in the Millennium , are the very principles , which are prescribed and are binding upon us at the present moment . No change in principles is required ; but merely a change in practice . If the practice of men should to-morrow be conformed to the principles , which the finger of God has written on the pages of the New Testament , then tomorrow would behold the Millennium . We delight to linger upon this subject . There is a charm in the millennial name . " Scribenti manum injicit , et quamlibet festinantem in se morari cogit . " The wing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it under the type of a wilderness newly clothed with bud and blossom ; sometimes we see it under the type of a city descending from heaven , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband ; sometimes we behold it as a great temple arising out of the earth , and capacious enough to contain all nations . This temple is not built of earthly materials , that will perish with the using ; but is supported on immutable columns . Every great moral and religious principle is a pillar in the mil- /z/ lennial temple . The principle of total abstinence from all intoxicating liquors is one pillar ; it suddenly arose fair and beautiful , and even now is enveloped with some rays of millennial glory ; the doctrine , that all slaveholding is a sin , is another pillar , standing firm , awfully grand , and immoveable ; the doctrine of the absolute inviolability of human life is another ; this is in a state of preparation , but it will soon ascend , and stand brightly and majestically in its place ; and thus principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be erected , till the spiritual house of the Lord shall be established in the tops of the mountains , and shall expand upon the eye of the beholder , far more beautiful than the Parthenon . And what then will be wanting ? Only that the nations , in the language of prophecy , shall flow into it ; only that the people should occupy it and rejoice in it , and this is millennial glory . But unless you have firm , unchangeable , ihimutable principles , it will be like a certain house , that was built upon the sand ; " and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell and great was the fall of it . " /z/ When the doctrine of entire abstinence from war both Offensive and Defensive is asserted and maintained it is so far in advance both of public sentiment and pub- ? lib practice , that we are at once met with a host of objections . Some good men , who in the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed at its announcement , on the ground , that , if it should prevail , there would be no personal or political safety . Some of the objections , which are made , may appear to be trivial ; undoubtedly they are so ; but if they arc frequently made and have influence with the popular mind , they seem to require a word of notice . This is to be said , however , that these objections multiply themselves so rapidly and assume so many shapes , that we can afford to give only a few specimens , leaving the rest to be supplied by the reader 's imagination . I ,  --  One man says , for instance , if a person or a number of persons should commence a violent attack upon you , to the hazard even of your life , what would you do ? This is my answer . I would do as the Savior did on a certain occasion , Luke 4 : 28-30 . " And all they in the Synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill . /q/ whereon the city was built , that they might cast him down headlong . But Ae , passing through the midst of them fjoent his tcaj/ . " In other words , ( by what means we can not tell , ) he made his escape . Or I would do as the Apostle Paul did , when the Jews of Damascus took counsel to kill him . Acts 9 : 2S-25 . " But their laying await was known of Saul ; and they watched ' the gates day and night to kill him . Then the disciples took him by night , and kt him dotm by the wall in a basket . Or if I could not escape , I would strive by superior skill or physical power to disarm the man , as an act of benevolence to him as well as of duty to myself , and yet without endangering his life , or injury to his person . In other words I would do , as David did on a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assailant , but with a sacred care , not to use it against him . I certainly should not feel at liberty , under any provocation whatever or any pressure of danger , to forget the sublime and instructive declaration of the Savior already repeatedly referred to . " My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered unto the Jews ; but now is my kingdom not from hence . " Every thing should be done in love ; and without any possible injury to the assailant . And there can be but little doubt , that this course of kindness , patience , and forbearance , especially if it were combined with affectionate entreaty and remonstrance , would prove a successful one . But if it . should prove otherwise , if it should clearly appear that all this would not avail , and that certain destruction stared me in the face , if I acted as a Christian , I should most seriously endeavour to imitate the example of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Father forgive them they know not what they do . ' * /z/ II ,  --  It is inquired again , how will it be possible to administer the laws on the system of the inviolability of human life ? How will it be in the power of the magistrates , on the principles of the pacific creed , to seize delinquents and to bring them to justice ? On this topic we answer concisely , that , if the laws of the community are such as they should be , framed with suitable wisdom and sustained by public sentiment , but little danger is to be apprehended on this 8coi:e . There are elements in human nature , which will infallibly secure the existence and advancement of society , if there is a suitable share of benevolence and justice in the administration of its concerns . The power of public opinion is immense ; it is based upon an ultimate principle of our mental constitution , the desire of esteem ; and this power can always , with suitable precautions , be arrayed on the side of or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there is power in benevolence ; and those , who are conscious of having right and kindness on their side , will not fail of exhibiting a due degree of energy and fortitude . It will be found , on the other hand , that men , who are so degraded as to assail society by the conmission of crimes , will in general discover but little moral , intellectual , or physical courage . The elements of a formidable contest are not in them . It is virtue , which gives strength ; and being destitute of the elements of a virtuous character , they arc , in a great degree , destitute of decision and energy . This is a great law of nature . It is essentially true of such persons , in the language of Scripture , that " the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them ; and they shall flee , as fleeing from a sword ; and they shall fall , when none pursueth . " Too ignorant of the provision , which a kind Providence has made in our mental constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , we are apt to exaggerate the /q/ dangers , which are to be apprehended from such men . The warrant of the justice and the staff of the constable , supported by wise laws and a correct public sentiment , will assuredly answer the purposes of public justice . We have had ample experience on this subject in this country . Whenever a riot takes place in some large town or city , there are always some persons , ( whether they act from reflection or from the suggestions of a mere nervous excitement , it would not be easy to say , ) who are in favor of resorting to force , of calling out the military , of inflicting summary vengeance . But such measures are found to do no good ; they only serve to inflame and aggravate the public maladies ; while on the other hand the prompt and judicious interference of the civil authority , especially when it is sustained by kindness , never fails . We have no hesitancy in saying , that it will prove a sad and dark day indeed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply any other than the pacific doctrines in the administration of justice . On this topic something further will be said in one of the chapters on Capital punishments , showing that in pursuing a criminal we are bound to respect his life ; that his right to escape is a natural one , which can not be taken from him ; and that the mere fact of his making the attempt is not of itself a sufficient reason for summary punishment and bloodshed . Ill ,  --  We have sometimes heard the question put , as if it were almost decisive of the right to use force and to destroy life , whether it would not be right to attack a slave-ship , loaded with slaves from Africa ? In answer to an inquiry of this kind , we would ask , in the first place , whether the plan of attempting to put an end to the slave-trade by force , which has been in progress  --  ome fifteen or twenty years , has done any good ? And we hesitate nothing is saying , that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether it has not in fact increased the evils , which it was intended to diminish . Certain it is , that the slave trade , up to the present moment , has not been essentially diminished ; and whatever diminution has taken place is probably owing to other causes . We are indeed compelled to admit , that the slave-traders take more precautions , than they used to do ; their vessels are modelled , much more than they were formerly , with a view to fast sailing ; but this only increases the wretchedness of the poor slaves . And if at any time , the vessels of the slave-trar ders are likely to be overtaken by hostile ships of war , they do not hesitate , shocking as the very thought is , to throw the miserable Africans overboard . If , then , we fihall do no good by resorting to force , and shall probably do evil , it would not be an easy matter to show that we are under obligations to make that resort . But while we throw out this view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the liberty to say further , that there is a much easier way of putting a stop to the slave trade , which ought at least to be tried , before we resort to the awful remedy of shedding human blood . The slave trade can be stopped at once by destroying the market at home ; or in other words , by the suppression of slavery . Here is a christian remedy . Let us try this first , before we resort to another , which is obviously of doubtful utility , besides being opposed to the Gospel . It is we , who make slave-traders by keeping open the slave market ; we have done wrong in the first instance by purchasing the slaves , and by thus encouraging the cupidity of these traders ; we are not at liberty on any soimd principles to take advantage of our own wrong and to make it an excuse for wrong in another shape . If , when we do right ourselves , by breaking the yoke of bondage and treating the millions /q/ of Africans in Christian countries as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not cease and die of itself , then we shall be called upon with some show of propriety to answer the inquiry concerning the application of force . IV ,  --  Another objection , ( one which may be supposed to have considerable weight with many minds in this country , ) is , that on peace principles the leaders and agents in the American Revolution were wrong . In remarking upon this difficulty , we do not deny , that the leading men of the American Revolution were the true friends of their country ; that they in general acted from public , and not from private and selfish considerations ; and that they deserve on many accounts to be held in most respectful and ajBTectionate remembrance . Furthermore , they were right in their prindpkj as we believe ; and Great Britain was wrong . But we as firmly believe , ( if we estimate the matter , not By the natural sentiments of mankind , but by the principles of the Gospel , ) that they were wrong in the measures they pursued . And if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely consistent with the spirit of the Gospel , and had persevered in them , we have no doubt that all the valuable results of the Revolution would have been ultimately gained . The measure , most likely to have secured their object , would have been earnest , respectful , and patient remonstrance , combined with some measures of a negative kind , such as refusing to use those things which were unjustly taxed . Nor do we hazard much in this remark , since the course was tried in opposition to the early movements of British oppression , and with a great degree of success . The principle , for which our revolutionary fathers contended , was the acknowledged and important principle of the English Constitution , that the /z/ right of taxation depends on representation . One of the first measures of the English ministry , after they had adopted the plan of taxing America , without , at the same time , permitting her to be represented in Parliament , was the imposition of stamp duties on most of the instruments in common use , which duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown . This was in 1765 . And what was the course , which was then pursued by America Not a resort to violence , not an appeal to arms , not the shedding of blood , but simply earnest and patient remonstance , combined with a concerted and general abstinence from the use of stamps . The consequence was , that in due season the English ministry was changed , and the measure was abandoned .  --  Some years afterwards the English government tried again its measures of oppression by imposing a tax on tea and a few other articles . If the same course of remonstrance and abstinence from the use of the articles taxed had been pursued for any considerable time , we may reasonably suppose , that the same results would have followed . And not only that , the English people and the English Parliament would soon have felt and recognized the justice of our claims in other respects , and have conceded the great principle of actual American representation in the Parliament of England . This would have fully satisfied America for many years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when America by the full and free consent of Great Britain would have separated from the mother country and taken a stand among nations , without that vast amount of crime and misery which attended the war , and without that mutual jealousy and hostility , which have existed in a painful degree ever since . We believe that this is a view of the subject , which candid and intelligent men . are generally disposed to /q/ take at the present time . Those , who are acquainted with the parliamentary history of England , know that America at a very early period had able advocates in Parliament , who maintained her cause on constitutional grounds , and that the public feeling of England , pifprious to the actual breaking out of hostilities , was setting strongly in the direction , which has been intimated . We have good reasons , therefore , for asserting and maintaining , that resistance to England on Gospel principles , the mere resistance of abstinence from the articles taxed and of respectfnl and persevering remonstrance , would have ultimately secured all those objects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were in Jai secured , ) by a long series of hostilities , by tears and agony and blood . The objections , therefore , to the doctrines of peace , which are drawn from the facts of our Revolutionary history , are of no weight . V ,  --  Supposing says another objector , that a band of pirates should assail the town , of which you happened to be the responsible magistrate , what must be done then This inquiry is answered with so much sincerity and eloquence in one of the last productions of the late lamented Grimk , that we can not forbear quoting it . Most earnestly do we commend it to the serious attention of this reader . And we fully believe , if he has the spirit of the Gospel , he will not be at a loss , in what way a Christian should meet the attacks even of the most infuriated and abandoned assailants . * A. has supposed me the Chief Magistrate of Charleston , and that the city was attacked by pirates . " Is it passible , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation to the Gospel , as to surrender the city ? " Does A. seriously ask what I would do ? Can he doubt ? But I will tell him . A Christian iflagistrate acknowledges the Bible as above all government , and the law of love and /z/ forgiveness as above all human regulations . If he can not hold his office consistently with the obligations of that book , and the teachings of that law , he will resign . That is precisely what I should do .  --  If my fellow citizens irigected , I should tell them that I must do my duty . But if I had , on the contrary , a Christian people in spirit and in truth , on the principles of peace , I should make proclamation that all the churches be opened , and that prayer be offered by the clergy and all the pious , that God would be pleased to change the hearts of our invaders , and to manifest his power and mercy in our deliverance . That done , I should throw open the gate that fronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a band of cavalry and infantry , as A. would do , but with all the clergy , and a long procession of Sunday School Teachers and Scholars , dressed in the white robes of peace , and chanting no battel song of " The Bruce , " but the hymn of Christian faith and hope . Does A. believe me in earnest ? I appeal to his own heart . Will he not acknowledge that if ever " the effectual , fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much , " it must be , it would be then ? Can he dcHibt that such a spectacle would soften the hearts , and change the purposes of that " band of greedy , lustful , bloodthirsty pirates ? " Oh , that he were there : for he himself would bid me , with such a spirit , to trust myself and the city , not to the cannon and musket , but to Grod . ' Would not the force of truth and the power of faith and the pathetic beauty of the scene compel him to exclaim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perish in the spirit of innocence , forgiveness , and love , praying , like Stephen , for your murderers , than to die suicides and murderers yourselves . " Would he not say , as he stood in the rampart and beheld that Christian army , with its Christian music of holy song , would he not exclaim . /q/  --  The faith of a Roman mother saved Rome from Coriolanus , and shall not Christian faith save this city even from Pirates ? B at let us reason a little on the supposed case : take A. s mode of proceeding . Is h , e sure of success BH all on his side argue as tho ' they were sure . But they are not sure . The goodness of a cause does not command success .  --  " The race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong . " Now I will grant that , in my case , I should not be sure of success . We are then on a level . A. will not say that I would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have turned enemies into friends . Perhaps I have made such an impression on that sinful company , that they abandon their wicked lives and become Christian brothers . Suppose A , to succeed , what then ? The survivors are implacable enemies , and will assuredly take a dark and terrible vengeance at some other time . There may be joy for the present , but no peace or security for the future . Besides , although he has sav 'd the bodies of his fellow citizens , he has sent a hundred impenitent souls to the lake of fire . Is this to trust in Crod ? Is this to love our fellow men ? If there be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just men that need no repentance , what joy shall there be in hell over an hundred impenitent sinners , sent to perdition by the bayonets of Christian clergymen and their flocks . * But I may fail . Granted ; and what then ? Would we not die , the innocent by the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelieving ? Would we not die the death of the merciful , of the peace maker ; and would we not have their reward ? Would we not obtain mercy ? and be called the children of God f /z/ that in every respect it must fare worse ? If he will not acknowledge this as a general rule , notwithstanding what may possibly happen in one case out of a hundred , I am sure every- other reader of the Calumet will . Wheiiber then we succeed or fail , I have the advantage of A. , and what an advantage is that which is built on faith in God and love to man ! But let me give A. a stronger example ; because mar tur 'd , and to have been executed , without faltering , if I know myself . It is not perhaps understood , that after the passage of the Ordinance of the 24th of November , 1832 , the state of parties was such in Charleston that , if blood had been shed on either side , in the streets , there is reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited scenes unparallel 'd in our happy country . As in all such cases , the most obnoxious must expect the most terrible fate . Altho ' I had taken the middle ground of peace , had publicly declar 'd that cost what it might I would not bear arms in any conflict between the State and Union ; yet I knew that my letter of December 1 , 1832 , " To the people of South Carolina , " on the subject of that Ordinance had not only caused the rejection of my petition to the Legislature for exemption from militia duty , but had been represented as a violent and inflammatory production . I had reason , therefore , to believe that my house would have been an object of attack . I had resolv 'd neither to prepare for defence , nor to accept any oiSer of protection , should any be made . I should have removed all arms out of my house , and prohibited absolutely , the attempt to use or conceal any . My family should not have been sent away , unless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least I could have answered to have stood by me with a more faithful love in death , even than in life . The doors and windows should have been open , and the rooms lighted /q/ as usual . I should have gone forth to meet them , and to speak , if they would have heard me , such words as God would have enabled me to utter . I may have died the death of Coligny , but it would have been the death which became the faith and love of a Christian . My family would have lost a husband and father , but then he would have been unspattered by a brother 's blood ; he would have sent no guilty spirit , unprepared , into the world of woe . ' We may well conclude by a parallel in my own case , like that in the case of the pirates . If I had succeeded with my exasperated fellow citizens , and they had departed in peace , what cause should I not have had for gratitude to God ? If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life With that , it is most likely , the mob would have been content , and my family , and their property would have been spared . But suppose it had been A 's case . As soon as he knew the state of the city , he would have prepared for war . The house of prayer would soon have become a fortress , and muskets and pistols , ammunition and swords would have been provided for the slaughter perhaps of some of the communicants of A 's own church in the midst of their sins . Let the time of trial come . The battle rages . What destruction , not only of his own , but of his neighbors ' property ! What rage and blasphemy from the baffled mob ! Look at the dying and wounded . Hear their shrieks and curses . Turn to the house . Look at the minister of the Gosp taking deliberate , deadly aim at his neighbor , acquaintance , communicant , to slay him for eternal misery ! Look at those men , the elders and deacons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What thoughts are in their souls ! What , but the ejaculations , " My God ! give his a firm heart , and steady hand ; forgive me if I break thy law Thou shalt not kill : ' // may every shot tell until the murderers desist ! Bless me in this work of blood ; my trust is in thee . " But the mob is repelled ; they depart , breathing out threatnings and slaughter against A. and his company . Did A. live under the Mosaic dispensation , his prayer of praise and thanksgiving might be conceived in the spirit of the Old Testament hymns for victory . Did he live in the age of the crusaders , or in that of the Puritans of England , or the covenanters of Scotland , his prayer would breathe the spirit of the elegies of Tyrtseus , not of the Sermon on the Mount . But how a Christian minister , the chief actor in such a scene , could offer prayer to a God of holiness , through the Prince of Peace and love , for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * Let us now reverse the scene . The mob succeed . The house is taken by storm . The mob burst in with howls and cries , more wild and terrific than the Indian war whoop ; for civilized man when madden 'd is more savage than the Savage . How many lives on both sides are lost in that furious struggle ! The mob rush in on every side , and the assailed driven from room to room , are hurled from the windows , or slain within . A. falls with the rest , and goes to give his account for having suffered , when he could have prevented many if not all the agonies and miseries of that scene . Can a Christian read , and not tremble at the thought that he should have any hand in those crimes and horrors f * Now , will not A. acknowledge , that as a Christian I have the advantage of him both ways . If I succeed , what a contrast to his success ! If I fail , perhaps only a single life is lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what destruction of property , what waste of life , what ruin of immortal souls ! Would not A. rather live with me , or die with me , than to survive or perish with his fellow combatants , stained with the blood of guilty /q/ brothers , and authors of perdition to many a soul . But my advantages stop not there . If I succeed , the mob depart , with passions calmed and restrained . Should mine be the first house , might not my course be the means , under God , of saving the city from the fury of the mob ? If I fail , the mob depart with revenge satiated ; but with no fierce excitement of ferocious feelings . Whether A. succeed or fail , it seems plain , from the exasperated passions of the populace , that nothing but a strong military force could control them ; nor then , without desperate conflicts and much bloodshed . The state of the city under my success or failure , compared with his , I leave to the heart and imagination of A. himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewing the whole ground , will they not confess , with king Agrippa , " Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian , on the principles of Peace . ' " * These are instances or specimens of the popular objections , which are thrown out against the peace doctrine . Others might be easily given , if we had space for noticing every thing of this kind ; and perhaps we might add with propriety , they might be as easily answered . Men may rely upon it , that a course of justice , tempered with imfeigned benevolence , will always be attended with the most favorable results . Is it not the mercy of God , that leadeth to repentance ? And if God 's mercy , God 's goodness can thus influence and lead men to pursue a right course , why may not mercy and goodness in men have a similar efiect ? The fact is , the power of beneficence has never been fully estimated , and never been put fully to the test . When this is done , ( and society will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it M done , ) it will be seen , that we are not flighty and chimerical , nor even unphilosophical in our /z/ views . Mental philosophers have told us of the power of the resentful passions ; not only how they sometimes prompt to injury , but how they have power to restrain others from doing injury . Political economists have told us of the power of bars and gates and prisons , in checking the tendencies to the perpetration of crime . But who , on philosophical principles , has investigated the power of beneficence and forgiveness ? Beyond all question , it is the unalterable constitution of nature , that there is efficacy , divine , unspeakable efficacy in love . The exhibition of kindness has the power to bring even the irrational animals into subjection . Show kindness to a dog , and he will remember it ; he will be grateful ; he will infallibly return love for love . Show kindness to a lion , and you can lead him by the mane ; you can thrust your hand into his mouth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affection stronger than death . In all of God 's vast , unbounded creation , there is not a living and sentient being from the least to the highest , not one , not even the outcast and degraded serpent , that is insensible to acts of kindness . If love , such as our blessed Savior manifested could be introduced into the world and exert its appropriate dominion , it would restore a state of things far more cheering , far brighter than the fabulous age of gold ; it would annihilate every sting ; it would pluck out every poisonous tooth ; it would hush every discordant voice . Even the inanimate creation is not insensible to this divine influence . The bud and flower and fruit put forth most abundantly and beautifully , where the hand of kindness is extended for their culture . And if this blessed influence should extend itself over the earth , a moral garden of Eden would exist in every land ; instead of the thorn and the brier , would spring up the fir-tree and the myrtle ; the desert would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ Having thus endeavoured to show the evils of war and its utter inconsistency with the Gospel , we now proceed to inquire , what is to be done , what course is to be taken on this all important subject ? In answering this question we are not ignorant of the difficulties , which stand in the way , and of the responsibility which it is necessary to assume . The FIRST measure to be taken , therefore , under existing circumstances , is to embody a peace society in every church . I say , under existing circumstances . If the different leading sects of Christians at their first organization had introduced into their formularies the doctrine of peace , after the manner of the Friends and some other smaller sects , it would have been much better . If all the Congregationalists , ( and the same may be said of all other Christian denominations , ) were peace-men , embracing the principles of peace and acting on them , would not the garments of their churches be far more radiant with beauty than they are now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more moral courage in the prosecution of duty than we now do ? And should we not feel more conscious of the approbation and favor of heaven than we do at present ? As those , who were concerned in establishing the original formularies of the prominent Christian sects , neglected to do what they ought to have done , we must now remedy the evil in /z/ the best way we can . And as the great objects in view can not be secured without some concentration of opinion and effort , we must undoubtedly begin with forming a Peace Society in every church . In some cases , where the aspect of things is favorable , the church may act upon the matter in their ecclesiastical capacity , and introduce the peace doctrines into their creed and covenant . After some few years , when the public mind has become a little more enlightened on the subject , it is probable that this last method will be the more common one , as it will certainly be likely to be most effective . This is the first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very important , in the second place , to consider carefully what principle shall be adopted as the basis of these societies . Every one must admit , that , in effecting a great moral object , every thing depends upon the adoption of a correct moral principle . If the , societies should be so unfortunate as to start upon an unsound principle as their basis , they may certainly count upon finding themselves practical nullities . We submit it , therefore , ( in concurrence with the opinions of others whose views are entitled to much consideration , ) that it is necessary to adopt , as a fundament tal article of these societies , the principle j that all wars whaUnsTy both offensive and defensive , are repugnant to the precepts and rit of the Gospel and are sinful . In support of the opinion , that there is a necessity for the express recognition of this fundamental principle there are three obvious reasons , which we shall state as briefly as possible . ( 1 ) The Peace societies under the common organization , ( that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral right of defensive war , ) have not been so effective , and have not been followed with those favorable results , which their supporters had fondly anticipated . They have undoubtedly /q/ done good , great good ; but after what has been learnt from the trial of them , it may be fairly and justly said , that they are inadequate to the great object , which all Christians ought to . have in view . They ought to have the " Credit of preparing the way , by ably drawing the attention of the public to the subject of peace and war , for that further step which it is now proposed to take ; but they can not safely or rightfully be received as a substitute for it .  --  ( 2 ) The doctrine of the lawfulness of Defensive war is in effect , and to all practical purposes , the doctrine of the lawfulness of every species of war whatever ; because , with scarcely a single exception , all nations which engage in war alledge , that they do it in self-defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in priority of attack , but in priority of injury ; and it will be found that belligerent nations are always ready to assort , that they have been led into wars in consequence of injuries previously received . It will be found on experience , if it has not already been , that Peace societies , which admit the lawfulness of Defensive war , do not essentially disturb the quiet of warriors and politicians , with whatever prudence and zeal they may be conducted . These persons will even become polite and laudatory , and pronounce such societies very good ; just as at the present time many tipplers are found , who praise those old-fashioned temperance societies , which admitted of moderate drinking , while they denounce the total-abstinence system .  --  ( 3 ) If defensive , as well as offensive war , is forbidden in the Gospel , as we have endeavored to show in former chapters , and as we doubt not every humble and faithful inquirer will find to be the case , then we can not reasonably expect the guidance and favor of heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we know to fall short of the Gospel reqoi &dtion.; It is of unspeakable importance , in the ex- /z/ amination of moral and religious duty , to ascertain the true Gospel doctrine , as we are then in a situation to enforce the duty upon the consciences of men , and to urge it home with entire confidence . We have then no doubts , no fears , no misgivings ; we know that God is with us ; and are sure of ultimate success . In the THIRD place , something is to be done . If Peace societies are to be embodied , they must be embodied for some purpose ; for some practical purpose . Such is the constitution of human nature itself , that it will be found exceedingly difficult to sustain a society organization for any length of time , unless it be expected to issue in some practical result . If the whole object of peace societies be to enlighten public sentiment on the subject of peace and war , we do not hesitate to assert , that it can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as well indeed , but almast . If no definite practical object is to be secured , the continuance of these associaptions is of comparatively little importance . A second article , therefore , must be embodied in the proposed new organization of these societies to this effect , that the menh bers pkdgB Ihemsebes not to submit to any military requititiom whatever J and not to contribute any things either direMy or indirectly either of their personal efforts or their money j in furtherance f military measures . It is the adoption of this pledge , which , still more than the adoption of the principle that all wars , offensive and defensive , are morally wrong , will constitute the predominant feature of the proposed new societies , and impart to them a specific and operative character . It is the pledge , which , like the pledge of the temperance societies organized on the principle of total abstinence , will render them positively and eminently practical . It is the pledge which is wanting ; it is the solemn , published , and immutable resolve not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furtherance of military measures , which is requisite in order to success . When this becomes the distinctive and unalterable feature of peace societies , their influence will be felt throughout the world . It is here we must take our stand ; it is upon this rock we must plant our feet ; and though the waves of the ocean dash against it , they will not prevail . But it will be said perhaps by way of objection to the proposed measures , that the adoption of such a pledge would constitute an act of resistance to the State ; that it would be throwing defiance at the fundamental regulations of the body politic . Undoubtedly it might be so considered , if its adoption were not a matter of religious feeling and religious obligation . But the supposition is , that those who join the Society acknowledge the paramount obligation of the Gospel ; and that they are fully satisfied of the first fundamental article of their association , viz. aSioar  --  ioAa ( er er , ftotAoenrive and DEFENSIVE , are repugnani to the precepts and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither proposed nor expected nor desired , that any should join the peace associations but such as can fully and sincerely assent to this fundamental principle . We do not of course insist upon this predse form of expressing it ; but we insist upon this fundamental principle in its essence . Now if a person fully and sincerely assents to this , and is conscientious in his profession that the Gospel is binding upon him , ( and certainly we should not expect much assistance from any other auxiliaries than of this stamp , ) then the second fundamental article follows of course .  --  There is no escape , no reprieve ; he not only stands upon the strong foothold of the Gospel , but he is bound by it ; it is as utterly impossible for him to obey either directly or indirectly a requisition in military matters , as it would be to obey a requisition to lie , steal , or murder . /z/ But some will say , how does this alter the matter ? Is it not still resistance to the body politic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are received as of any weight and authority in this country , agree in this , that the existence of society is a matter of contract . They furthermore assert , ( and they would be entitled to exceedingly little regard if they did not assert it , ) that the persons making the contract can not barter away physical or moral impossibilities ; they can not , for instance , bargain to deprive themselves of the exercise of perception , reasoning , belief , and conscience ; they can not , by means of any agreement they are capable of making , bind themselves to lie , to steal , to commit murder , or to do other moral wrongs . Consequently if a man really considers it morally wrong for him to take the life of a fellow man under any circumstances whatever , or to be accessory either directly or indirectly to the taking of human life , it is wholly out of his power , he neither has made , nor ever can make a contract , which places him in a situation where this necessity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are undoubtedly many and weighty , do not involve this case ; the file of human precedents will not reach him here ; he has taken his position upon Gospel ground ; he stands or falls to his own great Master . This is evident from the nature of the case ; but this is not all . The constitutions of the State and Nation recognize and guarantee the rights of religion ; and no man is obliged to go against his conscience ; or rather every one will be supported in acting in accordance with his conscience . The Congress of the United States is expresidy restricted from making any law prohibiting the free exercise of religion . The constitution of the state of Maine expressly guarantees , that no one shall be hurt , molested , or restrained in his person , liberty , or estate for his religious /q/ professions or sentiments , provide ( l he does not disturb the public peace , nor molest others in their religious worship , " Regulations of a similar import are to be found in all , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the present state of public sentiment , no one will be excused from the discharge of military duty merely because he vAshes to be ; but if he sincerely regards all participation in war and in the preparations for war as sinful , the law and the constitution will throw around him the cDgis of their protection ; the spirit of our forefathers , who fled to this country mainly for their religion , will rise up in his defence ; the noble barrier of trial by jury , often the last refuge of innocence and the last entrenchment of right , will never fail him in a contest on such a principle . And it is upon principle , religious principle , that we would move . We would make this whole business a matter of religion , a matter of sacred , conscientious duty ' ' ; we would remove it totally and immediately from the ground of expediency , where it seems to be placed , ( not excltuwelyy but in too great a degree , ) by the present peace organizations . We would not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , but would assert and maintain it on Gospel principles , to be wrong , morally wrong , wholly and absolutely wrong . It is possible , that some will make the inquiry here , whether , taking as we do the ground of refusing to perform military duty , we ought to pay military fines f Certainly not , if the fines , as is generally the case , are exacted and are applied for military purposes .. As far as principle is concerned , you might as well fight yourself , as pay others for fighting . But if the legislature , taking the constitutional course of eiempting from military duty and all military taxation those , who are conscientiously opposed to war , should at the same time impose on the Pacific Exempts , in consideration of their exemption , a /z/ tax , which should be expended for roads , schools , the poor , civil officers , hospitals and the like , it might be a question , whether it would not be a duty to pay it . But every one should be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied , that such a payment is not made to contribute , in any way whatever , to the purposes of war . If he can be fully persuaded of this , we are not prepared to say , that there would not be a benefit in such a tax . It would probably tend to satisfy public feeling , and to hush complaints ; it would be an evidence of our sincerity ; and would discourage those , ( for undoubtedly some such would be found , ) who might for the sake of saving their time and money , hypocritically pretend conscientious scruples in regard to war . We do not , however , express ourselves on this point with entire confidence ; but would merely take the liberty to suggest this view of the subject , as worthy of deliberate consideration . Whether such a tax could be imposed , consistently with some of the principles of the State and National constitutions may , indeed , well be questioned . But that is an inquiry , which time and the examinations of men learned in the laws will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may have nothing to do with war , either directly or indirectly ; and we ask it on the ground of our religion . We do not ask it , because we wish to save our time and save our money , although this would be a reason of some weight , since we believe that time and money expended upon war arc worse than throf n away ; but because we conscientiously believe wars to be forbidden . We wish to show ourselves good citizens in every possible way ; but we ask to be exempted from compulsory disobedience to that great Lawgiver , whose commands should always take the precedence of those of every earthly legislator . If our legislatures choose to increase our burdens in conse- /z/ /q/ quence of our religion , whether they can do it consistently with our principles of government or not , we shall consider it of but comparatively little consequence , provided our religious rights are not violated . But this is the point of difficulty . If by paying any tax whatever , on the principle of commutation , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exemption from military duty , ) we find that we are promoting , even in the least degree , the cause of war , we can not rightfully do it . And if we are forced to pay such a tax , then there is a violation of religious right . Going on Gospel principles , no military service is to be performed ; no military fine is to be paid ; nor is there to be a payment of any commutation tax , imposed for exemption from military services , so long as such payment is in any degree subservient to the purposes of war . But whether this is , or is not the case In any given instance , it is desirable , that each one should examine for himself , and , as we have already said , should be persuaded in his own mind . But it will be said perhaps , that this new doctrine will frighten people ; that it will raise an outcry ; and that but very few will join such an association . Be it so . And yet if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gospel , nothing is to be feared , and every thing is to be hoped for in the end . Undoubtedly but few will join at first ; but will they not be emphatically a light in the world ? The great question is ,  --  Are we on Gospel ground ? Have we Christ on our side , and the goodly company of apostles and martyrs ? In such company , although we may meet with discouragements for a time , we can not possibly fail at last . In regard to every leading practical principle of the Gospel , when it is fully understood and conscientiously embraced , it is a great and most encouraging truth , that " a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump . " Then let us make a beginning ; let /z/ US try , looking to God for help ; let every minister of the Grospel take up the subject for himself seriously , prayerfully , and earnestly ; and now , when pacific fprinciples are making progress and the aspect of things is decidedly favorable , let him not be slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive Christians , adopted by the Friends , Moravians , and some other sects ; or rather on the Gospel principle , to icft . Touch not , taste not , handle not . We eaniestly commend the propositions and views of this chapter to the serious attention of the reader . War is an evil , which has so wide a basis in the human passions and is stimulated into existence by so many incidental causes , that it can never be successfully opposed on any grounds of mere expediency . To erect the barrier of expediency against the overwhelming flood of war , would be like attempting to stop the Cataract of Niagara with the paddle of a canoe or the meshes of a fishing net ; or undertaking to prevent the incursions of the ocean on the coast of Holland by ant-hills instead of the immense dykes , which line that coast . Experience has shown it to be so ; reason , if one will enter fully into the subject , will show the same thing ; will fully demonstrate , that bloodshed can never be stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the world , so far as war is concerned , except in the influence of some great principle , clearly deducible from the Gospel , and operating upon Christianized conscience . Such a principle God in his mercy has given us ; such a principle we are most solemnly and earnestly summoned to recognize and adopt ; it stands dimly and imperfectly developed , ( or rather merely antidpated ) in the Old Testament , but written in letters of light on the pages of the New . And who are reasonably expected , not only to recognize this principle , but to put it in practice ? Christians . It is Christiansj /q/ those , who profess to believe the New Testament and to receive it as their guide , that must take the lead in this matter . The world will stop , till Christians move forward ; the world will assuredly continue to engage in war , till they cease to have Christian countenance ; the , world will ridicule all preaching against war , while Christian soldiers mingle in its ranks and Christian chaplains pray for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more urgent . Touch not the unclean thing . Come out and be separate . /z/ On the subject of exercising the offiqe of military chaplain , , we shall be very brief . If wars are wrong on Gospel principles , then no man can exercise the office of chaplain in an army or in any body of men assembled for military purposes , without a violation of those principles . The first inquiry is , what is a chaplain commonly expected to do ? If he were merely expected to communicate biblical instruction and to labor for the personal salvation of the soldiers , with full liberty both in public and private to express his sentiments in relation to the unlawfulness and the evils of war , we are not prepared to say , that the exercise of his office would necessarily be out of the pale of Christian duty . But /z/ this is not the expectation . A chaplain would not be tolerated in an army for a moment , who did not profess to be interested in the success of the war , however iniquitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such success . He is a component part of the army , as much so as a surgeon , and is expected to identify his interests and feelings with theirs . Such is the close connection between the chaplain and the military enterprize , to which he is attached and to which he is called to minister , that undoubtedly instances might be adduced of preachers in this situation , who have publicly addressed soldiers on military as well as religious subjects , and have encouraged them with all the powers of their rhetoric in the prosecution of their sanguinary business . Now when a person accepts the office of a chaplain , he accepts it on the implied condition , that he will discharge its duties in accordance with the common practice and the common expectation . Any other supposition would be inadmissible , because it would universally be considered as implying dishonesty . If these are correct views , then we maintain that no Christian minister can , consistently with the New Testament and without sin , exercise the office in question . First , He can not preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be conceded , that a Christian minister is boimd to declare the whole coiuisel and revelation of God ; that he is not at liberty to mutilate and to keep back anything , which is important truth . It is true he may exercise a prayerful and sound discretion in respect to the times and places , when it may be proper for him to inculcate certain doctrines ; but he is not at liberty to place himself in a situation where he can not inculcate them at all . But this the military chaplain has done . There is a portion of the Gospel , which he has virtually pledged himself not to preach ; there are some things , OFnCE OP CHAPLAIN . /z/ which he can not announce without giving great offence to his employers ; he is silent , and from his very situation must be so . If he were to preach in the presence of the soldiers from some of the texts , which have been introduced in the course of these discussions , such as * ' love your enemies , " " dearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy hunger , feed him , " " do good to them that hate you , " he would assuredly cause great dissatisfaction . If he were to preach from them in the spirit of the Gospel , giving them their full import , and pressing their practical application , it woild be likely to be received as an insult . Second , He can not pray , as he ought to . If there is any occasion , on which his prayers are peculiarly needed , it is on the eve of a battle . The soldiers throng around him , and with whatever carelessness they may have listened on other occasions , they now eagerly attend to what falls from his lips . And how does he pray ? What can he pray for ? Beyond all question he will find himself in such a situation , that he can not avoid praying distinctly and earnestly for the success of the army , in which he is employed . And if he prays for success and victory , ( as we can not suppose he expects they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a blessing on the means , which are ordinarily employed at such times . In other words , he prays , that the ball may be well directed and take effect , that the bayonet may strike surely and deep , that the sword and the lance may be plungpd into the vitals of the enemy , that their houses may be burnt and destroyed , that their provisions may be cut off , that they may be sent by hundreds and thousands in all the blood and agony of mortal conflict , into the pure presence of a holy God . Whether such a prayer , ( and it obviously means this or nothing , ) can be considered consistent with the benevo- /z/ lent principles of that Gospel , which requires us to do good to our enemies , to pray for them that despitefully use us , not to resist evil , and not to avenge ourselves , we leave to the reader to determine . Third , His presence gives a countenance to all the evils , which are attendant upon war ; the profaneness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always gather in its train . These dreadful evils , as well as cruelty and bloodshed , are universally regarded as necessarily incidental to a state of war ; no wars in times past have ever existed without them , nor have we any reason to expect it will be otherwise in future . It is not to be presumed , whatever may be the unfavorable tendencies of the human passions , that society would continue to tolerate the congregation of evils , direct and indirect , that are found in war , were it not for some fallacy in fact and reasoning . Men have been taught to believe , that wars are in some cases necessary , and that even the Gospel justifies them ; and the presence of the chaplain in an army , praying for its success , and throwing the ennobling sanctions of religion around the field of military preparation and battle , tends to encourage and strengthen this great error . Wars , they say , must sometimes be right , otherwise the minister of the Gospel , who certainly ought to understand the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of them , and would not sanction them by his presence . This , is the effect upon men generally , upon the ma80 of the community .  --  Furthermore , we assert it with entire confidence , that , were it not for the countenance , which they receive from professed Christians in the ranks of the army and particularly from the chaplain , the soldiers themselves , hardened as they are by the tendencies of their occupation , would experience more misgivings , more doubt , more compunction of haiurt i /z/ in their work of destruction and blood , than they are now generally found to do . They conclude , and very naturally too , if a preacher of the Gospel , a commissioned minister of the Most High , with all his capabilities for forming a moral and religious judgment of things , approves their employment and prays for its success , it would be an excess of scrupulosity in them to entertain a doubt . And the undoubted encouragement , which they receive from this source , extends itself , in a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also to the indirect evils of war . If the chaplain approves of war , it can not be supposed , all things considered , that he has any very serious and fundamental objection to those incidental evils of sabbath-breaking , profaneness , and the like , without which wars never have been , and never will be carried on . Especially if it should be the case , ( as under the existing circumstances we imagine it will be likely to be so , ) that he seldom takes an opportunity pointedly to preach against and reprove them .  --  We are under the necessity , therefore , of coming to ( te conclusion , that ministers of the Gospel can not and lawfully exercise the office of military chap*** ' J : And if they should act generally in accordance i l1 this view , we have no doubt , it would tend greatly ' " iSvheck the spirit of war . /z/ We have endeavored to show in a former chapter , that the great work of restoring the world to permanent and miiversal peace depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All , who profess to be governed by the principles of the Gospel , are called upon to act decidedly in their Christian character ; in other words , to consider abstinence from war in all cases , as an essential and indispensable requisite of that character . The world will never be permanently at peace , until this doctrine takes effect . But at the same time we are not at liberty to neglect any rightful means whatever , which can be made subservient to this most desirable result These means are various ; but one of the most important is the gentle , but efficacious influence of education . The application of this means of promoting peace may be stated in some particulars . I ,  --  In the first place , something is to be done by heads of families , particularly mothers . It is from them that the infant mind receives , in a great degree , not only its earliest , but its most decisive direction . And it is lamentably true , that the direction , which they have been instrumental in giving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have probably not been aware of the unpropitious tendency of the course they hdve often pursued ; but the evil has not , on that account , been /q/ the less real and great . They have planted the seeds and promoted the incipient growth of a military spirit by permitting the childish exaltation of their little ones , on witnessing a military parade and review , to go unchecked . They have fostered this miholy spirit by allowing their children the soldierlike gratification of paper military caps , guns , feathers , swords , sashes , and all the miniature paraphernalia of war . They have put into their hands the accounts of Indian and border wars , the lives of military chieftains , military and patriotic ballads and songs , which come recommended to their youthful imaginations with the emblazonment of plates and cuts . These practices , for which mothers stand in a very high degree , if not exclusively accountable , have been almost universal ; their influence is felt by almost every man of the community ; and it requu-es no small degree both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the soberness of manhood and old age . " The two first books I ever read in private , ( says Robert Bums , ) and which gave me more pleasure than any two books I ever read since , were the life of Hannibal and the History of Sir William Wallace . Hannibal gave my young ideas such a turn , that I used to strut in raptures up and down after the recruiting drum and bagpipe , and wish myself tall enough to be a soldier ; while the story of Wallace poured a Scottish prejudice into my veins , which will boil along there , till the floodgates of life shut in eternal rest . " The unfortunate Theobald Wolf Tone , speaking of his practice in early life of attending the military reviews of the garrison at Dublin , says expressly , " I place to the splendid appearance of the troops , and the pomp and parade of military show , the untameable desire , which I have ever since had , to become a soldier . " Let parents examine this matter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue a different course ; endeavouring to impress the susceptible minds of their children with the evils of bitterness and strife ; checking all those childish practices , which , adopted under the impulse of the principle of imitation , breathe a military spirit ; and substituting for the sanguinary narratives of human warfare the far more interesting records of kindness , of forgiveness , and of early piety. * II ,  --  In the SECOND place , a decidedly beneficial influence in regard to this matter can be exerted by Sabbath-school TEACHERS . There are said to be at the present time not less than an hundred thousand instructers , and a million of sabbath school pupils in the Uni-* ted States . It is the duty of these instructers not oaly * " I lately visited , ( says Mr. Ladd in one of his numerous peace publications , ) a distinguished instructor of youth , who has recently been converted to the peace principles ; and being of a strong and discriminating mind , he did not stop half way , but came , at onee , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of the gospel , and has not been afraid to publish his opinion to the world . He told me , that his boys were so taken up with military notions , that he could not reason with them , and he asked me to talk to them . I took the eldest boy , aged about seven years , between my knees , and something like the following conversation ensued . " Do you love to see the soldiers ? " " O , yes , I love to see the rub-a-dubs . " " Would you like to be one yourself ? " " O yes . " " Well , but do you know what these soldiers are for ? " ** No . " " Why , they are learning to kill people . Those bright guns are made ta kill people with , and those bright bayonets to stab them with . " The boy turned pale , such a thought never before entered his head . ' ' Do you know who killed the little babes in Bethlehem , because a wicked man told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were soldiers . Do you know who crucified our Lord , and drove spikes through his hands and feet ? " The boy was silent . ' ' They were soldiers , and soldiers would bum your house and cut down your fruit trees and kill your pa , if they were told to . " Both the boys were astonished , as tears stood in their eyes . " Do you want to be a soldier ? " ** No . " " Do you want to see the rub-a-dubs ? " " No. " /q/ to explain the doctrines which are made known in the Scriptures , but the duties , which are there inculcated ; to teach not only what they are to believe but what they are to do . And if Sabbath school teachers will but fully inform themselves in relation to the doctrines and duties of peace , and will take the pains to impress them earnestly on the minds of their pupils , it is impossible to calculate , how great would be the beneficial results . Let them , therefore , seriously consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . They must become peace-men themselves ; they must imbibe the true spirit of the Gospel in relation to contentions of every kind ; otherwise their instructions in respect to this subject will come with an uncertain and feeble aspecty and will do but little good . And while they endeavour to explain to their pupils , that the Gospel is a revelation of love , that it forbids a resort to arms and every species of unkindness , they will find occasion to remark on the practical results and evils of war , and the great guilt of men in permitting its existence . And thus their pupils will grow up in the spirit of peace , and will be likely in all after life to diffuse around them the benign influence of pacific principles . Ill ,  --  We may remark in the third place , that the instructions of the pulpit on the Sabbath constitute one of the methods of education . It is true , we do not , in fact , often speak of the Pulpit and of preaching in this way ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for doing so . It is beyond all question , that the influence of the Pulpit on the intellect of the community , as well as ' on the heart , is exceedingly great . And certainly it can not be denied or doubted , that the inculcation of the doctrines of peace comes within the legitimate sphere of the preacher 's duties . Unless the ministers of the Gospel of peace are willing to take the lead in the discussion /z/ and enforcement of this matter , how can it be expected , that the heads of families . Sabbath school teachers , and other private members of their churches and societies will either folly understand the subject , or deeidy feel its importance . Let it not be supposed , that we overrate the influence from this source . It can not , I think , be doubted that , on all moral and religious subjects , the most important school of education is the Sanctuary ; the rostrum of ancient eloquence , the professor 's chair , the Porticos of the Athenean Philosophy , the Lyceum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly no minister , who has imbibed in its length and breadth the spirit of the Gospel , will exclude the doctrines of peace from the list of themes , on which it is alike his duty and his privilege to expatiate . Nor are they to be introduced incidentally and after long intervals of time , as if they were of subordinate rank , and of Uttle value . There may indeed be other themes of more stirring interest and of more vital import to individuals , those which concern the prospects and probabilities of their own personal salvation ; but it does not by any means follow from this , that the subject of peace is of small consequence , and can be safely buried in a corner or hidden under a bushel . Very far from this . Every minister is sacredly bound to study this subject ; to bestow upon it his prayerful and serious attention ; to realize and to impress upon his own mind its importance ; to methodize it and array it in chosen forms of speech ; and with great earnestness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practice of his hearers . With the blessing of God he must educate them , not to the purposes of violence , hostility , and blood ; but to the exercise of forbearance , kindness , meekness , forgiveness , and love ; nor is he to circumecribe /q/ these benevolent exercises by the narrow domams of families and neighborhoods , but is to expand them , just as the blessed Gospel does , to the limits of nations , to the circumference of the world . In other words , he must explicitly maintain , that the benevolent principles of the Gospel , those which require love , forgiveness , the endurance of evil without rendering evil in return , are not more applicable to individuals than to communities , to families than to nations . IV ,  --  Academies and Colleges also have their duties to perform in relation to this matter . It is often remarked , ( and perhaps the remark is not wholly destitute of foundation , ) that the tendency of Academical and Collegiate education is to infuse into the young mind principles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in a single word , the tendency is to heathenize it . And under the impiession , which this view of things is calculated to make , some estimable men , ( among others the late Mr. Grimk6 of South Carolina , whose labors in the cause of peace and of benevolent efforts generally we desire always to mention with respect and gratitude , ) have proposed some essential modifications in the course of instruction , which has usually been pursued in such Institutions . Among other things they would entirely exclude the study of the Latin and Greek languages and literature . And why ? Not because the classic languages , whether we consider their admirable structure or their close and diversified relations to the English language and to literature in general , are unworthy of attention ; but because , being deeply imbued with a violent and warlike spirit , they can hardly fail to impart something of that spirit to the susceptible minds of youth . That this is an evil we admit ; nor do we deem it neces* sary to palliate the admission by asserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil . But perhaps it ought to /z/ be remembered , that it is an evil incidental to theliterature of almost every nation , in modem as well as in ancient times . Is there more of violence , bloodshed , and tnrime , or less of moral principle , in Livy and Tacitus , than in Machiavel and Gibbon ? We think not . A Christian history of war has never been written ; and never will be , in the spirit of commendation and eidogy . And yet all historians , modern as well as ancient , are eulogists ; their works are sprinkled over with covert and open approvals and panegyrics of those , ; who have secured great worldly objects by the worldly methods of vidence and bloodshed . Nor is this evil limited to history . We meet with it in poetry , in statuary , in architecture , in painting ; wherever we turn our eyes , we behold it ; we can not flee from it , but must confront it , oppose it , resist it . We do not , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient languages should be excluded from a course of public instruction on the grounds , which have been alluded to . But at the same time it can undoubtedly be admitted , that some alterations and improvements can be made as to the manner , in which these studies are to be pursued . What is chiefly necessary in order to meet the objection to the study of the classic languages , which has been hinted at above , is simply , that due care should be taken in the selection of books and portions of books . A selection certainly can be made , which , so far from tending to degrade the minds of youth and to leave upon them impressions of an unfavorable kind , will have the opposite effect of infusing sentiments of justice , purity , and magnanimity . In many writers of antiquity there are passages of a moral nature , which might well put to the blush those , who have written in later times and with better advantages for knowing the truth . If Professor /q/ Stuart shouTd be able to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , comprising Cicero 's Treatise on the Immortality of the Soul , has already been published , ) we shall have a work , which surely can not have a bad tendency . But while undoubtedly such a course can be taken in this thing as shall be fully consistent with the interests of the great cause of peace and virtue , it must be obvious , that it is the duty of the higher Institutions of learning to instill into youthful minds principles of moral duty more elevated and heavenly , than can be drawn from the fountains of antiquity . The writers of antiquity had not those moral and religious advantages which we enjoy ; if it had been their happy fortune to have possessed them , perhaps they would have improved them better . It is unreasonable to expect from them principles which are to be found in the Gospel alone , and which came from the lips of Him , who spake as never man spake . While , therefore , we would not insist , that the higher Institutions should lay aside the Classics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors and the parts of authors as the interests of true virtue require ; it is their bounden duty to make those who rch sort to them acquainted with the exalted philosophyi with the-aublime and benevolent Code of the New Tcs* tament . While we do not feel at liberty to deny to theii pupils the opportunity of imbibing instruction from the lips of Socrates , Cicero , and Seneca , and some other tru- ly illustrious names , we would earnestly urge it upon them , to give a prominent and emphatic utterance to the doctrines of Jesus Christ , and to baptize all other philosophy in His . All other systems of philosophy authorize the practice of war ; but the teachings of the Savior , if we understand them either in the letter or the spirit , breath a diviner note . They proclaim peace ; they announce forgiveness ; they return good for evil . /z/ V ,  --  Finally , we take the liberty to make an appeat to men of science and literature . The power , which these men possess , and which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can not easily be estimated too high . But it is with deep regret we are compelled to acknowledge , they have often prostituted their powers and their opportunities to purposes neither beneficial to society nor honorable to themselves . There are multitudes of writers in the English language , ( and we know not that there are good grounds for claiming a greater purity for the literature of other nations , ) who give such false and degrading views of human nature , and inculcate such vicious principles , that it is not safe for youth or for any other persons to read them . There have been other writers of a different stamp , who have combined the purest taste with the highest poetical invention ; but who have struck their lyres in praise of that deceitful gory which is won on the field of battle , while they have not reserved a note for the pacific virtues of the Gospel . How disastrous the influence of such writers has been , it would not be easy to describe . But we indulge the hope of a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more refinement of taste , more purity of sentiment , more regard for the public morals and happiness , a gradual but sure approximation to the sublime purity and benevolence of the Gospel standard . There is a new thing under the sun . Religious men , not nominally so but in reality , men of faith benevolence , and prayer , stand high , even by the consent of their opposers , in the ranks of literature ; men , who like Paul can place themselves on the Areopagus and hold disputation with Philosophers , and like the royal Psalmist , drink inspiration from Siloa 's brook , fast by the Oracle of God . " How encouraging and delightful would it be , if all were such ; if all powers of thought /q/ were baptized into the spirit of religion ; if all powers of imagination were borne upward on the wings of the Celestial Dove ; if all powers of perception , reasoning , and eloquence were consecrated to truth , to purity , and the real happiness of man . /z/ One of the sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian and philanthropist , is the false notions of glory , which are so prevalent among mankind . That there is such a thing as reputation , however , or glory , or whatever other name it may be called by , it is not necessary for our present purpose to deny . If we may without impropriety speak of the glory of the Deity , may we not also speak of the glory of the creatures he has made , at least so far as they bear his likeness and reflect his excellencies i It is true that the term glort is somewhat indefinite , and if we should take time to define its meaning and its shades of meaning , we should be likely to occupy the whole space allotted to this chapter . Without , therefore , entering into this matter , we take it for granted , that there is such a thing as glory , as true glory ; and that every one , when ke uses that term , attaches a meaning to it . /z/ The phrase National Glory suggests something rather more definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifying epithet . National glory , as the phrase is commonly understood , at the present time , ex* presses that species of reputation or honor , which is founded on brave and successful efforts in war . We do not mean to intimate , that such is necessarily its basis , but merely to express the fact , that such at least is its impultd basis . If there is any other foundation of national glory , it is scarcely recognized , and is certainly regarded as of little or no account . Such , therefore , is the perversity of the human mind on this subject , that a nation 's glory is estimated to be nearly in proportion to the national capabilities for destroying the human race in future , and the successful exercise of those capabilities in time past . When an Englishman speaks of the glory of his country , what is it he is thinking of  --  what particular recollections and associations occur to his mind ? His mind is undoubtedly more taken up with the recollection of military achievements , than with any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what his country has done nobly and successfully in war ; on the splendid names of Blake , Howe , and Nelson , of Marlborough and Wellington , and others renowned in the history of his country , particularly in naval warfare ; and is perhaps running over in his mind the spirited lyrics of Campbell , " Ye mariners of England , ' ' Who guard our native seas , " Whose flag has braved a thousand years " The battle and the breeze . And when a Frenchman speaks of the glory of France , what is hi$ train of thought  --  and what are hii reflections ? Is his attention directed to the agriculture of the country , its commerce , its common schools , its social improvement , the progress of the useful arts , advancement /q/ in morals and religion ? Whatever place these may have in his thoughts at other times , it is almost certain that , when his mind is inflated with the grand conception of national glory , they are never thought of . It is the pageant of warriors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his excited memory ; the battle of the Pyramids , the glorious death of Desaix , the wonderful passage of the Alps worthy of the modern Hannibal and the sublime pencil of David , the terrible bridge of Lodi , the victory and the sun of Austerlitz . National glory , therefore , in the common apprehension of the term , is to be regarded as the designation or name of a complex conception , embracing the various elements and capabilities of war , particularly as they have been exhibited in the past history of a country . And as such it is revolved , mused upon , and cherished , till it becomes a sort of personification , a species of animated existence , floating in the air and radiant with celestial hues , and beckoning the beholders onward and upward to the transcendent heights .  --  Now what we mean to say is , that national glory , as thus understood , is a source of unspeakable evil ; and that this false image , which is leading men astray and hurrying them on to deeds of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without some motive , their actions of course take their charac ter , in a greater or less degree , from the views which they may happen to form . Now national glory , existing in this distorted and most injurious form , becomes and is a most powerful motive to action ; stimulating large masses of men with a sort of indescribable fury . So much so , that , although many wars have arisen from caprice , prejudice , and mere rapacity , a greater number have undoubtedly had their origin from erroneous conceptions of national glory . /z/ But how are the evils , which are now complained of , to be corrected ?  --  In the first place , by showing that the glory , which is based upon the elements , capabilities , and spirit of war , is no glory at all ; but rather dishonor , disgrace , and ruin . And , although this is certainly a matter of some difiiculty , yet it can probably be accomplished with suitable pains on the part of those , who feel an interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agency of the press , and communicate extensively the statistics of the expenses of war , the increase of the people 's burdens occasioned by war , the immense loss of human life , the demoralizing effect of standing armies , the innumerable forms of domestic wretchedness originating from national strife , and the eyes of mankind will at last begin to open ; they will arise as from a dream ; the bright form of National glory , based upon war , will change its lustre and look dark and lowering ; and under the impulse of better views , they will dash their idol to the ground and trample it under their feet . In the second place , efforts ought to be made to build national reputation or glory on a more correct foundation. - And in order to this , there must be , amonf other things , a great revolution in literature ; a revolution which is already begun and is perceptibly advancing . As matters now stand , music , painting , statuary , history , poetry , are all subservient to that false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a great change is destined to take place . As an instance and illustration of what has been remarked , we doubt not that the time will come and probably soon come , when history will assume a new form , and be written upon new principles . It is now a mere series of battles . Very little is said of the organization of government , and of the principles , on which governments are in facty or oughi to be adminiatered /q/ ; still less of the progress of the arts and of knowledge in genial , of the character and habits , of the virtues and the vices , of the suiTerings and enjoyments of the great body of the people . Military matters are predominant , and every thing else is thrown into the back ground . But the public mind begins to tire of these details of blood , and to demand another kind of food . ' The multiplication of such works as Hallam 's Constitutional History of England and Pitkin 's Civil and Political History of the United States , ( not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as La Croix 's Review of the Constitutions of the principal States of Europe , President Adam 's Defence of the Constitutions of the United States , and Judge Story 's Commentaries on the American Constitution , ) clearly indicates , that the public taste is becoming less warlike and more civic . So great is the change already taken place , that a debate in Congress , Convention , Parliament , Storthing , or Cortes , on some great constitutional or political question , excites an interest throughout the nation , which a few years since could have been excited only by the announcement of thirty or forty thousand slain in some great battle . And now let people generally begin to feel , that their national glory , at least one great element of it , consists in the excellence of their civil and political institutions rather than in their ability and skill in war , and the war-spirit will soon be sensibly diminished , and the effects will be exceedingly beneficial . A change is going on also , somewhat analagous in its character , in other departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and so unhappily allied to the spirit of war , is beginning to put away the garments rolled in blood , and to array her native beauty in the pure and beautiful vestments of peace . A few years /z/ Before leaving the subject of the means to be employed , in order to secure the triumph of pacific principles , it is proper to say something further of the duty , which is especially incumbent on professors of religion . The subject has already , in repeated instances , been briefly alluded to ; but it is obviously too important to be passed by without some further notice . The church of Christ must take the lead in this great work , or it is in vain to expect it will ever be done . It is believed , that the experiment has already been so far tried as to give satisfaction on this point . Again and again the miseries of war have been described ; the vast expenses and the system of taxation attendant upon a state of war have been insisted on ; appeals have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the subject has been frequently brought before men elevated in political life ; but all in vain . It is true , public attention has been partially gained , and a slight impression has been made adverse to the practice of war ; but the root of the evil has not been touched . The elements of the volcano are still at work under the surface of society , ready to burst forth on a thousand imaginable conjunctures with unmitigated fury . OF THE DUTY OF PRIVATE CHRISTIANS &c.; /z/ But how does this happen ? Why is it , that , after this repetition of warnings and these repeated appeals , the danger is still imminent ? It is because one great means , a means more effective than any other , has been wholly overlooked . Unhappily , with the exception of the Primitive Christians and of a few more recent denominations of Christians comparatively small in number , the appeal has never been made , from the time of Christ down to the present moment , to the Christian church as a church . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion as men , as citizens , and as philanthropists ; but very seldom , and never , in the way of any general and systematic effort , have these appeals been made to them as occupying the distinctive and far higher ground of Christianity . They have never been taught to believe and to feel , as they ought to have been , that they can not be accessory to war and at the same time maintain their Christian profession ; that war and Christianity are in utter and endless conflict with each other . Here is the key of the position ; here is ground to be occupied , which has been almost wholly overlooked ; if this ground shall once be secured , and a barrier firm and impregnable shall be erected here , this tremendous evil will soon cease to spread its devastations over the world . Professing christians occupy precisely the same position in regard to the great pacific reformation , which must sooner or later inevitably take place , that temperate drinkers but recently occupied in respect to the Temperance reformation , which is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years since , and drunkards universally appealed for example and authority to those , who were not drunkards , but nevertheless advocated the right and the expediency of drinking occasionally , only let it be done temperately . Nothing could be /z/ effected under such circumstances ; it was found necessary , that a new principle should be adopted ; before a reformation could reach the drunkards , it was necessary , that there should be an absolute and total reformation of the temperate drinkers . And now we have another great reformation in hand still more important ; and in pursuit of it we declaim against military men and military statesmen ; but we do not touch their conscience ; we do not start them an hair 's breadth from that position of crime and cruelty which we believe they occupy . And why not ? It is because they are sustained by professors of religion ; it is because while they avowedly drink often and deeply into the spirit of war , the followers of the benevolent religion of Jesus support them by drinking temperately ; it is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behold Christians in their own ranks , and hear Christians prajring for their success . This is the secret , as time will assuredly show , of the great strength of that spirit of war , which has so long pervaded the world . If these suggestions are well founded , it can not be denied , that an immense responsibility rests upon the Church ; and we have no doubt , that the time is coming , and coming speedily , when they will be disposed to confess with sincere sorrow , that the immeasurable evils , resulting from the wars in which men have been engaged , are justly chargeable , in a very high degree , to their own stupidity , blindness , and dereliction of principle . We solemnly put it , therefore , to the professors of the Christian religion , how they can answer it to their conscience and their God , that they remain so quietly and stupidly accessory to the evil of war ; by their own admission , one of the greatest evils that ever afflicted our sinful and suffering race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have always assented to the evils of war ; /q/ that they have always maintained it would be for the interests of mankind to leave off war ; the root of the malady is not reached by such methods as this ; ' leviathan is not 80 tomed . " In this case as in others , and more than in most others Christians are bound , by every consideration of duty and of love to Christ 's cause , to oppose the spirit of the Gospel to the spirit of the world ; to put off their shoes from their feet ; and to stand firmly upon the only ground , which will sustsan them in such a conflict , the holy ground of Christian principle . They must learn what the Gospel teaches ; the doctrine of the Gospel , whatever it may be found to be , must be their immutable rule of conduct . When they conform themselves to this rule , and not otherwise , they may be said to act upon principle . And the rule of the Gospel , the principle which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch not , taste not , handle not ; have nothing to do with war ; have nothing to do with the preparations for war ; wash your hands clean , now and forever , from the stain of human blood . But in these views it seems proper to make a distinction between ministers of the Gospel and the great mass of Christian professors . If a great responsibility rests upon professors of religion in general , a still greater rests upon preachers and ministers . All Christians are represented as lights in the world , and are required to let their light shine for the illumination of others ; but ministers are , in some important sense , the light of private Christians* We are persuaded , that no private Christian ought to mistake his duty on this subject ; so explicit are the instructions of the New Testament in regard to it , that no one can justly plead ignorance ; but this does not alter the well-known fact , that private Christians do not , as a general thing , adopt novel principles and practices , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into them and encouraged in the course they take by their stated religious teachers . We come to the conclusion , therefore , that the attention of ministers of the Gospel is particularly called to the subject before us ; that upon them , more than upon any other class of persons , rests the important question , whether wars shall cease from under the whole heaven . It is desirable , that they should weigh well this solemn responsibility . Whether they have done their duty in this matter hitherto , whether they have brought to its investigation all their powers of intellect , and all their spirit of prayer , is for them to determine . If they have not , let them think well of it ; let them compensate , so far as can now be done , for the negligence of the past by the fervent zeal and untiring efforts of the future . If ministers will faithfully do their duty in this thing , there is no question , that the churches will ultimately , and in all probability very soon , respond to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to consider himself as having discharged his whole duty , until he has seen the members of his church formed into a peace society on the Gospel principle o total abstinence renouncing forever , and at all hazards , military enrollments , military musters , the payment of military fines , and all other efforts and contributions of a clearly military nature . What a spectacle would then be presented to the world ! Even impenitent and irreligious men would rejoice in it . Hope would arise in the darkened and depraved mind of the soldier . The eyes of experienced Statesmen would be gladly directed to this transcendent beam of millennial light . Mankind would smile in their sorrows , and say . It is indeed the star of Bethlehem ! /z/ It may be said with some degree of plausibility , that the principles of peace are not the principles of protection ; and that , if we throw off the aspect and attitude of war , we shall not only be insecure against hostility , but shall invite it . Whether this objection involves a fallacy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cordially received as an undoubted truth by many persons , who invest themselves with it as with a shield , and avail themselves of its aid to throw back , to a measureless distance , whatever is addressed either to their understandings or their hearts on the great subject of universal peace . They take their stand upon this simple proposition alone , that no nation is safe without military preparation . They assert with as much confidence , as if they were pleading the authority of a mathematical axiom , that there is no security , and no peace , except on the condition of bloodshed ; that he , who will not fight , mijst make up his mind to become the prey of every species of depredation . Nor can we justly assert it to be altogether without reason , that men so generally take this position , when we remember that the history of the world , with but few exceptions , is the mournful history of international jealousy and strife . And yet we feel in some degree prepared to maintain , ( and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind of the objector himself , ) that , amid all the belligerent elements existing either in individuals or communities , pacific principles are the surest safeguard . We verily believe , that in these principles there is a secret power , a hidden but most effective energy , which is but imperfectly understood . If men had the faith to receive it , they would not fail to find , that the panoply of love is more impenetrable to the attacks of adversaries than that of steel . We hope not to be charged with extravagance . God himself has made provision for this great result . The security , which is to be found in pacific principles , is based in the constitution of the human mind itself . We are so constituted by our Maker , that we naturally feel an interest in innocence and weakness ; and it excites in every man , whose feelings have not been greatly perverted , the deepest disapprobation and abhorrence , when they are made to suffer . Why is it , that little children and women and feeble old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully protected amid the widespread and deepest horrors of war ? Will it be said , that they find their protection in force ? But they exhibit nothing of this kind ; they have no arms ; they present no organization and array of battle ; on the contrary they make their appeal to the PENETRALIA of the soul ; they look for protection to the great principles of humanity alone . A little child was once found on the field of battle by an infuriated soldier of a victorious army . He looked up into Jiis face , and prompted by the protecting instincts of nature , exclaimed , ' ' Do not kill me lam so littk , In such a simple appeal as this , coming from the soul and addressing itself to the original and immutable principles of our nature , we do not hesitate to say , that there is a reality and effectiveness of power . Perhaps there are men to be /q/ found , who would kill the little child in the very act of making this simple and pathetic appeal . But do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them ? Do we not call them base assassins , murderers , and monsters ? Is there one to be found in a million , who would be accessory to such a crime ? It is with the greatest confidence , therefore , we assert , that , in the elements and arrangements of things , a wise and adequate provision is made for the protection of innocence and weakness . It is in consequence of this provision , which a kind Providence has made , that the tempest of war , while it smites the strong man armed , while it rends the oak and the mountain rock , so often leaves uninjured the reed and the flower , that bend submissively before it . We might bring instances , multitudes of instances from common life , where mild and pacific measures have secured that protection , which never would have been yielded to force . There is much philosophy in one of iBsop 's Fables . The sun and the north wind once had a contest , which should first disarm a certain traveller of his cloak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him ; it blew more loudly and angrily , but the traveller , exerting all his strength , held his cloak more firmly and closely than ever . The sun took an opposite course ; he gave no indications of violence and wrath ; he spread over hill and valley the warmth of his purest and gentlest radiance ; the traveller smiled , and at once yielded the cloak to kindness , which he had refused to force . This is a picture of human life . It finds its counterpart all the world over , and it would be an endless labor to exhaust the illustrations and proofs , which every where present themselves . In the early part of the year 1833 , or about that time , an agent of the Bible Society was travelling in the Mexican province of Texas . His course lay through a piece /z/ of woods , where two men waylaid him with murderous intentions ; one being armed with a gun , the other with a large club . As he approached the place of their concealment , they rushed towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they neither struck nor fired . He began to reason with them ; and presently they seemed less eager to destroy him in haste . After a short time he prevailed on them to sit down with him upon a log and talk the matter over deliberately ; and finally he persuaded them to kneel with him in prayer ; after which they parted with him in a friendly manner. * And this is the direct tendency of a pacific and benevolent course ; it touches a chord in every human heart ; it has influence with the most abandoned ; it has power even with the assassin . Nor is this meant as a mere emphatic declaration , which is to be taken with some diminution of its obvious import . We have no doubt , that a traveller would be more safe among an uncivilized and barbarous people , where assaults and assassinations are frequent , without arms than with them , provided it were fcnotrn , that he was unarmed . And in proof of the correctness of this opinion , we will introduce here an extract from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish smugglers , he says , " These smugglers are as adroit as they are determined , are familiarized at all times with peril , and march in the very face of death ; their first movement is a never-failing shot , and certainly would be a subject of dread to most travellers ; for where are they to be dreaded more than in deserts , where crime has nothing to witness it , and the feeble no assistance ? As for myself , alone and unarmed , I have met them without anxiety , and have accompanied them without fear . We have little to apprehend from men /q/ whom we inspire with no distrust nor envy , and every thing to expect in those , from whom we claim only what is due from man to man . The laws of nature still exist for those , who have long shaken off the laws of civil government . At war with society , they are sometimes at peace with their fellows . The assassin has been my guide in the defiles of the boundaries of Italy ; the smugger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his secret paths . qwq I have often thought , that the history of missionary efforts throws some light upon the great , but hitherto generally unacknowledged truth of the protective efficacy of pacific principles . The missionary goes from his native country into some distant and savage land ; he takes up his abode in desert and inhospitable places , among a people of a strange language andferodous habits ; he teaches a new and holy doctrine , altogether at strife with the superstitions and practices of their country ; he has no military arms for his defence , but is in that respect utterly exposed and defenceless . And yet he is entirely secure ; far more so , than if he were girt round with the unholy protection of weapons of war . With a mild and beneficent expression of countenance , he is greeted by rude and ferocious Savages , whose trade has been one through life of hostility and bloodshed . They see that he is a man of peace ; they recognize the exalted and divine nature of the principles of peace ; /z/ they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , ( the voice of that God , whom they have been accustomed to see in the sun and the stars and the woods and the moimtains , ) persuasively whispers , that the man of love and peace is under the special protection of the Great Spirit , and that it would be wrong , as well as dangerous , to do him harm . We would not , however , be understood to deny , that missionaries have sometimes been persecuted , and have sometimes fallen on the trying field of their labors ; but so far as we have been able to learn , it has always happened under misapprehensions , on the part of the Saves , of their true character , intention , and objects . Whenever their character and objects have been fully apprehended , they have stood erect and safe ; they have gone forth amid the perils , that surrounded them , like the pious men of old , who were unharmed in the midst of the fiery furnace ; the mouth of lions has been shut , and the Elliots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their den ; not because a miracle has been wrought in their favor ; but because the God of nature and of revelation has by an immutable purpose linked the lion and the lamb together ; has attached power to peace , has imparted efficacy to love . And we might with propriety refer here to those sects of - Christians , who have adopted the peace doctrine as one of their distinctive tenets ; particularly to the Quakers or Friends . This religious sect is understood to reject altogether the usfe of military arms as a means and resource of defence . Acting upon that leading doctrine of the Savior , that we should love and do good even to our enemies , they call to their aid the protection of no weapons but those of justice and affectionate good will . But who ever hears of a Quaker being insulted , beaten , dragged out of his house , or in any way maltreated and injured /z/ /q/ ' ' Integer vitse scelerisque pur us , ' ' Nod eget Mauri jaculis neque arcu . Even in times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , their dwellings are safe , their persons are respected ; while in mournful contrast , those , who look for protection in the practical application of the pugnacious and military doctrines , are seen wrapped in fire and weltering in blood . We do not mean to tsay , that in no case whatever has a member of those religious sects , who adopt in their full extent the principles of peace , been doomed to sufier violence and injustice ; but we do mean to say , ( and to assert it too with entire confidence , ) that as a general thing they have found in the celestial shield of their amicable principles far more of quietude , far more of protection and happiness , than other religious sects have , who have recognized the right of an appeal to force . History is rich in proofs on this subject . During the first century and a quarter after the settlement of New England , the inhabitants were constantly , with the exception of some short intervals , exposed to attacks from the Savage tribes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants in various places , were entirely safe , although they refused to avail themselves of the protection both of arms and of garrison houses . The Indians said , " They had no quarrel with the Quakers , for they were a quiet , peaceable people , and hurt nobody , and that therefore none should hurt them . " * During the rebellion in Ireland in the year 1798 , ( also in the same country during the Revolution of 1688 , ) the Friends , by keeping true to their peaceable principles , were preserved from the miseries of those disastrous periods . Of the occurrences in 1798 , so far as the Society of Friends was concerned , we have an interesting and circumstantial /z/ account in Thomas Hancock 's Principles of Peace ; a work exceedingly worthy of the attention of the friends of pacific doctrines . Amid the greatest excitement of the public mind , when crimes were frequent and every species of violence was practised , the Society of Friends , although in immediate contact with both of the hostile parties , lost but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his principles to his fears , had taken the coarse of wearing a military uniform and of associating with armed men ; and this was the occasion of his death . The statements , which have been made in respect to the Society of Friends , are corroborated by the history of other pacific sects , the Shakers , Menonists , Dunkersy and Moravians . During the rebellion in Ireland in 1793 , the rebels , it is stated , had long meditated an attack on the Moravian settlement at Grace-hill , Wexford county . At length in fulfilment of their threats , a large body of them marched to the town . But the Moravians , true to their principles in this trying emergency , did not meet them in arms ; but assembling in their place of worship , besought Jehovah to be their shield and protector in the hour of danger . The hostile bands , who had expected an armed resistance , were struck with astonishment at a sight so unexpected and impressive ; they heard the prayers and praises of the Moravians ; they listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets a whole day and night , they with one consent turned and marched away , without having injured an individual. *  --  - The Shakers too have experienced a share of that protection , wliich pacific principles are sure to aflTord . About the year 1812 , the inhabitants of Indi ana were harassed by incursions from the Indians ; but the Shakers , who lived in that region , although they were without garrisons and without arms , appear to - The Friend of Peace , Vol , II , No. 7. /q/ have been entirely secure , while the work of destruction was going on around them . The question was once put to a prominent Chief , why the Indians did not attack and injure the Shakers as well as others . His answer was ; " We warriors meddle with a peaceable people ! That people , we know , will not fight ! It would be a disgrace to our nation to hurt such a people . " * If we turn a- way from individuals and from classes of men , we shall find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the vast moral power of pacific principles . There is within the limits of Italy a little commonwealth , called the republic of San Marino . This is said to be , and probably is , the smallest independent state in Europe ; occupying in its whole circuit a single mountain and two adjoining hills . Its whole extent is about thirty square miles #@# and it comprises in its capital and four villages 7000 inhabitants . The government is in the hands of a senate of three hundred elders , and an executive council of twenty patricians , twenty burghers , and twenty peasants . This inconsiderable republic has existed nearly the same as at present for thirteen hundred years .  --  Within that long period mighty nations have arisen and fallen ; Italy itself has been again and again visited with mighty armies and covered with blood ; crowns have been rent and dynasties have crumbled ; republics too , proud in their military strength , and unwisely disposed to nourish a military spirit , have been swept away from the face of the earth ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered has ever been utterly defenceless , has remained unassaulted and safe . Its weakness and its professedly acting upon pacific principles has been the secret of its strength ; and not the smallness of its territory . No one , intimately acquainted with history , can have failed to perceive , that no territory is so small or so barren as not to be an  --  The Frieiid of Peace , Vol . II . No. 8. /z/ object of national cupidity . And San Marino would long since have been incorporated into the domains of some neighboring and more powerful state , had it not been for the incredible disgrace , which would have attached to such a transactijon . Another instance , illustrative of the views which we are now taking , is the Loochoo Islands , situated in the neighborhood of the Chinese Sea . The people of these Islands are asserted by those , who have visited them , to be ignorant of arms , and of the art and practice of war . As might be expected under such circumstances , they are found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; distinguished for their honesty and integrity ; well acquainted with agriculture , and also with some of the mechanical and manufacturing arts . It does not appear , that their ignorance of war and their reliance on pacific principles renders them more insecure than other nations ; their benevolent and pacific character is the pledge of their security ; they live in peace among themselves and with others , and are happy . The mention of this singular people naturally reminds us of their neighbors , the Chinese . It is well understood , that the Chinese are almost entirely destitute of military resources and power ; nor do they appear to have any military aptitudes and dispositions . But what nation stands more secure ! What nation has experienced fewer violations of its territory , or fewer infractions of its rights ! It is with them , as it was with the Romans in the time of Numa Pompilius . Before the time of that king , Rome was at war with all the neighboring nations ; a great portion of Italy was constantly in arms ; and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans . Numa took a different course from that of his predecessor , the warlike Romulus ; he introduced religious rites and ceremonies ; he endeavored to turn the /q/ attention of his people from warlike pursuits , and to inspire them with a love for the practices and arts of peace ; he quelled the dissensions existing among ; and inculcated upon them *a reverence for the Deity . The neighboring nations , who anticipated from the Romans an interminable war , were filled with astonishment at such an imexpected change . They threw aside their arms , and hailed the Romans as friends . The statement of Livy is , " finitimi populi , qui ante , castra , non lubem , poaitam in medio ad solicitandam omnium cem , criderant , in eam verecundiam adducti sunt , in ' civitatem , in cultum versafi Deorum , viohri ducerttU nefa$P The republic of Switzerland is another instance , favorable to the illustration of our subject . Since the early efforts of that remarltable people to throw off the yoke of Austria and to establish themselves as an independent State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of 500 years , ) they have , with but few exceptions , been at peace with the surrounding nations . While other nations around them , France , the Stalpsipf Italy , Austria , Prussia , Saxony and HoUaiM , he been engaged in an endless series of bloody wars , the Swiss have remained quiet upon their mountains ; have tilled with patience and cheerfulness their rugged soil aod have reaped the rewards of their laborious industry and pacific priirciples in the possession of health , competence , honor , and domestic . enjoyments . Will it h6 said , that the security , which SsiilsKrland has enjoyed , has been owing to the acknowledged fact of the distinguished bravery of her sons . That this has had its weight can not be doubted ; but this circumstance alone does not furnish an adequate explanation . The form of the*Swiss government is that of a confederated republic ; the cantons are dissimilar in religion and habits ; and the bond of the confederacy , while it secures the great object of union , is too feeble to /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravery of her inhabitants and of the facilities for defence furnished by her Alpine position , Switzerland is undoubtedly one of the weakest countries in thjB world .  --  Her citizens are brave undoubtedly , but what does that avail , if there is not strength enough in the General Government to concentrate them in sufficient numbers and for a sufficient length of time in those strong holds , which nature has built up in the midst of her ? Beyond all question it is in the power of some of the Aeighboroig States , to overrun and conquer Switzerland , if they had the disposition so to do ; and yel she remains undisturbed , free , flourishing , happy . And the simple reason is , not that she has any thing like the military strength of England , France , or many other nations , bitt because she exhibits no undue ambition to enlarge her territory , aims at no other object than security within her own limits , is scrupulously upright and honorable in her treaties and political conventions , in a word , endeavors to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Such a nation will always be found to be essentially iiidpregtoble , because it will have in its favor the moral sense of the great community of civilized nations . Another instance in favor of our views is to be found in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylrania . Of the character of the distinguished founder of Pennsylvania , by whose advice its eaily doings were chiefly di- rected and who stamped upon its early history the i ap i ass of his own great mind , it is unnecessary to speak any fur ther than to say , that by its simplicity , benevolence , and strict uprightness , it was the pattern of what every statesman , who wishes Veil to his country , ought to exhibit . He had no ends of violence to accomplish ; and whatever he did , was done in the spirit of justice . And what was the result ? Was his colony the scene of strife /q/ and bloodshed ? So far from it that for seventy years after the forming of his celebrated treaty with the Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , " that it was the only one ever concluded between Savages and Christians , that was not ratified with an oath , and the only one that was never broken , " ) not a single note of warlike preparation was heard . " While , the Puritans of New England , with all their estimable qualities , were involved in frequent and oody wars with the satage tribes , the colony of Penn remained at peace ; the Indians around them , mistrustful through ignorance and violent by habit , recognized with an instinctive quickness the preeminence and sacredness of benevolent principles , held forth the wampum of pacification , and , smoked with their Quaker brethren the calumet of love . It was not the sword , that tamed their unconquerable spirit ; it was not the threatening aspect of military array ; but the simple principle of non-resistance ; a principle so unheard of , so out of the common track , so sublime , so godlike , thfit they bowed down before it as one man . ' And might we not further appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its confederated and national capacity ? The policy of the United States , since the acknowledgement of our independence by Eng . land , has been essentially , and in a very marked degree , pacific . It must be very obvious to any one , who has stiUlied the history of our country , that our rulers have based their expectations of success in their external policy , not so much upon our military power , - as upon the just and equitable principles , which they have endeavored to infuse into that policy . ' Our national expenditures for military and naval purposes , compared with those of other nations of the same amount of population , are exceedingly small . And yet the United States have ever /z/ received , in their intercourse with foreign nations , their fall share of respect and confidence ; they have indeed sometimes , owing chiefly to the peculiarly disturbed state of Europe , suffered great and unmerited injuries ; but they have seldom failed in the end of obtaining ample redress . We certainly hazard nothing in saying , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or better treated , if their policy were of a more martial and belligerent cast . In bringing this Chapter to a close , let us not forget , that the Supreme Being always regards those with a peculiar interest , who , in the " exercise of a sincere and humble reliance upon Him , endeavor to do his will . Human nature is undoubtedlyso consitituted , that a truly and consistently pacific life is the best protection , so far as human agency is concerned , which one can possibly have . But in addition to this , the eye of that God , without whose notice not even a sparrow falls to the ground , watches and guards those , who trust in him . " It is better to trust in the Lord , th to put confidence in princes . " " When a man 's ways please the Lord , he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him . ' * These are his own declarations . Let us take hihi at his word ; and not incur the wo denounced upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charifts and horsemen ; but looked not unto the lloly One df Israel . Let us rather imitate the example of the pious Ezra , when placed in a very trying situation . " And I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way ; because we had spoken unto the king , saying , The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him , but his power and his wrath is against - all them that forsake Him . So we fasted and besought our God for this , and He was etxtreated of us. " /z/ If nations can not , consistently with the principles of the Gospel , go to war with each other , it becomes an important inquiry , what course they shall take in certain emergencies constantly occurring , such as the partial infraction of treaties , the confiscation or detention of property , the non-payment of debts acknowledged to be due , a refusal to reciprocate the privileges of commerce , and the like . In maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all kinds of war , it does not necessarily follow , nor do we intend by any means to assert , that we are bound to subject ourselves to the repetition of such injuries , if we can rightfully and peaceably avoid it . There is one practice already known in the Law of nations and sanctioned by high authority , which we apprehend will be more likely than more violent methods to secure the objects for which war is commonly commenced , and which at the same time possesses the immense advantage of being accordant with the principles of the Gospel . We refer to the practice of Non-Intercourse . It will not surprise us , if the mere soldier , or the man , who is so busy with his own private interests as to have no thought for the sufferings and tears of his fellow men , should contract his lips with contempt at what he will deem , no doubt , a very pusillanimous suggestion . We do not hesitate however , to assert , that , when our efforts to secure with other nationp /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we have nothing to expect but the reiteration of hostility and wrong , the safest course we can take if we consult our interest , and the only course , if we wish to be governed by the principles of the Gospel , is to suspend that intercourse , and leave them to themselves . This is a practice , to which we are not unfrequently obliged to resort in common life . If one of our neighbors is a man of a haughty and capricious temper , if his intractability be obviously such that he takes no cognizance of our good intentions , and is not disposed to reciprocate or even to receive our good offices , having made all the kind advances which we reasonably can , we at length feel ourselves justified in taking the resolution of breaking off all communication . The person , whom we thus discard is ready to engage in a quarrel ; perhaps that is the object of his strange and refractory conduct ; but we do not consider ourselves called upon by our character either as men or as Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; least of all , in the way of bodily and personal conflict . We simply , both for our own sakes and for his , establish a system of NON-INTERCOURSE , and thus leave him to those opportunities of solitary reflection , which sometimes constitute the bitterest wages of iniquity . All moral , religious , and literary associations , formed by voluntary consent , act upon the same principle . If a member of such an association so far diverges from the line of its just and legal requisitions as to place himself in an injurious and hostile attitude , instead of taking the course of breaking his limbs and shedding his blood , they merely institute a non-intercourse , and insist , as a matter beneficial to all parties , upon his temporary or permanent removal . This is the case in churches , which are voluntary associations , formed for moral and religious purposes . When a member of a church pursues a course , obviously /q/ at variance with the principles on which the church is constituted , the other members , after having used suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their circle by suspending or excommunicating him . In other words , they establish a non-intercourse ; a measure , the most simple and effective , as well as being in accordance wijh the mild and benevolent spirit of the Gospel . The principle of non-intercourse is as applicable to nations as to individuals or to private associations ; and happy and glorious will that day be , when it shall be substituted in the affairs of nations for a resort to war . It is not only a remedy , which can be applied ; but a remedy , which will have effect ; it will be more likely than any other to secure the object , for which it is adopted . Let us illustrate the subject . We will suppose , that France owes to the United States a certain sum of money , ' ( say the sum recently in dispute , five millions of dollars , ) and refuses to pay . Then the question before the United States is , if all other means of redress have failed , whether under these circumstances they shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the belligerent measure of reprisals and war . Saying nothing of duty , saying nothing of the sacred requisitions of the Gospel , we may with propriety compare the two measures , on the ground of expediency . If we declare war , or make reprisals in any form , or take any truly belligerent measures , we may well inquire , what we are likely to gain by such a course . In the first place , do we gain the five millions ? Not at all . If there had been no resort to warlike measures , the French might have ultimately paid the srun in question ; but the resort to such measures at once puts the payment at an infinite remove . No one , who is acquainted with the character of the French nation , a people that have always plumed themselves on their warlike 214 or NON-INTERCOURSE IN spirit , will be so foolish as to suppose , ( and the same may be said of almost every other nation , ) that they will pay the five millions , or the millionth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of the five millions the whole loss ? Certainly not . If the war is carried on with vigor , the expense will be at least fifty millions of dollars a year ; and supposing the war to continue five years , which is perhaps a fair estimate of its continuance , we incur the solid burden of two hundred and fifty millions . And if we add to this the loss incurred by the depredations on our commerce and in other ways , we may safely estimate the whole expense and loss to our nation at five hundred millions . And we lose in the conflict at a reasonable estimate fifty thousand men . This is the result ; a loss of five hundred millions of money and fifty thousand men , and tiothing gained ; saying nothing of the demoralization attendant on a state of war , and of the unspeakable sufferings , scarcely er exposed to the public eye , which are experienced in private families . But on the other hand , if we resort to the non-intercourse system , instead of war , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , while we take a course which does not render it dishonorable to the French to pay , we make it their interest to do so . And certainly if the payment of five million of dollars is the original and actual ground of dispute , we are bound by every principle of interest and of duty too , to take precisely that course , if it be a justifiable one , which will be most likely to secure the payment . And in other respects , how numerous are the advantages attendant upon this course ! We incur no expense ; we do not burden the people with excessive taxes ; we lose no men ; we do not suffer , in their countless ways of operation , the demoralizing influences of war . The merchants of course encounter some little inconvenience in altering /q/ the direction of their business and introducing it into new channels ; but this is so trifling as to be scarcely worth mentioning . But if these statements are correct , how does it happen , that nations have ever been so averse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to plunge into war ? It is owing in a great degree , undoubtedly , to the prevalence of false and unchristian notions of honor . This is the secret of their strange conduct ; and it is here we find the great difficulty , which is in the way of correcting that conduct . The system of non-intercourse is regarded as cowardly and pusillanimous , while that of war is looked upon as courageous and noble ; a false notion , which enlightened policy and Christian feeling are beginning to correct . Mankind are beginning to open their eyes on this subject ; they have long and deeply felt the immeasurable evils of war ; and are at last convinced of the futility of warlike measures as a means of redress . And the time is coming , when the nation , that shall substitute non-importation and non-intercourse measures for a resort to arms , instead of being accounted mean and pusillanimous , will encircle itselt with a wreath of true glory , that shall grow brighter and brighter till the end of days . But this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be governed by the principles of the Gospel , we have no other resource . Acting on the principles of our great charter , which Jesus Christ has died to confirm , we are solemnly bound not to return evil for evil , not to give place to wrath , not to avenge ourselves ; in a word , not to engage in war of any kind . The suspension of intercourse is the extreme remedy , which is allowed us ; and this is to be resorted to only in extreme cases . And it is an omen of good and glorious import , that distinguished politicians begin to occcupy the position , which the Gospel here allows us . It is enough for our present /z/ purpose to mention Mr. Jefferson . The whole aspect of his Administration was pacific . It is but justice to this distinguished man to allow , notwithstanding the asperity with which his character has sometimes been treated , that he possessed an intellect of the most capacious grasp , and a heart endued with the kindly and benevolent sensibilities . He saw clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments , war , and slavery ; and denounced them not with a humble whisper and affected meekness , but openly and boldly . He distrusted power , particularly military power ; because history had taught him , that , in ninety nine cases out of an hundred , it had been perverted and abused to purposes of oppression . And this perhaps accounts for some measures in his Administration , which appeared singular enough to the advocates of the war policy . Abundance of ridicule was thrown on his gun-boat system , and his non-intercourse system , on his ultra-democracy , his experimental agriculture , and his philosophy ; but it already begins to be whispered , that he both thought and acted with a foresight in advance of the age , in which he lived . Undoubtedly he did . And Christians , who deeply lamented some peculiarities in his religious views , will not be slow , nor wanting in cordiality , in their commendation of his foresight , his independence , his regard for equal rights , his abhorrence of injustice , his broad and glowing views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the man , saying nothing of others standing high in the ranks of politicians , who has given his seal , the ample and bright stamp of his expansive mind to the doctrine of non-intercourse as a practical and effective principle in the regulation of the affairs of nations . /z/ Closely connected with the doctrine of peace is that of Capital punishments . The true basis of the doctrine of peace is not absolute non-resistance ; the existence of civil government , in the exercise of its authority to con-i trol and to punish , is obviously recognized in the Scriptures ; and there are some extreme cases , ( very few indeed , but still some extreme cases , ) where resistance and the use of force , so far as is necessary to disarm and confine the assailant , are justifiable and a duty ; but the basis of the great doctrine of peace , the one immutable principle , on which it stands and stands forever , is the INVIOLABILITY OP HUMAN LIFE . Humau Ufc is sacrcd ; it is the gift of God ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create ; and no hand of man or angel , no principality or power of heaven or earth can lawfully touch it without the permission of that Being , who gave it existence . Hence the propriety and importance of saying something on the subject of Capital punishments . We oppose the practice of inflicting such punishments , FIRST , on the ground of scripture prohibition , secondly , on the ground of reason and experience ; and shall accordingly treat of the subject in that order . /z/ // It is our object in this Chapter to show , that the infliction of Capital punishments is unjustifiable and wrong , when viewed in the light of the Scriptures . And here we would make the remark as worthy of some notice , that the advocates of war and of Capital punishments seem disposed to support their doctrines , so far as they conceive them to depend on the Word of God , by a reference to the Old Testament rather than to the New . But certainly we ought to keep in mind , thafe successive dispensations , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all preparatory to the coming of the Savior ; that the revelations of the Old Testament are obviously and confessedly imperfect ; and that the code , which stands elevated and complete , without any admixture of perishable elements , and which emphatically binds all mankind at the present moment , i6 that of the New Testament . - The prominent passage of the Old Testament , which , in the opinion of the advocates of Capital punishments , authorizes the adoption of the retaliatory principle even to the taking of life , is as follows : " Whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed . " Gen , 9:6 . In commenting on these expres8ions , we remark , in the first place , that they are obviously not to be understood as a command , authorizing and requiring every one , by his own act and in his own person , to put to death any and every other individual , who has been guilty of murder . Such an interpretation , if carried out in practice , would soon fill the world with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are to be understood as a command , authorizing and requiring even the civil magistrate to see this done ; there is certainly nothing said in the passage itself , which throws the responsibility of carrying it into effect on the civil magistrate ; and such an inference , although it might not necessarily be in opposition to the passage , is /q/ nevertheless not strictly deducible from it . We propose , therefore , to consider the passage , not in the light of a command , but rather as an anticipation or prediction , ( or what is perhaps the more precise expression in this case , ) a denunciation of what may confidently be expected to take place . In other words , we regard it as merely expressive of a great retributive fact in nature and in the overruling Providence of God , that he , who designedly and wickedly takes human life , shall assuredly , in some way or other , meet with severe punishment , and will probably come to a violent end . It will probably not be questioned , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiting with the sword , and the like , are sometimes used metaphorically in that way , viz. , to denote a severe punishment , and particularly a punishment accompanied with more or less of violence . And we may add further , that this interpretation of the passage under consideration will appear the less exceptionable , if we substitute WILL for shall , which undoubtedly the indefinite nature of the Hebrew future will authorize us to do ; so that the passage may read , " whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man will his blood be shed , " retaining the idea of futurity , but excluding the idea of requisition and command , which is implied in the English verb SHALL . Taking the passage in that general sense , which has now been attached to it , it may be regarded as essentially parallel with another in the fifty-fifth Psalm , where it is said , " bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days . " This passage is not to be taken literally and just as it stands ; nobody interprets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general fact , which , in the constitution of things and in the Providence of God , is always found to be realized , that bloody and deceitful men do not prosper , but always meet with disappointment and suffering even in the present life . /z/ There is another passage in the twenty second chapter of Exodus , which throws light upon the expressions under consideration . " Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child . If thou afflict them in any wise , and they cry at all unto me , I will surely hear their cry . And my wrath shall wax hot , and I will kill you with the siford . " We are not to suppose , for we know that it was not the fact , that every oppressor of the widow and the fatherless was actually put to death by the sword . The passage simply expresses the great fact in the moral administration and Providence of God , that the divine displeasure rests upon such persons , and that in the end their conduct will meet with a severe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament , which seem to be precisely parallel to the one under consideration ; one as follows , Matt. 26 : 52 ; " All they , that take the sword , shall perish with the sword ; " in other words , those , who resort to acts of cruelty and violence , will find themselves exposed to simitar acts in return ; a general and indefinite statement for what every one knows to be the fact in respect to such persons . Another passage is to be found in Revelation 13 : 10 , as follows , " He , that leadeth into captivity , shall go into captivity ; he that killeth by the sword , must bekilled by the sword . " A similar interpretation isto be given here. * This , then , we suppose to be the . meaning of the passage in Genesis , that , he who sheds man 's blood , shall not escape ; he shall assuredly come to some evil end ; he will sooner or later be overtaken by some dreadful punishment . And is not this the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark of Cain is stamped upon murderers , and they are lost and ruined men , even if the civil magistrate does not touch them . /z/ /q/ All nature frowns upon them ; the very stones cry out ; dome perish by quarrels in the streets ; some seek a refuge on the ocean and are drowned ; some are put to death by their fellow-men from feelings of revenge , some are killed in war , some put themselves to death by violent means , some die of pure remorse and anguish of spirit ; and in one way or other , as sure as there is a God in heaven , who requires the blood they have shed at their hands , they all sooner or later come to a miserable end . Even the executioner , who sheds blood in compliance with the law , is looked upon with abhorrence . His office is a hateful one , as it always has been , * detestabile camificis ministerium ; " men scorn to give him the right hand of fellowship ; they flee from his presence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether even Ae , entrenched as he is within the forms of public justice , is exempt from the fearful doom , which a righteous Providence has pronounced upon all murderers . And this view of the subject is confirmed by God 's treatment of Cain . When that cruel and wicked murderer slew his brother Abel , did God require the civil magistrate or any body else to put him to death ? So far from it , he declared , whoever should slay Cain , vengeance should be taken on him seven-fdd . Nevertheless he was cursed from the face of the earth ; like Adam when he sinned , if he did not die bodily , he died mentally ; in the metaphorical sense at least , the sword was upon him , and his blood was shed ; he was a fugitive and a vagabond , and he confessed , in the anguish of his spirit , that his punishment was greater than he could bear . But , in the second place , if we take the ground , as some are disposed to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , and that it authorized and /z/ required those , to whom it was addressed , to put every murderer to death , still it is not binding upon us at the present day . Indeed it is wholly overruled and annihilated in its practical application , in the Old Testament itself . It must be obvious , that it continued to have effect only till the promulgation of the Ten Commandments . If the supposed command to Noah authorizes us to kill , the command of the Decalogue , given at a later period and of course overruling whatever went before , says , THOU shalt not kill . In the investigation of this subject , it is useless to go further back than this great announcement . In respect to the taking of life , the SIXTH commandment is to be regarded as the " beginning of days . " What went before is subordinate , thrown into shadow , and annulled . We must accordingly take our stand here , and reason from this point . It will be noticed , that the command is given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , some may maintain , that it means simply , thou shalt not maliciausly kill ; thou shalt not kill with evil inierU ; thou shalt not murder . But we are compelled to look upon this as a wholly gratuitous limitation . We have already had occasion , in the eleventh chapter , to remark on the meaning of the Hebrew word , which is used in the sixth Commandment . There is nothing in the Hebrew term itself , and nothing in the immediate connection , which requires us to limit the command in this way . It is to be presumed , that no one , who heard the announcement of this solemn precept , would have dared to put a human being to death for any cause whatever , without an express divine permission subsequently given , which suspended its effect in particular cases . The Ten Commandments were not given to be trifled with . God himself descended with flames and thunder ; never was there before , in the history of man , such a striking visi- EXAMINED BY THE SCtIPTURES. /z/ his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as we can judge , for the purpose of imparting additional solemnity to the few and simple Laws , which were then made known . And what is an interesting fact , showing that the promulgation of the Ten Commandments is entirely a distinct thing from any previous or subsequent announcement , we . have not only these striking circumstances preceding it ; but it is said in Deuteronomy , at the close of this great event , and he ADDED NO MORE . So that obviously the promulgation of the Ten Commandments is not to be confounded with any other communication whatever . We do not deny , however , that the practical operation of the precept , thou shalt not kill , was subsequently suspended . It was so . The Supreme Being , in his capacity of civil ruler of the Jews , saw fit to incorporate the principle of " life for life " into the Jewish civil code . But it does not appear , that He permitted this , because there was any thing in natural justice which absolutely required it ; for we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of the heinous crime of murdering his own brother , God forbade that any one should take his life . And Lamech , who was afterwards guilty of murder , pleads the precedent of Cain 's exemption from the punishment of death , as peculiarly applicable in his own case . He permitted it , therefore , for reasons connected with the peculiar condition and character of mankind ; or in other words , as was said in another case , which obviously throws light upon that before us , on ( account of the hardness of men s hearts Matthew , 9:6 . He saw that they were so little advanced in the knowledge and practical application of the principles of government , and at the same time by reason of the hardness of their hearts were so wholly given up to suspicion , violence , and discord , as to render the permission of the /z/ k* belligerent principle of an eye for an eye , tooth for tooth , life for life , in some degree necessary under the circumstances actually existing . It was on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other to death , in the same way as it was on account of their sin that he permitted them to practice polygamy , and to give the writing of divorcement . Or another scriptural illustration of the course of the divine- proceeding in this matter may perhaps be equally to the purpose , to be found in the hundred and sixth Psalm . They soon forgat his works ; they waited not for his counsel ; but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness , and tempted God in the desert . And he gave them their request , but sent kanness into their son/ . " We proceed now , in the thikd place , to remark , that the sixth Commandment is recognized and reenacted in the New Testament , unaccompanied by any exception or suspension whatever ; a view of the subject , which is particularly important in its bearings upon us in the present age of the world . The following passages will abundantly verify the correctness of the ground , which is now proposed to be taken . " And behold , one came and said unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , that I may have eternal life ? And he said unto him . Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God ; but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments . He saith unto him , Which ? Jesus said . Thou shalt do no murder , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thoa shalt not bear false witness . " Matthew , 19 : 16 , 17 , 18 . It is perfectly clear from this passage , that the Savior gives his sanction to the portion of the Old Testament which is so expressly referred to , and that he adopts it as a part of his own ex* alted system of doctrine and practice . And this is in accordance with what he says in another place Matthew /q/ 5 : 16 , 17 . Think not that I am come to destroy the Law , or the Prophets ; I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil . For verily I say unto you , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
