txt TuE English language , among its numerous wants , needs such a word as nationalit* may we coin one for our present purpose , and talk about nationality ? But do not be startled , reader , and hastily shuffle over the leaves of this article , for it is not meant to be a dry essay , nor an allusion even to politics , with which , in sooth , you have been drugged to satiety . Nationality , *eated philosophically , , would , indeed , be a dry subject ; because , in order to find the origin , and explain the causes of the difference of character which exists among nations , and out of which springs patriotism , we must not only ascend the stream of time to its source in the creation , and watch men dividing off into tribes ; but we must plunge into the depths of the human heart , and enter upon that wide sea of speculation where metaphysicians are lost in mists of their own creation . In the very remotest periods of history we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , and national feeling , but also in the very color of their skins , and the forms of their bodies ; and we are forced to adopt the opinion , either that different impresses were stamped upon them at the beginning of the world , or else that they must have been created thousands of centuries ago ; for , since we know that the three thousand years last past have effected little or no change in their characteristics , it can not be that it should have been brought about in double or treble that time . Now Divine Revelation forbids the latter supposition , while it says nothing to militate against the former ; and we are thus relieved from a thousand embarrassing inquiries into the operation of climate , government , religion , &amp;c. ; none , nor all of which , can ever explain the difference between some of the tribes of men : as between the Gipsey , the Georgian , and the Hottentot . We can find instances on record ofa people changing their religion , their government , and their language ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages their characteristic marks of dis // tinction in spite of the continual action of causes sufficient to efface every thing but innate propensities and distinctions . But , although this subject is of too great extent and importance to be compressed into the short space allotted for a single article , it may be ( Ii vided , and its principal features illustrated by a single historical example : we shall , therefore , abandon any attempt to explain the principles of what may be called the natural laws of political union , and take an example ,  --  a detached case ,  --  and point out in it the operation of those laws . The case selected for this purpose is that of the people of Greece ; and we shall endeavor , by tracing their history through those ages in which it is least known , to show the causes of the preservation of their old national character . Common-place as may seem the subject of the history of Greece , and familiar as are its important points , not only to every scholar , but to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers have lost their interest in it . Where is the scholar who reveres not the alrn.a mater of the world ; whose imagination has not been employed in picturing Athens as she was in the days of her glory ; the groves where Plato walked ,  --  the broad streets lined with porticoes and porches where Socrates and his disciples taught ,  --  the magnificent squares and market-places , where , amid the statues of the departed great , the people of Athens assembled to learn or defend their rights ,  --  and , above the whole , the lofty Acropolis , so studded with temples , and columns , and monuments , that it seemed a mountain of sparkling marble , wrought into fantastic shapes by fairy hands , and crowned by the majestic Parthenon , the glory of Gree*e , the wonder of the world ? There can be no scholar who does not feel an interest in that people who , at one time , exhibited such a brilliant spectacle of the intellectual powers of man , who carried the arts to a degree of perfection which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tl'iat people must be to him a pleasing study , especially if from their history he can learn lessons which may now be applicable and useful . Permit us , then , to allude to some of the l ) hases through which the Greeks have passe ( I in their progress from the zenith of power and refinement , down to the nadir of ignorance and degradation ; but , first , to make a few remarks suggested by the actual appearances of the country . One of the first things which surprises the simple traveler in Greece , is that so much learned speculation should have been thrown away upon the causes of the existence of separate states , so near to each other , yet so entirely independent ; for the very nature of the country seems to explain it . Greece is every where intersected by chains of mountains , running irregularly in all directions ; these are not formed as in other countries by a gradual rise from the sea , but they start out , rugged and precipitate , from the smooth level of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Egean , the bowsprit of your ship may touch the rocks on the shore , while the keel is far from the bottom ,  - -  so , in driving along the plains of Greece , you may skirt the rocky wall which rises rapidly to a mountainous height , without your horse leaving the smooth green sward which stretches away for miles , till bounded by a similar wall on the other side . On these vast and fertile plains you can see no relic of ancient times , though the ploughshare of the husbandman sometimes turns up the coins , and metal implements of // his forefathers . But on every mountain top , on every projecting crag , you see the venerable ruins of castles , the massy walls , the heavy towers which mark the Acro-polis of the surrounding country . From the plain of Argos , you may see the walls of Tyrynthus , which Homer says were built by the Cyclops ; the towers of Larissa ; the heights of Nauplion , and the domains of Agamernuon , king of men ; yet all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law were sufficiently strong to protect men , they built castles on some rugged height ; they went out upon the plains only in the day time , and came into the castle with their cattle and tools at night . As they became stronger , they built houses outside of the castle walls , and retired only on the approach of an enemy ; and when the community became too numerous tbr the castle to hold them , they enclosed the space around it with high walls , and thus formed their city ; while the existence of the fortress above , gave the opportunity to some adventurous person to seize upon it and power together . The proximity of these castles is another remarkable circur stance for we hear so much of the power of Athens and of Sparta , we conceive such high ideas of the domains of the kings and rulers of Greece , that we suppose they must have been extensive ; and nothing shows more strongly the different excellencies of different ages , than a comparison of the facilities for communication in ancient and modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree of perfection , which we can hardly hope ever to imitate in this country ; yet how inferior was she in the means of producing and communicating objects of comfort to the people . Athens and Lacedremon were far-off rivals ; it was a long journey , through various and hostile states , from one to the other . Yet with our means of communication we might leave Athens in the morning , pass the Megaride and through the Corinthian domains , cross the kingdom of Agamemnon , and the states of Nemea and Argos , travel the whole extent of the Laceda*monian territory , traverse Messenia , and the realms of old King Nestor , and arrive at Pylus before night . In regarding these castles , and the relics they contain , besides the indescribably pleasant , yet melancholy associations which they revive , the traveler is struck with the marks which they bear of the different state of the arts of architecture and sculpture , during the different periods at which they were altered , extended , or repaired ; and he is led into reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the bottom he wilt see the wall composed of common unhewn rocks , of flinty hardness , and incalculable weight , piled rudely upon each other , and foTming , from their immense size and ponderosity , a barrier strong as the base of a mountain . These are the Cyclopian rein ains , formed before the art of building was known , and yet such was the size and weight of the materials , that they are the most durable of all ; and the most extraordinary part of it is , that while the buildings were so rude , men should have been acquainted with the machinery necessary to hoist to the tops of tlieir walls huge blocks of flint-stone of more than a hundred tons weight . On the top of this lower stratum you may find layers of smaller stones , of irregular shape , rough on the front but with the sides fitted to each other-marking a step in the art of building , an improvement // of a later age ; above this , another layer of square hewn stones ; then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to indicate that the working of stone had arrived to great perfection ; then , above this , comes the brick-work of the Romans , indicating a decline of the art ; on this is reared a tower , constructed , perhaps , by the Venitians , of mortar and small stones ; and , to crown the whole , some wretched wood-work , the platform for a cannon , of Turkish or Greek construction . What a lesson does such a sight teach to us ! Where will you find in history , a page so impressive , as the moral written by the finger of time on the old gray walls of Corinth or Athens ? A walk among  --  the ruins of the buildings within these castles is alike interesting and instructive ; and we can learn much , not only of the character of the people who constructed them , but of the influence of the various political and civil institutions in different ages , upon this character ; nor does any thing show more strongly the importance of such institutions , than a contemplation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the Greeks carried the fine arts ; we know that , taking them in the rude state in which they existed in Egypt and the East , they rapidly brought them to a wonderful degree of perfection ; and the gradations in this progress we can trace in the remaining ruins " First unadorned , And nobly plain , the manly Doric rose ; The Ionic then with decent matron grace Her airy pillar heaved ; luxuriant last The rich Corinthian spread her wanton wreathThe whole so measured true ,  --  so lessened off By fair proportion , that the marble pile Formed to repel the still or stormy waste - Of rolling ages , light as fabri s looked That from the magic wand aerial rise . " Some speculative men have endeavored to explain the superiority of the ancient Greeks in the arts , by the peculiarities of their climate ; while others attribute it to the influence of the governments , or the patronage of individuals ; but if climate made men of brilliant genius , then should Greece always have produced them ; if government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they should have appeared and disappeared as the governments changed their character . But may we not better explain the superiority by reflecting upon the national character , and observing the modifications given to this character by the different so ' *ial feelings and social institutions in different ages . We hold that the tone and organization of society has more influence upon the arts and upon learning , than any and all other circumstances ,  --  and the history of the arts in Greece goes strongly to confirm our belief . The Greeks , as a people , are intelligent , and have a keen sense of the grand and beautiful ,  --  in other words , have taste ; now peculiar , political and social institutions have drawn this forth or kept it down in different ages ; but no edict of anj of their various governments has been able to call it forth at will . When Athens was in her glory , painting , sculpture , architecture , all the arts and sciences , in fine , were held in high repute ; the people honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they dignified the professions by enacting that no slave should ever exercise them ; and the laurel crown was // a higher honor than a diadem of gold . When Polygnotus refused payment for his painting of the Trojan war , though pressed by the people to name his price , he was rewarded by a decree of the Amphyctionic council , that wherever he went he should be the guest of the nation , and it was forbidden to take money of him . Nor did the government alone direct these matters ; there are proofs that the assembled people interested themselves directly ; in one instance , when Pericles was directing some work of magnificence , and heard the people talking about the immense cost , he turned and asked them if they would allow him to pay it out of his own fortune , and inscribe on the building , " Erected by Pericles ? " " No ! no ! " cried they all ; " let them be paid for from the common treasury , that we may all share the glory . " Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop genius in a people , must be secondary to the question of whether , under the one as under the other , the people can place the fiat of their approbation upon the artist ; and surely this is not the case ; the government may decree a crown of laurel , but unless the people hold this crown in honor , as well might the artist wind a wisp of straw about his brow . This is clearly shown in the fate of the arts after the conquest of Greece by the Romans . The Romans never were a people of taste ; it was not in their national character , and no government could make them so ; and when the crowd of Greek artists resorted to Rome , though they were supported and pampered by the state , they soon dwindled , because hey were not honored in the eyes of the people . Others were brought over , and every thing was done which imperial munificence could do , to revive the arts ; but in vain  --  the profession of the artist was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquered nation , by slaves , and it sunk to insignificance . Compare the monuments of Rome with those of Athens ,  --  look at the relics which were brought to Rome from Greece , and see how the inspiring touoh of genius is stamped upon the one , and the mark of decay upon the other . Some of the emperors , despairing of making the artists execute their statues equal to those from *ii*reece , used to knock off the heads of statues of the Grecian heroes , and cause their own likenesses to be placed upon the bodies . Does not this show also that the Roman people , like our own gentlemen now-a-days , encouraged only those artists who could administer to their personal vanity , by producing good heads and busts as mere likenesses ; while they neglected every other branch of the arts ? for we find that of the marbles left us by those ages , the busts and heads alone are excellent ; the statuary and the buildings are in inferior style . Quickness of perception and taste are national characteristics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain degree , under the most adverse circumstances . When , upon the revival of learning in Italy , the arts began again to flourish , they were indebted much to refugee Greeks ; the mosaic owes its perfection , and partly its origin , to them ; and even in this age , slaves as they have been to the Turks in body , they are their masters in the arts ; and distinguish themselves above all the subjected people of the Turkish empire . If a great mosque is to be built , a Greek 's head superintends , and Greek * // mechanics execute ; and none but Greeks can build the shipping or cast the cannon . It is really astonishing to see a master-workman build ships of beautiful form and great swiftness , without a model , without even knowing the principles of mensuration , or being able to calculate the square or cube of a number ; he builds he knows not how ; he carries a model in his mind , and produces a light and elegant vessel . Ship-building is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study ; nay , which has not been almost forbidden them ; and , in that , they have so far excelled , that the Creek ships are decidedly the most beautifully modeled of the Mediterranean , and for lightness , beauty , and speed , can compare with our own . Without pretending that those peculiarities which constitute national character are more strongly stamped upon the Greek than upon other nations , we would , nevertheless , insist , that , as a people , they have never lost their identity ; that they never have been swallowed up by the torrent of invasion , and confounded with other races . Nay , more ; we maintain that they have preserved , to a very considerable degree , the distinguishing traits of their old national character , and that under every favoring circumstance , this character has developed itself and will continue so to do . When we consider how often the storm of invasion has swept across the plains of Greece , how her people have been made to drain to the very dregs the cup of humiliation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their original character remains , and forced to confess that the original impress must have been very strong . First the Romans reduced Greece to the state of a servile province ; her semi-barbarous comnanders carried not only havoc among the inhabitants , but ruin among her monuments . Next came the Scythians with fire and sword . Then Alaric led his savage Goths through the valleys and over the plains of Greece , scattering death and destruction around them , and marking their track with the ashes of cities and the bones of the people . Then followed centuries of darkness and oblivion , in which we lose sight of the very name of Greece . Then come a swarm of crusaders , like locusts , to devour the substance , and crush the spirit of the people . At last the Venitians get possession , and rule the land with a rod so severe , with a system so subversive of every moral principle , every national feeling , that Greece may be said to have gained , when the hundred years ' struggle terminated ,  --  when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the walls of the Parthenon. flow instructive is the history of the fortunes and the miseries of poor Greece to every man ! but , to the classic scholar , the subject is doubly dear ,  --  dear , even when contemplated at borne ; but when he stands in the pass of Thermopyla* , when he treads on the graves of the heroes of Marathon , or leans pensive against the broken columns of the Parthenon-then he feels the force of the lines of a noble bard he feels , that Where'er he treads , t is haunted , holy ground ; No earth is lost in vulgar mould , But one vast realm of wonder spreads around , And all the muses tale seems truly told , Till the sense aches with gazing , to behold // The scenes his earliest dreams have dwelt upon Each hill and dale , each deepening glen and wold Defies the power which crushed the temples gone Age shakes Athena 's towers , hut spares grey Marathon . He feels that Greece is no lightsome land of social mirth ; . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region of his birth , When wandering slow hy Delphi 's sacred side , Or gazing on the plain where Greek and Persian di d . But with his melancholy reflections the scholar mingles some feelings of pleasure , when he reflects that such is the charm of knowledge ,  - -  such the irresistible claim of genius and taste upon the respect of mankind , that it exerted great sway even over barbarians ; and Athens , guarded only by the panoply of her glorious name , escaped the utter ruin which fell upon . Laced*mon , Corinth , Thebes , and other cities , her superiors in power and in arms . In the civil war of the Romans , when Greece was the arena on which two mighty champions struggled for the sceptre of the world , the people of Athens ,  --  espousing what they thought the republican cause ,  --  thre*v up their caps and shouted , " Long live Great Pompey ; " and when the magnanimous Ca*sar had carried all before him , and Athens was at his mercy , he said , " 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how much more surely can we count upon the impulses of a naturally generous soul , than upon those factitious characters who pretend to stifle the voice of nature with the maxims of philosophy ; how different was the conduct of Brutus from that of his great , his murdered friend ; for we find him before the battle of Philippi promising his soldiers the beauty and booty of Sparta , if they gained the victory , because Sparta , faithful to the memory of C*sar , had enlisted in the cause of his avengers . Her excellence in the arts , in literature , in refinement , still threw about Athens an irresistible charm , and secured her importance long after Sparta had fallen , not onl.y into complete insignificance , but even into contempt . How sudden and mighty is the change , when within a few years after their conquest of Athens , we find the descendants of the proud Spartans pleading in the courts of Rome for justice against the Messenians , who had seized upon a temple which they claimed ,  - -  the temple of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laceda*mon had begun the Messenian wars . At this time Athens too had fallen from her high estate , but her walls were crowded with the young , the rich , the noble , the aspiring , from every land ; parents named their children after the great men of her history ; kings and princes came on classic pilgrimages to her shrines ; and Adrian thought the title of emperor not glorious enough , until he had added that of Archon of Athens . The poets of Rome sang her praises ; the name of Athens was ever in the mouths of Horace and Virgil ; and Cicero followed the crowd to learn the lessons of wisdom and taste , in the birth-place of genius , and among the chef d'euvres of art . Until the sun of knowledge went down in the darkness of the middle ages , Athens was still the light , the eye of the world ; and , in the beautiful language of Chateaubriand , " when Europe roused herself from the sleep of barbarism , her first cry was for Athens ,  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known that her ruins existed , men turned their melancholy steps towards them , as though they had found the ashes of their mother . " In the examination of their nationality , the question arises , To what must we attribute the preservation of the identity of the Greek race through ages of barbarous ignorance and humiliating oppression down to the present time , when the day-star of Grecian glory is again appearing above the horizon ? And they seem to be , first , the adoption of the Christian religion ; second , the preservation of their native tongue ; third , the existence , in all ages , of hardy independent mountaineers , who , in the fastnesses of Greece , have kept alive the sacred fire of liberty ; and , fourth , the preservation of their peculiar municipal institutions . First , the influence of the Christian religion . When Constantine transferred the seat of empire from Rome to Constantinople , he embraced Christianity , and all the Greeks became its proselytes ; and , had the unity of religion long continued , such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greek character would have been lost in the Roman ; but the schism soon took place and separated the two churches completely . The empire of the West fell under the oftrepeated blows of the barbarians* Rome was enslaved , while Byzantium was free ; and the whole Greek nation , clinging to their religious faith , were preserved by it during the convulsions which preceded the fall of the empire of the East . Next came the Crusaders , on their errand of folly ; and , holding every man a heretic that would not bow the knee to the cross , and kiss the toe of the Pope , they persecuted the Greeks because they rejected the supremacy of his Holiness , and clung to the robes of their patriarch ; and persecution , we know , but heightens religious zeal . The Greeks would have been in greater danger of losing their national character , during the long sway of the Venitians over their country , had not these good Papists held the schismatics in abhorrence ; and the difference of religion acted as a repulsive principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact , no more united than does *il with water . Next came the turn of the Turks , and then not only were the Greeks secure , by different faith , from amalgamation , but the cord of their national union was strengthened by the policy of Mahomet and his successors ; a policy much more liberal than that of the Crusaders ; who , with the peaceful banners of Christ over their heads , and his lamb-like precepts in their mouths , nourished the feelings of tigers in their hearts , and wielded the sword of extermination with their hands . Mahomet granted his protection to the Christians , and his religion forbad them to be converted by force , so long as they paid a tax for their heads ; nay , when he visited the monastery of Mount Sinai , he gave to the monks a charter , containing important privileges ; and , as he could not sign it with a pen , he dipped his fingers and thumb in the ink , and placed them under the parchment ; thus making his mark , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still in existence . Mahomet II . after he had taken Constantinople , saw at once the policy of keeping up the hostility between the Greek and Romish // churches , and he established the Patriarchal throne in Constantinople ; making the Patriarch not only head of the Greek church , but enabling him , by certain important privileges , to be really the head and rallying point of the Greek nation . The Patriarch exercised a sway over every church in Greece ; he had a court which judged even in laical affairs , and he could condemn to prison or to the galleys any Greek , without it being in the power of the Sultan even to cancel the sentence . The only way a Greek could escape going into prison , to exile , or to the galleys , was to cry out that he wished to embrace Mahometanism , and straightway he was delivered from the hands of the guard , and could shake his turbaned head in defiance , under the very beard of the Patriarch . There is , or was , among Mussulmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarism and good feeling ; they almost always respected the Greek monasteries ; and there have been instances of the gracious notice of Sultans toward Christian nunneries ; notwithstanding , as a Greek author observes , they are so ungallant as to deny women even a little rivulet of honey in Paradise , while they grant to men whole rivers of delicious beverage ; for it is a fact , that the nuns of an Italian convent , having had their furniture destroyed by the fanatic republicans of France , and being instigated , probably , by some wag , did , in their simplicity , send a petition to his pious Highness the Grand Seignior , for three Turkey carpets , one green , one blue , and the other rose color . This petition was granted , as soon as read , and the Sultan gallantly selected and forwarded the carpets , with his compliments , to gladden the eyes and warm the feet of the good-natured sisters . The monasteries , which sprung up in every retired nook and corner of Greece , served other purposes than merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity of the Greek faith ; within their walls were secreted many precious manuscripts ; to them retired men of talent and learning , who kept up the literature and l ) reserved in its purity the language of the country ; and all the religious services were performed in the ancient Greek ton ue . The monasteries of Mount Athos were the most singular in Greece , and form an interesting study for antiquarians . Athos is the immense rocky peninsula , through the neck of which Xerxes attempted to cut a canal , the remnants of which are still visible . This mountain , which a bold artist proposed to hew into the image of a man , is , and has been for centuries , decked with churches erected to the living God . Durinb fifteen hundred years it has been the resort and refuge of pious Greeks , who enjoyed there security and solitude . Of late years , it so much increased , that , upon a moderate calculation , it had more than five thousand inmates , or dependents upon its numerous convents , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor Turk to spoil their possessions . They paid a tax to the Sultan , but lived in entire independence , and the whole of the peninsula was under their control . The second c*use , to which we would attribute the identity of the ancient and modern Greeks , and the present existence of the old national characteristics , is the preservation of the language in a singular degree of purity . And here we know we shall be met by the common opinion , // that the modern Greek is a barbarous corruption of the ancient ,  --  an error as prevalent , among those who adopt opinions hastily , as it is apparent to those who have an opportunity ofjudging correctly . Lord Byron , who knew no more of modern Greek than he did of the Chaldaic , has given prevalence to the error , hy publishing , as specimens of the modern Greek , pieces which represeiit the language about as correctly , as would the doggrel verses of Jin Crow represent the condition of poesy in the United States . In fact , Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as so sunk in ignorance and degradation , that people are as little prepared to believe in the identity of the ancient and modern language , as they were that hardy bands existed in her mountains , who had never howed the knee to the Mussulmen . But there is no resisting the truth , and a slight examination of the subject will show how little the langiage has changed , and what wonderful progress has been made toward the restoration of Greek literature within the last century . We have observed , that after the Romans took possession of Greece , the language was preserved hy the church ; in fact , after a very long period from the days of Polybius , Plutarch , and Pausanias ; we find such writers as Basil , Gregory , and Chrysostom , who eloquently wrote in a language nearly as pure and forcible as their great predecessors . In the course of ages , the language of the people changed some , as do all languages ; but it was principally by the introduction of foreign words , and the variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says one of the ablest scholars of this or any other country , " the difference between the two dialects consists rather in the style than in the basis of the language ; the new dialect partakes of the genius and color of modern idioms , without losing any thing of the ductility , the opulence or variety of the ancient . " It is impossible to judge of a language by the colloquial forms of the people ; the man , who should have known nothing more of English than what he gathered from the study of Byron or Irving , would be sadly at a loss to understand the language of the people ; and he who expects the modern Greeks to talk in the style in which Demosthenes wrote , is equally unreasonable . Since the commencement of the last century , there has been a great revival of learning in Greece ; thousands of Greeks sought out the Universities of Europe , and there received a perfect education ; while in every favored part of Greece , high schools and respectable colleges were established ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might have compared well with many in this country ; and few professors among us have more literary merit than had Phillipidas , Constandas , Psilas , and Coray . Four periodicals , written in so pure a style that the ancient Greek scholars of any country could read them , were circulated in Greece ; and , strange as it may sound , it is an indisputable fact , that , since the year 1730 , more than three thousand different books have been printed and circulated among the modern Greeks ; most of these , being translations , were printed at Vienna , at Trieste , and at other places where multitudes of Greeks had established themselves . Tragedies and comedies , written in modern Greek , were performed in small theatres , and the language used was always such as an // ancient Greek scholar , with slight application , could understand . It will be asked , XV here was the wealth to support , and the taste to relish these things I  --  and we point to the flourishing towns of Chios and Xydouia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquirers to look at the history of Hydra , and Ipsara , and Spetzia , and the other commercial islands , where the Turks never landed , and where the Greeks enjoyed the most important privileges , subject only to the capitation tax . From these islands there went forth more than six hundred square.rigge ( l vessels , whitening with their sails not only the Mediterranean and the Black Sea , but finding their way across the Atlantic , an ( l up the Baltic ; there were nearly twenty thousand hardy and expert mariners , voyaging free and fearless in their floating castles , often covered , indeed , with the Russian flag , but with the Greek language on their lips , and Grecian hearts in their bosoms . The consequence of this wonderful commercial spring , which took place the moment the wants of Turkey obliged her to favor the Greeks , was an influx of wealth to those engaged ; splendid edifices sprung up on the rocks of Ipsara ; the dwellin*s of the merchants of Hydra sparkled with marble ; and the purses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . It will be tedious to enter now into a detail of the points in which the modern Greek language differs from the ancient ; suffice it to say , the resemblance is so great that a crood ancient Greek scholar could , in a few days , read fluently a modern Greek newspaper ; and provided he had learned the aticient language with the modern pronunciation , he could at once make himself understood in the country , and soon converse fluently . Is it not extraordinary with what tenacity we cling to the differetit methods of pronouncing the ancient Greek in our schools and colleges , when it is of as little consequence , as it is of little certainty , how the ancient Greeks pronounced it ; and when several millions of their descendants use another and an uniform method I The ancient Greek is again becoming a living language-our young men , who study it profoundly , might make themselves understood by a whole nation , if they were taught the language properly ; but learning it as they do , with an entirely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as say Alpha , Beta to a modern Greek . There is a standard of pronunciation for all nations ; yet how few adopt it ! how few attempt to spare something of the loss incurred in the study of the ancient Greek , by enabling the scholar to converse in the mod-em ! It is a source of pride to the scholar , that the revival of literature has done more to effect the regeneration of Greece than any other cause : the sons of science have repaid the debt they owed to Athens , the mother of arts , by freeing her from the thraldom of slavery : the pens of her scholars have done as much as the swords of her patriots ; and Coray , arid Rhigas , and Negris , as much deserve the crown of patriotic martyrdom , for lives worn out in literary labors , as do Giorgaki , or Karraiskaki , or Botzaris , who sealed their devotion with their blood upon the battle-field . It requires no aid of romance , no effort of imagination , for those who know Marco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as that , which blooms immortal on the memory of // Leonidas ; for the patriotic life , and the voluntary immolation of the hero of Thermopyla* , were no snore meritorious than the generous sacrifices and the chivalrous devotion of the youth , who at Carpenisi rushed upon certain death , hut died with the shout of " victory " on his lips . So the annals of ancient Greece may be searched in vain for a name of more merit than that of Rhigas , the philosopher , the poet and martyr . This young man distinguished himself as a scholar in the middle of the last century ; and ran hourly risk of his life , for the patriotic and spirit-stirring songs , in which he called his countrymen to rise in rebellion to their tyrants . He died at last , a martyr to his zeal in an ill-starred attempt at revolution ; but his poetry will not die while Greece lives . One of his songs may well he compared to the celebrated Marseilles hymn , a song which has been in the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolution , the Kie tes made the peaks of Olympus , the cliffs of Parnassus , and the caverns of Delphi ring out to sounds like theseSons of Greeks , arise !

In remoter ages , we read of them only as robbers ; but the history of the last three or four centuries teaches us that the name and profession of robbers were the only noble name and profession in Cr*ece . Always provided with arms , these hardy mountaineers made , from time to ti. *e , descents upon the open country , and carried terror and ( levastation among the possessors of the plains . They x'ere regularly or anized and to such importance did some of them rise , that we find their organiz* tion under George Castriote-surnamed , by the Turks , Skender Bey , or Alexander  --  to have been the // greatest obstacle to the advance of the Turks under Mahomet IL . This valiant mountaineer , for nearly thirty years , was the terror of Turkey ; he would , during one week , scour like lightning over a whole province the next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ofI-fall upon them in the night ,  --  scatter them like chafl and then appear under the very gates of the capitals . After him sprang into notice the tribes of Suli , whose rocks , for centuries unpolluted by the footsteps of Mussulmen , nourished as brave and hardy a set of men as the world ever knew . In the Peloponnesus , the heights of Taygetus were infested by bands of marauders , if not more honest than their ancestors of Sparta , at least not less brave . Among the islands , Crete had her independent tribes ; and every mountain region of the continent swarmed with them . They were called Kleftes or robbers ; but the title was one of which to boast : the robber gloried in his name , for he spoiled the spoiler of his country-honor and not shame attached to his calling-he was the robber at noon-day  --  the robber of tyrants-he was free and brave , and freedom and bravery did not fail to inspire him with noble sentiments . " Go , " said he to his Turkish l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get new arms , and new clothes , that I may again rob you ! " There was something exceedingly wild , romantic , and enticing , in the situation and life of a Klefte ; horn in a cavern , and cradled on the cliffs , he passed his childhood amongst the wildest and sublimest scenes of nature ; his first exercises were to clamber among the rocks ; his first lessons were in the use of arms ; his first precepts , love of country and liberty , and hatred to the enemies of his religion and his land ; thus educated , he became a hardy mountaineer , a wild but daring soldier , and a devoted patriot ; there is no exaggeration in the description given of them by Byron Hark ! hark ! to the war-drum ; its larum from far Gives hope to the valiant , and promise of war ; All the sons of the mountain arise at the note , Chimariote , Illyrian , and dark Suliote. 0 ! who is more brave than the dark Suliote , In his snowy caroese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulture he leaves his wild flock , And descends to the l ) lain , like a stream from the rock : The mountains that view him descend to the shore Shall view him as victor , or view him no more . The Turks found it so difficult to hold the country while the Kleftes were in war with them , that they made a sort of compromise , and employed many of them as armed police , to guard the mountain passes , and keep peace on the plains : this kind of militia , which was called Armatoli , rapidly extended itself and became an excellent nursery for Greek soldiers : many chiefs of note and influence arose among them , and , living perfectly independent of the Turks , they exercised the profession of arms , and prepared the way for the late revolt . JJere , as on the sea , the moment favorable circumstances allowed the Greek character to develop itself , it did not fail to do so , and from the cringing , crouchin slave , the Greek became a bold and free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his song of freedom , and the cliffs bore aloft the b* nuer of the cross ; while the no-less hardy sailor of Greece whitened every surrounding sea with his sails , // and pushed his adventurous prow into every port , where industry and intelligence could enable him to reap a harvest of gain . We come now to the fourth , and last , but most important of the causes of the preservation of the Greek national character ; we mean the existence , in all ages , of those minor political institutions , which constitute what we call municipal governments , and which left to the people the privilege of regulating , in their own way , their own little village and domestic affairs . They chose their own officers for the regulation of their l ) arocl ) ial business , the assessment among themselves of the tax laid on by their masters , and for the management of all the ( listrict or town affairs . These institutions are of much more importance than is generally awarded to them ; we look for the character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations ; but for the secret springs of power , for that which constitutes the real strength of the fabric , we must look to the little bonds of union among the people for the cement which holds the materials together , and without which the proudest fabric will crumble and fall . If we would preserve for posterity the purity of our glorious institutions ,  --  if we would gain for our country a high permanent rank among the nations of the earth , let us look not alone to the acts at Washington ,  --  let us count not alone the number of our ships or pur soldiers , or depend upon the physical resources of the land ; but let us watch over our minor institutions and social bonds ; the village church , the country school , the ballot-box at eections ,  --  these , and others like them , are the tendrils of the roots , by which the tree of liberty shall be held fast in our land . Space is not allowed us to explain the extent , to which the Greeks have always exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind fatality , their enemies have left to them . The effect of it is , however , most remarkable ; for , in some towns , for instance , in the interior of Asia Minor , the inhabitants , cut off from communication with the rest of their nation , have lost their native tongue , and adopted the Turkish ; others , as in Crete , have abandoned their religion , and adopted Mahometanismn ; but still , bound together by their social principalities , they preserve in a remarkable degree their national characteristics ; with the Turkish turban on their brows , and the Turkish language on their lips , theyare still Greeks in h&amp;art , as they are in form and nature . Such are some of the causes which have preserved , in its purity , the national character and the national spirit of the Greeks ; a spirit , which has been to them " a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night , " to guide them when they wandered darkling for ages , in slavery and degradation ,  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their land , and prevented its parted waters from overwhelming them ; and finally , which gave them the hearts to plan , and the persevering courage to work out their late revolution by a seven years war of inconceivable horrors . Yes ! to most of mis the misery and devastation of that war are inconceivable ; and God grant that our happy land may never learn the like . We weep over the tale of the sufferings of our forefathers ; but we should weep tears of blood , had their woes been like those , which tried the spirit of the Greeks . It was a war@@183068685.txt As I am not of the school of students in the natural history of dreams , my thoughts have never got entangled in any of the fine-spun threads of metaphysics , or laid themselves down to rest on any learned hypothesis , concerning them . I would not undertake to tell where reason is , or how far imagination may have strayed from her , during the hours of slumber , . that produce them . I believe that the wisest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can only go to prove it but a dreamy philosophy ; and , that he , who wearies or amuses his mind most in theorizing on the subject , can no more give a true exposition of its own condition and operations while his body sleeps , than he can of the inscrutable principle that acts in the magnet , or that throws up sheets of light in the Aurora Borealis . The nature of our dreams , spite of all we may do , will baffle investigation ; and , with their own characteristic levity arid caprice , dance out of our reach , and elude the grasp of its most diligent pursuer . After the keenest speculations , into which man may enter on this subject , as well as a thousand others connected with the mysterious being which he calls himself , , he must ait the dawn of a clearer peception than can come to him through the veil of the flesh , before he can look upon it with an unclouded eye . Till this shall be , he must own that he is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are certain effects , for which he can find no origin short of the great FIRST CAUSE . The spiritual being , which is here wrapped up in the bud of its existence , will not be full-blown till all the sleeping and the waking dreams of this life shall be dissolved , and the shadows of the earth flee away . Then will it unfold to the light of another world . I am not what is popularly called , a believer in , or an interpreter of , dreams ; nor does superstition ever feed me with hopes , or torment me with fears , drawn from them . But I am. one , ( probably of thousands ) who sometimes have the mind so strongly stamped with scenes and images that have ' passed before it , while the body had assumed the temporary likeness of its final repose , as not to lose the impression till after this mysteriously united pair , . matter and spirit , have long been wide awake . The following is an instance of this kind . I will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as it was drawn on my mind during a short sleep . I hope my readers will forgive me for violating a prescribed rule of politeness , by telling a dream ; as it seemed tome to be a striking allegory* and one that never would // have entered my mind in my hours of wakefulness ; nor could I trace it to any association of thoughts or circumstances that had occurred . I thought myself in a beautiful ship , that was out on the open ocean , and bound to some part of the eastern continent , with her sails all set to the balmy breeze , upon which , from the top of her stately mast , floated the BETHEL FLAG . The deep was smooth and bright before her ; and not a vapor , nor the trace of a cloud , hung between her and the pure blue world above , where the sun moved on in his glory , till his approach to the western horizon softened the radiance of his face , and enabled the eye to look full at its mellowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more heart-touching than its mid-day beams . I watched his descent till he was fairly gone , and the sky where he had sunk , blending the reflection of his farewell smile with the dusk of the coming night , became a visible figure of that feeling , half delight , half sadness , which the memory of a departed saint pours over the soul . Then , twilight came ; and star after star peeped out , while night gathered round us , till the whole arch of heaven was peopled with twinkling ministers of light , that seemed like a bright army drawn out to protect the color under which we sailed , and to guide us over the deep . While I stood and leaned over the side of the ship , as she rolled on in majesty , my eye grew weary of looking up to the lofty vault above , and fell , for rest and amusement , on the gently swelling billows of the element beneath us , where each within the scope of its vision , heaved up its bosom marked with the sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distance , it confined itself to a narrower sphere , and was contented to watch the path of the ship . As she cut her furrow through the deep , she left behind her a luminous train like the milky way ; and her sides were encompassed with wreaths of phosphoric light . I knew not how long I had hung , idly musing over the play of the sparkling waters , and listening to their gurgling and dashing round the bark that bore me through them , when the quick , hurried steps , and mingled voices of the mariners roused me from my reverie . On looking up , I found that , by one of those sudden changes to which one is often liable at sea , we had entered another latitude , and a region where we were overhung by a dense vapor , which shut out the face of the sky , and shrouded us in a blackness that was only pierced by forked lightning , which seemed darted at us from every side of the hemisphere ; while a strong under.current of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our flag was only discernible by the fitful glare of the flashes that played about the masts . The sails were slackened , but the ship drove on with a fearful speed , till the cry of " breakers ! breakers ahead ! " sounded along her deck , and consternation seized every man . Soon she began to rock and toss like an egg-shell . Then , she would mount , and plunge , and welter , while her cordage rattled , her canvas flapped , and her timbers creaked , as if ruin had taken hold of her with a determined grasp . She had broken from the command of her officers ; the pilot had abandoned the helm , and the tiller was left to play back and forth without a hand to steady it , while surge after surge swept over her // decks like terrible besoms of destruction ; and the roaring and the dashing of the raging waters drowned every other sound . At*length , by one mighty effort of the sea , the weary ship was driven and thrown up with impetuosity , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand , on-some unknown shore . The waves rushed furiously after her , as if to recover their lost prey ; but while none had power to loosen her hold upon the beach , each drove her deeper and deeper into the sand , till the commotion among then began to abate , and calmness came gradually over the deep . When the night had faded , and the day dawned , the skies shone out in unveiled beauty ; and we found we had been cast far up on the shore , in an uninhabited tract , on the coast of Africa . The sun rose clear upon our ship , as she lay upon her side , with the points of her masts touching a muddy soil , where the soft wet turf stretched down towards the rocky and sandy border of the sea ; so that our beautiful Bethel Flag had been dipped in the puddles , and trailed upon the gravel , till it was wet and heavy , and lay before us in a mass of long , dirty wrinkles , so completely disguised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately been . But while the ocean seemed divested of the terrible character it had assumed in the night , the land prospect , that opened before us , was such as to fill the bosom with inexpressible delight . A wide , inclined plain , that receded from the sea-side and fastened itself to the foot of a neighboring mountain , was covered with a carpet of soft , fresh grass , with the dew all clear and still upon it , and looked like a bed of emerald sprinkled over with diamonds ; while it was studded here and there with the knots of flowering shrubs , that filled the air with odors from a thousand bursting buds . The birds , in throngs , disported their many-colored plumage among them , and sang their morning hymns , in songs and voices that I had never heard before . The date-tree held out her fruit ; and fair groves of palms waved their broad leaves , as the soft winds passed by ; while , from the side of the mountain , its pure , sweet veins were pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to beautify and fertilize the soil that lay beneath it . But amid all this beautiful scenery of nature , one object that seemed wholly out of keeping with what surrounded it , and its purpose , in such a place , inexl ) licahle , arrested my attention , and excited much curiosity , though it was not at all imposing in its appearance , and my discovering it seemed entirely accidental . As I roamed , full of wonder and delight , along the verdant slope , my feet came suddenly upon a spot where the sod was pierced by the grey head of a rock , that seemed deeply sunk , and strongly set in the earth . Just as I was going to step on it , to pass over , a crackling sound and a sweep of hot air , made me withdraw my foot , and retreat . On going a little down towards the water , to take a fair view of the rock , at a safe distance , I saw that it was excavated on one side , so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ocean . The little cavern was nearly full of living coals , whose intense heat and vivid glow gave the whole inside of the rock the appearance of a carbuncle . As I was opening my lips to ask a little sailor lad , who walked by my side , what he thought the design of this furnac*e could be , and who // could have kindled the fire , when there was near it no trace of human agency , he darted from me , and , running to the ship , unfastened the flag , and dragged it up the slope , to the cave . He then gathered it up in a small compass , and , before I had time to seize his hand , to arrest its work , cast it on the fire . A loud hissing was he rd in the furnace , as the drenched flag met the fervid coals ; and it was for a while filled with steam and smoke that rolled out of its mouth in such volumes , as completely to conceal the process which was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire or the water would gain the victory . I rebuked the boy for what he had done ; for , I thoughtour beautiful - color was now gone forever beyond the hope of restoration ; and that not even a remnant could be saved . He smiled , and , with a placid look , calmly replied " The BETHEL FLAG ca n't consume-it is made of Asbestos , and will only be purified by the fire ! " When the smoking subsided , and the furnace resumed its red , devouring look , I saw the flag lying on the coals , in a mass of fuel , half black , half bright , that looked as if in the act of separating to go off in light cinders . But no part of it was rent away , while it grew hotter and hotter , till it shone before me in an entire web of threads of fire . Then the boy drew it forth , with the aid of an instrument , and tossed it up in the air , till it was cool enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it till every particle of ashes and dust was gone ; when he spread it out , and displayed it in its perfect form . It looked whole and new , and its colors were bright and beautiful as those of the bow of promise . Meantime , the ship had been righted ; her hands were all found to - be safe , and uninjured by the disaster ; and she now stood up , fair and stately , with the flag again hoisted in its proper element , after its cotiflict with earth , fire , and water , and ready to resume her voyage . But , getting the ship under weigh produced so busy a scene of action , and the joy at our preservation , together with the thought of setting sail again , filled my breast with feelings that bubbled up so fast , that I awoke , and found myself actually exhausted with excessive emotion , and drawing in my breath as deep and long , as*if respiration had been suspended during the whole of my slumber . The whole of what I have related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind , that I could hardly get rid of the impression that it was something which I had , in reality , experienced ; and , even now , it comes up to my memory among other events of my life , with equal pretensions to truth ; and perhaps , more , to utility . For , while many of them only bring bitter or sorrowful reflections , this produces a train of pleasant and harmless , if not profitable thoughts , as I thus moralize it . I was looking downward , at what we were going through , and amusing myself with false lights , when the misfortue came upon our ship . No one can undertake the voyage of life under a better color than the Bethel Flag ; it will come out bright at last , if it is made of the true material . The lightning can not shred it  --  the blast can not rend it-it will not lie long upon the earth , nor take a lasting stain from the things thereof  --  the fire will prove its virtue and its imperishable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these assailants , it will rise again to be examined by the keen eye of the sun , and float in its pristine beauty upon the pure breath of heaven . The bark that bears this flag may not always sail on a smooth sea , nor be preserved from adverse winds . Vapor and darkness may sometimes hang round her-she may run into breakers , and find the sea foaming over her , but she will not sink-she will not part-her owner and builder has made her strong-he knew she must sail on a perilous voyage , for " the sea is his , and he made it . " She may be thrown up awhile on the strand , but this will be to save her from being swallowed by the deep , and to make her secure till the fury of the waves is over , and the shades of night are lost in the light of the morning . Her mariner may not always have strength to govern , or skill to direct her ; but when he has done all in his power , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord ; " and find that the only ark of safety bears the BETHEL FLAG.
