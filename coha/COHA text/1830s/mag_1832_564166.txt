txt THE relation , in which these governments stand to each other in the family of nations , has long been considered as peculiar . Other colonies may have grown into states , and nations springing from a common origin and speaking a common language may have existed before the United States became independent of the mother country . But where shall we find a parallel with the reciprocal influence which these two nations have had upon each other , or the extent to which their respective influences have been felt by cotemporary nations ? There are , indeed , peculiarities in every stage of the history of the connexion and separation of these governments . We find our ancestors emigrating to a wilderness , where they grew into importance by the very neglect of the home government , and for a long time neither claimed nor claiming to be colonies , in the sense in which other governments had regarded those who had gone out to people a new country or to possess a conquered physical energy themselves , which was one day to put at successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherish and sustain . And , when at last the revolution , which severcd these colonies from the parent stock , had placed America among the nations of the earth , there was more to humble and wound the feeling of national pride for which England has been so distinguished , in the self-wrought and self-sustained independence of her former colonies , than if there had been a change of masters or a mere transfer of territory from one potentate to another ; and , if we mistake not , it was not so much the present loss of this " jewel from the British crown " that her leading men regretted , as it was the consequences of this setting up by the colonies of a government for themselves , in which neither the legitimacy of kings nor the so much lauded union of lords and commons were recognized or admitted . Various and contradictory as have been the histories of the struggle which severed the colonies from the mother country , there have been none we believe , which have seriously impugned the motives of the mass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . Indeed , there were too many of the choicest spirits and noblest patriots that ever graced the annals of England , who saw and boldly proclaimed the irrepressible spirit of English freedom , in the resistance of the colonies and in the fearlessness with which they drew the sword in defence of their liberties . With a portion , therefore , at least , of the British nation , the struggle of the Americans was regarded as honorable and patriotic ; but the feelings which were excited by the progress and issue of that struggle , among what seems to have been the mass of the English population , were , nevertheless , bitter and implacable . The former endearing terms of brethren and fellow-citizens were changed into those of aliens and rivals ; and the peace of 1783 was rather a political calm than a cordial reconciliation of long-cherished animosities and hostile jealousies . Many saw , or thought they saw , even in the political relations which arose between the United States and England , after that peace , a manifestation of hostility on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the former was found both able and resolved to sustain the independence which she had achieved . But whatever were the motives which dictated the course of policy , which was partialiy suspended by the treaty of Mr. Jay , and apparently compromised by the peace of 1815 , we have only to look into the works of the British press relating to this country , in order to study the feelings which were cherished towards it by that portion of the community that undertook to be the arbiters and the organs of public sentiment . There has been a malignity a bitterness of spirit uniformly manifested in these , which nothing can palliate or excuse . Abuse the most unwarranted , and libels the most unjust and unfounded , have have been poured out from pens of hired emissaries , and crowded the pages of periodicals , which affected to speak the sentiments of those who were in power ; and even rival publications , which differed upon every other topic , agreed in the obloquy which they attempted to heap upon the character of this republic . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for whether we regard the hase falsehoods of a Fearon , the canting and contemptible abuse of a Basil Hall , or the often repeated and wilful calumnies of the London Quarterly , we should find in either and in all these , as well as in numerous other works which have been current in Great-Britain , a labored and systematic effort to defame and degrade America and her institutions , which can only have resulted from a feeling of long indulged rancour and ill-disguised hostility . Happily , however , for England , and happily , we believe , for the world , this feeling has spent itself in impotent reproach , *while those who have been the subjects of it have been content to exert in their turn an influence over the same people , to whom these hostile appeals have been addressed , which could not be controled . There is something in the contrast between the hostile feeling , which has been so constantly manifested and so industriously disseminated through the reading community in Great-Britain , and the influence which America is actually exerting over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these nations now stand to each other , peculiarly interesting in a moral as well as in a political point of view . The ungrateful calumnies of English travelers have sometimes roused an indignant feeling for the moment , but it soon passed away , and was forgotten with the pitiful authors who excited it ; and the labored abuse of the British press , as often as it has appeared , has been practically treated by the mass of our community with as much indifference as ever the impotent clamors of a spendthrift who had wasted his estate , were regarded by those who had profited by his improvidence , and were securely enjoying the possessions which they had acquired by their own superior industry and forecast . In the rich possession of blessings which were denied to the old world , and in a conscious independence of the frowns and the favors of those who seemed thus hostile without a cause , the American public have rarely turned aside from the absorbing pursuits of business or politics to inquire whether the charges of mental imbecility or literary inferiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their institutions were free ; that their physical ability to sustain these was undoubted ; and if at any // time , they took a part in this wordy war of feeling , it was but the harmless seif-gratulation which such reflections were calculated to cherish . There have been American scholars whose sensibilities were more easily excited , who have felt more keenly the attacks upon the literary fame of their country , and with fearless and manly energy have stood forth as her champions in the field of literature and the arts . In what manner this has been done , and with what success , we need only refer among others to the pages of the " Appeal " of Mr. Walsh , or to more than one article in the North-American Review , whose writers have practically , as well as by argument , confuted these charges of the enemies of our literary fame . But the efforts of theses writers , though honorable in design and successful in execution , were in reality unnecessary . Time was fast doing what they were attempting-covering with oblivion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world the moral and physical energies of a people which had but yesterday taken their place among the nations of the earth . It has been amusing to see how these calumnies have , one after the other , been silently and effectually refuted ; how our country , like the good man in an evil world , has lived down , by the force of example , the slanders with which she has been beset . The genius of our artists has stamped its own immortality on an English canvas , the books of American authors have been printed and read on the other side of the Atlantic ; and not only has England borrowed American inventions in the useful arts , but she has learned a more important lesson , that these arts can flourish to perfection among a free population , and be successfully pursued by those who know not the existence of want or distress , but by name , and who themselves form a constituent part of that power which keeps a mob of English artisans in check when their sufferings can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in public sentiment in GreatBritain in regard to America , if we may judge from the indications which occasionally appear , from which we may anticipate a most salutary result . England has been taught a practical lesson by our example ; and however critics may sneer at the pretended uncouthness of American phrases , or a " Brummagem " Drummer be shocked at the republican simplicity of American manners , there has been a silent but irrepressible spirit at work among the mass of the people of Great-Britain , which will one day shake down the tottering fabric of her political system , and which , defying alike a hireling press and a corrupt ministry , has been stamping an American character upon whatever this spirit has reached in its progress . To those who have watched the changes which have been going on in Great-Britain for the last three quarters of a century , the influence of the politics of what are now the United States upon the politics of England , must have been too obvious to need comment . The principles upon which the present reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , are not the discoveries of the present ministry . The discussions which engaged the public attention in the colonies , between the years 1760 and 1776 , and the principles which were sustained by the American revolution , were not confined in their effect to America alonc ; they produced an impression in England , which has never been // effaced , and the revolution of 1688 hardly wrought a greater or more marked change in public sentiment there , than that which may be traced to the Revolution of 1776 . We see not , in fact , how it could have been otherwise . The government of England is so far popular in its character that its constitution and its administration are topics of legitimate discussion and examination , and in these discussions the defects and absurdities of their system must necessarily be exposed . If a principle of loyalty have consecrated the name of king , and if by prescriptive submission and indulgence , the people have been content to acknowledge the undelegated power of a hereditary peerage , they have not calmly acquiesced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular branch of their government , whereby so large a portion of the people are practically disfranchised and without a hope of redress by any means short of a virtual revolution . There have been burdens , too , under which that nation have groaned , which have been boriie with a reluctance increasing in pro* portion to the increase of light , which time has shed upon their true condition . It is in vain that a Post Captain in the royal navy may tell the people of England that our manners are uncourtly , or the Quarterly reiterate the stale scandal of English travelers ; they can not conceal from the nation xvhose attention has been aroused to the question of their own wrongs and the means of redress , that America is free from the burdens under which they are suffering . It can not be concealed that here the people have , in fact , as well as in theory , a voice in the administration of the government which they obey-that here are no rotten boroughs to give laws to the industry and enterprise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-earned fruits of others ' labors , and no tax-gatherer or exciseman to snatch even from poverty a portion of whatever feeds or warms or shelters or clothes it , to sustain the forced credit of the government , and check the accumulation of a hopeless public debt . It is , in short , in vain , that the English press is arrayed against American principles and American institutions , with facts like these before them ; for these principles and these institutions have already produced an influence upon the English government , and the English people , which will be felt long after the jealousies and the heart-burnings which grew out of the struggle of their colonies for independence shall have been forgotten . We can claim but little on the ground of originality in thus attempting to connect and embody a train of thought which has been suggested by the discussions that have been going on in England upon the allabsorbing subject of Reform , and the manner upon which the first of two articles upon that subject , which appeared in the late numbers of the North-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished statesmen and scholars , was commented on in the course of the debates in the British Parliament . The topic , may , indeed , be somewhat hackneyed ; but we hope it can never be without its use to dwell upon some of the circumstances , which ought to endear to us the institutions under which we live , and to recal to mind some of the considerations which entitle our country to our veneration and respect . // A iVinter Soliloquy . If we are , in fact , inferior to England in some of those peculiarities which distinguish some classes under an old and long established government , it is because the public mind has been actively engaged in objects of higher moment to a young and rising people , and has directed its powers towards rearing an imperishable temple of freedom , and fitting and adapting the parts that shall strengthen and sustain it , rather than to decorating it with the finishing touch of art , or twining festoons with which to adorn its proportions . If we owe England a debt for the labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she owes America a debt for the principles of true liberty which she has sustained in the republic of nations , which has infinitely outweighed the sum of that obligation . The day is fast approaching when the relation of obligation between these nations will be better understood and more accurately appreciated . It has already come , when the hostility of the English press has been virtually subdued by the reflected influence of American example , and when upon the time-hallowed constitution of the English government , America has begun to work a revolution more marked than that which followed the Norman Conquest , and more permanent and glorious in its consequences than that which the people wrought out for themselves in their memorable struggle of 1688.
