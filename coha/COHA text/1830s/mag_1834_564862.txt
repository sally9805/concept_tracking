txt IN the June number of this Magazine appeared an article headed " Phrenology , " which calls , in our opinion , for a plain reply ,  --  if not to all , at least to some of the remarks it contains , and the positions it assumes . It is characterized by much professed candor , and exhibits , in its own way , no common share of tact and ability . It is well calculated to propitiate the feelings and gain the assent of a certain class of readers , especially such as are uninformed in the science of which it treats , and at the same time unsuspicious of any thing but entire fairness in the writer . Nor are we inclined to charge him positively with intentional unfairness , however strong appearances may be against him . From prejudice , strengthened by association , habit , long-cherished opinions , and other causes , men 's feelings are often so completely hidden from themselves , that they are not conscious of their own designs . They believe themselves ingenuous , when under the sway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of self-examination ; a process on which the writer referred to lays great stress , and draws for no small amount of his matter of argument . Be the cause , however , what it may , the paper is strongly marked with partiality , nearly its whole weight being thrown into one scale . To say the least , there is , on one side , hut little else than profession , and on the other , all the logic , fair and foul , the writer can command . And where facts fail , he resorts to insinuation . Our design , therefore , is to place in the opposite scale such matter as we can hastily bring together , not merely to restore the balance , but to make truth preponderate . The writer , whom , for brevity 's sake , we shall call , from his signature , B , professes to have attended Dr. Spurzheim 's lectures on Phrenology ; to have carefully perused his works on the subject , and to entertain for him as a philosopher , a teacher , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the first men of the age . It is singular , therefore , that he should have either mistaken or perverted his means // ing . Yet , that he has done so , in the article before us , we have the evidence of his own statements , and shall endeavor to convince our readers of the fact . We are aware that the opponents of Phrenology ,  --  and B is virtually one of them ,  --  prefer , as a complaint against the advocates of the science , that they always charge them with either ignorance or misrepresentation of it ; and sometimes with both . That a charge of the kind is usually made , is true . Nor is it less so , that it rests on solid ground . if any one has ever opposed Phrenology fairly , in its genuine character , without misunderstanding or misrepresenting it , we know not who he is , or where his discussion of the matter is to be found . Our acquaintance with the history of the science embraces neither , and it would gratify us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to B to say of him , that he gives , perhaps , a less distorted exposition of the tenets and claims of Phrenology , than most other cavilers at it , whose writings we have read . He is , also , less rancorous and embittered in spirit . Still , however , his representations are incorrect , as we shall now make appear , by extracts from his article . The Phrenologist says , My science can not , from the nature of the case be disputed . It has its direct and impregnable support in undeniable facts . It would surely be a mark of insanity to deny the plain , bold , and honest evidence of the senses , which evidence claims for my philosophy priority to all other phi . losophies , because no other is built on observation of and induction from , facts . " p. 46* . This vaunt is the " very coinage of " B 's own " brain ; " and his having thus broadly and tauntingly stated it , is satisfactory evidence of his unfriendliness to Phrenology . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , if successful , would be fatal to it . The soundest opposing fact and argument could scarcely be more so . A boast so turgid and vainglorious has never issued from the lips or the pen of the modest and unoffending Spurzheim , to wlose views the writer has almost entirely confined his remarks ; nor has any other Phrenologist of intelligence and standing been guilty of it , or of any thing resembling it . An effort of the kind , to gain influence , by imposing on credulity , would be charlatanry ; and Phrenologists willingly invite an enlightened and impartial public to decide , which party , they or their adversaries , are most obnoxious to the charge of an attempt to delude , by unfair practices . We ask B to cite his authority in support of an imputation so disrespectful and exceptionable . And if he declines to comply with our request , we shall hold him guilty of having preferred against Phrenologists a charge , which he can not sustain , with a view to weaken their influence and cripple their science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie quiet , under such an accusation , the public will understand his motives , and know how to appreciate them . To which of the two , a politician practised in all the wiles of his calling , but a stranger to conscience , struggling to overthrow an opponent , or a fair-minded philosopher searching for truth , would such a stratagem be most suitable ? We put the question ; let others answer it . Again * The Phrenologist notices a certain configuration of skull ,  --  he infers by physiological reasoning , that beneath it the brain Lion . " Ibid. , conforms to that configura. // Can B. be serious in this statement ; or does he mean to play on the supposed ignorance and credulity of his readers , and , in their view , affix a blot on the science he so groundlessly attacks ? Be his intention what it flay , a grosser misrepresentation than he has here made , can scarcely be imagined . " Infers by physiological reasoning ! " There is neither reasoning nor inference in the case , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The writer either misunderstands his own words , is an entire stranger to the process he alludes to , or willfully misstates it . When a Phrenologist notices the figure and dimensions of a skull , he does not " infer " the conformity of the brain to it , by any kind of " reasoning . " He assures himself of it , by an actual examination of the things compared , whose relations to each other he wishes to learn . He opens a cranium , and finds the brain it contains accurately corresponding to it in size and shape . He then fills it with plaster or wax , and finds the same correspondence between the cast and the mould . He treats others in the same way , until he is satisfied . Having examined a sufficient number of skulls , and ascertained that this is true of each of them , he then " infers " the uniform result , as a general law respecting other skulls , by legitimate logical , not " physiological reasoning . " And the process is as fair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive at the truth , that the whole is greater than a part ; or that things equal to one and the same thing are equal to one another . rrrue : physiological principles concur in the conclusion , and give the reason of it . But they had no agency in leading to the discovery . That was as purely the result of observation , as the facts , that light bodies float on water , and heavy ones sink in it . It is singular that a writer so intelligent as B should thus commit himself , in a matter so palpable . Nor do we consider the following remarks less extraordinary " One of the elements of our reasoning , before we can come to a single phrenological conclusion , is our opinion of the strength of a certain mental quality ,  - -  an opinion furnished by means entirely exclusive of any which Phrenology presents . " Ibid . By what " means " do we discover the " strength " of a " mental quality ? " The question , if we understand the writer 's object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief and plain . The discovery is effected by observation alone , made either on others or ourselves ,  - -  most satisfactorily on the former . But Phrenology being built on observation , can not be considered as divorced from it . Indeed , Phrenology " presents " all the " means " for the discovery of truth common to other sciences ,  --  experiment , observation , and induction . In the present case , therefore , either B does not understand his subject , or we do not understand him . Might we speak in general terms , respecting page 468 , we would pronounce it singular throughout . Nearly the whole matter contained in it presents little else than a tissue of mystification and mistake . It neither expounds nor illustrates , proves nor refutes any thing . It is too subtle for the purposes of science . To us , no small portion of it is unintelligible ; another part is irrelevant to the subject treated of ; and almost the whole of the remainder is erroneous . Hence it leaves matters much as it found them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are more entangled and obscured . Whether the writer // was in a dreamy or a casuistical mood , when the following effusion escaped him , it is hard to tell " There is great danger that the Phrenologist will adapt the head of the individual examined to the character , and the character to the head ; that , in support of his favorite theory , he will , unintentionally , perhaps , exaggerate or depreciate facts , which he learns by moral observation , so as to suit them to mechanical development . His imagination will be likely to enlarge what is in fact small , or to take from the size of what is already larger than it should be , till his principles are justified . He will observe objects , as suits his convenience , through either end of the telescope . " Ibid . To discover the precise object of these " mays " and " peradventures , " is no easy matter . Might we guess at their purport , however , we should say that they point to one of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deluded , and , therefore , incapable of seeing things as they are ; or dishonest in their purposes , and struggling for victory , instead of conscientiously searching for truth . Such insinuations made against enlightened and honorable men , are indecorous and offensive , and might , more deservedly , be thrown back on their discourteous author . The great body of Phrenologists are not fanciful , but calm , observing , and deliberative men ; they cherish no sinister designs ; nor do they deal in any thing dark or cabalistical . They seek truth in simplicity of feeling and honesty of purpose ; and by the means most likely to attain it ,  --  observation and induction . What idea does the writer intend to convey , by the phrase " moral observation I " If he means " observation " made by the " moral " faculties , he speaks of what does not exist . The moral faculties are incapable of observation . And if he means observation on moral matters , made by the intellectual faculties , which alone have the capacity to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may choose in the dilemma , as best suits him . On one of its horns he must necessarily hang . But all the wrongs he has done Phrenology are not yet enumerated . " One of the most boasted excellencies of the Phrenological system is , that it gives a just , full , and scientific analysis of the mind . p. 471 . What Phrenologist of standing has ever " boasted " thus ? Not one . And as to phrenological sciolists and pretenders , no matter what they affirm , or what deny . They have injured the science , and are excluded from the fellowship of its true votaries and enlightened cultivators . That Phrenologists consider their analysis of the mind just , as far as it extends and is pronounced settled , is true . But they do not contend that it is " full , " and complete . On the contrary , they admit the probability that it is not ; but that further discoveries are yet to be made . Hence their researches after new truths are as eager and unremitting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as might be easily shown ; but we can dwell on them at present no longer . B 's remarks on Dr. Spurzheim 's wonderful sagacity and success , in deciphering the characters of persons , at first sight , are passingly strange ; and , were the term less exceptionable , we should call them jesuitical . Most assuredly they are disingenuous . They betray a pretension to a degree of penetration , and a pompous affection of wisdom , far beyond what their author possesses ,  --  beyond , indeed , what // any one possesses . The writer even pretends to a more correct knowledge of the ground of Dr. Spurzheim 's judgement of character , than that great philosopher possessed himself . The Doctor believed and declared , that he judged from development and temperament . To physiognomy , technically so called , he paid but little regard , although he has written on it , in connexion with Phrenology , lie regarded it chiefly as throwing some light on temperament . In forming his estimate of characters , he professed himself to act in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To all this B most sagely demurs , and explains the process on very different grounds . " Explains , " did we say ? Oh , no ; he explains nothing , but throws all into deeper shadow and entanglement , darkening most points and illustrating none . But we can give no adequate idea of his perplexing disquisition of this topic , without quoting from it . After bewildering himself and his readers with the preposterous paradox , that , when a person is engaged in any process or operation , a mere looker on , no way superior in sagacity or attainment , can better tell the means , by which he performs it , than he can himself , the writer adds ,  --  " Now we think it must , in the first place , be allowed that Dr. Spuraheim had an altogether unusual power in judging of character . By what knowledge , or by the use of what means , did he possess and exercise this unusual power ? What was the situation and character of the man himself ? He had devoted himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole intellectual and physical nature , with a constant and particular reference to the single point of ascertaining mental qualities from mental manifestations . He had been accustomed , through a long course of years , to pursue this subject with unremitted assiduity during the *1ay , and to meditate upon it during the night-watches . Every person , on whom his eye rested , was looked at in the same aspect , and with the same purpose . Every habit he could form , that would aid his great object , was formed ,  --  not only habits of application , perseverance , and selF-sacrifice ; but a thousand different habits of observation . Observation to him was not one single , unvarying , mechanical , thing ; but it was itself a science , with almost numberless divisions and applications , having reference to a great many distinct classes of facts , and leaving out of view not the most trivial , incidental , and , as other men might think , insignificant , showings-forth of the interior spirit , " &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. to the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which we can make nothing , except a web of words and imaginings neither intelligible nor useful . Rarely has a man labored more zealously , or with less success , to convert a mouse into a mammoth , than B has done , in the present instance . Had his object been to produce some shapeless and cloudy creation , in which no one could feel an interest , and which no one could comprehend , he could scarcely have better accomplished his purpose . Of this complicated and tangled scheme of " observation** turned into a " science , " Spurzheim was so ignorant , that he did not even suspect his possession of it . He honestly believed that he observed like other men , except , perhaps , more attentively , and that he availed himself only of the resources of a practical Phrenologist . And in that alone consisted the mystery , and thence arose his uniform success . Nor did that success mark the latter period of his life only , when his experience was mature . From the commencement of his career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was true of him , when he was traveling with Gall , in the capacity // of a pupil . We ask of B whence is derived the unerring accuracy of Deville , of London , in pronouncing on character ? - an accuracy which never fails to astonish , and proselyte to the science every beholder . He is neither a man of extensive attainments , profound research , nor close and uninterrupted study ; hut a plain and unpretending artist . Yet is he more resorted to , to interpret character , than ever Spurzheim was , and his judgements are equally sound . Were B to approach him , with his tedious and mystified exposition of means , he would be met with a look of surprise , if not with a smile of derision . Deville judges as a plain Phrenologist , looking to temperament and development alone . So do the Cornbes and Scotts of Edinburgh , Elliottson of London , Levison of Hull , and Otto of Copenhagen . So do all other practical Phrenologists . Their means are observation ; temperament and development the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprises and convinces all whom they examine . It is amazing that any man of intelligence should hazard his reputation by so exaggerating and distorting Dr. Spurzheirn 's mode of interpreting character . As if to leave no portion of the science untouched , B has made a grave attack on Phrenology , through the " Freedom of the Will ; " a point which has been the battle-ground of metaphysicians and divines , for hundreds of years , and does not promise to become shortly the Tesidence of peace . The problem to be solved is ,  --  Is the Will governed by motives , bearing to its action the common relation of cause to effect ? or does it decide and act , by a self-governing power , independently of motives , and can it do so even in opposition to them ? rro the former of these questions we would give an affirmative , and , of course , to the latter a negative reply . The Will is not independent of motives , and above the influence of causes . If it were , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of human comprehension , and , so far as that point is concerned , on an equality with the CREATOR HIMsELF . He alone is independent of all exterior influences , selfgoverned , and self-dependent ; and nothing else can be so , otherwise he is not in all respects SUPREME . Even to the actions of the Deity himself , his own perfections furnish motives . His Will , therefore , is not independent of Himself , although it is so of every thing else . Universal Supremacy in one source , necessarily implies universal subserviency in all others . The very idea of a human Will above motives , and proof against influences , is an anomaly , which sets not only comprehension , but conception at defiance . All things created are governed by definite and unchangeable laws ,  --  the Will of man no more excepted than his intellect or passions . A condition of things the reverse of this would render nugatory and unavailing , and convert into a mere name , all argument , remonstrance , persuasion , and every thing else employed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man . As relates to human action , and government , of what avail would be reason , affection , a sense of duty , or the dread of punishment , were the Will a despot , deag impassible , and superior to them all ? Such a state of things would set equally at defiance , law , justice , terror , love , and even the obligations of religion itself . In vain would these influences and all others be urged , under the highest // and weightiest sanctions , were the Will insensible to the impression of motives . Yet insensible to them it is , or might as well be , if it can resist them , and resolve and act in opposition to them . In that case it would be as lawless and unmanageable , as a mass of matter superior and disobedient to the principle of gravity . Such would be the character of an independent , self-governing Will . But no such thing exists . The Will , or rather the mind of which it is an attribute , is as essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical bodies are to the control of physical laws , or organic bodies to that of organic laws . Were the case otherwise , the moral world , notwithstanding its superiority to the physical , would be a chaos or a despotism , subject only to chance or arbitrary rule . But a belief that any portion of creation is in such a condition , would be virtually a denial of the perfection of the Deity . It would be an irnpeachment of his goodness , or wisdom , or power , or of all of them united . In determining human actions , the stronger motive predominates , precisely as , in moving machinery , the heavier weight exceeds the lighter in power . In fact the laws of causation prevail every where , and are every where analogous to each other , the Will and the moral world generally constituting no exception to the rule . Nor is moral responsibility subverted by this . The Will of the inferior animals is as free as our own . The deer is as free to stand and perish , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , or to leave it in safety ; and the tiger can , at pleasure , lacerate the kid , or allow it to go unhurt . The Will of the infant , the idiot , and lunatic is also free . Yet neither those human beings , nor the inferior animals are morally responsible for aught they may do . The reason is plain . They have no moral nature , and can not therefore be held culpable for a violation of laws which do not attach to them . Moral nature consists in sound and effective moral faculties . But idiots and inferior animals are destitute of such faculties ; the moral faculties of infants are immature and feeble ; and those of the insane are diseased . Neither of these classes of beings , therefore , are moral agents . To none but moral agents does moral responsibility belong ; and to them it adheres , by a law of their constitution , from which nothing but a change of their nature can absolve them . To be rendered perfectly clear , this subject calls for further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty of a violated law . But to be binding and to imply a penalty , a law must correspond to the constitution of the being responsible to it . None , therefore , but a being possessing a sound moral constitution can be held responsible to a moral law . Under the want of such a constitution , there is no fitness between the being and the law . The being can neither understand nor feel the law . Unable to comprehend even its existence , he can not be made sensible that it is his duty to obey it . To subject him to its penalty , therefore , would be unjust and cruel ; because a sense of duty and a liability to punishment should be inseparable . If enforced on idiots or mad*rnen , infants or inferior animals , the whole moral code would turn to a system of hateful tyranny . Why ? Because it would be made to bear on beings , who , for want of a sound moral constitution , are unable to comprehend it , or to feel the obligations it imposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an adult and healthy condition , is justly responsible , because he possesses a constitution in correspondence with it ; and yet his Will is governed by motives . Those motives , moreover , operate as certainly , as do the causes that govern the physical world . To illustrate our views by familiar examples ,  - -  An assassin , posted in a dark and lonely place , is in the act of committing murder . His motive is deep vindictiveness , or an excited state of the faculty of Destructiveness , and his Will conforms to it . But suddenly a light appears , and an armed party advances to the rescue of the victim . The excitement of the assassin is immediately removed into the faculty of Cautiousness , and produces fear . This is a new motive , to which the Will again conforms , and , instead of striking the meditated blow , he seeks his safety in flight . Here the Will is as certainly controled by motive ,  --  the stronger motive for the time still prevailing ,  --  as the ball is by mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needle by attraction , when it points to the pole . We have said that the " stronger motive prevails . " This is explained by the fact , that , when excitement is removed from Destructiveness , that faculty ceases to furnish a motive , while excited Cautiousness operates as a very powerful one . Again . A brave man is assaulted by a party of savages , and excited Cautiousness supplying the motive induces him to retreat . But the savages , discovering his wife or mistress , turn from him , and rush toward the female . Instantly the excitement being transferred to the faculties of Amativeness , Adhesiveness , Combativeness , and Destructiveness , supplies a new and stronger motive , and he flies to the rescue , to conquer or die . Here the Will does not act the part of an arbitrary and inflexible despot , but , like an obedient subject , submits to command . Once more . A beloved daughter marries below her rank , and in opposition to the wishes and remonstrance of her father , who sternly resolves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or admit her to his presence . Offended Combativeness and Self-esteem supply the motive , and the XVill accords to it . But , on a sudden , the disobedient fair one appears , in all her beauty and loveliness , falls at her father 's feet , clasps his knees , and , unable to speak , implores forgiveness with pleading looks and a flood of tears . From the offended faculties the excitement is translated to Philoprogenitiveness , Adhesiveness , and Benevolence , which , furnishing a counter motive , the paternal Will again conforms , and the daughter is forgiven , and received into favor . And the Will is always thus subordinate , the faculties of feeling arid sentiment , singly or in conibination , furnishing the motive , and the intellectual faculties directing the course . Spnrzheim was right , therefore , in regarding the Will , not as an element of mind , but as a mere decision , under the influence and control of motives . It has been already shown , that mere . freedom of Will is not the source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no moral faculties . Nor is it less true , that wherever those faculties exist , there is moral responsibility , even though the Will is governed by motives . The reason is plain . The guilt of an immoral act consists neither in the act itself , nor in the effect it produces ; but in // the criminal intention of the perpetrator . That intention is the offspring of the depraved and vicious condition of his mind , which arises again from neglect so to cultivate and strengthen his moral and reflecting faculties , which are of the higher and better order , as to give them a preponderance over his animal faculties , which are of an inferior order , and , when not restrained and regulated , lead to vice . The real criminality of the deliberate murderer , then , is anterior to the felonious act ' . It consists exclusively in the fell design . But that design would never be cherished , nor for a moment tolerated , were the mind suitably disciplined , and the moral and reflecting faculties made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominate , being the source of assassination , and every other form of crime . If the mind be suitably trained , the higher and virtuous faculties will always give the stronger motives , to which the Will will promptly conform , and vice will be avoided . And such training is perfectly practicable . The source , if not the essence of crime , therefore , consists in willfully neglecting it , and not purifying the mind from vicious propensities . Hence our being drawn into evil practices , by the influence of motives , neither removes nor lessens our guilt , in as much as it ' was in our power so to cultivate and fortify our minds , as to subdue in them criminal propensities , and render them secure from seductive impressions . In plain terms , it is , as already stated , perfectly ' in our power so to discipline our minds , as to establish in them such a condition , that the superior faculties will ' always give the motives to action , to the exclusion of the inferior ones , and lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Will be literally free in its obedience to motives , because no opposing influence is felt , while those motives tend only to what is right . And this result is the product of sound education , begun early , and continued until the requisite habits are confirmed . But , by throwing new and important light on the process of education , Phrenology furnishes us with improved modes of training the mind , strengthening its higher faculties , and preparing them always to furnish the predominant motives . Hence ' it is favorable to the most valuable and desirable form of free Will ; that which decides in favor of virtue . We venture to say that the more enlightened the intellect is , and the stronger the moral powers , the freer is the Will , because it is unfettered by animal passion . On the contrary , the Will of the ' depraved and ignorant is in comparative bondage to their gross , unsubdued , and vi'cious propensities . Still , strictly speaking , its decision is free , because it conforms to the leading propensity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shall close our remarks on this topic , by making B a frank proposition . If he is not satisfied with the cases we adduced , where change of motives produced corresponding changes in the Will , let him state other cases , specifying accurately all the material circumstances connected with them , and we will ' show phrenologically that , in respect to them , the same is true ; or we will yield the question , and acknowledge our error . In every instance , where a skillful examination is had , the motive leading to it , is plain . So true is this , that we hesitate not to say , that an act of the Will without a motive , would be as direct a departure from the laws of nature , as for a ponderous body to move in opposition to the *rrinciple of gravitation , or for the communication of // caloric to water , instead of its abstraction from it , to form ice . Notwithstanding all this , our feelings tell us , that , in every action we perform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our Will is free , we choose our course , and are as sensible of our responsibility , as we are of the motive under which we act . B seems to consider Phrenology a thing of single points and insulated propositions . He is evidently a stranger to the beauty and interest of its numerous combinations . In illustration and proof of these remarks , we offer the following brief quotations " The great rule of judgement which Phrenology proposes at the outset , is , that the strength of any disposition is proportionate to the size of its organ and the activity of the bodily temperament . But it afterwards deviates seriously from this rule , coming into a sort of inconsistency with , or desertion of , itself . " p. 473 . This is a mistake , whose source is obvious . It arises from a defect in B himself : , not in Phrenology . He does not comprehend the full signification of the term temperament . He does not seem to be aware that it includes , in its meaning , the tone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever may be its cause , for high action . Nor does he appear to know that this condition is subject to sundry modifications . It may belong to one part of the system in fuller measure than to another , or to the whole ; and it may be higher at one time than at another . In a particular manner , the temperament or tone of the brain experiences frequent changes , which produce necessarily corresponding changes in that viscus , as the organ of the mind , making it better at one time , and worse at another . We will explain our selves more fully on this point , which is peculiarly important to the science of Phrenology . When any part of the body is unusually excited , it receives , in conformity with a law of organized matter , an unusual amount of arterial blood , as well , we believe , as of cerebral influence . Its reception of the blood is certain ; that of the cerebral influence highly probable . This augmented conflux of vital matter increases , for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fitness for action . Hence its functional performance , whatever it may be , is correspondingly heightened . rrhe phenomena of topical inflammation are in proof of this . Is the finger inflamed ? Its warmth and sensibility , which are vital properties , are increased , a proof that some forms of its action are invigorated . Is the visual apparatus inflamed ? Its sensibility becomes so keen , that the impression of light is often intolerable . The auditory apparatus ? Sound grows painful . And it is well known , that , on the same principles , idiots become intelligent , under cerebral inflammation . The high-toned condition , which is but another phrase for an improved temperament of the brain , renders it more vigorous and efficient , as the organ of the mind . A degree of excitement inferior to inflammation produces a similar effect . The economy of the erectile tessues proves this . When in a state of erection , which consists in a superabundance of arterial blood ,  --  accompanied , no doubt , by a corresponding supply of cerebral influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of these truths to Phrenology places the science , in that respect , beyond controversy . Like other portions of the body , the brain , when excited , becoming a centre of confluxion , receives an inordinate // quantity of blood . This increasing its tone or temperament , for the time , increases equally its power of action , as the organ of the mind . When its excitement ceases , and the blood accumulated in it recedes , its tone declines , and it returns to its ordinary power of action . The truth of this statement is sustained by phenomena familiar to every observer . Passion , which is but the product of high cerebral excitement and action , is marked by an inordinate conflux of blood to the brain . And who does not know that it increases not a little the energy of the mind ? It is tle source of true eloquence , by adding to the fertility and force of conception , and giving greater fluency and vigor to expression . By imparting more intensity to the motive nerves and those portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ augments the strength of the body . By becoming deeply impassioned , a man often doubles the force of his muscular action . Of ferocious madness the same is true . That form of insanity is accompanied with deep cerebral congestion ,  --  we mean arterial congestion . And it is known that the strength of a person in mania ferox is at times quadrupled . From the same cause , madness also frequently produces an improved condition of the intellectual faculties . At times , the amount of this improvement astonishes. hence , during paroxysms of insanity , persons of common capacities in health , converse , at times , with great eloquence , reason acutely , sing , or perform on a musical instrument , arid write poetry with peculiar facility , taste , and elegance . Nor is this all . Mental exertion is an excitant of the brain , injects it with arterial blood , and improves its condition , as the apparatus of the mind . hence , when an orator commences a public discourse , he is often comparatively barren and feeble , both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his brain wants excitement and arterial blood . And these it receives by its own exercise . In a short time , therefore , through the influence of higher cerebral excitement , the carotids of the speaker begin to throb , his countenance flushes , his eyes take fire , and his eloquence , improved in compass , depth , and power , assumes a bolder and loftier tone . his thick-coming thoughts and conceptions are restrained by no other limit than his power to utter them . Even his voice becomes louder and more melodious , and his action improves in fitness , grace , and impressiveness . Nor is the cause of all this concealed . It is the amended temperament of his brain , diffusing its influence through the whole man . Weaken this temperament , and the high mental manifestations , with all their charms and glory , disappear ; and the resplendent orator , shorn of his radiance , becomes a man again , and excites the wonder of his audience no longer .

Phrenologists speak truth , then , when they say , that the power of a cerebral organ is as its size and temperament . And the same is true of every other kind of organ in the body . Other things being alike , its size is the measure of its power . B is frankly challenged to cite an exception . // B alleges that Phrenologists assign the greater " compactness " of some brains as the cause of their superior fitness for intellectual action . We do not assert that such a cause has never been assigned ; but we know not when , where , or by whom . We were entirely ignorant of the existence of the fact , until B 's paper informed us of it . Nor do we believe now that a notion of the kind has ever been seriously maintained by a Phrenologist of standing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and remove from himself the suspicion of inaccuracy . That some brains possess a greater delicacy of fibre than others , appears to be true ; a circumstance which no doubt modifies their action , rendering it perhaps more brisk and sprightly . In this respect the female brain surpasses the male . Its texture , like that of the female system generally , is more delicate and refined , and of a higher finish .

For a similar reason the female muscles exceed the male in quickness , delicacy , and minuteness of motion , giving a sul ) erior fitness for certain kinds of employment Cincinnati.
