txt THERE is no name in the history of this country which is destined to a higher or a more perpetual fame than that of Nathaniel Macon , of North Carolina . The purity and simplicity of his life have made a lasting impression on the minds of his countrymen , and contributed most essentially to elevate the standard of political morality among the public men of his time . The example of his public career , from the humble station of a volunteer soldier in the army of the revolution to the highest rank as a Senator , will , in future times , be referred to as an instructive lesson of wisdom ; and whoever shall studiously observe the admirable calmness of his whole life will respond to the legacy of affectionate remembrance bequeathed to him by the long-tried and faithful friend of his youth *snd his old age. * Mr. Macon 's life was essentially a life of principle . The principles which guided him in his votes as a Senator were but the rules upon which he conducted the administration of all his duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged sphere of action ; nor could the most scrutinizing criticism detect a solitary blot upon the fair fame of his long , useful , and eventful life . We conceive the character of such a man to be an approp ) riate snbject for one of the leading articles in the first number of the Democratic Review . The identity of his name with the great principles upon which this journal stands , affords a suitable opportunity of illustrating those principles , by an appeal to the progressive stages of his public life , to his behaviour as a volunteer soldier , as well as to his votes as a Senator . The obligation which every man should deeply feel to serve his country was well illustrated by Mr. Macon in his enlisting as a volunteer while a student at Princeton , in the year 1777 ; and so eager was he to be useful in the cause of his country , that even after his return to North Carolina , when his mind had been improved by his collegiate studies , and with the advantage of his military service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private soldier , under the command of officers inferior to him in education and fortune . His object was the good of his country , and his purpose to be serviceable was not to be checked by an apprehension of degradation , in the discharge of the duties of a common soldier . Even at that early age his heart was indifferent to the gaudy allurements of ambition , and the intensity of his love for his country reconciled him to the fatigues of the camp , as well as to the strictest obedience of the orders of a superior . * The manner in which Mr. Macon is mentioned in 3ohn Randolph 's will is well known , and is equally honorable to both . VOL.I.NO.1 . B // It is one of the main objects of this Review to protect from the ' sneers and scoffs of what is styled " fashionable society " the pure democratic principle so aptly personified in the youthful character of Mr. Macon , when he entered the army in its humlAest.station . His fortune was in every way ample , his education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and antkjuity of residence , in his native State ; still , when he found the cause of his ' country in danger , he made 110 demand for the favoritism usually extended to men in such circumstances ; . but of his own free will took his place among the privates , of the army . The true principle of democracy is devotion to the interest of the people ; but alas ! how few of the great men of our country have left behind them a name fortified by such an illustrious example of singleness of patriotic purpose ; . an example which should be constantly in view of the youth of our land ; an example which teaches more than the folios of philosophers , and ' which , if lastingly impressed upon the memory of posterity , will contribute no inconsiderable influence to perpetuate our liberty and our Union . Mr. Macon , during the whole war of the revolution , served in not other capacity than . that of a common soldier . Even after the defeat of Gates at Camden , when he again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he preferred the ranks to the subordinate command of the army ; and accordingly we find him under the . command of his brother , Col. John Macon , in one of the companies which hovered on the march . of the British army from Wilmington to the Roanoke . When the war ceased , the people justly a*preciatect his ' sacrifices , and , having found him ever faithful to their honor and . interest , . entrusted him with the civil duties of a legislator , by an election to the House of Commons of North Carolina . It was here that Mr .. Macon was first called upon to bring into practicer by his votes , those sterling principles of democracy , for an ardent support of which his name will ever be memorable in the history of this government . In the character of a legislator , he could not possibly continue unobserved in the ranks of the members . His name , his education , and his meritorious services and sacrifices in the army , now began to have their influence ; and ere long his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees ; and , when the election of Councillors of State came up before the Commons , young Macon expressly declined being considered a candidate for that theiz very honorable and responsible station . From the conclusion of the revolutionary war , the history of North Carolina presents nothing but a succession of popular struggles , growing out of the distress always incidental to a depreciated paper currency ; and both in the Assembly , and among the people , Mr. Macon was distinguished for the high sternness of the remedies he // proposed . The revolution had been conducted by means of paper issues , but this circulating medium had been so long below its nominal value , that in the general exchanges and contracts of the country , it was only received at a degraded discount , which the common consent of all had regularly established . It was therefore that , in the arrangement of the finances of the State , we find such men as Mr. Macon the advocates of a law legitimating the depreciated standard of those paper issues , and pledging the credit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount only as they were received by the people of the whole country . It was in this kind of money the soldiers of the revolution had been paid for their services to their country , and his ideas of justice taught him that they alone , and not the persons to whom they might have passed it , were really entitled to indemnity for the loss . The State was without means , as it had formerly been without freedom , and it was the duty of patriotic men to suffer once more for the maintenance of her credit and her fame . Such was the doctrine of Mr. Macon in a time of the deepest public distress . While the politicians of North Carolina were busily engaged in the discussion of the affairs of the State , the subject of the Federal Constitution was brought before the people ; and on the division of parties on this question , Mr. Macon was found among its thorough opponents . It is unnecessary here to allude at much length to the principles of the two parties which then came into collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the formation and adoption of a federal constitution . The reasons which influenced him to such a course were his convictions that any general government , independent of the legislatures of the several States , would soon be independent of the will of the people ; and that then corruption in every shape would ensue . In this , as in every thing else , he was guided by the simple democratic rule , that government was made for the people , and that it should never be beyond the immediate reach of their voice , or the absolute control of their will . To his latest hour he rejoiced in his original opposition to the present plan of a federal government ; and in the gloomy hour of the Proclamation and the Force Bill , ' he recurred to the reminiscence with evident satisfaction . Splendid governments at best are but the disguises of tyranny ; and Mr. Macon thought that he saw in the constitution of the United States the lurking elements of corruption , which the ingenious and forced constructions of mercenary politicians would soon develope into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adoption of the constitution until November , 1789 . The first election for members of Congress was therefore only for an unexpired term of service , and for this post Mr. Macon was not a candidate . He was first elected to the House of Representatives in the summer of 1791 , // and took his seat on the 25th of October of that year . He immediately commenced an active and energetic opposition to the financial schemes of Alexander Hamilton , then Secretary of the Treasury ; and the intimacy which was then formed between Jefferson and himself continued until death separated them forever . Mr. Macon found himself in Congress surrounded by the same condition of parties as in the Assembly of North Carolina . Persons who had speculated in the depreciated paper issues and debts of the States were hovering around the legislative halls of the infant government , exerting themselves but too successfully to induce the members to support the scheme of funding , at a par value , the paper which they had received at an immense depreciation ; and , remembering the shameful extortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then disbanded army by these speculating m'uckworms , he could not conceive the honesty or justice of their claims for the indemnity which they now pressed with all the importunity of avarice . Throughout the whole of the administration of Gen. Washington , Mr. Macon was found among the members of the opposition . Against Jay 's treaty , as to every other leading measure , he zealously exerted himself ; and it was about this period of his life he commenced those political arrangements which , in the course of a very few years , overthrew the federal party of North Carolina . His only weapon , however , was an appeal to the people ; and this appeal he founded upon the danger which threatened the integrity of our democratic institutions ; and , throwing himself upon his country for a trial , he brought to the defence of his position a moral force of argument and reason which ultimately secured to him the most signal triumph . When we recur to the tremendous force of mind arrayed against him , we can not but wonder at his success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were but some of the leaders of the federal party , men of gigantic minds , of profound learning , and of the most consummate skill . They were men , too , who had every claim upon the affections of their countrymen for the distinguished services they had rendered in the darkest hour of the war , in the cabinet as well as in the field . The w*iole press of the State was emphatically under their control ; the influence of the General Government was in their hands ; and , in short , every means of success was brought to bear in this grand struggle to overwhelm the simple majesty of this obstinate and high-souled democrat . The campaign commenced in the Assembly with an effort to legislate him out of Congress , by a reorganization of the districts , in which the county of Warren ( which is on the Virginia line ) was annexed to a county in the neighborhood of South Carolina ; but the very means which the federalists used to defeat him recoiled back upon themselves , for he extended his influence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confidence which his personal character invariably inspired . Those who had supposed , from the simplicity and innocence of his manners , that he was inefficient , knew but little either of Mr. Macon or of the people among whom he had been reared into life . He was no intriguer , no follower of the opinions of men , no worshipper of popular prejudice , no flatterer of power ; his art , his only source of influence over the minds of the people , was simply the almost magical force of his character , the attributes of which were , contempt for the ostentatious pretensions of wealth or power , indifference to the dignity or emoluments of office , and an immovable adherence to his own opinions . Wherever he went , his example , as well as his language , instructed the people in the principles of democracy ; and it was perhaps the complete political ubiquity forced upon him by the legislation of the Assembly , that contributed , more than any other cause , to hasten the downfall of the federal party in North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party was , that they had underrated the genius of Mr. Macon , and mistaken the character of the man . They had not studied the history of his life . They did not appreciate the indefatigable and unshrinking patriotism of him who , when a boy , and surrounded by all the blandishments of wealth and maternal affection , joined the army of his country as a common soldier . They did not perceive , as they should have done , in this one act of his life , that his spirit and his convictions were as unconquerable as were the principles which he so boldly avowed ; and that , come what might , those principles , personified in his public and private character , could not be forgotten whilst he lived . Mr. Macon had thus established the foundations of his popularity deep in the affections of the citizens of his native county , and , by degrees , extending himself from county to county , he was soon felt in the remotest parts of the State . Every inch of ground he gained was seen to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic principle . The bond which united his party was the determination to simplify , to cheapen , and to restrain the apparently heedless career of the new government , which bade fair , by its alien and sedition laws , to strangle the infant genius of American liberty , and , by its profuse expenditure of the public money , to corrupt and to bribe the people into a support of the Liberticide . So rapid , indeed , was the progress of events leading to the ultimate triumph of the democratic party , that though , in 1799 , the Assembly of North Carolina rejected the Virginia resolutions in favor of State rights , one single year more developed the defeat of Mr. Adams , and the complete success of Mr. Macon , in the vote which North Carolina gave for Mr. Jefferson . Still further triumphs awaited the hero of the democracy in the congressional election in the Halifax district , in which General Davie ( who had returned // from his mission to France ) took the field , in a last effort to restore the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher respect for the character of General Davie than Mr. Macon ; no man felt more grateful to him for his eminent military services , or was more disposed to accord to him the applause due to his high and commanding talents ; hut still they were separated by the great principle of the age in which they lived , and struggle after struggle had no doubt embittered the contest . The election came on , and General Davie was defeated . The catastrophe disbanded the federal party of the State ; and although , for a long time afterwards , it rallied in the Newbern and Salisbury districts to the support of a Stanley , a Gaston , a Henderson , and a Person , still it was no longer a party which could reasonably aspire to the control of the State . From the very commencement of the administration of Mr. Jefferson , Mr. Macon became one of the leaders of the popular house of Congress , and the respect and confidence of his fellow members e1evated him to the chair of its presiding officer . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited , in the strongest light , those distinctive principles of character for which he was so remarkable . He demanded of every member the strictest obedience to the rules of the house , and the gazettes of the day allude in high terms of praise to the excellent order which prevailed in the legislative proceedings , under his direction . He had obeyed the commands of authority as a soldier , and it was this high sense of allegiance to legitimate authority which made practicable the democratic principles he professed . Democracy is too often confounded with licentiousness ; but Mr. Macon has left behind him ai* example which distinguishes the two , illustrating , in every act of his life , the practice of the purest popular principles , in the enjoyment of the highest honors of office , as well as in the faithful discharge of his duties as a citizen . From the administration of iVUr . Jefferson to the year 1816 , Mr. Macon continued his support of the leading measures of the party to which he belonged . It was , however , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to perceive , as he thought , slight symptoms of decline in the purity of the principles of the democratic party . The first four years of Mr. Jefferson 's administration , he used frequently to say , were the most propitious days for the democracy ; and it is remarkable that after this period we find him frequently voting with the Opposition , especially on appropriations ( Teemed by the government indispensable to its existence . To Mr. Madison 's administration he came very near a decided opposition . He thought all his cabinet appointments unfortunate for the interest of the country , and some of them decidedly antidemocratic . But still he continued to stand forth as the leader of // *democracy , and whenever the course of policy of the cabinet veered from the range of his support , the records of the House of Reprerentatives will show that it lost the votes of many of the most distinguished members of the party , of which he was the acknowledgea nucleus . We propose to say but a few words on the subject of Mr. Macon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , in 1812 . He voted for the declaration of war , but he voted against the appropriations to sustain it ; and for this he has been denounced , in terms by no means remarkable for their courtesy . But we shall have as little difficulty in defending his course upon this subject as upon any other ; and need only , in fact , appeal to the bills of appropriation themselves , which embrace not only expenditures for the support of the war , but for nearly every service of the whole country . It was as common in those days as in these in which we live , for The opposition to the government to insert in the regular bills of appropriation for its support every item of unpopular expenditure. , which the heated mind of a factionist could suggest ; and these bills for the support of the war were not unfrequently filled with appropriations for objects wholly without the meaning of its title . Mr. Macon would not vote a million of dollars for the support of the war , if he was obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , no respect for the tricks of . legislation , even when he thought the honor of the country was at stake . It appeared to him too much like bribing people to be patriotic . If the war could nat be conducted without falsifying the title of a law , he would prefer an appeal to the people , to rally and fight , as they had fought before , without appropriations for their pay . His patriotism was , indeed , too lofty for the reach of the ordinary race of politicians ; his sense of obligation to the people , not to squander their money , too unbending for the log-rolling honesty of factious demagogues , who were and are ever ready to perjure themselves , in case some one opposed to their mercenary views will reciprocate the crime . Fiut justitia is the creed of but too few of the statesmen of this country , o.r of this age ; but the example of Mr. Macon will attest the fact , that strict justice and honesty can never fail to secure the happiness of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unnecessary to give a more detailed account of the principles of Mr* Macon . The remainder of his life , from the year 1816 , ( when he took his seat in the Senate , ) to the period of his death , was spent in the daily practice of the precepts , and adherence to the doeitrines of an honest democrat . He was opposed to the Bank of the Ijuited States , and , indeed , to all banks ; to all forced constructions of The constitution ; to all duties for the protection of manufactures ; // to all schemes of internal improvement by the aid of the government ; and , in short , to every expenditure of the public money for purposes not absolutely necessary . He looked upon the public treasury as the property of the people ; and recognized no difference between the criminality of a breach of public and of private trust . If he had been the agent of one of his neighbors to receive and pay out money , he could not have been more scrupulous in his notions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely challenged for another example of serener lustre , as a strictly honest public servant . In 1828 , after the election of General Jackson was ascertaine4 Mr. Macon resigned his seat in the Senate , and retired altogether from public life . In the daily performance of the duties of a good citizen , he continued to live until the year 1835 , when he was called out from his retirement , by the unanimous voice of his fellowcitizens , to become a member of the convention of the people , for the amendment of the constitution of North Carolina . He was elected President of that body , and united with Judge Gaston in the noble effort which that gentleman made to establish the freedom of religious opinion . On many other occasions , however , he differed from his distinguished friend on the most important political subjects , and in the last hour of the existence of the convention , he voted against the amended constitution , because it destroyed annual elections . While a member of the convention he frequently brought before the public , in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of courts of justice , a principle which he held incompatible with the rights of a free people , and dangerous to the very existence of true liberty . In 1836 , Mr. Macon was again called upon by the people of North Carolina , to consummate another and signal triumph of democracy . He was chosen to act as elector of President and Vice President of the United States , in the late memorable contest , in which North Carolina rendered such noble service to the cause of Mr. Yam Buren , and repaired to Raleigh , where he presided over the deliberations of the college of electors . Many of the friends of Mr. Macon were strongly opposed to the use made of his name , in placing him at the head of the electoral ticket  --  and the writer of this notice ventured , in a confidential letter , to protest against his entrance again into public life , on the ground that his presidency of the State convention was the most appropriate termination of his political career ; and he ventured likewise to suggest , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool of a party , and not the patriarch of the people of the State . To the letter above alluded to , Mr. Maco made the following remarkable and characteristic reply : // WARREN COUNTY , October 6 , 1836 . Sia : I had nothing to do with putting my name on the democratic ticket of electors ; and I shall certainly not have it taken off . If the people of North Carolina elect me to any service , I will , as far as I am able , and in the way I can , perform it . I am glad you have written to me , because I know you will , according to nature , live after me : and I know your habit of writing history will not allow you to respect my name as I want it to be respected , namely-in silence . It is not the first time I have been advised against being an elector , on the ground of people suspecting me of being a tool of a party . A party is nothing more than a union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I agree with those people , I had as lief be their tool , as to be any thing else in political life . I think Mr. Van Buren the best man for the office of President ; and I shall vote for him , if I go to the election ; and if I am chosen elector , I shall go to Raleigh , if I am able . I think better of the people than most of the men I meet with . I have tried them in every way , and never found them faithless . It is men who set up for leaders who betray them , and make them suspicious . My health is as good as could be expected . I send you aletterof old General Person , which lately cmne into my possession . I wish you every success in life . Your kinsman . N. MACON . After Mr. Macon returned from Raleigh , in November , 1836 , whither he had been to fulfil the predictions of the above letter , he remained constantly at home , dispensing the hospitality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be obviously preparing for death , which he knew was close upon his lengthened duration of life ; and his friends had the satisfaction to perceive that the continued indications of its approach gave no uneasiness to a man whose life had been essentially a career of virtue and usefulness . In the spring preceding the date of this review , he was suddenly attacked with some of the symptoms of a paralysis ; but under the temperance of his life , he soon revived , and was restored to the usual health of his old age . But a few days more , however , rolled over his head , when , on the 29th of June , 1837 , he expired at Buck Spring , the name of his plantation , in his native county of Warren . The incidents of his last illness have lately been before the public , in the newspapers of the country , and his funeral has been alluded to , as a most remarkable exhibition of the grief and veneration of a whole people . We are informed by a correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were present on the melancholy occasion , all deeply impressed with a sense of the irreparable loss which the whole country had sustained . The few of his old companions in arms , who still remained upon the theatre of life , were there , mingling their veteran tears with those who had grown up under the free government which their almost forgotten trials had achieved . The deceased had made provision for his funeral before his death ; and in ordering that all who came to it should be hospitably entertained , he did not forget the poor slaves , whose grateful hearts he knew would bring them to the scene to pay the last tribute of idolatrous love . The feelings of all were too intense for expression , and the voice of the minister alone broke the // universal silence of the peopled grave . The good old man is dead and buried ; and though no monument of brass shall mark his grave , the spot will be immortal in the traditionary reverence which the posterity of his countrymen will pay it to the last hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Mr. Macon are emphatically identified with the ultra democratic principle , not only of this country , but of this age . He was a democrat , because he believed in the integrity of the people ; and he looked to their legitimately expressed will , as the supreme law . According to his creed , government was created for mankind , and not mankind for government . Freedom-unqualified freedom-was the grand prerogative of nature . " All men were born free and equal . " Ingenious and entangled forms of government were the veils of tyranny , which it was patriotic to rend asunder . A tendency to usurpation and corruption was the nature of all human institutions ; and the only palliative , a frequent recurrence to the fundamental and absolute authority of the popular voice . It was a constant and hearty allegiance to this great principle of the age in which we live , that distinguished the career of Mr. Macon . It is impossible to suggest a single deformity in the completeness of his democratic character . The silly and ostentatious pretensions of wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circumstance which legitimate power too often affects , only contributed to nerve him in his advocacy of the supremacy of the people . Throughout his whole political life , we find him ever the unflinching antagonist of those boasted conservative powers of the Federal Government ; which , say what we will , are the disguises of monarchy , to retrench and abridge which is the most sacred duty of the democracy of the land . The usurpations of the Supreme Court , he contended , were but the natural results of its total irresponsibility to the will of the people ; an authority always despised by the pampered holders of perpetual offices with perpetual salaries . The corrupt legislation of Congress he ascribed to the six years independence of the Senate , and the two years holy-day of the representatives of the people  --  and he hesitated not openly to assert the theory , that annual elections would enlighten as well as purify the " united wisdom " of the nation . These principles Mr. Macon applied , not only to the action of the General Government , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to the municipal regulations of the county in which he lived . He proclaimed at his fireside , at the court-yard of Warren , and in the Convention of the State , that when annual elections ceased , the liberty of the people was no longer safe ,  --  and he left an impressive warning to his country , in assigning , as the only reason for his vote against the Constitution of North Carolina , in 1835 , that it annihilated annual elections . In his domestic habits , Mr. Macon was essentially an affectionate nian . He had *ione of that moroseness at the fireside , which too // often accompanies great political distinction ; and even in the gov. eminent of his slaves , he was the kindest and most beloved of masters . No man was ever more revered by those who knew him best . And when , as was , however , but seldom his habit , he visited his friends and relatives , it was beautiful to observe the warm , cordial love , with which even the children of their house would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenderest sensibilities , and of the strongest and most endearing affection . How completely he entwined himself about the hearts of his friends , let the last memorial of the ascetic Randolph attest . He paid back to his friends , however , from the warmth of his own heart , every tribute of affection yielded to him . And , although he did not vaunt himself upon his good deeds , the writer of this article could here , were it necessary , record a long list of charities , ever active , though unostentatious , and munificent , because they were always useful.
