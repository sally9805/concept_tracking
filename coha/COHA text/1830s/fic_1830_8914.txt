PREFACE . The play of the Disowned is founded upon a French drama , entitled Lc Caissier , by Monsieur Jouslin.  --  Many liberties have been taken with the original , in adapting it to the American stage , especially in the last act , where Bertrand kills his sister . In the French piece Amelia retires to a convent , and Bertrand is taken into custody , the same hardened wretch as he appears in the earlier scenes . The termination was without a climax , leaving a painful sensation on the mind of the spectator  --  for Amelia is still alive , and the man to whom she is so devotedly attached is given in marriage to another . Besides , a blemish is unnecessarily thrown upon the moral character of Amelia , which diminishes the interest awakened by her situation . The result proved the alterations to be judicious ; and the powerful acting of Mr. Rowbotham , after the death of Amelia , never failed to rivet the attention , and elicit the unqualified applause of the audience . Indeed , to the able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the piece indebted , in a great degree , for its flattering success ; and to the performers generally the author tenders his acknowledgments for the zeal and ability displayed in bringing his drama upon the stage . The Disowned was first produced at the Baltimore Theatre , March 26 , 1829 . DRAMATIS PERSON . Duval , ( a banker , ) Mr. Hathwell . Gustavus St. Felix , ( his cashier ) Southwell .

Andrew Curse that fellow , he 's a perfect sticking plaster . He appears , to have taken root . I wonder what the deuce he can want . Ber . Bertrand Harkee , young man . And . Andrew ( Aside . ) Young man ! pretty familiar ! well , sir . Ber . Bertrand I have been cooling my heels here for half an hour , and begin to grow a little impatient . And . Andrew I have already told you , sir , that Mr. Malfort does n't lodge here . Ber . Bertrand I know you have , but here he transacts his business , and this is therefore the most likely place to meet with him . Since I must wait , hand me another paper . And . Andrew ( Aside . ) Here 's assurance ! Ber . Bertrand I like to see what is passing in the world . I say , young man . And . Andrew Eternal questioner . ( Aside . ) Ber . Bertrand You have lived here for some time , have you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bertrand Right . An industrious shrewd lad , I 'll warrant me , with an eye to main chance . How stands Mr. Malfort with the old chap ? And . Andrew Old chap ! Ber . Bertrand The banker here ; Mr. Duval , I mean . And . Andrew He is the old chap 's right hand man . Ber . Bertrand So .  --  The house is staunch  --  no want of funds , I suppose ? And . Andrew What can the fellow mean ? ( Aside . ) Ber . Bertrand Well , these bankers are happy fellows indeed ! Why was not my lot cast among them instead of  --  no matter . ( Raising his voice impatiently . ) The devil ! am I to be kept waiting here all day , for a  --  I say , young man . And . Andrew What , again ! Ber . Bertrand What is the hour ? I have forgotten my watch . And . Andrew Forgotten !  --  It is half-past nine . Looking at his watch . Ber . Bertrand So late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . And . Andrew ( Returning it to his fob . ) I go by the town clock . Ber . Bertrand I have it  --  my old resource . Takes tobacco and pipe from his pocket . And . Andrew ( Aside . ) A pipe ! surely he has'nt the impudence to smoke here . Ber . Bertrand ( To himself , cleaning his pipe . ) Yes , this is my only resource when my spirits are depressed , and fortune frowns . Within this little tube I find solace , rational reflection , philosophy  --  yes , true philosophy , at five sous an ounce . Produces a tinder box and strikes fire . But , unfortunately , philosophy is but a ragged virtue , and no longer passes current in the world . Going to light his pipe . And . Andrew Stay , sir , do you know what you are doing ? Ber . Bertrand Yes , lighting my pipe to be sure . And . Andrew What an impudent rascal it is ! Enter Malfort.  --  R. H. And . Andrew Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you , sir . Mal . Malfort Me ! ( Aside  --  recognizing Bertrand , who takes off his hat and salutes him very respectfully . ) What do I see ! Bertrand ! ( Authoritatively . ) Your business , fellow ? Leave us Andrew . And . Andrew I 'll have an eye upon that fellow for I do n't half like him . Exit . L. H. Ber . Bertrand So , since he is gone I may reserve my respect for another occasion . ( Puts on his hat and extends his hand to Malfort . ) Well , Malfort , my worthy fellow , how do you do ? Mal . Malfort Well . But how is this ! Bertrand in such a dress . Ber . Bertrand Times have changed with me . Once we were equals  --  partners in iniquity , but now you are at the top of fortune 's wheel , and I at the bottom . Well , no matter ; so it is  --  you wrote that you wished to see me , and here I am . Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons in attendance , and I would not  --  Ber . Bertrand Be seen with me . I understand . Well , there is no disputing it ; we are not exactly birds of the same feather , though we do flock together . ( Touching Malfort 's coat . ) Can we confer here ? Mal . Malfort Yes ; Mr. Duval is engaged , and we are not likely to be interrupted for some time . Ber . Bertrand Well , to business . Despatch is my motto . Mal . Malfort When I first knew you , Bertrand , about ten years ago , you were a handsome spirited young fellow , with some property . Ber . Bertrand Yes ; my patrimony . The cash then jingled merrily , and merrily did I dance to the tune . But do not speak of those times ; the recollection always makes me melancholy . Mal . Malfort Since then , I have lost sight of you . Ber . Bertrand Like enough ; I wanted to see a little of the world , and travelled . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to have paid for yours . By accident I encountered you last week ; when , struck with the misery of your appearance , you recollect I promised to render you a service . Ber . Bertrand For old acquaintance sake . ' T was friendly . Mal . Malfort Something now presents itself . Ber . Bertrand I am glad of it . Bread and water may suffice to keep body and soul together , but I am a gentleman born and bred , and would live , not merely exist . To business , then . What would you have of me ? Mal . Malfort I wish to employ you in an office which relates to me alone . I have need of one on whom I can safely depend , and I believe I can count upon you . Ber . Bertrand Certainly . My word of honor ; besides , if it is my interest . Mal . Malfort The recompense shall be liberal . Ber . Bertrand Enough . To the point . I like brevity . Mal . Malfort Though I am one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live extravagantly and appear rich , you must know , Bertrand , that I am worth  --  Ber . Bertrand Nothing . Therein we resemble each other . The sprigs of nobility are not now as easily pidgeoned as they were ten years ago . Go on . Mal . Malfort Though involved , I hope soon to extricate myself from my critical situation . Mr. Duval has a lovely daughter , whose dowry will be great . She is beautiful as an angel  --  amiable  --  Ber . Bertrand ( Interrupting him . ) You have said enough .  --  Never mind her personal charms . You wander from the point . Mal . Malfort I was about to propose myself as a suitor , when a friend of Mr. Duval , a Mr. St. Felix , a rich citizen of Havre , sent his nephew to be cashier of this establishment . I was not backward in perceiving that a marriage was contemplated , and that Miss Pauline , Duval 's daughter , did not regard young St. Felix with indifference . Ber . Bertrand Human nature  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsophisticated cashier , on arriving at Paris , of course , stood in need of a mentor , and I was chosen as the most proper person to teach him the principles of civilization . Ber . Bertrand And , under your tuition , he doubtless made rapid progress . Mal . Malfort So I flatter myself . In less than two months he dissipated more than his yearly salary . Ber . Bertrand A lad of spirit . I should be proud of his acquaintance . Mal . Malfort That was but half the service I rendered him , As I perceived he was struck with Miss Duval 's charms , I introduced him to a female as remarkable for her beauty as the splendor in which she lives . She is called Madam de Courcy , the widow of a colonel . Ber . Bertrand De Courcy ! The widow of a colonel . Right , I am all attention . Go on . Mal . Malfort As I anticipated , he soon forgot Pauline , and became enamoured of the widow . Happy only in her presence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During his delirium , I managed to introduce into the same house , agents of mine , who fleeced him of large sums of money , which his situation enabled him to procure , and now he stands indebted to this establishment upwards of twenty thousand francs . Ber . Bertrand The devil ! In less than a year , such a sum .  --  Malfort , I bow respectfully to the superiority of your genius . Taking off his hat . Mal . Malfort I have done well , but must still do better . The crisis approaches . The young profligate 's uncle arrived yesterday , and a marriage is evidently on foot . Ber . Bertrand Why not then disclose at once his extravagance and passion for the widow ? Mal . Malfort That would be unwise . I am considered his sincere friend , and it is still my interest to strengthen that idea . Besides , a disclosure at this time , would not eventuate in any good to me ; his follies would be forgiven after temporary displeasure , and my aim frustrated . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , if possible , hasten his alliance with the widow , which has been delayed , alone , by dread of his uncle 's anger . Ber . Bertrand Then she loves this St. Felix ? Mal . Malfort Deeply  --  desperately . I wish to place some one near her who will render me an account of all that passes between them , and upon you I have thrown my eyes , as being a fit person for the office . Ber . Bertrand I am flattered at the preference . The very thing for me  --  a gentleman born and bred . Mal . Malfort I heard her mention the other day that she was in want of some trusty person , in the character of steward ; you came to my mind , and I immediately wrote to you . I will give you a letter of recommendation ; ( Goes to the table and writes. ) and flatter myself my name will be sufficient . Remember , be diligent , faithful , and , above all , secret . Ber . Bertrand Doubt me not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ; I have travelled . But the reward . Mal . Malfort Shall , as I told you , be great . Ber . Bertrand I am not over particular in such matters , but , since you have a pen in your hand , I prefer plain black and white . Memories are treacherous ; words , unsubstantial . ' T is my humour . Mal . Malfort To insure your fidelity I will indulge it then . ( Writes . ) Here ; by this I promise to pay you , on my marriage with Pauline , twenty thousand francs . Will that satisfy you ? Ber . Bertrand Perfectly . ( Reading the paper . ) Right . This now will undergo no change , but speak the same thing till doomsday , while mere words are constantly liable to be perverted and misunderstood . Mal . Malfort ( Aside . ) I have been too hasty . Stay , give me that paper again . Ber . Bertrand ( Coolly putting it up . ) That 's not necessary . I am perfectly satisfied as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' T is Gustavus ; be on your guard . Bertrand assumes a respectful air . Enter Gustavus.  --  L. H. Gus . Gustavus St Felix Ah ! I have found you my dear Malfort at last . I have been looking for you every where . Mal . Malfort Good day , good day , my friend .  --  By your leave ; I am yours in an instant . ( Giving letter to Bertrand . ) Take this , sir , and I trust you will find it serviceable .  --  No thanks , no thanks , one is always happy in obliging honest people . So , my dear sir , do not stay any longer , for I have already intruded on your time . Ber . Bertrand I shall never forget your kindness . ( Eyeing Gustavus as he goes out . ) A promising lad that , and , though he has been pretty well plucked , it may be worth while to pick him closer yet . Exit . L. H. Gus . Gustavus St Felix My friend , who is that man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery  --  but he merits a better lot . I have interested myself for him , and recommended him to Madam de Courcy , as a person to whom she may entrust the offices of her household . She requires such a person , and this man will be found capable and trustworthy , and , above all , very happy with so sweet a lady . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Who could be otherwise than happy in her presence ! Beloved Amelia !  --  But , Malfort , I have hastened to see you , for I am drawn to the verge of despair . You know not what has happened . Never was the assistance of your friendship more necessary to me than at this moment . A terrible misfortune menaces me ; and , without your aid , I am lost forever . Mal . Malfort Lost ! you amaze me ! What dreadful thing has occurred ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix You know my imprudence ; my guilt . Yes , call it by that name ! the sums I have squandered at gaming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my despair ; this day Mr. Duval requires from me an exhibit of my accounts . Mal . Malfort How ! can he suspect ! he can not know ! Gus . Gustavus St Felix I think not  --  nay , I am sure he does not know of my extravagance : he spoke to me so mildly that I should wrong him in supposing it . But , Malfort , my friend , can you imagine my horror , when , on making up my accounts I found there was a deficiency of  --  Mal . Malfort Some hundreds , I suppose . A trifle ! Gus . Gustavus St Felix No , no ; thousands  --  thousands .  --  Disgrace , shame , ruin and dishonor now await me . Mal . Malfort Be comforted ; there are few conditions so deplorable but that they may be relieved . Hope . Gus . Gustavus St Felix ( Starting from him . ) Hope ! name it not . It has been my ruin . ' T was hope that induced me to risk fresh sums in order to regain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no hope , no comfort for me  --  nought but shame , lasting and consuming shame . Mal . Malfort Trust me there is room for much to be done . A few days since I gave into your hands bills of different capitalists . Some of them  --  most of them are nearly due . I will make use of all my efforts to have them cashed . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Ah ! my dear friend , I fear you but divert me with a shadow . Mal . Malfort Come , come , be more confident in me . Remember that the night is darkest as the day approaches , and , indeed , your situation appears to me more happy than ever . Though you have debts , your marriage with Pauline will enable you to liquidate them all . Gus . Gustavus St Felix What say you ! I marry Pauline ! think you I will abandon Amelia ? No ; rather let my uncle desert me ; rather let me become the scorn and scoff of the world , ere I commit an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your union with Miss Duval appears decided . Gus . Gustavus St Felix No ; no one has yet explained my situation with Amelia , and I hope  --  Mal . Malfort What can you hope from such an explanation ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix Alas ! Malfort , I am ignorant myself , but this I know , that there is no power on earth shall separate me from Amelia . Mal . Malfort You have scarcely an instant left to decide , it is therefore well that you have resolved . What if your uncle commands you to espouse Miss Duval , you will not hesitate to refuse ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix Oh ! Malfort , it is that refusal tortures me.  --  How shall I dare to announce it to him , what pretext can I offer ? I can not speak of Amelia ; and if he discovers my passion , I know so well the severity of his disposition , that he never will pardon me . All my hopes of fortune depend upon him , and deprived of his friendship I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my debts ; how shall I be able to conceal my shame and dishonour from the world ? Mal . Malfort See  --  now you are giving yourself up to despondency again . Compose yourself , St. Felix , your uncle , approaches . Gus . Gustavus St Felix My uncle  --  at such a time . Enter St. Felix .  --  L. H. St. Felix . St Felix Ah ! this looks well ; at your post by times . I like this  --  industry and activity are the certain guides to fortune . But , nephew , is not this the gentleman of whom you have written to me so often ; Mr. Malfort ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix The same , sir ; my best friend . St. Felix . St Felix And mine , of course , if you will permit so old a man to be classed among the number of your friends . Mal . Malfort You do me great honour , sir . St. Felix . St Felix By St. Anthony I am delighted in knowing you . Do you know , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Malfort To me , sir ? St. Felix . St Felix Yes , yes , to you , yourself . My friend , Duval , has told me all . You have been the guide and mentor of my nephew here ; every one speaks in his praise , and what is it owing to but your counsel and example . Do n't go to disclaim it , but if ever you should stand in need of a friend , remember John Ambrose St. Felix . Mal . Malfort Your civility confuses me . St. Felix . St Felix Tut , tut , sir , call it friendship , pure friendship . I am a plain , blunt man ; put me to the proof and you shall judge of the sincerity of my esteem . But , od 's so , I am forgetting myself ; business must be attended to . If your presence is required elsewhere , Mr. Malfort , do n't let the silly chatter of an old man detain you . Make no ceremony with me . Mal . Malfort Since you permit me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . ( Aside . ) An embarrassing interview . ( To Gustavus . ) Keep up your spirits and count upon my prudence . Exit .  --  L. H. St. Felix . St Felix Now , that young man pleases me amazingly . He possesses one of those prepossessing figures that strike at first sight . I should have known him any where for a candid , honest man . A look is sufficient for me ; I read the character at once , and was never yet deceived in a physiognomy . But to leave him  --  I came to speak to you , Gustavus , of an affair that interests you nearly . Gus . Gustavus St Felix To me , sir ! What is he going to say ? I tremble . ( Aside . ) St. Felix . St Felix When your father died he left nothing but some poems , comedies and stories , which the world called very fine , but which were to you not worth a sous . My poor brother was a worthy man  --  but that mania for writing played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars I had no such genius , and never composed any thing more poetical than a bill of lading , or letter of instructions . I need not tell you that I made an ample fortune by such compositions . Gus . Gustavus St Felix My dear sir , whither does this tend ? St. Felix . St Felix Zounds , boy , do n't interrupt me ; ca n't you let me tell my story my own way . You were brought to me a friendless orphan . The sight of you set my tears flowing afresh for the memory of my poor brother . He was my only brother . You perceived my tears , and , though but an infant , wept from sympathy . I caught you in my arms , and while striving to kiss off your tears , mingled my own with them . You clung to me as if sensible of my feelings at that moment . This child , I sobbed , has his father 's heart ; he shall be the consolation of my old days ; for his sake I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  father , monitor , friend . I have kept my word , and with pride I declare , my honourable boy , you have never given me reason to repent of my resolution . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Oh ! Heaven ! my benefactor ! How shall I speak ? St. Felix . St Felix Enough , enough my boy . I see you now a prudent , upright and accomplished man  --  just what my hopes anticipated ; and since you are the pride and joy of my declining years , it is but just that I should strive to make some recompense . I have been thinking  --  but tell me candidly , what do you think of Mr. Duval 's daughter ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix Heavens  --  what a question to put to me !  --  ( Aside . ) St. Felix . St Felix Do you not believe that she will render that man truly happy who may possess her as a wife ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix Doubtless ; certainly  --  Miss Duval possesses all the accomplishments , all the virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Felix . St Felix That is to say , you would ask no better in marriage ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix My uncle  --  I know  --  St. Felix . St Felix Well , well  --  why do n't you speak out ;  --  Be plain , and say at once , you love Pauline . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Believe me , I am fully sensible  --  I feel  --  St. Felix . St Felix Yes , yes , it is all clear enough ; this embarrassment declares what you are too sheepish to utter . Make your mind easy ; the business is settled ;  --  she shall be your wife . Gus . Gustavus St Felix My wife ! oh ! Amelia ! St. Felix . St Felix Yes , my boy , yes ; I have just left Mr. Duval , who agrees to the marriage , and gives with his daughter a liberal portion ; that portion I will double on your part . But mark you , Gustavus , if , instead of being an industrious citizen , and making yourself honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who glory in their dissipation ; drink , gamble , keep mistresses and ruin their families  --  I love you much , Gustavus , more than any thing on earth  --  you might break my heart by such a course of conduct , but I would never forgive you ! never ! Gus . Gustavus St Felix I am silenced . ( Aside . ) St. Felix . St Felix But I have no fear of that nature . Come , you no doubt are anxious to salute your intended .  --  Come , follow me , and I will break the ice for you  --  you sheepish fellow . Gus . Gustavus St Felix No , no , not just now  --  an important affair  --  your pardon , sir , I am forced to leave you . Going . St. Felix . St Felix How !  --  stay , stay  --  at such a time you may surely steal a moment . See , here comes Mr. Duval and his daughter . Gus .

Duval Well , my daughter , you hear  --  you know our wishes ; but your father will never influence your choice . Is it not true that you love Gustavus ? Pau . Pauline My dear father , you know  --  St. Felix . St Felix That delicacy forbids such a confession , you would say , my dear . ' T is clear enough , Duval ; we will strengthen our old friendship by this union , and make but one family . Ha ! wo n't that be charming . In an under tone to Duval . But have you seen to the contract ? Duval . Duval Well thought of . Pauline , my love , excuse us for a moment . St. Felix . St Felix Do n't speak ; I know what you would say ; the business we are about carries its own excuse . Ha ! ha ! do I not read your thoughts , my pretty little niece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then true ! Gustavus loves me , and I am happy ! I have secretly accused him of coldness and indifference , but I have wronged him ; his reserve was discretion ; his silence , respect .

Your pardon , Miss Duval ; I was not aware  --  I intrude  --  perhaps  --  About to retire . Pau . Pauline Nay , sir , ' t is I who ought to apologize . This is not my place ; my father conducted me hither and has just left me for an instant . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Regarding her . How beautiful ! what a figure !

True , your name was affixed to them , but your great losses at play have become known , and they sneered at the sight of your name . Gus .

Hastily takes a number of notes from his portfolio and gives them to Andrew . Count out sixty thousand francs . St. Felix . St Felix Wretch ! could I ever have supposed this ? Shame pursue you . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Cursed be the hour that I looked upon a card ! A gambler ! O ! that I had never been born ! A gambler . A curse upon society ; a disgrace to the human race . Fallen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth ! Respected , beloved , affluent and happy in friends ;  --  what more on earth could I desire ! Heaven 's choicest blessings were showered upon me , and yet I was mad enough to listen to the seductive fiend , and , in very wantonness , to stake reputation , happiness , honor  --  all upon the color of a card , or the turn of a die . O ! that heaven would launch its exterminating bolt on this devoted head , and terminate at once , my infamy and despair . Tableau . Curtain falls . ACT II . SCENE I. An apartment in Amelia 's house . Amelia and Madam Mercoeur. discovered . Amelia arranging her hair at a glass . Ame . Amelia Tell me , Madam Mercoeur , how do I look to day ? Mer . Madam Mer Charmingly indeed , Amelia . Ame . Amelia How does this dress become me ? Mer . Madam Mer It suits both your shape and complexion to a miracle . Ame . Amelia My glass tells a different story . Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Madam Mer If he has any taste , he will , for indeed every body must admire it . Ame . Amelia Thou flatterer ! I care not for the admiration of the crowd , if I only appear to advantage in his eyes . Dear Gustavus ! The arrival of his uncle has robbed me of him for these two days past ! but this evening my ball takes place ; all the world will be here , and he promised to attend . I shall then be so happy ! but how long will that happiness last ! Mer . Madam Mer Until you have been married six months , I dare say  --  It would be unreasonable to expect it longer . Ame . Amelia Married ! O , my friend , you forget that his uncle is in Paris . Mer . Madam Mer Do you apprehend that he will be an obstacle to your union ? Ame . Amelia I do , indeed . Mer . Madam Mer But , should he not , marriage at best is but a hazardous experiment , and happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ; happiness may be wrecked when least expected . Mer . Madam Mer Why do you sigh ? Ame . Amelia That question proves that you are not yet acquainted with my early history . A few years ago I lived in a provincial town , and devoted myself to soothing the afflictions of my aged father , caused by the conduct of a profligate and disobedient son . It was there colonel De Courcy first saw me . He was young and accomplished . He loved me and our union soon followed ; on which event , we immediately set out for Paris . I imagined myself the happiest of women , but I had soon cause to know myself the most wretched . My husband was wealthy , but extravagant . He launched into all the dissipation of the metropolis . Indifference and neglect followed  --  neglect from the man I adored . We had not been married a year when he fell in a duel , and I was left alone in the world , a young and inexperienced widow , with the remnant of his fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had introduced me , when Mr. Malfort , who was a friend of my husband 's , made me acquainted with Mr. St. Felix . He became dear to me , and I have found in him a defender and a friend . Mer . Madam Mer And I cordially hope , Amelia , that before long he may have a legal title to the appellation . Enter Justine  --  R. H. Jus . Justine There is a man in waiting , madam , miserable enough in his appearance , who desires to see you . Ame . Amelia What can he want ? if charity , give him a trifle and let him begone . Jus . Justine He says he comes from Mr. Malfort . Ame . Amelia From Mr. Malfort ! O , then I will see him myself . Show him in . Exit Justine  --  R. H. This Malfort I do not like , yet I dare not say to St. Felix what I think of him , he has such a blind and unlimited confidence in the man . Mer . Madam Mer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present . Ame . Amelia But you will remember my ball this evening . Mer . Madam Mer Never fear , I shall not forget it . Exit  --  L. H. Enter Justine and Bertrand  --  R. H. Jus . Justine Madam , he is here . Ame . Amelia Well , sir , you desired to see me . Ber . Bertrand Assuming a gentlemanly air . A thousand pardons , madam , for the liberty I have taken ; but Mr. Malfort sent  --  Presenting letter . This letter will explain , madam , if you will condescend to peruse it .  --  ( Aside . ) ' T is singular  --  that figure  --  those features  --  I can not be deceived  --  if it should be she ! Ame . Amelia After reading  --  aside . He gives him a good character , but his appearance displeases me . Ber . Bertrand ( Aside . ) The more I examine the more am I convinced that it can be no other . Ame . Amelia Are you the person mentioned in this letter ? Ber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see Mr. Malfort in the course of the day , and give you an answer to-morrow . Ber . Bertrand That 's as much as a dismissal , which wo n't suit me . ( Aside . ) Would you allow me to say two words to you , madam ? Ame . Amelia To me ! Ber . Bertrand Yes ! and alone , if you please . Ame . Amelia ( Half aside . ) A singular request ! I know not whether I ought . Ber . Bertrand ( Aside . ) She hesitates . Mr. Malfort charged me  --  Ame . Amelia Mr. Malfort.  --  ( To Justine . ) Leave us , Justine , but do not be far off . Jus . Justine I will not . Be composed , madam . Exit  --  R. M. Ame . Amelia Well , sir , what commands has Mr. Malfort for me ? Ber . Bertrand In faith , madam , none that I am charged with . It was only a pretext of mine to catch you alone . Ame . Amelia A pretext ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertrand Nay , be not frightened . I intend no injury . It was out of pure regard for you , I assure you . Look at me well , my angel , and I believe you will discover that we are not entirely unacquainted . Ame . Amelia With encreased alarm . I have not the slightest knowledge of you , sir . Ber . Bertrand By my soul that is strange now ; but I do not wonder ! It has been many years since we parted , and it requires sharp eyes to detect , in such a garb , a gentleman born and bred . But we will know each other better before we separate . Ame . Amelia Your words , sir , are inexplicable  --  your absence is necessary . Who waits there ? Going to ring a bell . Ber . Bertrand Seizing her by the arm . Stay  --  you are not tired of my company already ? Answer me , for I must know ! Are you not from Normandy ? Ame . Amelia I am . Ber . Bertrand From Montagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertrand Your family name is Gremont ? Ame . Amelia Yes , yes ! You have known my family ? Ber . Bertrand Intimately !  --  So , there 's no mistake . I also knew your brother ! You have , or had one . Ame . Amelia Yes ; poor Charles . Ber . Bertrand Poor Charles ! A disowned reprobate . A vagabond . Ame . Amelia Insolence ! this to me ! Ber . Bertrand So the world pronounced him , but , if you prefer it , we will call him a noble spirited fellow ; I have no objection . Ame . Amelia Alas ! Were you well acquainted with him ? Ber . Bertrand No one knew him better . Ame . Amelia This language is extraordinary . Ber . Bertrand It may be so , but still it is true to the letter  --  Look at me well ! Amelia , behold the disowned ! Ame . Amelia Ah ! yes , yes , I know you now . Charles !  --  My brother ! Throws herself into his arms . Ber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ; the force of natural affection . You are not too proud to own me . Ame . Amelia How often have I thought of you , Charles  --  but in what a state do I find you . Ber . Bertrand A little the worse for the wear , I must confess . My affairs are not in a very flourishing condition , but , with you , it is otherwise , and as becomes a brother , I rejoice at it . Ame . Amelia I never will abandon you . Ber . Bertrand Certainly not ; do n't think of such a thing . Ame . Amelia But where have you been ; what have you been doing since you left our father 's roof ? Ber . Bertrand Many things  --  I first enlisted for a soldier , but not liking that mode of life , deserted ; was pursued , taken , and would have been shot , but for the friendship of a comrade , who effected my escape . Without a sou in my pocket , I came to the metropolis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I became an agent for a gambling house ; a genteel affair ; but as I was too knowing for the principal , we separated . Being out of regular employment , I now found myself one day in favour and the next kicked out of doors . Thus I lived for some years , when , all at once , our father died and I became possessed of my patrimony . Ame . Amelia Alas ! our poor father ! Ber . Bertrand Ah ! poor man , that 's exactly what I say . Ame . Amelia He died , Charles , without pardoning you . Ber . Bertrand And without leaving me sufficient to allay the poignancy of my grief . But , fifty thousand francs was something , and I mourned not while they lasted .  --  Those were glorious days ; but human joys are fleeting . In about a year , what with wine , women and play , my money vanished . To support my mode of living I had recourse to certain hazardous speculations , which becoming public , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in opinion with me with regard to the legality of my conduct , and , as they had it all their own way , I was sentenced to the galleys . Ame . Amelia Starting from him . Horror ! Ber . Bertrand I have finished ; and , since I am here , my pretty sister , we 'll forget past sorrows ! I 'll be your protector and we 'll never part . There are but two of us remaining , Amelia , and ' t would be a sin to part . Ame . Amelia I will provide for your wants , Charles , but , after what you have disclosed , you must conceive  --  Ber . Bertrand I conceive nothing . Ame . Amelia You can not think , my brother , that without injury to my reputation , I could acknowledge you to the world . Ber . Bertrand Ha ! Does the wind set in from that quarter ? then to prepare for the storm . Behold me ! ( Sitting . ) Here I am securely anchored , and here I will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pipe . Ame . Amelia Gracious heavens ! What would you ? Ber . Bertrand Live , and live well ; ' t is natural ; besides , I was born and bred to it . Fixing his pipe . Ame . Amelia Would you ruin me ? Ber . Bertrand That is your affair , not mine . Ame . Amelia Think of my situation ! I am upon the point of marriage ; if I avow you as my brother , the secret of your desperate life would be known ; then would St. Felix !  --  Could he unite himself to the sister of such a character ? Ber . Bertrand Humph ! Now you speak like a sensible girl , you 'll find that I am not unreasonable ; I have the means of arranging matters ; I came hither to be the domestic of Madam De Courcy , and , in that capacity we will merge the brother for the present . Ame . Amelia I can not suffer you to submit to such degradation . Ber . Bertrand True , I am a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brother , or suffer me to enter your service . Oh ! you prefer the latter . Well , I submit ; but I must provide a proper suit of clothes , and it has been so long since I saw my tailor , that I rather suspect I have no credit with him . Ame . Amelia Well , since you will have it so , here is money . Ber . Bertrand Gold ! Ravishing sight ! ' T is a long while since I looked upon these tempting portraits . Three louis ! It will do for the present . Now to consider what dress ? Oh , no matter , I can employ it more advantageously than in dress , and any thing will do for a valet-dechambre . Enter Justine , running  --  R. H. Jus . Justine Mr. St. Felix , madam . Ame . Amelia St. Felix ? Ber . Bertrand My brother-in-law . An introduction is not necessary , at present , I presume ? Ame . Amelia Do not forget  --  Ber . Bertrand My part ? Never fear ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exit with Justine  --  L. H. Enter Gustavus , in great trouble  --  R. H. Gus . Gustavus St Felix Throwing himself in a chair . Amelia ! dear Amelia ! Ame . Amelia Here , here my beloved ! What has happened ? This agitation  --  Gus . Gustavus St Felix Is that of despair ! the deepest ; the most hopeless ! Ame . Amelia Heavens ! What terrible presentiment !  --  Your absence for two days ; the arrival of your uncle ! Gustavus , do you come to tell me that we must part ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix No , no ! I fear not that excess of misery ! but , if you knew all the horror of my situation , could you ask to remain with me ? Ame . Amelia You alarm me ! In the name of heaven speak ! Hesitate not to tell me all . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Learn , then , the dreadful truth ! When we first met , Amelia , my name was untarnished ; my heart was pure , and it adored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I believed that you would be the happiest of wives ! It was a momentary dream of enchantment , but I have now awakened to the fearful reality . You see me , discarded , destitute ! without resources , without hope ! Ame . Amelia Unfortunate Gustavus ! But if you have the courage to support your misfortune , I shall be happier than ever , for it will be the means of proving that it is you alone that I love . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Unexampled generosity ! But when you shall know all , will you still preserve your love ? Ame . Amelia All ! Gus . Gustavus St Felix Yes ; branded , spurned , dishonored . Ame . Amelia Oh ! no , no , no , not dishonored ! any thing but that  --  You did not say dishonored ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix I burn with shame while I avow it . I have betrayed the confidence of the worthy man who entrusted me with his concerns . Well may you start and recoil from the touch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unintentionally . I was mad ! mad . My uncle has disowned me ! he knows all ! I am disinherited  --  cursed , and have nothing left me but the contempt and scorn of the world . Now , my Amelia , can you still love a wretch so lost as I am ? Ame . Amelia You are culpable , and I could blame you ; but it is for me to sooth and not to censure . Were you a thousand times more guilty , I might expire with grief , but not cease to love you . Gus . Gustavus St Felix How can I ever repay such devoted affection ! still you cast me not off , still you cherish me in your heart , though my guilt has rendered me so contemptible in your eyes . Ame . Amelia Dishonored ! Oh ! St. Felix ! that was unkind ! But there may be a means to repair all . Gus . Gustavus St Felix A means ! Ame . Amelia Yes , and I am happy in having it in my power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes out a pocket book . Here are twenty thousand francs , the residue of my fortune . Take it ; take it , Gustavus ; go , save your honor . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Amelia ! My heart is full ! I was not prepared for this . You have made a very child of me . Falls in tears on her neck . Ame . Amelia Beloved St. Felix ! take it ! fly ; lose no time in redeeming your honor . Gus . Gustavus St Felix ' T is useless ; this sum is insufficient . Ame . Amelia Well , then , my furniture , my jewels , my diamonds , may double it perhaps . Take them , sell them , and return to your uncle and implore his pardon . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Amelia , I have adored you , but never knew you till this moment . But I will not permit the sacrifice ! I am not so base as to abuse your love and expose you to privation and misery . Ame . Amelia Think not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the name of heaven do not refuse me . Your honor and reputation are at stake  --  ought you , can you then hesitate ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix I never will consent . Enter Malfort  --  R.H. Ame . Am elia Ah ! Malfort . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Running to him . Welcome , welcome , my friend . Aid me to resist the generosity of Amelia .  --  She knows my misfortune , and , to repair it , she would relinquish every thing she has in the world and devote herself to the most abject misery . Mal . Malfort ( Aside . ) Confusion ! I must interfere here . Ame . Amelia I think , sir , that so far from blaming , you will , on the contrary , approve of any steps which may save your friend . Mal . Malfort This interest for my unfortunate friend , madam , touches me sensibly  --  fills me with wonder and admiration ; but , unfortunately , your noble interposition will now be useless . Ame . Amelia How so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle , Gustavus , who is now more than ever enraged against you . Gus . Gustavus St Felix From what motive ? Mal . Malfort By some unlucky chance he has heard of your intimacy here . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Is it possible ! What has he heard ? Mal . Malfort I am ignorant ; but this I know : Some secret enemy has circulated scandalous reports which have made a terrible impression on his mind . He accuses madam De Courcy , alone , as being the cause of your fault , and upon her he pours out the vials of his wrath and indignation . In a word , your love now is your greatest crime in his eyes . Ame . Amelia You hear , Gustavus . Gus . Gustavus St Felix This is to the heart ! But let not his injustic distress you , Amelia . A terrible fate threatens us , and we must rather escape from , than encounter it .  --  My uncle is implacable , and he has the power to overwhelm us . I fear even him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your proposal  --  sell all , and let us abandon this spot forever . Ame . Amelia Fly ! Gus . Gustavus St Felix Yes ; to some foreign land for refuge : The money will suffice for a time . I will labor diligently , and , be assured , heaven will second my endeavours .  --  Some day , perhaps , I shall be able to acquit myself of the debt which has caused my shame . If we are not rich , we shall , at least , be together . There is much in that , Amelia . Ame . Amelia Much ! every thing ! Gus . Gustavus St Felix Then , without regret , you consent to follow me ? Ame . Amelia Throughout the world  --  to the end of life . Gus . Gustavus St Felix God give you strength . To night then we will depart . Mal . Malfort ( Aside . ) To night ! that must not be . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Malfort , you say nothing . Do you disapprove ? Mal . Malfort No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage with which you support this reverse of fortune . That you should go , I see the necessity ; but to night is what I blame . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Why not to night ? Mal . Malfort Your precipitate departure would soon become known , and your uncle would follow your steps and employ the most rigorous measures to terminate your flight . You know his character . Gus . Gustavus St Felix What then would you suggest ? Source text incomplete Illeg. the game , and are so admirable a player ! You consent , do you not ? Ame . Amelia Since you insist , sir .  --  ( Aside . ) He has the twenty thousand francs about him ; can he have forgotten ? Will he risk ?  --  The dance is continued . Gustavus is on the right at a card table . Amelia , with Malfort and two others , is engaged at whist on the left . Gustavus suddenly rises and throws the cards on the table . The dance ceases . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Damnation ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ten thousand francs ! Mal . Malfort You have had ill luck , St. Felix , but courage , fortune must turn . Ame . Amelia Play no more , Gustavus ; risk no more . Gus . Gustavus St Felix ' T is impossible that ill luck should always pursue me . Double or quits . He places ten bank bills on the table . Ame . Amelia Are you mad , Gustavus ? Mal . Malfort Interposing . You forget , madam , where you are . We are observed . Ame . Amelia If he should lose what will become of us ! Mal . Malfort Proceed with the dance . The dance continues . Amelia throws herself on a chair in the greatest agitation . Mal . Malfort Overlooking the players . Capital hands .  --  Both equal .

St. Felix . St Felix Let me pass wretches . I will enter  --  PerceivingGustavus . O ! Sir , I have found you at last , have I ? And is it here you come in the midst of dissipation to drown the reproaches of conscience .  --  Amelia speaks to the guests and they retire . Gus .

Some monster has calumniated her to you . So far from meriting your reproaches she is worthy of your esteem . St. Felix . St Felix My esteem ! She , who has consummated your ruin . Gus . Gustavus St Felix You wrong her ; cruelly wrong her , and shall yet acknowledge it . Even now she has sacrificed to me all her possessions to save my honour and regain your good opinion . St. Felix .

You would intimidate me.  --  I have come to make one last effort to save you . Reflect ; for your answer decides your fate . Notwithstanding your conduct I can forgive . Mr. Duval pardons you , and his daughter is still disposed to give you her hand . Happiness , fortune and reputation , can yet be retrieved , but you must instantly quit this house , and renounce forever a connection that has dishonoured you , and will sooner or later bring you to ruin . Ame . Amelia Do not hesitate , Gustavus . Accept his generous offer  --  accept it I conjure you . Gus . Gustavus St Felix What ! Can you , Amelia  --  you !  --  advise me to such a step ?

St. Felix . St Felix Your wife ! Will you thus dishonour your family ? But I will find a way to separate you in spite of your frenzy . This night a convent 's walls shall enclose her . Ame . Amelia Oh ! Heaven ! Gus . Gustavus St Felix Dare you commit such an outrage ! St. Felix . St Felix I have here an order from the minister of police . Producing paper . Gus .

I sink with emotion .  --  His insults  --  his menaces .  --  Gus . Gustavus St Felix Supporting her . Mere words .

Had it not been for my cursed infatuation  --  the means of escape  --  Ame . Amelia Do not mention it .  --  I meant not that Gustarus . Enter Bertrand hastily . Ber . Bertrand Quick , quick , madam , there is not a moment to be lost . Instantly fly . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Fly ! From what motive ? Ber . Bertrand Several men have beset the house , who enquire for Madam De Courcy . Ame . Amelia For me ! is it possible ! Gus . Gustavus St Felix Can my uncle have done this ! Ber .

Haste , haste , every moment is precious . Ame . Amelia But where shall we find refuge for the night ? Ber . Bertrand I have a small furnished apartment whither I will conduct you . No delay . Go prepare your jewels : in the mean time I will stand sentinel , and warn you in case of danger . Amelia and Gustavus enter the apartment on the right . If it were not for me , these inexperienced young ones would run into the wolf 's mouth , but the burnt cat knows the fire , so I will reconnoitre . Going out . Enter Malfort.  --  U. E. L. H. Mal .

Malfort The situation of your sister is desperate . Ber . Bertrand Bad enough . Poor thing 's approaching my level . Mal . Malfort Would you render her an important service ? Ber . Bertrand Certainly . She is my sister you know . Natural affection and all that . O , I remember the old story ; I have read it a hundred times in books of morality . Mal . Malfort Right .

SCENE I. The vestibule of Mr. Duval 's house . In the flat a large glazed door which opens into the court . On the right an elegant practicable stair case ; on the same side , nearer the front , a door of a small apartment . On the left . a door leading to another room .

So far we have entered unperceived.  --  Go to my chamber , St. Felix , and leave me to prepare your uncle for an interview . And . Andrew ( Aside . ) What 's in the wind now I wonder ? Gus . Gustavus St Felix I have followed your advice , Malfort , in coming hither , but I am certain the step is useless . My uncle is so much irritated against me , that if he consents to see me it will be only to load me with reproaches . And . Andrew The old gentleman is violently enraged against you , that 's the truth of it . ( Aside . ) Mal . Malfort Believe me your case is not so desperate . Tomorrow all will be well .

His fate is sealed , and if my designs are well executed , I shall soon enjoy the rich reward I aim at . Where can Bertrand loiter at such a time . Ber . Bertrand Appears in the court , opens the glass door , with precaution . Malfort . Mal . Malfort Ah !  --  is it you , Bertrand ? Ber . Bertrand Give the word ; advance or retreat ? Mal . Malfort All 's safe . Enter . Ber . Bertrand Coming forward . Well , here I am ; punctual to a moment , you see . It is the life and soul of business . Mal .

To levy contributions on my fine brother-in-law ; that 's my plan . Mal . Malfort In the present state of affairs your profits , it is probable , would be but small . Ber . Bertrand How so ? Mal . Malfort Young hopeful 's expectations rest solely with his uncle , who to-morrow intends to will his property to another branch of his family . Ber . Bertrand The devil ! Will he play us such a trick ? That 's illiberal . Mal . Malfort He is firmly resolved , in which case Amelia 's husband will not be worth a sou . Ber . Bertrand Then I must forbid the bans . We wish no poor devils in our family . Mal .

The way of the world . Mal . Malfort You then must perceive , if the uncle execute his project , our schemes fall to the ground . Ber . Bertrand You talk like a sensible man . Something must be done , and immediately . Mal . Malfort To-morrow it is that he signs the fatal instrument that involves us all . To-morrow he signs . Ber . Bertrand I hear .  --  I understand you perfectly . To-morrow he disinherits my brother-in-law . Mal . Malfort Yes ; but if by chance one of those unexpected accidents  --  Ber .

Mal . Malfort Gustavus , Miss Duval ! Who could have told you so ? And . Andrew I did , sir . I saw him enter with you and mentioned it to Miss Pauline to oblige her . Pau .

Yes , madam , I am that Amelia , that wretched being , for whom Gustavus has made such a fearful sacrifice . Pau . Pauline Gracious heavens ! What then means this mysterious visit to me ? Ame .

Amelia The sacrifice is dreadful , but my determination is made , and nothing on earth shall change it . Let Mr. St. Felix dispose of me as he will . Let him designate the land to which he would have me exiled , where I may conceal my tears and brood over my sorrows alone , and I here vow that the asylum he may choose shall be the place where I will terminate my days .

Believe me , madam , I am not insensible to your anguish . Bertrand appears on the top of the stairs . He stops on seeing Pauline and Amelia . Ber . Bertrand Ha ! I must be cautious  --  some one is below . Ame . Amelia Ah ! madam , you know not what a balm the hope of saying Gustavus has brought to my wounded spirit . I feel I shall be less unhappy . Ber .

As she is retiring , Bertrand descends and places himself in her way . Ber . Bertrand Stay an instant . Be not in such haste . Ame . Amelia My brother ! You here ? Ber . Bertrand Exactly . Say , did I understand you right ?  --  You would renounce St. Felix . Ame . Amelia I would . His happiness has rendered a separation indispensable . Ber . Bertrand His happiness !

I promise it , and have already taken such steps as will enable me to fulfil my promise . Ame . Amelia I know not how it is , but your words and looks make me tremble ! What do you here at this hour ? Ber . Bertrand Business . Ay , and of moment too . Ame . Amelia Answer me . I must know . Ber .

Follow me out of this house , or instantly I rush into the street , and by my cries arouse the neighbourhood . Begone , begone , I say . Ber . Bertrand Ha !  --  I will find a way to silence your upbraidings . Despite of yourself I will serve you .  --  He draws a dagger , and seizes her by the arm . She falls ; he holds the weapon over her . Behold ! Swear not to divulge my purpose , or I strike . Ame . Amelia Hold , hold , my brother .

Frightful as the truth is , I dare not conceal it from you . Gustavus , the life of your uncle is threatened . Gus . Gustavus St Felix Great God ! how know you this ? Ame .

Dare you then , Gustavus , take , as the partner of your fate , the sister of a man , whose shame and guilt must bring odium on all connected with him ? Gus .
