txt IN a former Number of our journal , we reviewed " The Penitentiary kSystern of the United EStates , " the joint production of // M. de Tocqueville and the companion of his journey , M. de Beaumont . That work has been translated , and has obtained a pretty extensive circulation in this country . It has prepared those who have read it to expect the present publication with some eagerness . We feel no hesitation in saying , that this expectation will not be disappointed . M. de Tocqueville shows himself to be an original thinker , an acute observer , and an eloquent writer . We regard his work now before us , as by far the most philosophical , ingenious , and instructive , which has been produced in Europe on the subject of America . In the wide range of its topics , treated as they all are with boldness , there are , as might be anticipated , many things to which , as speculations , we can not give our assent ; there are several mistakes , as to matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally a disposition shown , almost universal among intelligent Qriginal thinkers , to constru*t a theory , and then find the facts to support it . These , however , are slight derects in an excellent work . M. de Tocqueville shows , that he came to this country to study with impartiality its institutions , to ascertain its condition , and to trace the existing phenomena to their principles . There is no eulogy in it , and no detraction ; but , throughout , a manly love of truth . M. de Tocqueville 's observations uniformly discover a high degree of acuteness and discrimination . They show , that to observe accurately and profoundly requires a vigor of mind , as rarely perhaps to be met with , as the power of original invention . rrhe number of men , who are able to lay aside the paltry prejudices of party , - who are not misled by superficial appearances , - who can separate what is permanent and essential from what is momentary , - who can discern great principles under a thousand varying forms of developement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their talent more severely put to the test , than in writing a book of travels . We take the greater satisfaction in the work of M. de Tocqueville , from a deep conviction that much mischief has been produced by works of a different character on the subject of America , which have of late years issued in great numbers from the European press . M. de Tocqueville speaks of the bitter hatred entertained by the Americans toward England . We consider that expression as too strong . The angry feelings excited by the wars between the two countries have yielded to time and other healing influences ; // and there is nothing to keep up the sort of animosity , which prevails , for instance , between the Turks and the Greeks , the Irish and English , the Russians and Poles , the Spaniards and Portuguese . Still , however , if not hatred , there is a very considerable soreness and sense of injury , existing on the part of America towards Great Britain , and almost exclusively iroduced by the publications of a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unadvisedly given to these publications by the most respectable literary journals in England . It is idle to talk of the peculiar irritability of the Americans . M. de Tocqueville , who falls into the vulgar error oC foreigners , in imputing such an irritability to the people of this country , ( or rather who , on this point , abandons his excellent habit of observing for himself , and adopts , without reflection , one of the stale , stereotyped sneers of the tourists , ) explains himself the only circumstance , that gives a semblance of truth to the charge . A vastly greater portion of the community in this , thdn in any other country , are readers ; and the novelties of the day , thrown into circulation , at a rate of almost incredible cheapness , may be said to be read by everybody . The scandal and gossip of the travellers in our own country , give their works an instantaneous circulation , on the same principle that gives zest to the columns of the most worthless journal , which deals in personalities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by almost all persons who read any thing ; and those who escape the book itself , must encounter it , at second hand , in the reviews , magazines , and newspapers . These considerations account for the universality of the feeling , which the works in question excite . An American tourist in England might publish an equally offensive book , and not one in ten would hear of it of that class , which in America devours all the trash of every kind that issues from the press . But that the individual , in the two countries respectively , is differently affected by the perusal of works of this class , we have yet to learn . If an English gentleman , who had hospitably entertained an American , should find the confidence of his fire-side violated , and what was done and said in the unsuspicious frankness of the social board duly embalmed in the journal , and blazoned to the world , we are inclined to think he would express himself on the occasion , very much as an American gentleman does , when similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of the British critical press toward Prince PUckler Muscan was particularly characterized by a philosophical indifference toward the individual or personal detraction charged upon the pages of that eccentric writer and the more recent instance of a countryman of our own furnishes an edifving comment on the atrocious violation of the decencies of life , which has marked the publications of many of the British tourists in America , and the unscrupulous countenance extended to them by the most respectable journals . John Bull 's tremendous horn , long , hooked , and crumpled , has been for forty years buried deep in Jonathan 's flank ; and if the poor sufferer hut winks under the discipline , Europe rings from side to side with his tetchiness . But when Jonathan , the other day , in a moment of indiscretion , showed a disposition , in a slight degree , to take a turn at the sport , all Albemarle Street was in commotion . Foi* ourselves , we wholly reprobate this license , on whichever side of the water it is taken ; and how gentlemen and ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , that they are foreign tourists , ( in other words , that in the account of friendly offices , they must almost of necessity stand on the debtor 's side , ) a reason for liberating themselves from those restraints of good breeding , which would operate on a person travelling from city to city in his own country , we never have been able to conceive . Much , however , as the violations of confidence and the ungrateful return for hospitality , to which we allude , are to be rebuked , there is a sin of a deeper dye at the door of some of the tourists . We mean that of undertaking the voyage expressly and for fhe avowed purpose of political effect at home , and consequently to find , and ( what is the same thing , with such a purpose , ) to make the materials for vilifying this country . These writers have done the greatest mischief ; and have mainly contributed to l ) produce that feeling , which M. de Tocqueville , overrating , we trust , its intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Louis the Fourteenth , when the King was the State , an offensive device on a medal of doubtful authenticity was among the causes of the war with which he desolated Holland . human nature is the same , in all a bes , and on both sides of the Atlantic ; and it would be underrating the vigor and efficiency of the British press to suppose , that , if its conductors and contributors , of all descriptions , desire to excite a bad temper between the two countries , they will fail of their object . // We have already intimated the opinion , that M. de Tocqueyule 's work exhibits more insight into our system than any European publication which we have seen , and we consider this circumstance as somewhat remarkable . Our institutions ( to use a word which our English brethren profess not to understand , though in what its obscurity consists we do not perceive , ) are modelled , to a considerable extent , on those of England . Our law in its frame-work , substance , and phraseology is English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother country . Between our legal and political system and that of France , there is , on the contrary , the greatest possible dissimilarity . And yet , while M. de Tocqueville has seized , with great accuracy and acuteness , the prominent points of our policy , both in matter of theory and practical operation , we do not recollect any English writer , who has comprehended either ; certainly not Captain Hall or Colonel Hamilton , from whom , if from any of the British tourists , it might have been expected . No English writer on this country has discerned the important part sustained by our town and county organization in carrying on the governtnent ; or evinced any accurate knowledge of the relative limits of the National and State jurisdictions . We could almost think that the resemblance , which exists between the two countries , prevents a more accurate perception of the state of things , in points where the resemblance ceases , and the peculiarities and novelties commence . England lives under an organization , which may be compared to the solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of central attraction . America possesses a much more complicated organization ; like that of which the sun , with all its subject planets , is supposed to form a part in the heavens . The twenty-four independent States , each constituted substantially according to the political type of the mother country , compose a general system of government variously complicated with the separate systems , perpetually acting into them and reacted upon by them , both organically and sympathetically , forming in the general result , a highly artificial plan , whose main workings have been long ascertained by experience , but of which incidental properties and functions are continually unfolding themselves , beyond the range of any thing contemplated even by its founders . Now it is perhaps natural , that the Frenchman who approaches the subject as new in all its // parts , and studies it in the existing phenomena , without being misled by previous associations , may attain a more accurate knowledge of it , than an Englishman who comes to America , expecting to find nothing but the English system , mutatis mutctndis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent the old names import new things ; how far that which is wholly new , varies the action of that which is borrowed , and how far the absence of that which was not borrowed fiom England , changes the character of what was . Besides this , it is not to be disguised , that , with Englishmen of almost all classes , the American constitutions are regarded as the British , in a state of degeneracy . No man can comprehend a system against which he is prejudiced ; the passions are on all subjects the great disturbers of perception and obstructers of knowledge . A Frenchman of the liberal school like M. de Tocqueville , is disposed to regard the representative republics of America , as a fair and natural attempt to carry the principles of the British constitution into their consequences . If he has no partiality for the experiment , he has at least no prejudice against it . It would he underrating the imJ ) ortance of M. de Tocqueville 's work to regard it merely as a book on America . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the modern civilized world . Let the first sentences of the introduction attest the truth of this remark . " Among the new objects , which attracted my attention , during my residence in the United States , nothing struck me more powerfully , than the equality of conditions . I easily discovered the prodigious influence , which it exercises on the march of society . It gives a certain direction to the public mind , a certain character to the laws ; new maxims to rulers , and peculiar habits to the ruled . " I soon found that this principle extends its influence far beyond politics and laws ; that it exerts the same sway over society as over the government . It creates opinions , gives rise to feelings , suggests usages , and modifies what it does not produce . " Thus , then , in proportion as I studied American society , I saw more and more , in the equality of conditions , the parent fact from which every other fact seemed to proceed ; and I continually met it as a central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I then directed my mind toward our own hemisphere . It seemed to me that I distinguished there something analo // gous to the spectacle presented in the new world . I saw the equality of conditions , which , without having reached its extreme limits , as in the United States , was daily approaching them ; and that same democracy , which bore sway in the American communities , seemed to me to advance rapidly toward power in Europe . " From this moment the idea of my work was conceived . A great democratic revolution is going on among us ; all see it , but all do not estimate it alike . Some , considering it as a novelty , as an accident , hope to be able to arrest it ; while others judge it to be irresistible , because it seems to them the fact the most constant , the most ancient , and the most permanent , known in Our readers perceive from these sentences , that our author 's work is no child 's play . Well may M. de Tocqueville remark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the statement of the subject . lie regards the government of this country , as founded on great ultimate principles , which lie deep in the nature of man ; as a bold and noble experiment to develope and apply those principles , lie farther considers the civilized world , which looks on , the spectator of the experiment , as itself profoundly interested in the result ; nay more , that a similar experiment , in earlier stages and under other conditions , is proceeding at the same time in Europe and that between the great experiments , going on in the two hemispheres , there is a constant action and reaction . We conceive it of great importance to take these enlarged views of our politics . They elevate and purify the mind . They lift it out of the narrow sphere of contemporary intrigues ; and they show the incalculable importance of the part which Providence has assigned us on the stage of life . In nothing has M. de Tocqueville more approved his sagacity , than in placing at the very head of his work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equality of Conditions " ; and it will be found , hy a careful study of the genius of the various forms of government , at different times established in the world , that they differ mainly in this respect . This is essential , every thing else is accidental , in the constitution of political societies . The fact of the equality of men is most curiously arranged in the providential order of human affairs ; and it seems to us that the manner , in which the allotments of a Higher Wisdom // have been obeyed and respected in the contrivances of our constitution , affords , more than any thing else , the proof of the almost inspired sagacity of our fathers . Religion teaches the moral equality of men , as the great foundation principle of our nature , which admits of no respect of persons with God . By the side of this moral equality , we perceive , nevertheless , the most extraordinary diversity of physical gifts and intellectual capacities ; in the result of which , in every form of society that has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriarchal government , to the rudest simplicity of savage life on the one hand , and the most complicated and artificial constitution on the other , vast disparities of condition among individuals are continually presenting themselves . These inequalities of gifts and capacities are the basis , first , of wealth , influence , and power . The robust , healthy , intelligent , brave savage is found in the possession of a larger and more commodious wigwam , of a buffalo 's skin more tastefully ornamented , of a finer horse , of a comelier squaw , and of superior influence , perhaps of a commanding lead in the tribe . The same elements , concentrated into . military prowess , in a more artificial constitution of society , led to the formation of the various monarchical and aristocratical governments , which have at different times existed in the world , and which were so many political contrivances , devised by the self-perpetuating instinct of power , not to give effect to the moral equality , but to perpetuate the physical and intellectual inequality of men . This , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government , organized on the true principles of the nature of man , the moral *quality , which is eternal and universal , should have been the end , and the physical and intellectual diversity the modification of the system . But the evil did not stop here ; the ancient governments , in seeking to perpetuate and organize the diversity principle , adopted institutions , which had the direct effect of still further impairing the equality principle . From this moment , the beautiful equilibrium of nature was disturbed , and enduring mischief was perpetrated . The fortunate general sought to transmit to his son that l ) Iedominance in the state , which he had himself acquired by his valor . He was entitled to it for his personal qualities , and he wished to bequeath it to his son , who did not possess those personal qualities . Now and then the egregious absurdity , as well as injustice , of such a bequest peeps out . When // Richard Cromwell , the good-natured , timid , smooth-visaged , English gentleman , tries to take up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reeking hand and a brow ploughed and blackened by the thunder-bolts which staggered , but could not prostrate him , had hewed his way to power , the world looks on with derision , laughs awhile , and permits Richard , greatly bissed for his pains , to sink away to his hiding place . But the line of monarchs , from Nimrod down , has been principally the alternation of Oliver and Richard . Oliver gives an impulse to the system , which often lasts through a succession of Richards . And when mankind , disdaining at length the ignominious yoke of a feeble despotism , conspires to throw it off , and affairs fall into confusion , up starts Oliver again in the old line or a new one , and plies his iron flail , till they cry for mercy , and all again is quiet . This rationale of political history was well understood by the ancients , and happily illustrated in the annals of their sacred Majesties , King Log and King Stork . As , in the transmission of power , the personal superiority strives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so with the transmission of fortune . The very idea of property , that which makes it to be what it is , namely , one 's own , authorizes the possessor to dispose of it at his pleasure , while lie lives and at bis death . Experience showed the convenience of strengthening transmitted power by an alliance with transmitted wealth . Hence tbe various devices , the entails , the substitutions , and the trusts , by which , in the language of the law , the accumulations of one generation are committed to the faith of the next , to be used , kept together , and banded down . But , as it is plain that the equality , on which all stood as candidates for power , in the first generation , is greatly disturbed in the second by the organization of society into permanent divisions of rank ; so , for the acquisition of wealth , the equality principle is still more fatally impaired by all devices calculated to keep great accumulations together . In the first generation , all stand fairly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural enendowments . In the second , some start with great accumulations of inherited capital locked up against the vicissitudes of fortune . In this way , the natural constitution of society is subverted . The principle of equal rights is entirely lost sight of , a common interest ceases to exist , and every thing is // reduced to force ; with some considerable assistance from habit , patriotic pride , and superstition . In this state the American Revolution found the world and from this political and social condition the American constitutions seek to restore mankind . The plan was not excogitated in the philosopher 's cell , nor proclaimed by the sound of the trumpet . It offered itself , as all mighty improvements must offer themselves , spontaneously , to men nearly unconscious of the great work of which they were the chosen instruments . Wise men proposed it ; but they did not invent it , or create it . It grexv out of the providential constitution of our race , and the heaven-controlled juncture of affairs . A child can drop an acorn into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the academies in the universe , with all their chemistry , can not compouud a blade of grass . The time had come , the circumstances were favorable , the soil was mellow . The natural equality of man is embalmed in an elective system . Detur digrtiori . The impossibility of the actual intervention of each individual of a large nation is relieved by a representative government . The system in a moment is complete . It is an elective representative republic . As transmitted power sought the alliance of transmitted wealth , transmitted political equality demands a healthy circulation of property . This is effected by the statute of distrihutions , in virtue of which , at the end of the second generation in most cases , and invariably at the end of the third , the accumulation vanishes , and nature 's noble upstarts are found at the head of affairs . No violence , no plunder , no invasion of the right of property . All is gradual , salutary , and life-giving , because all is done in conformity with the dictates of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the individual diversity principle and the general equality principle are thoroughly harmonized ; and the experiment of two hundred years ( for the system in all its great features dates rather from the settlement of the country than the revolution ) has fully tried it in practice . To say , that in no single instance it has failed ; that no bad man has been raised to office ; that no good man has lived in undervalued obscurity ; that there has been no profligate wealth , and no wronged , heart-broken poverty , would , of course , be idle . But this may be truly said , - that all the evils which disfigure our system equally exist in all others . There are , and have been in all time , as many bad and incom // petent rulers , as many worthless persons clothed with influence and fortune , in other countries as in this , and many monstrous oppressions elsewhere existing are here wholly unknown . This , also , may be said , that the evils which manifest themselves in the working of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited in the whole moral constitution of the universe , as far as we can comprehend it ; which presents to our observation , alike in the intellectual and the physical world , the perpetual antithesis of a perfect theory and constantly recurring exceptions to its operation , an absolute nature thwarted in individual cases of developement , a beneficent system struggling under the abuse of its most genial provisions . But it is time to return from these speculations to the mattet ' more immediately before us . No part of M. de rrocque ville 's work has struck us as more masterly , than the manner in which , in his lutroduction , he has traced the growth of the democratic principle in Europe . " I look back , " says he , " a moment , on what Europe was seven hundred years ago . I find it divided among a small number of families , who possess the earth and govern the inhabitants . The right of commanding descends from generation to generation with the inheritances . Men have but a single instrument of acting upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but one source of power , landed property . " In this state of things , the power of the clergy is founded and extends itself . The clergy opens its ranks to all , the poor and the rich , the nobleman and the commoner . Equality begins to penetrate through the avenues of the church to the bosom of the government ; and he who would have vegetated like a serf , in a constant slavery , places himself as a priest in the midst of nobles , and not seldom sits down above kings . " Society becoming in time more civilized and more stable , the different relations among men become more complicated and numerous . The necessity of civil laws is strongly felt . From this necessity the legal profession springs up . Its members go forth from the dark enclosure of tribunals , from the dusty retreats of the registry , and take their places in the court of the prince , by the side of feudal barons covered with ermine and steel . " Kings ruin themselves by vast enterprises ; nobles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The influence of money begins to be felt in the affairs of the state . // Commerce opens a new path to influence , and financiers constitute a power in the state , at once despised and courted . " By degrees , knowledge is diffused ; taste for literature and the arts awakens ; talent becomes an element of success ; science is a means of government , and intelligence becomes a social power . The learned attain political station . " Meantime , in proportion as new avenues to power are opened , the importance of birth declines . In the eleventh century , in France , nobility was of inestimable value . It could be had for money in the thirteenth century . The first patent of nobility was conferred in 1170 , and equality was at last introduced into the government by the aristocracy itself . " Durincr the last seven hundred years , it has sometimes happened , that , in order to struggle against the royal authority or to divest rivals of power , the nobles have given political importance to the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce the lower classes into the government , in order to abase the aristocracy . " In France , the kings have shown themselves the most ac* tive and constant of levellers . When they have been ambitious and strong , they have labored to elevate the people to the level of the nobles ; when they have been moderate and feeble , they have permitted the people to rise above the throne itself . Some have aided the democracy by their talents , others by their vices . Louis the Eleventh and Louis the Fourteenth took care to reduce every thing to a level beneath the throne . Louis the Fifteenth , with all his court , descended himself into the dust . " From the time that the soil began to be possessed by the citizens on any other than a feudal tenure , and personal property began to create influence and give power , every discovery made in the arts , every improvement in commerce and industry , created so many new elements of equality among men . From this moment , the processes found out , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps toward a general levelling . The taste for luxury , the love of war , the empire of fashion , the passions of the human heart , alike the most superficial and the most profound , seem to work together to impoverish the rich and to enrich the poor . " From the time that the labors of the mind became the source of strength and wealth , every scientific developement , every new branch of knowledge , every original idea became a germ of power accessible to the people . Poetry , eloquence , memory , the graces of the mind , the fires of the imagination , depth of thought , all the gifts which Heaven scatters at a venture , // profited the democracy ; and even when those gifts were found in the possession of their adversaries , they still promoted the democratic interest , by bringing out in hold relief the natural greatness of man . Its conquests accordingly extended with those of civilization , and knowledge and literature became an arsenal , common to all , where the weak and the poor daily resorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our history for seven hundred years , you meet no great events , which have not promoted equality . " The crusades and the English wars decimate our nobility , and produce a division of their estates ; the municipal incorporations introduce democratic liberty into the bosom of the feudal monarchy ; the discovery of fire-arms equalizes the vassal and his lord , on the field of battle ; the art of printing offers equal resources to their intelligence ; the post-office brings knowledge alike to the cottage and the palace ; Protestantism maintains , that the road to Heaven is equally open to all men ; and the discovery of America presents a thousand roads to fortune , and conducts obscure adventurers to wealth and power . " Ig starting from the eleventh century , you scrutinize what takes place in France from half to half-century , you will not fail to perceive , at the end of each period , that a double revolution has taken place in the social condition . The noble will have sunk in the social srale , the commoner will have risen ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they approach each other , and they will soon meet together . " Nor is this peculiar to France . On whatever side we cast our eyes , we perceive the same revolution throughout the Christian world . " - pp. 4-S . Views like these are equally sotind and cheering ; they reconcile us to the fortunes of our race . When we contemplate tl ) e unsatisfactory progress of freedom ; when we witness revolutions commencing tinder the most promising auspices , hut soon plunging into seas of blood ; when we see symptoms of degeneracy in the practical operation of the wisest systems of government ; when we contemplate the leaden apathy of that ignorance and servittide , into which many of the nations have settled down , our hearts are apt to sink within us . We are ready to despair of the progress of man toward any substantial improvement of his condition , as a member of civil society . But a survey of broad tracts of 1 ) istory is sufficient to correct the impression . The dark annals of the middle ages furnish a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // that we do not live in the time of the crusades . The baronial castles , masses of tasteless ruins that lie in heaps on the bill-tops of Europe , and whisper from their crumbled battlements the tale of the private wars that desolated the nations for three centuries , are eloquent of encouraaement . Arbitrary forms of government still subsist ; but civilization , if not constitutions , has broken down much of their rigor . The fangs of the Inquisition are extracted , and nation after nation has risen up with their once enslaved children into the light of knowledge and Christianity . The crew of the ship may fall into unhappy ( lissensions , but she is ploughing her way onward before the breeze , and will yet reach the port . No doubt there is a mournful waste of energy , in the struggles of party against party and nation against nation , of those who have the same interests at stake aud the same object at heart . No doubt there is a deplorable waste of innocent blood . Thousands and tens of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are constantly straining all their energies in worthless contests with each other for worthless objects and hundreds of thousands throughout the civilized world annually fall a prey to the sword , to the diseases of the camp , and to the horrid reverses of fortune , that follow in the train of war . These evils we witness and feel , and they make us , perhaps , despond over the progress of mankind . But the age of Peter the Hermit , of the Guelfs and Ghibellines , of Louis the Eleventh and Henry the Eighth were worse . All the now existing evils existed in a tenfold degree . Abuses now unknown bore sway ; and the great mass of men were actually brutalized in the depths of their ignorance and subjection . No brighter prospect need be desired for mankind than that religion , morals , government , literature , and the arts , in a word civilization and liberty , may , for ten centuries to come , make a progress equal to that , which has been made in the ten centuries past ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagance , that each newly discovered art , truth , and right will furnish in itself not merely a new blessing , but a new instrument of other discoveries and improvements in morals , government , and social existence , imagination itself must fail in the attempt to estimate the inheritance , which is in store for our children . There is great power and sublimity in the manner in which NI . de Tocqueville , having sketched the past , glances at the future fortunes of Europe . // " Whither , then , are we tending ? No one can say ; for the terms of the comparison already fail us . The conditions of men among Christians are already more equal than they ever were among men at any previous time , in any country ; thus the magnitude of what has already been done prevents our measuring that which remains to he accomplished . " The work which is now submitted to the reader , has been written under the impression of a sort of religious terror , produced in the mind of the author by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages has advanced against every obstacle , and which is still advancing in the midst of the ruins it has caused . " It is not necessary that God should speak himself , in order that we may discover the certain signs of his will . It is enough to ascertain what is the habitual march of nature and the continnal tendency of events . I know , without an audible voice from the Creator , that the planets perform their courses on the curves , which he has marked out . " If long observations and meditations , pursued in good faith , should convince the men of this day , that the gradual and progressiv e developement of equality is at once the past and the future of their history , this single discovery would give to this developement the sacred character of the will of the Sovereign Master . To wish to arrest democracy would then appear to be a struggle against Heaven itself ; and nothing would remain to the nations but to accommodate themselves to the social state , imposed on them by Providence .

The movement which impels them is already so strong , that it can not be suspended ; it is not yet so rapid , that it is hopeless to attempt to direct it .

To instruct the democracy ; to renovate , if possible , its religious belief ; to purify its manners ; regulate its movements ; substitute hy degrees the knowledge of affairs for its inexperience ; an acquaintance with its true interests for its blind instincts ; to adapt its government to time and place ; to modify it according to circumstances and men ; such is the first of the duties imposed in our day on those who direct society . " - pp.9 , 10 . We have made these extracts as presenting favorable specimens of our author 's manner . It would take us greatly beyond our limits , to engage in an analysis of his work . Some general account of the plan , with some additional extracts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully suffice to // give our readers an idea of its value , and to induce them to acquaint themselves with its contents . The first chapter treats of the physical configuration , ( geog* raphy ) of North America . The second is devoted to what the author calls the point of departure of the first settlers , namely , their character , previous opinions , and motives in emigrating . This portion of the work contains very profound observations on the original germ of democratic liberty , as developed in the municipal organization of the mother country . We have already made a remark as to the superior insight possessed by M. de Tocqueville into American affairs , compared with that evinced by some of the ahlest English tourists and writers . The present chapter affords a confirmation of this remark . It so happened , that in the early periods of the American settle* ments , it was the practice of the British government to trans* port felons to some of the plantations . On this notable fact , and for the worthy purpose of complimenting the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to propose on the subject of the colonization of the United States , " that their Adam and Eve came out of Newgate . " This reflection was historically so correct ; it was so flattering to Great Britain , considering certain passages in the international relations of the two countries ; it was so pleasing and philosophical a solution of the American problem ; and its first propounder ( Mr. Cobhett ) was , in all respects , so worthy a guide of public sentiment , that it is not wonderful , that it was , on several occasions , adopted by writers of great consideration and weight , among others by our learned brother of the English " Quarterly Review . " * The following is the most recent form in which we have seen the sentiment stated ; it is quoted from " Frazer 's Magazine. ** " Any one initiated into the secrets of the book-trade must be aware , that copies of the Newgate Calendar are in constant and steady request throughout President Jackson 's dominions ; most families being anxious to possess that work from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us hear what M. de Tocqueville has to say of the first settlement of New England , and the character of those , who led the way in its colonization . " After having thus taken a rapid survey of American society VOL . XLIII. - NO. 92. * For January , 1828. // in 1650 , if we examine the state of Europe , and particularly that of the continent toward the same period , we feel ourselves penetrated with profound surprise . On the continent of Europe , at the commencement of the seventeenth century , absolute royalty everywhere triumphed over the ruins of the oligarchical and feudal liberty of the middle age . In the bosom of this brilliant and accomplished Europe , the idea of the rights of the people was more misconceived , than perhaps even at any other period . Never did the people possess less of the political life ; never had notions of true liberty less engaged the minds of men ; and yet at this very period these ideas of liberty , unknown to the European nations , or despised by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and became the future symbol of a great people . The boldest theories of the human understanding were reduced to practice in this society , apparently so humble , and of which assuredly at that time , no statesman had deigned to take notice . Inspired by the originality of nature , the imagination of man there struck out a legislation not founded on precedents . Irs the bosom of this obscure democracy , which had as yet produced neither generals , nor philosophers , nor great writers , there could arise a man in the presence of a free people , and give , amidst the general acclamation , this beautiful definition of liberty . " The questions which have troubled the country of late , and from which these disturbances in the State have risen , have been about the authority of the magistrate and the liberty of the people .

" - pp. 67-69 . Though we have disclaimed the purpose to institute a minute criticism of the details of M. de Tocqueville 's work , we can not pass from the chapter before us , without pointing out an inadvertence , capable of leading to a very injurious conclusion . A note to page sixty-second sets forth that , " By the penal law of Massachusetts , the Catholic priest who sets foot in the colony , after having been driven from it , is punished with death . " This statement , without any thing to make the reader regard it as expressed in the historical style , the present for the preterite , might betray him into a singular misconception of the state , of toleration , which now exists under the law of Massachusetts . His Eminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most respected citizen of Boston , must guard our friends in France against the mistake . The severe legislation against Catholic priests borrowed by the colonies from the mother country , was the enactment of a very early period ( 1647 ) , and has long since passed away . It may be proper also to remark by way of explaining to a portion of our foreign readers the true character of the legislation of the colonies , as well as of England on the subject of the Roman Catholic religion , that it must by no means be ascribed purely to ecclesiastical considerations . It rested on such considerations in the colonies , no doubt , to a greater extent than it did in the mother country . Our forefathers entertained an unaffected dread of the peculiarities of the Roman Catholic church , and it was their chief ground of dissent from the chur'ch of England , that it had , as they thought , stopped short in its career of reform . But , in both countries , political causes of hostility lay deep in the minds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with political questions , which , from Henry the Eighth , to William and Mary , came home to the organization of the hierarchy as a great element in the government , the composition of the House of Lords , the pecuniary condi* tion of a large body of the priesthood of both communions , // and the titles to no small amount of secularized church property . Besides the interests involved in these questions , an abiding irritation had sprung from the relations of Elizabeth and Mary , and the gunpowder plot under James . After William and Mary , to all the previous causes of an irritable sensibility on this subject , was added the paramount question of a disputed succession to the crown . The colonies could not hut sympathize in the excitement of the mother country on these questions ; and if their immediate interest in some of them was inconsiderable , it was still a matter of the highest state policy , that they should atone for their nonconformity , at least by a zealous anti-Romanism , to which their feelings guided them , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social state of the Americans in a general way , of which the author regards the main characteristic to be an essential democracy .

" - ( 1647. ) // ever , is founded rather in theory , than in any accurate obsertion of the practical injustice of our law in that respect . The fourth chapter treats of the sovereignty of the people , as the acknowledged principle of the American constitutions , and its inevitable tendency to universal suffrage . M. de Tocqueville justly describes this principle as coeval with the settlement of the colonies , owing not its origin hut its enthusiastic developement to the Revolution . It is unquestionably the master-principle of our politics ; - that from which the highest duties of the citizen flow . The great mass of men are virtuous , patriotic , and single-hearted in reference to public affairs ; hut the great mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking individually neither for the honors nor emoluments of office , are too apt , in common times , to sink into a profound apathy and a criminal indifference relative to the concerns of the country . Thus the field is too often left open to the demagogue , who enters it with those forces , which the law of universal suffrage enables him to enlist among the uninformed and the unprincipled . The solid portion of society are at home ahout their husiness ; the intriguer , with his deluded instruments , at the polls . Hence the almost unvarying fate of free states ; seasons of prosperous degeneracy , and of political revival in difficult times . Affairs are brought into a bad train , by the incompetent or dishonest men , who from the causes stated have found their way to power ; - a crisis comes on , great public dangers supervene , the patriotism of the country is awakened , and better men are called to the helm . Circumstances , too numerous to be indicated determine the laws of this fluctuation , both as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps more than can be hoped for , in the imperfection of human affairs . The nature of the evil indicates the exercise of the elective franchise as the highest duty of all good citizens ; but the most effectual remedy must he sought in universal education . With a universal diffusion of knowledge , universal suffrage may be strip* ped of its accompanying evils , and rendered , in practice as in theory , a source of strength and happiness to the state . The possession of the elements of useful knowledge and the cheap multiplication of good books would render the mere party press comparatively powerless , and wrest from the demagogue the wand of his power . M. de Tocqueville , as we have already intimated , has per .. // ceived , more distinctly than other writers on this country , the necessity of commencing his inquiries with the separate States ; and that not only in reference to their constitutions of State government , but their municipal corporations . He has made New England the basis of his investigations in this respect , justly deeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he much more systematically developed , than that of the rest of the Union . This remark was emphatically made hyMr . Jefferson , who deemed the towns in New England to he the cause of a good part of its prosperity . It should , however , he home in mind , that the counties in Virginia and other States formed on her model are multiplied greatly beyond the proportion of their population , as compared for instance with Massachusetts , in order to supply , in some degree , hy the machinery of county organization , the want of that of the towns . Massachusetts with a population , in 1830 , of ahout six hundred thousand , has fourteen counties ; and Virginia , with a population ahcut douhle that of Massachusetts , has one hundred and five counties . Still , however , the county organization is vastly less penetrating and efficient than that of the towns ; and all those interests , which are under the peculiar guardianship of the towns in New England , the * the high-ways , and , above all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wanting . M. de Tocqueville has penetrated , upon the whole , with great accuracy , the municipal system of New England . Certain suggestions would however mislead a foreign reader . Thus it is said , that " there are nineteen principal toxvnoffices . Each citizen is compelled , under penalty of a fine , to accept these several offices ; hut at the same time the greater part of them are paid , in order that the poorer citizens may devote their time to them without injury. , * The most important municipal offices are discharged gratuitously ; and of none of them perhaps can it be said , that the salaries amount to a compensation sufficient to enable the poor to accept them , did they impose duties requiring a large appropriation of time . They are , however , usually filled by the substantial citizens of the towns . Again ; " You see , accordingly , the towns in New England buy and sell , bring and defend suits before the courts , make what appropriations , and raise what sums of money they please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Although it may // be correctly stated , that all this can be done , without an admirtistrettive check , the expenditures of the towns are not wholly uncontrolled . The courts of justice will hold the towns to a bond fide interpretation of the law , which authorizes them to raise money to defray the " reasonable charges of the town . All conceivable objects of expenditure are not reasonable charges . Besides this , the money is to be raised by the vote of those who are to pay it , among whom a great equality of taxability prevails ; and where peculiar circumstances favor a surcharge on individuals of the burden of taxation , a change of residence to some other town is easily cifected . This last remedy against oppression will be less easily appreciated in Europe , where family estates are of such vast importance , and their proprietors are rendered by them fixtures on the soil , scarcely more movable , than the massy walls they inhabit . But this locomotive quality of the American population has not escaped M. de Tocqueville 's observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American liberty is more essential than this unobtrusive , humble , domestic , municipal organization . Every thing is done by the neighbours ; by the people , whose interest and comfort are to be promoted . It is the curse of centralization , that it puts power into the hands of those who know not Joseph . They can not exercise it so well ; and if they could , and if they did , they would not have the credit of it . There is always an air about a commissioner , who comes down from a distance . How can he tell where to build the district school ? Who taught him to thread his way through the barberry-bush lanes , and across the beaver-meadows , to find out the true centre of population for their sun-burnt and flaxen-headed little tenantry ? Does he , the supercilious stranger , know how much that steep hill will bear levelling , with a view to the Squire 's convenience at the summit , without subverting the doctor 's underpinning on the side ? Can all his town-learned wisdom teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely indulged in her preference of every thing but starvation and freezing at home , rather than be made comfortable in the almshouse ? To give a foreigner an adequate idea of the importance of the town system of New England , as a school of legislation and politics , would be wholly impossible . It is enough to say , that the great contest of principle between Great Britain and // her colonies was , as far as New England is concerned , mainly carried on in the towns . The principles were discussed in town-meeting . The representatives , as the crisis drew on , came up to the seat of government with their instructions adopted in town-meeting , often argumentative , pertinent , and eloquent in no common degree . And from that time to this , the same assemblies furnish a constantly renewed discipline in the manly arts of popular government . We do not wonder at the tenacity with which the towns adhere to all their immunities ; and no better illustration could be offered of the estimation in which they are held by the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne for the sake of keeping up a house of representatives in this State , whose great size is occasioned by the resolute adherence of the towns to their right of separate representation . The sixth chapter discusses the topic of the judiciary ; the seventh that of impeachmnents , the terrors of which are greatly exaggerated by M. de Tocqueville . Out of the hundreds of thousands of functionaries of the States and of the United States , who , since the adoption of their constitutions , have been amenable to the impeaching power , we can not recall half a dozen cases of its successful exercise . No elective officer is likely to be impeached . If there is strength in the impeaching body to vote his accusation , and in the judging body to convict him , there will be power in the party opposed to him in a year or two to deprive him of office , and this contents them . Judicial functionaries , by the tenure of their office , invite to a more frequent exercise of the impeaching power ; but experience has shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different causes nearly nugatory . Judicial malversations are infrequent , slight , unprompted by political passions . The judge can scarce ever have a motive to do the only great evil he is competent to do , to corrupt the fountains of private justice ; and could he be so depraved as to ineditate it , public opinion so hems him in on every side , inofficial checks so constantly beset him , the press is so observant and so formidable , the bar so powerful , the path of judicial trans. ' gression so unfashionable , so unprofitable , so uncomfortable , that impeachment rests like an unused sword in its scabbard , hard to draw when perchance it is wanted . With this preparation , M. de Tocqueville passes , in the eighth chapter , to the federal constitution , which is treated in // the latter half of the first volume . The second volume is devoted to a series of discussions , of which we can in no other way furnish so adequate an idea , as by transcribing the table of contents .

The views which are taken by the intelligent foreigner on all the subjects touched by him , are ingenious , often strongly stamped by originality , frequently both profound and correct . He is sometimes , as we have already observed , led away by a desire to // generalize , and , occasionally , takes too readily for granted , that the existing phenomena justify theories , which he has formed rather in the exercise of his own power of combination and inference , than on the basis of previously collected facts . These however are by no means the characteristics of the work , which , as a whole , can not be read either in Europe or America , without awaking new and profitable trains of thought . To the European it is replete with instruction . There is one subject , which M. de Tocqueville has placed in an entirely new light . A favorite topic of reproachful comment with the British tourists and journalists has been the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of religious observances in the thinly settled frontier portions of the country , taken in connexion with the European prejudice , that religion can have no substantial foothold , where it is not supported by law , have produced among the class of writers to which we allude , an impression , which they take great pains to propagate in the reading world , that the people of the United States are an irreligious people . The testimony of a French traveller , so intelligent as M. de Tocqueville , of the liberal school of politics , but far from being a blind and indiscriminate admirer of America , and a professed Roman Catholic , will be beard with attentioii and respect on this subject . We pass over a section , in which the author discusses , with an ingenuity which has not carried conviction to our minds , the proposition that the Roman Catholic religion is not unfriendly to the genius of republican democracy . M. de Tocqueville ascribes the influence of religion to the multiplicity of sects , uncontrolled by an establishment , which leaves every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship as suits his peculiar temper ; and to the entire abstinence of all the sects from an interference in politics , and a rigid adherence to moral influence alone . We make a quotation from his remarks on this head . One of the most popular of the recent tourists , and not nominally of the masculine gender , loads with inexhaustible ridicule the prudery of the American women . Hear M. de Tocqueville ; " It can not be said in the United States , that religion exercises an influence over the laws or the detail of political opinions ; but it directs the morals , and , in regulating the family , labors to regulate the state . " I do not doubt for a moment , that the great severity of // morals , which exists in the United States , h'as its origin in religious belief . Religion there is often powerless to restrain man in the midst of the numberless temptations which fortune presents him . It can not moderate the constantly stimulated passion for gain ; but it exercises a sovereign sway ovei the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morals . America is assuredly the country in the world where the marriage ' tie is most respected , and where the highest and truest idea has been formed of conjugal happiness . " In Europe , almost all the disorders of society have their origin about the domestic hearth , and not far from the nuptial couch . It is there that men conceive a disgust for natural ties and lawful pleasures , and contract a taste for disorder , an anxiety of heart , a fickleness of passion . Agitated by the tumultuous desires , which have often troubled his own abode , the European submits not without a struggle to the legislative authority of the state . When the American retires from the agitations of the political world to the bosom of his family , he immediately finds there the image of order and peace . There all his pleasures are simple and natural ; all his joys innocent and tranquil ; and as he reaches happiness by regularity of life , he is easily accustomed to regulate his opinions as well as his tastes . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , the American finds in his home that love of order , which he afterwards carries into the affairs of state . " - Vol. ii . pp. 216 , 217 . The following fine remark will arrest the attention of the reader , when it is home in mind that it comes from an intelligent French writer , fully imbued with the spirit of political reform " The philosophers of the eighteenth century had a very simple explanation for the gradual decline of religious belief . Religious zeal , said they , must be extinguished , in proportion as liberty and knowledge increase . It is unfortunate that the facts do not accord with the theory . " There shall he a European population whose incredulity is equalled only by its brutality and ignorance ; while in America you shall see one of the freest and most enlightened nations of the world fulfil with ardor all the exterior duties of religion . " On my arrival in the United States , it was the religious aspect of the country , which first arrested my attention . In proportion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences , which flowed from these new facts . " I had seen at home the spirit of religion and the spirit of liberty proceed almost always in an opposite direction . Here I // found them intimately united the one to the other ; reigning together on the same soil . " - pp. 223 , 224 . M. de Tocqueville proceeds to observe , that he applied himself with great diligence to the solution of this problem , and found it in the fact of the entire separation of church and state . " To ascertain the cause , " says he , " I interrogated the faithful of all communions . I sought particularly the society of the priests , the depositaries of the different forms of belief , and possessing a personal interest in their permanence . The religion which I profess brought me particularly into connexion with the Catholic clergy , and I hastened to form some kind of connexion with several of its members . To each of them I expressed my astonishment and unfolded my doubts ; I found these persons differing only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of church and state , the peaceable empire which religion exercises in their country . I do not fear to assert , that during my residence in America , I did not find a single man , priest or layman , who did not agree in this . " - p. 224 . M. de Tocqueville engages in a philosophical analysis of the idea of a separation of church and state , in the course of which we meet with several judicious and profound remarks . " As long , " says he , " as a religion derives its power from the sentiments , the instincts , the passions , which are reproduced in the same manner in all periods of history , it braves the efforts of time , or at least it can not be destroyed but by another religion . ' But when religion seeks to rest on the interests of this world , it becomes almost as frail as the powers of this earth . Alone , it may hope for immortality ; connected with ephemeral powers , it follows their fortune , and falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In uniting itself to the different political powers , religion can but contract an onerous alliance . It has not need of their aid to live , and in serving them it may die . " - p. 228 . But we have no time to pursue these extracts . The chapter is full of instruction , which our readers must seek in the volume of M. de Tocqueville himself . His remarks are made for the meridian of Europe and particularly of France ; but they rest on a correct estimate of the facts of the case as existing in this country . Perhaps there is nothing in which the guiding hand of a Superior Wisdom is more plainly traced in the affairs of this country , than in the general adoption and the unanimous ap* // proval of the principle , to which our author ascribes so much importance . One might have expected from the fathers of New England , at least , the foundation of an ecclesiastical establishment . Their notions of personal rights did not forbid it , the doctrine of toleration was not well understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say necessarily , led for the time to the erection of one of the most rigid church systems ever known , - not so much a state religion as a theocracy . But many happy conspiring causes prevented its taking root in the state , and not the least curious was the relation of the colonies to the mother country , as a settlement of Dissenters watched with jealousy by the hierarchy at home , and compelled to purchase toleration by toleration . From the moment the colonies became important enough to attract the notice of the government of the mother country , every attempt to invest their own opinions with legal preference must have proved abortive . Meantime the austere fathers were compelled to fight the hard battles of liberty . They felt every day , that freedom was but one idea ; that it must be embraced or repudiated ; and that conscience could not be shackled and unrestrained at the same time . They were satisfied with a moral influence , in matters of faith , which was as absolute as they wished , and wisely forbore to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have obtained , and the struggle for which would have sown bitterness among themselves . Thus the doctrine of liberty of conscience silently grew up and ripened , till , when the revolution conferred the power of creating a church establishment , a unanimous opinion was found existing , that it would be madness to attempt it.
