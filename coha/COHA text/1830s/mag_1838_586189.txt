txt I DESIGNEDLY omit the place of my birth , that being a matter of come doubt to myself , inasmuch as from my earliest recollection I led a sort of miscellaneous life , seldom remaining long in the same place , and moving about as occasion made necessary or convenient . My family , though poor , was of great antiquity , and withal respect*able , since I ha *e &amp;fte heard my fath r say , not one of his ancestors had ever , to his knowledge , degraded himself by following any egular occupation . The only tainted limb of the family tree was our grandfather , who was ignominiously bound apprentice to a cobbler ; but thank Heaven , he ranaway before he took a degree , and becanii distinguished as all our race have been , by " living by their wits " - an expressive phrase which distinguishes the happy few from the miserable many , who are justly condemned to live by the sweat of the brow , seeing they can not Fve by the sweat of he brain . The consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former , arising , no doubt , from an innate sense of inferiority . My early education was like my mode of life , rather miscellaneous . In fact , settin0 aside a little smattering of reading , writing , and cyphering , that I obtained , at various times , it consisted principally in the example and precepts of my father . As we rambled about from town to town-for my father seldom remained long in one place , on account , he said , of the envy and ill will he excited by the superiority of his wits-he would stop and call my attention to a fall of water , a little murmuring river , a particular point of land , or some other matter , and tell me what a capital speculation be could make out of it if he only had the money . In one place , he would erect a great manufactory ; in another , make the river navigahle ; in a third , found a city ; and in a fourth , cut a canal that would enrich the whole country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his sole dependence was on these castles in the air , which he never realized , except in the way of now and then peruading some poor dolt of a workingman , who had saved a little money , to embark it in some one of his speculations , which I confess almost always failed , for want , as my father said , of a proper redit system founded on paper-money . But though they failed , my father always managed to take care of himself , which he affirmed was the first duty of man , and to save enough from the wreck to *serve him till he could hatch some other speculation . When I grew old enough to think a little for myaelf , and observed // the ingenious devices by which my father wrought on the credulity of these egregious blockheads , that sense of justice which I used to believe innate in the nature of man , woul ( l rise against such mischievous deceptions ; and I remember I once ventured to express myself rather ingenuously on the subject . His reply at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has ever since been the governing principle of my life . " My son , " said he , " what do you ' suppose constitutes the supe* riority of man over nil other animals ? " I mustered up my scholarship , and replied*His reason , sir . " " Good-you are right . It follows , then , that reason being hi great characteristic , it was the design of Providence , that he should live by his reason-in other words , by his wits  --  and that , therefore , it is his bounden duty to make the most of them . Do you under. * stand ? " " I think I do , sir . But he should not make use of his wits to deceive others . Justice- " " Justice ? Where did you get these queer notions , boy ? " " From nature , I believe , sir. ** " Nature is a son of a-tinker !  --  and the sooner we turn it out ' of doors the better . This is the object of all education . The impulses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what , philosophers call a knowledge of the world-which , by the way , is worth all other knowledge-consists solely in sharpening our wits , and preparing us to take advantage of the dullness of others . Scrupulous blockheads call this deception , but you may depend upon it , it is nothing but a justifiable use of our wits . Nay , it is not only justifiable , but obligatory ; for not to make use of the faculties bestowed on us by nature , or acquired by experience , would be flying in the face of our Maker . It would be a most criminal negligence . Do you remember the parable of the talents ? " " I think I have some sort of recollection . of it . " " Well , what i 's the moral of it ? Is it n'ot that the great duty of man is to turn a penny , and make money as fast as he can ? " " But , sir , I think he ought to make it honestly . " " Pooh-you 're a blockhead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parable . " This , and various similar conversations , together with the daily example of my father , and his perpetual turmoil about speculations , gave a radical turn to my mind , and fixed my destiny for life . I saw very clearly that mankind were condemned to la our , not for their own benefit , but that of others ; and that inasmuch as the wits of a man were the noblest part of him , it was but just they should live at the expense of those democratic physical powers , which were undoubtedly intended for that special purpose // One of the great resources of my father , who was a decided enemy to hard work , was the invention of labour-saving machines . I remember to have heard him boast that he had , during his life , taken out patents for a hundred and thirty-seven contrivances of this sort , many of which he sold out to the country farmers and village mechanics , for he had a most slippery tongue , and a keen wit , which he often assured me were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have long ago forgot the greater portion of these labour-saving machines ; but I remember there was one for scalding pigs without heating the water , and another for churning butter by an ingenious application of the well-pole , while the good women were lowering and hoisting the bucket . We lived comfortahly three months on these inventions , at the end of which time the ignorant country people began to be so jealous of the superiority of my father 's wits , that they threatened to tar and feather him , and subject me to the new patent scalding machine . In short , the country was becoming rather warm for us , and my father determined to seek not only a wider sphere of action , but of iml ) unitY , in the principal city of that section of country which had hitherto been the scene of the triumphs of his wits . " Ferret , my son , " said he , one day , just after a great ignorant country booby , who had paid his last five dollars for the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and threatened to prosecute him for swindling- " Ferret , my son , there is no longer any living among these hard-working Cyclops , who have no respect for the triumphs of superior intellect , and prefer brute force to mother wit . Besides , these big-pawed fellows ' - my father was the inventor of this phrase-have such a stupid respect for industry , that they are apt to despise their betters , who live hy their wits , according to the instinct of reason , and the decrees of Providence . I nm going to the great city of Ragamuffinville , where there is elbow-room for the exercise of one 's wits , and I can turn dollars where I now only turn pennies . Accordingly we departed for the great city to seek our fortunes in a more enlarged sphere of action . As we proceeded along , my father whiled away the time by pointing out a variety of excellent speculations . I had but a confused notion of the precise meaning of this word ; and to this day I confess the distinction between making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not precisely clear to my mind . How far a man ma* use his superior wit or experience in getting the better of ignorance and simplicity , is a question , as my father used to say , which every one must decide for himself . " There , now , " said he , as we passed the house of an honest farmer- " There is a fellow who might douhle the value of his farm , and live like a fighting cock , if he would only drain that great swamp , // blow up that ledge of rocks , sprinkle a few hundred busheb of plaster over it , lay it down in grass , and stock it with the short horn breed . " I replied in the simplicity of my heart " I suppose sir , he has not the means of doing this . " " Ah ! Ferret , there 's the thing . The whole world is , as it were standing still for want of means . There is not half enough money in the world to supply the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want so as to keep pace with the spirit of the age-do you understand me , boy ? - is what employs my mind day and night . The difficulty of getting money has always appeared to me a great defect in the scheme of Providence , and were that only got over , man would be all but omnipotent . I believe this to be possible , and have a sort of dim conception working its way in my brain , which , if I can only bring it to maturity , will produce the greatest revolution that has happened in the world since the deluge , and relieve mankind from that cruel denunciation that he should earn his bread by the sweat of his brow , which always gives me an ague whenever I hear it from the pulpit . " I requested my father to explain his project , but he only replied , patting his forehead --  " It is here , boy , here , but I ca n't explain it yet , at least to your mind . One of these days I may let you into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This conversation set my thoughts in motion . I pondered almost without intermission on the subject , which gradually opened upon me ns I advanced , step by step , until I conceived the sublime idea , which , as Will appear in the sequel , I afterwards carried into effect , and with such consequences as have astonished and confounded the world . Just as my father concluded his last remark , we came in sight of a little tailor 's shop , in a village by the road side , through the open Window of which , we could see the owner stitching away with treat animation , and jerking his elbow in a most spasmodic style . Observing that he had some business with the tailor , who , as it soon I appeared , was a simple good-natured soul , of great faith and little experience , my father told me to follow him , say nothing , and be sure not to laugh . Several suits of clothes were hanging out of doors as a lure for customers . My father saluted the master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raised his eyes , gave him a nod , and then went on at a great rate , as if he wished to make up for lost time . My father then inquired if he had any ready made clothes to suit himself and eon , at which the little man pricked his ears , stuck his needle into his work , and jumped from his shop-board with the elasticity of a bull-frog . " Suits ? Fit ? my dear sit , I have clothes to fit any body , from a giant to a dwarf* " // He began to pull down his paraphernalia with his usual celerity ; and to make short of a long story , we were soon fitted . I wondered how they were to be paid for , as I happened to know my father had at all times considerably more wit than money . But I was soon enlightened on the subject . " Friend Dibdill , " said he , " your clothes fit better than if they had been made for us ; what would they have done had you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth at this compliment , but made no answer , except repeating the word " friend , " three or four times with great rapidity , in a tone of interrogation , to which my father responded --  " Aye , friend Dibdill , but I believe you do n't recollect me , though we have met several times at the Rev. Mr. Snortgrace 's meeting . Do n't you remember what a refreshing time we had about seven years ago at the great sermon about earthquakes ? " " Bless me ! " cried the tailor- " To be sure I do , but I do n't remember to have seen you there . " " Sure-you do n't say so ? Why I was one of those who lifted you up , brother Dibdill , when you were struck down , and carried you into the air , where you waked up , singing Hallelujah . Do n't you remember ? " The tailor reflected awhile . " Why , yes , now I think of it , I think I do . I 'm much obliged to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones that day , " rubbing his hands . " But may I crave your name ? " " Pumpelly , " answered my father , looking significantly at me . " Oh ! yes-may be a relation of Squire Pumpelly , the rich old codger that lives over across the river . I 've heard he 's as rich as King Solomon . Any relation ? " " His brother , " replied my father , with an air of conscious dignity . " Well , if ever ! who 'd have thought it ? " cried the other , looking rather significantly at my father 's costume , which was somewhat weather-beaten . " Yes , his youngest brother . Pm on my way there now , after an absence of several years , in which I have been rather roughly handled , as you see . But my brother has written to me to come and live with him . " Here my father began rummaging his pockets . " Plague take it ! what can have gone with the letter ? 0 , now I remember I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yonder . But to business , friend Dibdill . I did'nt like to appear before my brother , the Squire , in such a poor pickle as this , and so I thought I 'd rig myself and my boy out a little , that we might not disgrace him . I went first to the shop down yonder by the ferry , but the // fellow 's clothes , I believe , were made with a marlinspike , after measuring with a broomstick . " The tailor rubbed his hands and chuckled at this , but had the magnanimity not to run down his rival . " Now to come to the point , my good friend , " continued my father . " I have not quite enough cash , at present , to pay for these things , and so I will give you the choice , either to wait till I can see my brother , the Squire , or take an order on him for the money . What say you ? decide quick-for if you wont do either , I must e'en take up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced his trumpery upon my back . " The tailor considered a moment , moving his elbows backwards and forwards , from the mere force of habit , as if be was stitching , and then , modestly , and rather hesitatingly , as if fearful of giving offence , decided in favor of the order on Squire Pumpelly . This was accordingly given , and we departed in triumph , in a quick step . The tailor slipped upon his shop board , and the last I saw of him he was stitching it away with infinite glee . I am not ashamed to confess-for I am grown wiser now-that I felt a sort of vague perception , that this operation of my father was not altogether justifiable . Indeed , I ventured to hint as much , but his answer silenced my scruples forever . " Ferret , " said he , " I ought to have bound you apprentice to that simpleton of a tailor , for I fear I shall never make a gentleman of you . The world will say I have cheated the fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you seem to think so too . I maintain on the contrary , that I have paid him double and treble the value of these clothes in the lesson I have given . The experience he will acquire before many days are over , will answer him two most valuable purposes ; it will guard him from future losses of the kind and if he makes a proper use of it , enable him to practice the same game on others . The fact is , boy , in the scale of strict justice , he owes me for half a dozen suits , instead of my being indebted to the stupid hard-working blockhead . How I hate to see a rascal 's elbow moving at such a rate . " " Had'nt we better go back , father , and dun him for the balance he owes you ? " asked I. " Hum-not just now , my son , I 'm in too great a hurry to get to Ragamuffinville . " Accordingly we mended our pace , and in due time arrived safe at the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most expensive and fashionable establishments of the place , observing to me , " that persons who lived by the superiority of their wits , should always go to such places in preference to obscure taverns . The very fact of stopping at a splendid hotel , was // a sort of letter of credit among those two-legged animals , who were created as objects for men of wit to practice upon . The day after our arrival , my father gave me three dollars , telling me , at the same time , that for the present I must expect nothing more from him but good advice and good example . " Do you see that little red flag flying over the door yonder ? That is a place where great bargains can sometimes be made . Go and try your wits against the auctioneer , and if you come off triumphantly , I predict your fortune is made . You will be a match for the greatest shaver in the land . " I obeyed his commands , and came back a " lame duck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hammer had made a speculation out of me , that is , he had taken me in . The mode in which he circumvented me was worth ten times the money , and was , in fact , the foundation of the vast property I afterwards possessed , and which , if I could only have paid for , would have made a little German Prince of me . But I lost all , as will appear in the sequel , by some unlucky democratic experiments , which I revenged myself upon , by calling them " Specie Humbug , " " Infamous Scheme , " &amp;c . The manoeuvres of the auctioneer are too precious to be detailed to the public . I keep them for the special use of myself and confidential friends . My father scolded , and laughed at me at the same time . " Ferret , ** said he , " I did not intend to give you another cent as long as I lived . But the first error of inexperience is excusable . Here is two dollars more-go and try your fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bamboozled this time , you are no longer a son of mine . Take care how you disgrace yourself by another had bargain . " I took the money , and proceeded somewhat disconsolate and mortified along the street , running over the process by which I had been taken in by the little auctioneer . All at once , the lecture of my father on the advantage the tailor had derived from the experiment on his credulity , occurred to me , and I determined to turn the sharp edge of my newly acquired experience against others , the first opportunity . This soon presented itself , and by a process which I shall keep to myself for the reasons just specified , I succeeded , not only in retrieving my former loss , but making a snug penny besides . My father received me in triumph , and such was his awakened confidence in the superiority of my wits , that from that hour he predicted my future eminence . This incident was , indeed , the first step in the ladder . By good luck an eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was struck with the masterly genius it displayed ; and being a most liberal patron of merit , at once offered to take me into his employment . Accordingly , I descended into his // cellar , where , for a time , I was told to look sharp , listen to every thing , and say nothing . Here was a noble school to awaken the powers of my mind , and the exercise of my wits . The head of the house , or rather the cellar , was one of the most profound men of his time , as a proof of which it is only necessary to state , that he began business with no capital but his wits , lived like a prince for several years , without ever being worth a dollar , and finally failed for some millions . Here was a sublime genius for you . " Here - to use the words of my father- " here is the great Archimedes who can move a world by putting his lever upon nothing. * ' This great man watched me narrowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preparatory to trusting me in his affairs . There was an old woman who had a table where she sold apples , cakes , and other small wares , which frequently excited my longing , and as she carried on the business just at the window of our cellar , I was tempted to trade with her whenever I had money . On these occasions , my master watched me closely , and the result of his investigations was exhibited in an increasing confidence . By degrees , he opened to me the mysteries of the shaving business , and displayed to my mind all the wonders of an invisible world , appealing to the imagination instead of the senses . The glorious mysteries of kiting , race-horsing , and other occult matters connected with the sublime science of raising the wind ; the manner in which the credit system is built up and sustained , without any thing but itself to stand upon ; the masterly process by which any amount of ideal money may be conjured out of nothing , like the spirit from the cloud , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum if it were real ; these and some other of the " great principles , " which constitute the sublime of the new credit system , he could not present to me , for as yet they had no existence , except in the heated chaos of my mind , which , from the period in which I received this first practical insight into the great money , or rather credit , kingdom , continued to hoil and bubble with the fever heat / of grand conceptions , fighting their way from a faint embryo to a glorious maturity . But the lessons of my master were of the highest use to me , notwithstanding . Like streaks of sky , at early dawn , they prepared the way for the god of light and lustre , and , at the same time , taught me to take advantage of the mid-day splendor , which soon after opened upon me . The city of Ragamuffinville , just about this time , suddenly awakened to a perception of its future greatness , and it come to pass that every body began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years , and saw at the end of the long vista , a vision of grandeur and prosperity that set them all mad . They forgot that a hundred years was a long while , and that he who incurred a debt , // in the expectation of receiving a great profit at the end of that time , was very likely to die before he could realize his anticipations . Suddenly , there was a great and increasing demand for money , for all the world had become borrowers , to invest in lots , in order to take advantage of the great rise in value a hundrcd years hence . The precious metals not being of a ductile nature , and incapable of expanding fast enough to suit these great e Igencies , it became indispensable that some substitute should be found , more suitable to the spirit of the age , and the newly discovered wants of the community . My master every day lamented to me the contracted sphere of operations to which his genius was confined , by what he called the " infamous Specie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dark ages , to what they called a standard of value . " If I could only make money out of nothing , " would he exclaim in a paroxysm of enthusiasm , " I would , in a short time , possess the world U ' I brooded on this idea from morning till night , and sometimes lay awake for hours , thinking on the glorious hope of its successful accomplishment . I often asked myself xvh ' *t was the basis of the value of every thing in the world , and atlehgth came to the conclusion that it was the general estimation of mankind . I then proceeded to investigate the possibility of substituting an imaginary , for a real , value , and appealing to human credulity as its basis . Mankiad , thought I , worship false gods , adopt false opinions , and arrive at false conclusions . Many believe the moon is made oi green cheese ; is it not possible to make them believe that what is worth nothing intrinsically , is just as good as a thing of inestimable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What , proceeded I , was the intrinsic value of a fathom of Wampum , and yet , in old times , you could purchase a farm with it from the Indians . 1 forgot at that time that this Wampum was the product of labor , and therefore represented the value of all the labor bestowed upon it . While my mind was struggling to emerge from the twilight of these conceptions , into the meridian day , my master began , by degrees , to employ me in transactions which became , every day , more important and consequential . In the course of them , I daily acquired new ideas and new experience . I learned the art of evading the laws against usury , without subjecting myself to the penalty of their violation ; I mastered all the mysteries of the business in which I was engaged ; and in good time became such an adept that I could practically define to a hair the precise line which separated a lucky speculation from an act of downright swindling . I could tell to the utmost nicety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignorance , and the extent to which deception might be carried without constituting a fraud . he short , I could see my // way clear in the darkest transaction , and split a hair with my eyes shut . I was gradually , though not actually a partner , adiriitted sometimes to a share in the profits when I had made a good hit , and soon found myself in possession of a snug little sum . With this , having the approbation of my master , I commenced business on my own account , and considered my fortune as good as made , when , by his influence , I was admitted a member of the Board of Brokers , which , under the present severe laws against every other species of play , enjoys a monopoly of gambling . In truth , it was carried on upon a great scale . Not a day passed that some one of us , who , perhaps , was not worth one-fiftieth part of the money , did not play stakes for thousands , and buy or sell what neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . But every thing was done in the most gentlemanly manner , and all the members were strictly governed by the point of honor , which consisted in taking every possible advantage of each other . The entire process was a war between buyer and seller . One member would , for example , offer a thousand shares of some fancy stock ; that is , a stock which had no definite value , and another accept the offer , although the former had not a single share , and the latter not a single dollar to pay for one . The stock was to be delivered at a certain specified time , and here commenced a great struggle on the part of the buyer and seller , one to depress , the other to raise the price of the stock , by rumors calculated to affect it one way or the other . It was on one occasion of this kind that I made my first great speculation . Happening to overhear a bargain of this kind , for a vast number of shares in a certain contemplated rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without losing a moment , I went and purchased , on time , every share of this stock in the market , and of consequence , the person who had contracted to deliver the amount of shares , which was very large , was under the absolute necessity of applying to me when the period of delivery arrived . You may depend , I made him pay handsomely , knowing that he would ever after lose the chance of diddling others , if he forfeited his honor on this occasion , by being expelled the Board . By this operation he lost , and I gained , a little fortune , and what was of no less consequence , a great accession of reputation , on account of my superior sagacity and foresight . The affair recommended me to a certain bank , which soon after installed me in the office of its chief broker , that is , furnished me with money to shave all the good notes which the directors refused to discount at legal interest . In this situation it was that I invented the famous mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premiums above the legal interest as a commission for my serrices . Being now in a prosperous and honorable situation , I began to . *igh for the enjoyment of domestic felicity , as I could now afford myself that expensive luxury . I accordingly sought a partner , and being guided by prudence , as well as inclination , married a lady of a certain age , who had great family interest . Her father was president of a bank , and three of her uncles bank directors . This at once initiated me into the mysteries of the " Credit System , " as it existed at that time . I at once saw its defects , and my mind again reverted , with increasing force and vigour , to the question of a currency founded xclusively on public credulity . It is true , the banks , as they then existed , possessed great advantages in furnishing a currency , two-thirds or three-fourths of which was not represented by real value . Still , this was not the beau ideal of my imagination . I reflec ted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that it should consist solely of credit , without being adulterated by a single particle of real value . The period was now come for realizing this long cherished vision of my imagin ' tion . I was rich in credit and paper-money ; the great city of Ragamuffinville was turning wild with visions of what was going to happen a hundred years hence ; and there was such a demand for money , as all the gold and silver mines of the universe could not supply . I had also bank influence ; and now set about acquiring political distinction as indispensable to my purposes . I turned a furious democrat , that party being then uppermost ; attended every ward meeting . and made speeches in favolr of Equal Rights ; until , by degrees , I rose to be a member of the general committee for nominating members of Assembly . When this measure came up , there were so many candidates , and so great a diversity of opinions , that we settled the matter by nominating ourselves. , and were triumphantly elected . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had so long anticipated . Before proceeding to the seat of government , I had projected a scheme for a bank , founded on the great principle of making money out ofnothin* ; a self-constituted , self-existent , perpetualmotion banl ' - machine , entirely in dependent of any represeaL tive of real v " lue , and which , like a spider , would spin its web for catching flies out of its own bowels . On opening my scheme to several of my confidential friends , who had submitted to the disgrace of being called democrats for a time , in order that they might make use of their support in the attainment of their object , the- were delighted with it ,  --  most especially when they found that my bank required not a dollar for its specie basis . They eagerly joined me in a memorial to the Legislature , stating that there was a great necesVOL . II . No. vi . M // sity for an increase of capital in the great city of Ragamuffinville , and a great surplus capital having no profitable means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends to the Equal Rights of the soverei0n people , had come forward , actuated solely by the public good , to request a charter , conferring on them certain privileges , which , though the people were prohibited from exercising , were exclusively for their benefit . This ch rter , I employed a friend of mine , a lawyer unequalled in drafting laws for the purpose of being , evaded , to draw up in such a manner as that it would require no capital to pay up the stock , and authorize the corporation to do directly the contrary of what the Legislature intended . With this , I proceeded , in anticipated triumph , to the fountain of le* is lation . On my arrival , I found that almost every member of that honor* able body had some scheme or other on the anvil for the public good . and in the benefits of which he expected to participate , only . as one of the people . I made it my first object to become acquaint* ed with the individual interests of every member , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , however , was a task beyond my power to accomplish , and it then occurred to me that though I could not reconcile , I might unite them all , and thus produce perfect harmony . This plan was accordingly adopted , and produced the most beneficial consequences . Each member proceeded on the great and only just principle of reciprocity , that is , each one promised to support every one of these schemes , provided , all the others would support his , and thus , the whole batch was carried triumphantly through our honorable body with only three dissenting voices , consisting of three members who had been guilty of the unpardonable nebli*ence of coming thither without a single project for the public good . rrlfis was the origin of that great mo ( lern improvement in legislation , called log-rolling , of which I flatter myself I am the sole inventor . My bank went through with the rest , and with it commenced the new and most glorious era of that great Credit System , of which it has been truly said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barbarism . My lawyer had incorporated into our charter a phrase of my own invention , and which , in my opinion ,  --  and I hope I am not misled by vanity ,  - -  embodies the greatest improvement ever made in the system of banking , I allude to the provision that the capital of our bank should be either paid in , " OR 5 CURED TO BE PAID . ' * Under this convenient and salutary provision , on the breaking up of the session we returned to Ragamuffinville , and immediately commenced operations . We began with engraving and filling up notes to the amount of twice our nominal capital , with which we paid the first instalment on our subscriptions for stock , the whole // of which , with the exception of a few hundred shares-assigned to some members of the Legislature as a compliment for voting according to their consciences-was distributed among ourselves . For the remaining instalments , as they became due , we first issued the stock , then ave our notes of hand for the amount , and then pledged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system brouaht to that perfection which I had long imagined possible , and now saw realized . It was the ideal representation of a pyramid reversed ; nothing at the bottom , and a vast expansion of surface at the top . It was credit founded on credit , paper on paper , and promise on promise . It might , consequently , be extended to an infinite series , or at least so long as human credulity , that great beast of burden , could be brought to stagger under the blessing . We had some difficulty in finding a cashier to make oath that our capital was thus " paid in , ar secured to bc paid ; " but , at length , were lucky enough to catch a man exactly suited to our purposes ; one just emerged from the errors of the dark ages , and who recognised the distinction between the letter and spirit of an oath . I-Ic saw clearly that " secured to be paid , " was an indefinite phrase , and , consequently , meant just what a man pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our bank proceeded to business , by , in the first place , lending twenty-five per cent . more than the whole of its capital to the directors , the cashier , and the president. , to wit , myself , who claimed , and received , one-third of the whole as my lawful share . Having thus achieved the grand desideratum of making money out of nothing , my next step was to turn the discovery to the greatest advantage by changing what was worth nothing for something of real value . The truth is , I could never entirely discard from my mind certain unpleasant intruding doubts of the stability of my system , and therefore resolved to make hay while the sun shone . Accordingly , I conceived another grand scheme for the employment of the surplus funds of our institution . I proposed to a certain number of the members of the Legislature , to which I now no longer appertained , a plan for a great public improvement , that is , a rail road of a few hundred miles in length . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the funds furnished by our Bank , which was capable of expanding like an empty bladder , we proceeded quietly to purchase all the land in the immediate vicinity of the line of the contemplated improvement . which was intended however solely for the public good . We then once more commenced the system of log-rolling , to xv hich I added another lever of my own invention , to wit , the agency of lobby members , and the law passed by a great majority ; although sturdily opposed by an ignorant , old Dutch member , who insisted // that the public good had come to signify nothing but private interest . Our project went on swimmingly , and such was the rise of property along the contemplated improvement , that it was sold , and resold , on credit , so many times that it was afterwards ascertained it had become the representative of more paper promises of one kind or other , than the whole district of country through which it passed , would sell for , after the great improvement was made Such was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great advantage of which is , that it enables people to run in debt indefinitely , and property to represent fifty times as much paper as itis worth . As a sort of interlude to this , I became a purchaser of vast tracts of public land in the West , which I paid for in the notes of our bank , on which I expected to realize immense profits , and which , even though it fell in price , would still be worth more than our paper promises , the chief recommendation of which was , that the moment they passed from my hands , as a private person , in payment of a debt , the debt was paid , though they might become ever so worthless afterwards . This is another great advantage of my newly invented Credit System , if not to those who receive , at least to those that pay . In this case , as I purchased of Uncle Sam , my conscience was quite easy , for in case the worst came to the worst , the old fellow could afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth ; the idol of the brokers ; the oracle of financiers ; the controller of the stock market ; the envy of all that miserable race , which lives on real property and labour ; and the founder of cities , for I had laid out six of these on my new lands , or rather on the maps of my lands , some of which threatened to outgrow even the great emporium of Ragamuffinville . Nay , I do n't know but I may in time become the founder of a great empire on the North Pacific , where I once established an Agency for buying muskrat and mink skins . But alas ! there is nothing perfect in this world , and my new Credit System , though as near perfection as possible , was unluckily a little out at one of its elbows . It contained a vile principle , by which it is said , by pretended philosophers , every thing in the natural and moral world is regulated . I mean the mischievous and abominable principle of REAcTION , the greatest enemy to the Credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , it is pretended that the affairs of this world tesemble the action of a pendulum , which the farther it is driven one way the farther it will recede on the other , thus ever returning to opposite extremes . *Thcther there be such a law of nature , or necessity , or not , certain it is that I now began to experience the existence of some cause // or other by which the equilibrium of my new Credit System was sadly disturbed . At first I ascribed it to the great number of banks which had grown out of the system , with capitals " paid iu , or secured to be paid " in a similar manner to ours ; and the operation of the old saying that " too much pudding will choke a dog . " This however was so contrary to my first principle , namely , that it was utterly impossible to have too much of a good thing , and of course an excess of credit and paper-money , that I discarded it with contemptuous indignation . At length I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin of all the dangers which now began to threaten my system in two great sources , namely , the " Specie Circular and the Specie Humbug . " These two humbugs pla0ued me exeeedingly . The former interfered with the founding of my cities in the West , by striking at the root of my Credit System , which contemplated the entire extension of every thing hut promises to pay instead of payments ; and the latter was a serious obstacle to my plan of causing the people to give up their absurd prejudices in favour of silver and gold , by keeping the latter out of sight until they should actually forget such things ever existed . I always considered specie as the great ally of ignorance and barbarism , and was convinced in my own mind that an extensive paper circulation representing nothing , and which nobody was obli bed to redeem , was the sole agent of refinement and civilization . And here I must do myself the justice to state that the idea which a " Great Financier " of the present day has since carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon the above principle , was suggested by me in a confidential conversation . Be this as it may , these two mischievous humbugs caused a udden revulsion in the flood-tide of my affairs . The dunderheadud people , I mean the big-pawed Farmers , and the hard-handed Mechanics and Labourers , began once more to recall to mind those demoralizing substitutes for paper-money , silver and gold , which are well denominated in the Scriptures the root of all evil . Certain mischievous fellows , out of revenge for being disappointed in getting discounts at my bank , began to write essays in some of the newspapers whose editors were in a similar predicament , full of the most disorganizing principles . They maintained the enormous heresy of Equal Rights ; denounced Monopolies ; denied that a promise was the actual substance of the thing promised , and cancelled the obligation ; and dared to insinuate that a superstructure that had no foundation would be very likely to fall to the ground , the first storm it encountered . Nay , they had the hardihood to assert that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very heart of my system . In vain did I marshal my forces , consisting of editors of newspapers whom I had conciliated by my generosity , and who . epaid me with gratitude ; politicians whom I had linked body and // soul with the existence of my system , and who lived and breathed in that alone ; and legislators who had grown out of it like toad stools from rotten wood . In vain did I set on foot the cry of Loco Foco , Fanny Wright , Robert Dale and Jack Cade ; equally vain that I called on the people who owed more than they could pay ; the people who sighed to make promises they could not fulfil , and all those who desired to live by their wits instead of their labour , to come forth and defend their possessions , their morals and their religion . All would not do . The stubborn ignorance of the mass of mankind , which prevent them from knowing when they are well off , or properly distinguishing betwixt happiness and misery , resisted the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cri is of my great Credit System was at hand . It behooved ii , therefore , to make ready for the shock ; and accordin*ly we proceeded to prepare ourselves for a run upon our Bank . We had only specie eiiough in our vaults to pay the postage of our letters , and our capital consisted entirely of the following items Firstly. - The notes of hand which represented the stock of the bank . Secondly. - The stock of the bank which represented the notes of hand . Thirdly. - The de ts due to the bank , to wit , the notes of the president , directors , and editors and politicians* we had thought it prn ( lCnt to make friends of , in order to resist the stupid , ignorant hostility of the " big paws " and others . I had almost forgot to mention that somewhat rising one-third more than the whole amount of the nominal capital of our bank , was loaned to myself and the Directors , of which I had by far the largest share , as was but just , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Credit System , but likewise ' the means of carrying it into execution by log-rolling . This brief exposition will serve better than any other mode , to exemplify the principles of my system . The reader will readily perceive that o r Bank had actually no other capital than public confidence , or as the infidel Loco Focos , and Fanny Wright men , who believe in nothing but Specie Humbugs , call it , public credulity . This was the perfection of my system . It is easy enough to found a Banking ystem on a specie basis , but to raise it upon credit alone , I consider the triumph of financiering . Our first act , in order to meet the unreasonable demands of the senseless people who held our notes , a great amount of which we had hsued in anticipation to strengthen us against the coming storm , was to discharge a great duty to ourselves . Charity begins at home , is one of the fundamental maxims of my Credit System . *5o we unanimously decided to liquidate our own obli // gations by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital stock . Our next act was , to cancel the certificates of stock pledged by ourselves as collateral security for the stock ; and our third to throw both notes and certificates into the lire . Thus at once were cancelled all our responsibilities in the most satisfactory manner . The bank which , according to my great Credit System , orilnated in nothinb , returned to its original element of nothing , and all parties were perfectly content , e* cept those eternal and disorganizing grumblers , the Loco Focos and Jack Cade men whom nothing will satisfy , who came with their hands full of our notes to demand payment , and began to talk of tarring and feathering . But the Mayor had providentially ordered out the military to overawe these unreasonable villains , and so my gentlemen went home with each a flea in his ear . I dare say some of them suffered onsiderably by the loss of a pitiful sum , un* Torthy the notice of the great inventor of the Credit System , but I have since quieted my *conscience by subscribing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these wretched , irreligious , ( lemoralized beings . This equitable adjustment of our affairs placed me on the very pinnacle of prosperity . I had paid all my debts to the people , and might now have sat down in the enjoyment of a quiet conscience amid unbounded wealth , but the truth is , I longed for a single hundred thousand dollars more , to make up two millions , and unfortunately an opportunity seemed to present itself just in the nick of time . I had a parti ular friend ,  --  one with whom I had done business for years past , and regularly got to windward of two or three times a year ; but with all this the fellow crept along prosperously by some inconceivable means beyond my comprehension . There are such men in the world , and of all beings in the creation they most puzzle me to account for their prosperity . They themselves pretend to xplain it by quoting that stale maxim about honesty being the best policy ; but for my part I never saw honesty achieve such wonders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my Credit System . It is at war with the spirit of the age and the progress of improvement . Be this as it may , when in consequence of the " suspension " of our Bank , I had got rid of all my responsibilities in the most satisfactory manner , and felt myself perfectly independent of panic and pressure , my worthy friend came to me one day with a proposition to sell a tract of new land , comprising three millions of acres , and several large towns in perspective . This tract I had ori*inally aold him at a prett considerable profit , and now thought it would be a capital operation to purchase back again under the depres*ion of the panic which I was convinced would blow over again and be followed by a cor ye , ponding reaction of prices . // My worthy friend was excessively al armed , and consequently very desirous to sell his land , and realize the pro.ceeds , as soon as possible . I took advantage of his apprehensions , and finally purchased back my land at somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying him cash in hand . The poor creature went away hi* , hly delighted , and what is not common on such occasions , both parties were perfectly satisfied . He rejoiced in selling , and I in purchasing , what I was assured would enrich me a few hundred thousands in the end . This would undoubtedly have been the case if it had not been for the obstinate ignorance and stupidity of our outlandish Government , which about this time began a series of diabolical experiments which played the very mischief with my Credit System , and gradually undermined its only support , namely , the public credulity* It undertook to refuse my bank notes in payment of the public lands , which operated against my system like a two-edged sword , right and left . It injured its credit and depressed the price of lands by demanding payment in specie instead of what all people of good breeding call its " representative . " It embarrassed me terribly , and was the commencement of the doxvnfall of one of the greatest estates ever acquired by a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves obliged to give real value instead of its respectable representative for lands , began to calculate the cost , etc. , which they never did be. * fore , when they paid in promises which neither themselves nor any body else ever expected to redeem . Land began to descend rapidly , . and like a wagon running down hill , the nearer it got to the bottom the faster it went . Not content with aiming this blow at the national prosperity , this outlandish Government not long afterwards proposed the " Infamous Scheme " of a divorce of Bank and State , which completed my downfall . " Infamous Scheme , " indeed , for what could be more infamous than withdrawing the Government from a partnership in which it furnished a breat portion of the capital , and all the credit , while the other parties received all the profits ? It was in fact a base conspiracy against my system , and accordingly all the really honest pntriots raised a hue and cry the moment it made its appear. * ance . I was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetin6 of every man who owed more than he could pay , ii the city of Ragamuffinville  --  and they were not a few in number - which denounced the Specie Circular , the Infamous Scheme , and the outlandish Administration , which had , by its stupid folly , arrested the career of my Credit System , and ruined the country by pre* maturely experimenting on the capacity of mankind , to continue the practice of running in debt through an infinite series , as I am coiv // vinced can be done , if no mischievous attempts are made to appeal to their common sense and experience . But I have neither temper nor patience to detail all the mischievous follies and stupid experiments of our outlandish Government , and , besides , the details of my decline are by no means so agreeable to my recollection as those of my rise . Suffice it to say , that the great land speculation I made out of my simple friend , as I thought him at the time , was the primary cause of my catastrophe . The blunders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which like a top the moment it ceases to whirl round , falls to the ground . I had risen with speculation , and I fell with speculation . I had lived for years in the anticipation of a rise in the value of every thing on the face of the earth , except papermoney , and as soon as prices declined I became to all intents and purposes " a lame duck . " It is unnecessary to enter into details , as my object is not to record my descent , but my ascension . Suffice it to say , that the vile persecutions and egregious blunders of our outlandish Administration at length brought me to a " suspension , " that being the genteel phrase for what used to be called bankruptcy . And here I will pause a moment to observe on the truth of the Conservative theory , that my Credit System is the parent of all that is pure and refined in human society . In nothing is this more strikingly exemplified than the refinements it has brought about in our language . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie circulation , when a man could not or would not pay his debts he was called a bankrupt ,  --  now he has only suspended ; taking in another in a bargain , was called swindling , now it is speculation ; running in debt without paying , or having any prospect of doing it , is now enterprise ; crime is imprudence , and murder , a great misfortune . But if any doubt remains of the beautiful perfection of my system , it will be found in the following fact which I record as the consummation of its triumphs . I had for more than fifteen years lived in the greatest luxury and splendor ; I had spent in that time upwards of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ; I had held property to the amount of between two and three millions , and yet when I came to investigate my affairs critically , I found that at no period of my prosperity had I ever been worth a dollar in the world ! In short , I had been over head and ears in debt every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt for a single moment the perfection of my Credit System ? Can any man that loves his country or his species , refrain from joining with me in denouncing the Specie Circular , the Specie Humbug , the Infamous Scheme , and the tissue of blundering ignorance exhibited by our outlandish Administration ? But for these I might have gone on accumulating " responsibilities " // and spending money like dirt , to the end of my life , and what if my debts had increased all that time ? It would only have been a few hundred thousand dollars more issues of paper money , by some body or other , and the vacuum would have been supplied . This is the great beauty of my system . It works by an infinite series , as it were , and there is only one trifling thing wanting , namely , that there should be all debtors , and no creditors , in the world . I do n't despair of bringing this about , when , as will certainly be the case a couple or three years hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Credit System . rj7hen shall we see the age of Internal Improvements , unexampled exquisite refinement , and unlimited public prosperity , for then will every body owe and nobody pay ; then will the wealth of the nation , like that of England , be demonstrated by the amount of its debt ; then will the true Agrarian principle be in practical operation , for a man who borrows a hundred thousand dollars will be as rich as the one that lends it ; and then there will be no occasion for a bottom to the sea , for the whole world will be adrift on its surface . Such are the anticipations with which I solace the lazy hours of my temporary retirement from the business of the world . My other auxiliary comfort is in recalling the busy scenes of my former career , and either suggesting great speculations to others , or imagining the muse for myself . In this way I endeavour to get rid of the desperate ennui of a life free from the perplexity and distraction of being out of debt . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound , and the leaden depression consequent on being freed from the excitement of getting up every morning , without knowing whether I should not be " suspended " before night ; and going to bed every night with the anticipation of being a lame duck the next morning , is now the principal evil of which I complain . It is inconceivable what interest such vici situdes communicated to life , and were it not that I look forward to the speedy downfall of our ignorant outlandish Administration , and the resuscitation of my Credit System in more than its past glory , I really believe I should be obliged to turn philanthropist , to pass away the time . P. 5 . I forgot to mention that on my retirement from the presidency of my bank , the Directors unanimously voted me a service of plate , worth twenty thousand dollars ; and that my father , to whose lessons I am indebted for every blessing 1 have enjoyed or anticipated , has lately been appointed by the Federal Common Council of Ragamuffinville , Chairman of the Finance Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind , " which is now the principal employment of our States and Corporations.
