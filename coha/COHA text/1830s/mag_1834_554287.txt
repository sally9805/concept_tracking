txt Tnis is the first livraison ,  --  to use a convenient French term , for which we have no English equivalent ,  --  of Mr. Sparks 's l ) roniised selection from the correspondence and other papers of Washington . The two volumes are to form the second and third of the work the first , which is to appear at some future time in the progress of the publication , being devoted exclusively to a new biography of the illustrious aiithor , from the pen of his learned and indefatigable editor . We incline to think , that the feeling of the country will ultimately call for the printing of all the Washington manuscripts , voluminous as they are , at the public expense . The deep veneration for his character , that now prevails throughout the civilized world , and is constantly augmenting from generation to generation , will hardly permit the people to rest satisfied , while any portion of his compositions , which is known to exist , remains unpublished . As the only fitting monument to his memory is that which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country , so the only suitable inscription for that monument is the whole mass of written compo // sitions , in which the patriot expressed , in his own simple , manly , and excellent language , his views of passing events , and which form a complete commentary on the history of the country through the whole period of his mati.ire life . The collection ,  --  amounting , as we are told by Mr. Sparks , to not less than eighty volumes ,  --  was lately i ) urchased of the family of Washington hy the General Government , and will he safely deposited in the Department of State , where it may also he consulted with convenience by those who may have occasion to recnr to it . Even there , however , it will riot he entirely beyond the reach of the accidents , that must always endanger in some degree the preservation of a work , of which there is only a single copy in existence ; and we can hardly doubt , as we have said , that in the course of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) recalitior*s , by the multiplication of copies , against the possibility even of the destruction of this last and most interesting legacy of the Father of his country . In the mean time , the feelings and the actual wants of the present generation called loudly for the immediate publication of a copious selection from the most interesting l ) arts of this mass of writings ; and it is fortunate that the preparation of the work has fallen into the hands of a person , every way so well qualified to execute it to the public satisfaction , as the present editor . On this point , we have expressed ourselves so fully in a preceding article of this number , that it is unnecessary to add any thing in this connexion . Mr. Sparks 's former publications of a similar kind , afford the best evidence of his qualifications ; and the great experience he has now acquired iii the editorial profession , the unwearied labor which he has bestowed upon this undertaking , as well as the character of the present specimen , satisfy us that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the second volume of the work , and the first of his writings , the editor has given a succinct statement of the general plan upon which he has proceeded , in arranging the whole , and which we consider as extremely judicious . It was a task of some difficulty with him to determine , what general principles should be adopted , in selecting the parts for publication from the whole body of the papers left by Washington . in the first place , the mass of manuscripts , which extends , as we have remarked , to eighty volumes , consisting chiefly of letters , is so large as to preclude the idea of publishing // more than a comparatively small portion . Again ; from the nature of the Correspondence , being mostly official , and many of the letters having been written to different persons on the same subjects , there were necessarily frequent repetitions and numerous particulars constantly intervening , wbi ch , though essential at the time , in the transactions to which they relate , have no longer any interest or moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subordinate arrangements of an army ; such as supplies , provisions , clothing , camp equipage , arms , ammunition , and other points of minor consideration , which engaged the incessant care of the commander-in-chief , and entered largely into his correspondence even with Congress , and the highest officers , both civil and military . To print all the materials of this kind would not only have been useless in itself , but would have added so much to the size and expense of the work , as at the same time to make it cumbersome and unattractive to readers , and raise the cost above the means of many individuals , who would gladly possess it . Under these circumstances , the EcEtor has endeavored to pursue such a course , as would most effectually accomplish the general object which he Lad in view , within the compass allotted to the present collection . For this purpose , he a ( lopted two rules , which he has labored to follow as exactly as possible : - flrst , to select such parts as have a l ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they contain ,  - -  whether in relation to actual events , or to the political designs and operations , in which Washington was a leading or conspicuous agent ; secondly , to take such other parts , as contain the views , opinions , counsels and reflections of the writer on the various topics suggested to him by the occasion , and serve to exhibit the structure of his mind , its powers and resources , and the peculiar traits of his personal character . Taking these rules as a guide , Mr. Sparks went carefully through the manuscripts , without regard to what had before been made public , and selected from the whole the portions best fitted to his purpose . According to this plan , when a letter throughout bears the features above described , it will be printed entire , as will in every case the addresses , speeches , messages , circulars , and other state papers , issued by him from time to time . But many of the letters , both in the public and private correspondence , for the // reasons already assigned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating chiefly to topics or facts , evanescent in their nature , and temporary in their design . Special care will be taken , nevertheless , in all such omissions , that the sense shall not be marred , nor the meaning of the writer in any manner perverted or obscured . Nor is this difficult , because the omitted passages usually treat upon separate and distinct subjects , and may be removed without injury to the remaining portions of the letter . It ought to be premised here , that , in preparing the manuscripts for the I ) ress , I have been obliged sometimes to use a latitude of discretion , rendered unavoidable by the mode in which the papers have been preserved . They are uniformly copied into volumes , and this task appears to have been performed , except in the revolutionary correspondence , by incompetent or very careless transcribers . Gross blunders constantly occur , which not unfrequently destroy the sense , and which never could have existed in the original drafts . In these cases I have of course considered it a duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazard such corrections as the coristruction of the sentence manifestly warranted , or a cool judgment dictated . On some occasions the writer himself , through haste or inadvertence , may have fallen into an awkward use of words , faults of grammar , or inaccuracies of style , and when such occur from this source , I have equally felt bound to correct them . It would be an act of unpardonable injustice to any author , after his death , to bring forth compositions , and particularly letters written with no design to their publication , and commit them to the press , without previously subjecting them to a careful revision . This exercise of an editor 's duty , however , I have thought it allowable to extend only to verbal and grammatical mistakes or inaccuracies , maintaining a scrupulous caution , that the author 's meaning and purpose should thereby in no degree be changed or affected . ' If any part of the plan , as thus explained and developed by the Editor , could be regarded as questionable , it would perhaps be the occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are retained . As a general principle , we consider it highly important , that , in all collections of this kind , the documents published should , as far as possible , be entire . In most cases , subjects so nearly connected in time , place , or the personal relations of the writer , as to come within the compass of the same letter , will have , though they may not be apparent to the casual reader , bearings upon each other , // which may serve to explain and modify the statements made , or the opinions given U*Ofl each . Hence the perusal of a letter , known not to be entire , with whatever discretion the omission may he 5uppo5ed to have been made , can never give us the same assurance that we are in possession of the writer 's views , which we should feel if we had the whole before us . We are aware , that there may he cases , in which a too scrupulous adherence to the principle of publishing all documents and letters entire , might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present ; hut we would venture to suggest to Mr. Sparks the expediency of deviating from it as rarely as possible , in the further progress of his labor , especially with *ape1s of much importance or interest . The contents of the immense mass of manuscripts , from which the present selection has been made , and the admirable order in which they were arranged hy XVashington , are particularly decribed by Mr. Sparks in the preface to the second volume . The account is very curious in itself , and illustrates , in some of its most important and valuable points , the character of the illustrious author . T*vo complete copies of Washington 's revolutionary correspondence have been preserved at Mount Vernon . The first consists of the original files , which he always kept with him for reference and use in camp and in his campaigns ; the second is a literal transcript from these originals , recorded in forty-four large volumes , in which all the letters are classified and arranged according to their subjects and dates . This transcript was executed under his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaries employed for the purpose , who wrote a fair and handsome hand , and on whose fidelity he could rely . Even the dimensions of the volumes , the quality of the paper , and the style of binding , were prescribed by himself . Each parcel in the file is designated by a letter of the alphabet , and each paper in the parcel is numbered . By the aid of corresponding marks in the margin of the letter-books , a sure and speedy reference may be had to any original paper in the whole series . A brief sketch of the plan , as drawn out by Washington , and a few explanatory remarks , will show at the same time the principles of the arrangement , and the varied subjects of his correspondence . 1 . Under the first great division , were classed letters to the Congress of the United States ; to Committees of Congress ; to the Board of War and Ordnance ; to American Ministers Plenipotentiary at Foreign Courts ; to individual Members of Congress in their Public Characters . // As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his powers from Congress , it was necessary , that his intercourse with that body should be full , constant , and of the most confidential kind . In the first place , the army was new , undisciplined , unprovided ; very few of the members of Congress were military men , or possessed of any knowledge of military affairs , either practical or theoretical ; the burden of organizing and disciplining the army was at once thrown upon the commander-in-chief But all the arrangements of this sort , the rules and regulations , and every contemplated change , were to be approved by Congress before they could take effect ; and Congress reserved wholly to themselves the appointment of thc general officers . Thus it was not only the duty ofWashington to obey instructions and execute orders , but he was obliged to suggest what these orders should be , and wait till his suggestions were passed into resolves by the Congress . This was frequently a source of delay and embarrassment ; it was a heavy and perpetual tax upon the forethought and reflection of the commander-in-chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole military system , although a jealousy of their civil rights , and a fear of the tendency of warlike ambition , induced the members of Congress to keep a salutary check in their own hands . The condition of the army and an account of all the principal occurrences were communicated at stated times to Congress , doubtful cases were referred to their decision , and returns forwarded respecting the departments of the commissaries , quartermasters , and other officers engaged in providing for the wants of the army , and regulating its internal economy . The intimate and peculiar relations , thus subsisting between Congress and the army , gave rise to a correspondence , which , although it necessarily ran into details , was nevertheless of great importance . For similar purposes he kept up an intercourse by letter with Committees of Congress , the Board of War , and individual members . By these means his views were always presented to that assembly , and guided them in their deliberations and resolves . * . Letters to Provincial Congresses , Conventions , and Committees of Safety ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to Civil Magistrates and Citizens of every Denomination . Although the army was under the general control and pay of the Continental Congress , and the number of men to he furnish .. el by each State was prescribed from time to time by that body , yet the mode of raising the men , and in part the supplying of them with arms and clothing , were left to the States themselves . it was the business of the commander-in-chief to see , that the // men were actually brought into the field at the proper times and places , as well as to call out the militia upon emergencies , and to dismiss them when their services were no longer required . This duty opened a wide field of correspondence with the States , and some of XVashington 's best letters are circulars to the governors , making appeals to the patriotism of the people , and urging po*verful motives for exertion and sacrifice in the common cause . Wherever the army was stationed , he was always cautious to keep the military and civil powers distinct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local nature , which did not clearly come within the jurisdiction of the army . rrhe delicate and troublesome concerns of the Tories were of this description . The safety of the country required him to use the force he commanded to apprehend suspected persons ; but he invariably turned them over to the civil authorities of the State in which they resided , to be dealt with as the proper tribunals should decide . Occasions frequently occurred , likewise , for corresponding with the committees of towns and smaller districts or communities . 3 . Letters to Officers of the Line of every Rank ; to Officers of the Staff ; and all other Military Characters . The correspondence under this head is much more voluminous , than that under either of the others . It extends to the whole army of the United States , however divided or wherever stationed ; to the commanding officers in the great departments , to major-generals and other officers on separate commands at posts or in detachments , to officers of every rank engaged in any special service , such as partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy 's outposts , or procuring intelligence . It also includes instructions to officers , from the highest to the lowest ; directions for the arrangements in camp , as well as the movements during a campaign ; letters to quartermasters , commissaries , contractors , the clothier-general and his deputies , and all others concerned in providing supplies for the army ; to surgeons and superiutendants of the hospitals ; to militia officers while on Continental service ; and to other persons , acting in a military capacity within the sphere of his command . 4 . Letters to Foreign Ministers ; to Subjects of Foreign Nations in the immediate Service of the United States ; to Foreign Officers . When the French army came to America , it was , by a previous stiJ ) ulation , to be under the command of Washington , while acting in concert with the American army . This arrangement , as well as the mutual plans for co-operation , necessarily caused much correspondence between Washington , Count Ro // chambean , Count d'Estaing , and other commanders of the French army and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated , as the French military affairs in the United States were under their general supervision and guidan ce. 5 . Letters to Officers of every Rank and Denomination in the Service of the Enemy ; to British Subjects of every Description with the Enemy ; to Persons applying for Permission to go to the Enemy . The most important letters under this head are those to the British commanders , on various topics , but chiefly relating to the exchange of prisoners , in which there were many difficulties , emanating from the peculiar relations of the two contending armies to each other , and the manner in which the British government regarded the nature of the contest at the beginning of the war . 6 . Private Letters . In this division is included a long list of letters ; and although they were classed as private , yet they are mostly on subjects appertaining to public concerns . They are not official ; but many of them were written to persons in public stations , and intended to promote a purpose by stronger representations and the force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for general inspection . In this view they may be considered as expressing the unreserved sentiments of their author , and as explaining his designs and conduct on occasions , where the caution required in his official despatches must leave much for inference or conjecture . A few are mere letters of friendship ; but even in such cases ; the great work in which he was engaged seems to have absorbed his thowrhts , and suggested the principal topics for his pen . Such is the mode projected and adopted by General Washington himself for classifying his papers , while commander-inchief of the American army . Such is the broad outline of the topics to which they extend . The arrangement is , in the first instance , according to subjects ; and , in the second , according to the order of time ; that is , the mass of letters is formed into six distinct classes , and those in each class are brought together consecutively by their dates . In preparing them for publication , it has been thought preferable to throw them all into the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events to which they relate . This method , indeed , is the only one by which a just understanding of the papers can be obtained , without much trouble in referring from one part to another ; since the subjects upon which they treat are not of an abstract nature , but corninonly // relate to the affairs in which the writer was immediately concerned , and are blended in the general train of the correspondence . ' In connexion with this account of the arrangement and contents of the Washington papers , Mr. Sparks introduces the following very judicious observations upon the question , how far Washington is personally responsible for the language of the letters and documents , which hear his signature . The question has been asked , how far Washington may be considered the author of the immense number of letters , to which , in his official and private capacity , he affixed his name . This is a question rather of curiosity , than of essential interest or consequence , and one which it would be quite impossible at this day to answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been preserved as they were transcribed into letterbooks , and in the different handwriting of a great many copyists , who were employed from time to time for this purpose . The first drafts have been for the most part destroyed ; for even in the correspondence during the Revolution , which now exists in the files that were used at the time , the letters thus filed are not in every instance the first drafts , but copies , so that it is impossible now to tell by whom they were originally penned . All the letters printed in the First Part of this work , embracing the period before the Revolution , I believe were written by Washington himself , because a large proportion of them are still to be found in his own handwriting , either in the condition of first drafts , or as transcribed by himself ; and because , while acting as an officer in the French war , he seldom if ever had the services of a secretary , and at Mount Vernon he was certainly his own scribe , both in his correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote with his own hand all his official letters durimig the Revolution , it would be as preposterous to suppose , as that Marlborough , or Bonaparte , or Wellington , or any other great commander , was the penman of all the letters to which he subscribed his name . Compositions of this kind are not adduced as evidences of the genius , the rhetorical ingenuity , the brilliant fancy , the felicitous invention , or the literary accomplishments of the persons , whose name they hear . The value to be attached to them , and the high consideration , which they justly claim , are derived from the circumstance of their being records of great events , expressing the opinions and unfolding the designs of men , in whose conduct and motives the destinies of nations are involved . They are the highest and purest fountains of history , // and by whatever hand the written language is constructed , the spirit and substance , the principles , facts , arguments , and purposes , must necessarily be considered as flowing from him , by whose name they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his character and reputation , as well as the vital interests of the cause entrusted to him , are at stake . Caution in weighing , and judgment in adopting the sentiments of others , are often not less indicative of true wisdom and greatness , than the power to originate and combine . It will be seen , by hints contained in several of Washington*s letters , that his personal labor in writing was at times intense , even amidst the harassing cares and oppressive burdens , under which he struggled in discharging his military duties . When he resorted to the assistance of his secretary , aids , or other persons , it was his custom sometimes to prepare brief minutes of the topics , which he wished to have introduced into a letter , and leave the arrangement and style to the amanuensis . At other times he would dictate in detail the substance of a despatch ; and again , when the subject was of minor importance , he would give general directions only , which the secretary would embody in his own language . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of correspondence , than the similarity which prevails throughout in the style , the turns of expression , the habits of thought , and particularly the methods of stating facts and enforcing arguments . This will be obvious upon a very slight inspection ; and no stronger proof can be required of the pervading influence of one master-mind , whatever instruments it may have employed to communicate its sentiments and effect its designs . It should be stated , moreover , that the originals of many of the ablest and best written papers , which will appear in the present work , may still be seen in the handwriting of the author . It is a mistake , which some have been too ready to adopt , that he was not accustomed to composition . The truth is , he commenced the habit very early , and practised it assiduously till the end of his life . It is equally true , that his defective education qualified him but indifferently to attain elegance or even accuracy of style . But he knew when his thoughts were clearly and forcibly expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his chief study . Though he frequently betrayed a want of skill in the construction of his sentences , yet he was fastidious in the use of words , as is manifest from the numerous verbal erasures and insertions in his original manuscripts . Indeed he seldom suffered a paper of any sort to go out of his hands , even an ordinary letter of friendship or business , without first compos // ing and correcting it with studious care , and then transcribing a fair copy . Bundles of letters to the managers of his farms , written in the midst of his weightiest public duties , afford a striking testimony to this fact . ' The concluding observations in the above extract , upon the style of Washington , in papers known to be from his own pen , though perhaps in the main just , are certainly not too favorable ; and sufficiently prove that Mr. Sparks is not inclined to the error , so common to editors , of indulging in extravagant and indiscriminate eulogy upon their subjects . The education of Washington was no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best literary institutions of this and other countries ; although , considering the moral influences which prevail at such institutions , it may be questioned , whether his character , as a whole , would have been improved by studying at one of them . However this may be , the deficiency in his education , as compared with that received at our colleges , lay chiefly in the want of any acquaintance with foreign languages , ancient or modern ;  --  a branch of learning , the importance of which , especially for citizens of this country , is in common opinion much over-rated . But the very fact , that his attention was not distracted by the study of a number of foreign dialects , naturally led him to bestow more than the usual portion of time and care upon the language and literature of his own country , and were thus favorable to the acquisition of a good English style . He appears , accordingly , to have felt very early the great importance of this accomplishment ; and the circumstances of his life , which threw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epistolary communication with the first characters in the Colonies , upon subjects of the highest moment , gave him an extent of exercise in composition , which is rarely required even of professedly literary men at the same age . The result was , that he attained and possessed through life a most remarkable facility in com position , and probably wrote with his own hand as large an amount of manuscript , as almost any person that ever lived . That his style is not distinguished for elegance , in the usual sense of the term , may perhaps be admitted . The mind of Washington was not poetical or imaginative , and no system of training could probably have given to his language , either in conversation or writing , the brilliancy and warmth of coloring , which indicate a temperament of that description . But these qualities YOL. xxxix. *-No. 86. 61 // are rarely admissible in letters of business , as those of Wash .. ington always were ; and he is quite remarkable for an easy and natural flow of language , which is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the proper and only elegance , that appertains to the official style . His grammatical accuracy is also remarkable , and though a severe eye would doubtless detect a great many blemishes in the whole mass of his writings , yet we doubt whether the average number , in any given number of pages , would be larger than in the composition of professed authors of distinction and acknowledged correctness . In accuracy and ease of construction , his style is , we think , superior to that of Jefferson , which has always , and deservedl y , been much commended . In short , we can not but regard the literary talent and habits of Washington , though applied exclusively through life to merely practical purposes , as among the most remarkable of his characteristic qualities and as among those which contributed , most directly and powerfully , though in a subsidiary way , to his efficiency and usefulness . The Editor has accompanied the papers contained in the volumes before us , with notes and illustrations of considerable extent , and which carry with them internal evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been prepared . In preparing himself for the discharge of this part of his duty , Mr. Sparks has exhibited a degree of diligence and perseverance , almost without precedent , and , as we are happy to learn , has met with facilities and aids , that are almost equally rare . He has made it a matter of conscience to visit the scenes of most of the important events in our history ,  --  to examine in person the archives of Congress and of the United States , represented in that body , as well as the private collections of many revolutionary characters of note ; and finally , to explore the immense repositories in the foreign offices of the British and French Governments , which , much to the credit of those Governments , were thrown open to him with unrestricted , and before unexampled liberality . We extract the few short and modest paragraphs , in which Mr. Sparks gives an account of these truly meritorious labors . The notes and other illustrations , comprised in this Second Part of the work , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of research , and with much expense of time and labor . In the first place , the letters // received by Washington during the war , amounting to several thousands in number , the records of councils of war and courtsmartial , the opinions of the general officers on important subjects , the orderly books , resolves of public bodies , and reports of committees , all of which are among his papers , afford a rich treasure of facts , to which I have constantly resorted . The manuscript papers relating to the Revolution , which are deposited in the office of the Secretary of State at Washington , containing all that remains of the proceedings and correspondence of the Old Continental Congress , I have also personally examined . For the same purpose I have visited the several States , which belonged to the original Confederation and took part in the war , and have examined in the public offices of each State the manuscript papers appertaining to the period under consideration . It has moreover been my good fortune , through the politeness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , including the entire correspondence of several of the major and brigadier generals of the army , the members of the Old Congress , and other civil and military officers of distinction . The materials thus collected , being original and perfectly authentic , and proceeding from the highest sources , possess a value which may easily be estimated . In England and France , my researches were pursued with no less perseverance and success . With a liberality on the part of the governments of both these countries , which demands the warmest acknowledgments , I was permitted to inspect in the 1 ) ublic archives all the papers , which relate to the American war . The task occupied nearly twelve months of close application , but the labor was abundantly rewarded by the results . The British offices opened to me the complete correspondence of the ministers , Lord Dartmouth and Lord George Germ am , with the governors of the colonies at the beginning of the contest , and with the commanders in America during the whole war , namely , Generals Gage , Howe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornwallis , and others of subordinate rank . The original correspondence of the British Commissioners , while negotiating the peace in Paris , was likewise examined ; and also the original papers presented from time to time by Lord North to Parliament . In Paris , my researches embraced the voluminous correspondence between Count Vergennes and the French ministers , Gerard and Luzerne , while they were in the United States , amounting in all to nearly four hundred despatclies , and unfolding the policy and views of the French Government from the also * hennnin* to the end of the wcr ; iu*uwu-t* and UL ? J*I // pers on American affairs , written by members of the cabinet , or by able jurisconsults employed for that purpose . In the archives of the Department of War , the despatches of Count Rochambeau , and other officers commanding the French army in America , were submitted to my examination , and such copies as I desired were allowed to be taken . I feel it a duty , as well as a pleasure , to express on this occasion the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several gentlemen in Europe , who rendered most generous and valuable services in promoting the object of my inquiries , particularly to Sir James Mackintosh , the Marquis of Lansdowne , and Lord Holland in London ; to General Lafayette and the Marquis de Marbois , in Paris ; and to these I may add Mr. Lawrence , at that time Charg* d'Ajfaires from the United States to the Court of Great Britain , and Mr. Brown , the American Minister Plenipotentiary in France . From the large extent and various nature of the papers above indicated , it is obvious that only a partial use can be made of them in illustrating the writings of Washington ; yet , as they all have a bearing on the great train of events , in which he acted the most conspicuous part , they contain many particulars , explanatory of the designs of persons and parties , which could not be known at the time he wrote , and others that will throw additional light upon the topics which employed his pen , and the affairs in which he was engaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on manuscript authorities , and avoided as much as possible the encumbering of the pages with matter , which is already accessible in printed books . By this process I trust it will be found , that some valuable accessions have been made to history , at the same time that the character and deeds of Washington have received new elucidation . The plans of battles and military movements , which are occasionally inserted for a better understanding of the text , have been compiled from the best drawings that could be procured , as well English and French , as American . In this design , I have been specially aided by a series of manuscript drawings in the possession of General Lafayette , which were taken by a French engineer attached to his staff , and which are executed with scientific accuracy and beauty . Some of the old drawings , published at the time in London from imperfect sketches and surveys , I have been able to correct by the documents , to which I have had access , and by actual inspection , having personally visited nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief operations of the American Revolutionary war . No pains have been spare ( I to give these plans all the accuracy , of which // they are susceptible on so small a scale , and with the present means of information . ' We have thought it due to the huportance of the publication now before us , which we consider as being , in the proper and best sense of the word , a truly national work , to present to our readers somewhat in detail , and , to a considerable extent , in the language of the Editor , an account of the materials from which the collection has been drawn , and of the principles upon which it is to be conducted . Our preceding remarks and extracts apply equally to all the portions of the work . Of the two volumes immediately before us , the second , which is the third of the work , comprehends the commencement of the correspondence and documents relating to the Revolutionary war , and will come more naturally under review in connexion with the subsequent volumes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore confine the farther remarks which we have to offer on the present occasion , to the first of the two volumes before us , being the second of the work , which composes of itself the First Part of the entire correspondence , and covers the period in the life of Washington preceding the Revolutionary war . Although the contents of this volume , considered as materials for the future historian , are less important than those of the following ones , we look upon it , nevertheless , as one of the most curious and interesting portions of the collection . It exhibits the forniation and gra ( lual development of the character of Washington ; and solves in a satisfactory manner the problem , which has hitherto appeared to most persons a very difficult one ,  --  how a country gentleman . exclusively devoted to agricultural and civil pursuits , on being called to direct the military operations of a great confe ( leracy , extending over half the continent , should have exhibited , in all the departments of his new vocation , froni the largest plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp , not only the talent and courage which might be regarded as original gifts of nature , hut the self-possession , judgment , accuracy and familiarity with details of an experienced commander . We now see , what was known in general before , but had not yet been brought home to the mind of the public , in such a way as to be fully realized , that Washington han served a regular lapPrel-I iceship to the cyeat. em h ) loyInent of his mature life , during the // old French war . In the operations of that , as far as Virginia was concerned , disastrous contest , he took throughout an active part , and commanded in chief , for several years , the troops of his native Commonwealth , though at that time scarcely above the legal age of discretion . in this early rehearsal of the great part which he was afterwards to play , he exhibited already the eminent qualities , which belonged to his character , and produced an impression upon the minds of his countrymen , the depth and extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Davies ; who , with a fortunate and sagacious foresight , that has never been equalled in any other instance , publicly spoke of Col. Washington , as that heroic youth , who seems to have been expressly raised up by Providence , for the purpose of rendering hereafter some signal service to the country . ' We proceed to give , in the language of Mr. Sparks , an account of the contents of the first of the two volumes now before us , and of the sources from which they have been collected . In the method , which has been adopted for the present publication , the First Part consists of letters and papers written before the American Revolution . they relate chiefly to the French War , in which Washington was actively engaged for five years . During a large portion of that time he was cornmnander-in-chief of the Virginia forces , and his corrcspondence in that capacity , both as furnishing historical materials and manifesting the characteristics and resources of his own mind , is curious and valuable . The importance attached to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , many years after the letters were written , he revised the first drafts , and caused them to be carefully recorded in volumes . They have been preserved in this condition . Several of the originals still exist in his own hand*vriting . The same letter-books also contain military orders and reports of courts-martial , with connecting arid explanatory remarks , which appear to have been added at a later date . These records form a complete narrative of the events in which Washington was concerned , from the time he joined General Braddock till he retired from the army . At Braddock 's defeat , Wasl*ington , in common with the cornmander-in-chief and the other officers , lost all his l ) al ) ers , which were taken by the French , sent first to Canada , and thence to France . Among these were contained his official correspondcrice of the preceding year , and a private journal of lime campaign , // important as developing the particulars of his military movements , of the death of Jumonville , and of the affair at the Great Meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaired from other sources . By the courtesy and favor of the British Ministry , I was allowed free access to the archives of the public offices in London , where I found , particularly among the manuscripts in the office of the Board of Trade , several valuable documents illustrative of these events . Through the politeness of Mr. Lockhart , I was also made acquainted with the existence of Governor Dinwiddie 's letter-books , and a collection of Washington 's early letters , in the possession of Mr. Hamilton of London , who very obligingly permitted them to be copied for my use . The file of Washington 's letters contained the originals written to Governor Dinwiddie , describing all his military transactions previous to Braddock 's defeat , and of course filled up the chasm occasioned by the loss of his papers in that disastrous battle . In the library of the War Department at Paris , I had moreover the good fortune to find some original papers respecting the operations of the French , on the frontiers of Virginia , during the time of Washington 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many particulars , in addition to these materials , have bee nderived from the military and other letters , official and private , which were received by Washington in the time of the war , and were preserved at Mount Vernon . These have served to shed much light upon his own writings , by contributing matter for brief notes , and more full explanations in the Appendix . For this object I have likewise consulted such other manuscript authorities as could be obtained , relating to the period in question , and the best printed records and documents , such as the journals of assemblies , statutes at large , proclamations , governors ' messages , and the correspondence of officers high in rank , both military and civil , English and French . It has in all cases been my endeavor to establish facts , as far as possible , by original testimony , and to take nothing at second hand where means existed of ascending to a more authentic source . As this aim has been pursued with a scrupulous care and persevering diligence , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the nature of such inquiries will admit , and that nothing has been passed over , which would serve to illustrate the character of Washington , or explain the transactions in which he took an important part . After he resigned his commission in the army , and retired to his plantation at Mount Vernon , he devoted himself for fif // teen years almost exclusively to his private affairs . lie was usually a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses , but few traces remain of his public acts in that body . A list of the voters at his several elections , denoting the persons for whom they voted , has been preserved , from which it appears , that he was uniformly chosen by a large majority over all his competitors . Two manuscript volumes contain the copies of letters , which were written between the time of his leaving the army and the beginning of the Revolution . They are copied out with peculiar neatness in his own handwriting . As these letters were directed chiefly to his mercantile agents in London , employed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to purchase such as he wanted from that market , they have little in them of public or permanent interest . They show the exactness of method , the unceasing industry , the minuteness of detail , and rigid economy , with which he managed all his affairs , and prosecuted every kind of business he undertook . Political reflections , general remarks , and opinions on higher topics , are occasionally introduced , but these are incidental , few , and brief . From this part of the correspondence such selections have been made , as were suited to the objects of the present work . For many years previous to the Revolution , it was Washington 's custom to keep a diary of some of the principal incidents that occurred within his observation . For this purpose he commonly used an almanac , interleaved with blank paper , and bound in a small volume . He made daily entrances under three heads , namely , first , Where , how , or with whom , my time is spent ; * secondly , Account of the Weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a careful observer of the weather , and almost every night recorded the aspect of the heavens during the preceding day , whether cloudy or fair , the direction of the winds , and temperature . Whenever he left home he carried the interleaved almanac in his pocket , as also another little book , in which he entered daily the amount of money paid out by him , and the specific objects for which it was paid . This habit ceased during the Revolution , but was renewed afterwards . The contents of his diary turned chiefly on agricultural operations and other business concerns . These volumes , kept for a series of years , afford some biographical materials not destitute of interest . ' The above extract gives a complete view of the character of the materials , which compose the body of the volume . The Appendix , consisting of a hundred and thirty pages , contains a number of interesting disquisitions by the Editor , upon seve // ral points of importance in the early history of Washington . The first article in this part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws a good deal of light upon his family connexions and personal adventures at this period of his life ; and also includes several extracts from diaries kept by himself , on a voyage to the Island of Barbadoes , and on some of his excursions for the purpose of surveying , as well as the more formal journal of his expedition across the Aliegany mountains , which were already in print . The second contains a dissertation on the circumstances attending the death of M. de Jumonville , a French officer , who fell in an engagement between a small detachment of troops under his command and an Amencan corps commanded by Washington , during the war of E156 . The proceedings of Washington in this affair were represented at the time , in France , as not in conformity to the rules of honorable warfare . This charge had been refuted hy Washington himself , in a letter written to a friend , who requested information on the subject , and is now disproved by Mr. Sparks at greater length , and in a very satisfactory manner . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively to remarks on the hattie at the Great Meadows , and on Braddock 's defeat ;  --  the rest are shorter , and of a more miscellaneous character , but are full of valuable information , and do great credit to the judgment and industry of the Editor . The shorter notes at the bottom are uniformly drawn from authentic , and , in general , before unexplored sources , and throw a useful light upon the corresponding passages in the text . It is not our intention on the present occasion to make any remarks , in a formal way , on the life and character of Washington . Any suggestions of this kind , which might occur to us , would appear with more propriety in connexion with a notice of the volume of the collection devoted to his biography . In the few pages which now remain to us , we shall cursorily advert to some of the more interesting topics , that are treated upon in the volume now before us . The education of Washington , though generally , and doubtless in some respects justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears , on the contrary , to have been conducted with great care and good judgment . We doubt whether , for the practical purposes of life , and for the particular course on which he was destined to enter , he could possibly have received a better one . He enjoyed the inestimable benefit of // passing his youth in the healthy atmosphere of home : - * - -  his attention was directed to studies of substantial rather than ideal importance , and his morals and manners were apparently the objects of earnest solicitude . His earliest papers consist of exercises in arithmetic , geometry , *nd surveying , executed with great neatness and accuracy . In a book , dated when he was thirteen years old , there is a manuscript , occupying thirty folio pages , entitled Forms of Writing , consisting of models for papers to be used in the transaction of business , such as a note of hand , a bill of exchange , a bond , an indenture , a lease , and a will . In the same book there is another curious article , entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , containing one hundred and ten maxims of this description , carefully written out , and numbered . The source from which they were derived is not known , but as they exhibit a maturity both of thought and language much beyond the age of Washington at that time , and are not to be found in print , they were doubtless collected for his use by some intelligent and judicious friend . We regret that Mr. Sparks did not publish the whole of these rules , from which he has given a selection only . They are particularly interesting , from the bearing they doubtless had on the formation of the character of Washington , and , as far as they are given , they seem to us to furnish a very well-executed code of the minor morals of social life , which the circumstances of its origin should strongly recommend to the attention and observation of the American people . We would respectfully suggest to the Editor the expediency of inserting the entire paper , in some future volume of the collection . We copy the portion which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in company ought to be with some sign of respect to those present . 2 .

Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire , called conscience . ' Washington was the third son of Augustine Washington , wh*o was twice married , first to Jane Butler , and afterwards to Mary Ball . The fruit of the first marriage was three sons and a daughter , and of the second four sons and two daughters . The eldest son by the first marriage was called Butler , and died young . The second , named Lawrence , was born about the year 1718 , and was consequently fourteen years older than George , who was but the eldest son of the second marriage , and was born in 1732 . Lawrence was a captain in the British army , and served in the unfortunate expedition which was fitted out against Porto Bello , under Admiral Vernon , in the year 1741 . On the death of his father , in 1743 , he came into the possession of the family property , and retired from the army ; soon after which he purchased the estate on the banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vernon , in honor of the Admiral . At his death the family estate devolved upon George , who was at that time probably the oldest son living , although no particulars are given of the death of the third son by the first marriage . Until this , Washington had probably little or no property , either in possession or expectation , and he seems very early to have turned his attention to the public service of the country , as his occupation . At the age of fourteen , he obtained , on the application of his brother Lawrence , a midshipman 's warrant ; but his mother , though she at one time reluctantly gave her consent to his entrance into this line of life , was never fully reconciled to the plan , and in consequence of her objection it was finally abandoned . At the age of sixteen , he appears to have taken up the employment of a surveyor of lands , and for the next three years was wholly occupied in this way . The field of his operations was on the Allegany mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The country was an entire wilderness , and the labor of surveying was so severe , that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time . His home was with his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon , although lie sometimes resided with his mother at Fredericksburg . On these excursions he usually kept diaries , some extracts from which are given by Mr. Sparks , and show that at that early age he had already acquired a great maturity of thought and // style . in a letter written in one of these professional excursions , from the house of Lord Fairfax , then an inhahitant of Virginia , the young hero speaks with some warmth of the personal attractions of a young lady residing in his Lordship 's family , but intimates that he was protected from the influence of her charms by a predisposition in favor of a certain Lowland beauty , ' whose name and history seem to be now unknown . However narrow a field the occupation of a surveyor , had he continued to pursue it through life , would have afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowments of Washington , it is hardly possible to imagine , that he could have passed the period , which he devoted to it , in a manner more favorable to his physical development and to the formation of his character with reference to his future course . It is probable , that after his intention of entering the naval service was abandoned , he looked to the army as his ultimate resort , and that he took up the employment of a surveyor as a temporary occupation , and a useful course of discipline . We find , accordingly , that , at the age of nineteen , he obtained , probably through the influence of his brother , an appointment as one of the adjutants general of Virginia , with the rank of Major . During the same year he accompanied his brother Lawrence , whose health was then rapidly declining , and who died the next year , on a voyage to the island of Barbadoes . Some interesting extracts are given from the diary kept during this voyage . The next year Lieutenant Governor Dinwiddie , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts , assigning to each an adjutant , and in November , 1753 , the appointment of Washington was renewed for the northern district . About the same time he was despatched on the mission to the commander of the French forces on the Ohio , which gave occasion to his first conspicuous appearance on the stage of public life . The journal of this expedition was published at the time in England , and has been often reprinted in America . It does the highest credit in every respect to his character , both intellectual and moral . The instructions given to him by Lieutenant Governor Dinwiddie , and the correspondence of the latter with the British ministry , after the return of Washington , expressing strong approbation of the manner in which he had executed his commission , are now published for the first time from the Dinwiddie manuscripts . // Soon after the return of Washington from this expedition , the Governor and Council determined to enlist two volunteer companies of a hundred men each , to be employed in constructing a fort on the Ohio River , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , who was stationed at Alexandria , and retained his former rank of Major . The first letters in the collection before us are written from that place , on the subject of this expedition . The Assembly afterwards enlarged the force to be employed to three hundred men , divided into six companies ; the chief command was 6iven to Colonel J. Fry , and Washington was second , with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel . On the 2d of April he marched from Alexandria with two companies ; and on the 20th arrived at Will 's Creek . Another division of the little army , which had preceded him , under Captain Trent , and taken up a position at the fork of the Allegany and Monongahela rivers , now Pittsburg , had been attacked by the French and compelled to surrender . This was the first act of open hostility that occurred in the memorable war , commonly called that of 1756 . On the death of Colonel Fry , about the first of June , Washington took the temporary command of the expedition ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post , he was advanced to the command of the Virginia regiment . In the correspondence belonging to this period , he adverts to the affair of M. de Jumonville , and to the battle of the Great Meadows , both of which , as we have remarked , are illustrated at considerable length in the Appendix . The projected expedition across the mountains was found impracticable ; but the Assembly , in October of the same year , voted to raise ten companies of a hundred men each , and in order to avoid the difficulties respecting rank , which had occurred between the royal and colonial officers , they determined that the companies should be all considered independent of each other , and that there should be no colonial officer of higher rank than captain . Washington , who already held the rank of colonel , declined of course to remain under the new organization , and resigned his commission . But his reputation was already so high , that his presence was regarded as important , if not essential , and on the arrival of General Braddock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to avoid any difficulty on the score of rank , he invited Washington to accompany him as his aid , with a Colonel 's commission . The // following letters are occupied with details of the events of the disastrous expedition , that terminated in Braddock 's defeat ; of which a long and interesting account is given by Mr. Sparks in the Appendix . It was immediately after this action , that President Davies , then a clergyman in Virginia , made use of the remarkable expression , alluded to above . Washington escaped unhurt , though he had two horses shot under him , and received four bullets in his coat . On the 14th of August , he was appointed by the Governor , commander-in-chief of the Virginia forces , which had now been raised to sixteen companies , comprehending in the whole a thousand men , and thus attained , at the early age of twenty-three , by the mere force of his own courage and conduct , the same respectable and elevated station , though on a smaller theatre , which he filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ondence as commander-in chieg principally with the Governor , extends through the next three years , and occupies the greater part of the volnine . At the close of the year 1758 , he retired from the army , and took his seat in the House of Burgesses , of which he had recently been elected a member . rrhe great satisfaction which he had given to the troops under his command , and to the public at lar6e , is evinced by the address of the officers , now first published , and by the interesting scene which occurred in the House of Burgesses , upon his taking his seat . It is related by Mr. Wirt , on the authority of Edmund Randolph , in the following terms . As soon as Colonel Washington took his seat iii the Assembly , Mr. Robinson , the speaker , in obedience to an order of the House , and following the impulse of his own generous and grateful heart , discharged the duty with great dignity , but with such warmth of coloring and strength of expression , as entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his acknowledgements for the honor , but such was his trepidation and confusion , that he could not give distinct utterance to a syllable . He blushed , stammered , and trembled for a second , when the Speaker relieved him by a stroke of address , that would have done honor to Louis the Fourteenth in his proudest and happiest moment . " Sitdown , Mr. Washington , said he , with a conciliating smile , " your modesty is equal to your valor , and that is saying more for it than I could possibly express in any other language . " The concluding part of the collection is composed of a few private letters , written from Mount Vernon , during the inter VOL . NXxIx. - NO. 85. 63 // val between the retirement of Washington from the army and the opening of the Revolutionary War . We deem it unnecessary to make any extracts from the correspondence , as specimens of its style or substantial character . It is more valuable as materials for history , and as illustrating the character of the writer , than from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general to matters of mere detail . It has all the prominent qualities of the subsequent revolutionary correspondence , and exhibits a complete maturity of mind , as well as style . The latter was probably somewhat improved by revision at a later period of life . With cordial thanks to the Editor , for his indefatigable and well-directed labors , we take our leave , for the present , of this collection , to which we shall probably take occasion to invite the attention of our readers again ,  --  perhaps more than once ,  --  before its final completion.
