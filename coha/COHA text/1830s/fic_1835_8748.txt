" A prudent man forseeth the evil , and hideth himself ; but the simple pass on , and are punished . " Proverbs xxvii , 12 . PREFACE . I do not undertake this work , thinking to gain fame or applause ; to the contrary , I know that the greater part will ridicule me , and say , " What a vile wretch ! " I have been so , am I so now ? who knows ? The Power , the Word , and the Spirit ; three witnesses : that 's enough , if I was to add another , ( myself ) perhaps you might doubt whether it was truth . Some will understand , and not condemn ; let others consider lest they also be tempted . If I do n't get fame and applause , I am in hopes of getting a few shillings , or dimes , or cents . I have buffeted the boisterous ocean twenty-two years , commencing when I was ten years of age ; and many a long year have suffered the penalty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the just wrath and indignation of Him , who too well knows that I write true . I do wish that some human beings who are careless about their present and eternal welfare , may take warning , and be benefited . Although you may not have run to the same excess of rioting as I have , yet you are under condemnation , except you abase yourselves , and exalt the Lord Jesus continually . What I have here related , I have seen with my own eyes , and proved by woful experience . I could say much more , and relate from hearsay , many , and greater cruelties . But these facts are sufficient to show the tyranny and brutality of unprincipled men , when " clothed with a little brief authority : " and to show the salutary effects of Christianity , as exemplified in the character of the Hon. Judge Powers , and other worthy keepers at Auburn . It is represented in a dialogue , because I was three years in Auburn , previous to my going to Singsing ; the reason of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , I returned to my sister 's in Saratoga ; and finding her , with several children , in extreme want , through the misconduct of an intemperate husband , and being also intemperate myself , resolved to overcome evil with evil . Therefore , thinking to relieve their wants , feloniously took some articles not belonging to myself , for which I was apprehended , and sent to Auburn for the time above mentioned . Main text Scene In a dialogue between two discharged convicts ; one from the State Prison at Singsing , and the other from Auburn . Scene on board a Steam Vessel on the North River . Singsing and Auburn . Auburn . Auburn Well messmate , how goes it ? you look very dull . Singsing . Singsing The boat goes well enough , but I must confess that I do feel very dull . Auburn . Auburn Hav'nt you and I been shipmates somewhere ? Singsing . Singsing I think I 've seen you before . Auburn . Auburn Was'nt you on Lake Champlain last war ? Singsing . Singsing Now I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auburn . Auburn I do middling well now , but I 've had hard times since I saw you last . Singsing . Singsing And so have I , and not long since neither . Auburn . Auburn Why , what 's been the matter ? you look more shabby than over I saw you before . Singsing . Singsing Did you take notice of that big house where all them poor fellows with striped clothes were at work ? Auburn . Auburn Alas ! poor fellow , how long was you there ? Singsing . Singsing Two years . Auburn . Auburn How did they use you there ? Singsing . Singsing We were all very apt to cry out with one in very ancient times , " my punishment is more than I can bear . " But I tell you of a truth , I was almost in despair all the time I was in that place . Auburn . Auburn I know what it is , messmate , I was three years in Auburn . Singsing . Singsing You was ! what for ? I never should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never should have thought it of myself , if I had not got there . I tell you that while we are giving full scope to our foolish , and deceitful , and desperately wicked hearts , fulfilling the lusts of the flesh , not caring how , we know not where we are going ; till by being led captive by the devil at his will , he leads us into a scrape , and there he leaves us : he never bails us out , or pays the penalty . Singsing . Singsing I know that too well , by experience ; but do you think you will serve that old hard master any more ? Auburn . Auburn I know I never shall . Singsing . Singsing Beware of self-sufficiency , the great High King of spirits deals mysteriously with those that feel so confident in their own strength ; and he sees that they are building on a false foundation , he throws the whole fabric of works down , and leaves the man in a worse condition than he ever was . I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going on in formal religion : I thought I was strong , but he let me know that I was weak , by bringing me into sore affliction of a long continuance . The story is this ; about nine years ago I cut up a dirty caper in New London , and got put in jail ; and there was a fellow put in with me , a very unreasonable disagreeable person ; and he aggravated me three or four days , but mostly nights ; for he would not let me sleep . So just at daylight one morning , he waked me out of a dose , and I sprung up , and catched up a bench , and hit him over the head , and very near killed him . He halloo 'd murder , and the jailor , and many other people came into the prison . And now you must know the devil had got me into a scrape , and left me . I denied what I had done , saying that he fell over the stove . He told his story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dungeon . The women said he would die , and could not live . What think you must have been the situation of my mind , then in a dungeon , and a murderer ? We are brave to extreme , ( sailors in general ) even in approaching danger , when there is the smallest hope ; but let it come upon us so as we can see no hope , and then if we are spared long enough , how soon it will be " Lord have mercy upon my poor soul . " That was my prayer , for I could see no hope ; die he would , I thought , and hang I must ; so I walked back and forth in the dungeon , and all I could say , was , " Lord have mercy on my poor soul , Lord have mercy on my poor soul ; " and he heard me ; the man got better , and I was bound over to the superior court , under five hundred dollars bonds ; but having no friend to be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eleven days ; during which time I broke off many wicked and idle habits , going on strictly in formal religion . Through his having a bad character , and my morality , when the court set , they let me go . Now when I got my liberty , I thought I had a good heart , and like the Laodiceans , thought I was rich in spiritual goods ; but soon found out that the seed was sown by the way side . One day I met a man that I knew , and he , perceiving I appeared to be very religious , says to me , " do you think that your religion is good for any thing ? " " O yes , " says I , " I know it is . " But not long after , I was tempted by a drinking , lewd woman ; and I complied with the temptation , and then , you see , God gave me over to a reprobate mind , to do those things that were " not convenient , " for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought me through it , for which I feel thankful . There is no way to get along in the religion of our Redeemer , but to feel our nothingness , and exalt him , and follow his example . Auburn . Auburn " But how did you get into trouble again ? " Singsing . Singsing If I tell you all the particulars , will you in return tell me how you got to Auburn , and how they used you there ? Auburn . Auburn I will , and I want to know how you was used too ? Singsing . Singsing As soon as I had complied with the temptation before mentioned , I went on from bad to worse , stealing and drinking . They caught me in a little dirty trick in New London , butthey had compassion on me , and sentenced me only a fortnight to the Work-house ; but I got away the first night , and started off into the country . I still often had serious thoughts about my lost religion ; and I thought if I could get a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to go on in the good old way ; accordingly I went to a place to get work ; there I fell in with a young woman , and after a very short courtship , got married , but soon found out I had missed the mark of happiness , by forgetting to walk in the Spirit , and that I should not fulfil the lusts of the flesh . I was poor in health , and in circumstances , getting but little work ; and at first , though my wife drank to excess , I did not give way to it , but at last , being enticed , I took a little , and that opened the door for much more , and greater folly . Auburn . Auburn But did you not know that she would use strong drink before you married her ? Singsing . Singsing Yes , I knew that she had been subject to dissipation , but she had walked soberly some time , and said she had seen the folly of it ; and , as I thought , she was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived me , for I thought I was good enough to bring her over to righteousness . Never did a man come nearer to the transgression of Adam , than I ; she says to me , " I would not be so odd among folks , the family have all drank a little this morning ; take a little , it wo n't hurt you . " Alas ! I yielded ; but wo was with me ; for I took to strong drink from that time : but it was not long before I got where I could get no more for a couple of years ; and since I got out , the goodness and mercy of God has kept me from it . Auburn . Auburn But what was your crime , that sent you to Singsing ? Singsing . Singsing It was not one , but many . If the authority had known what a bad fellow I was , they would not have given me so light a sentence . In the first place , I was unwell , and scarcely able to work ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; and if I earned a shilling , my wife wanted two ; and I was very anxious to get things to keep house with , so that I coveted almost every thing that I saw . At last I began to hook things , at one place and another . One night I was bringing along a parcel of things , and as the stage came in very late , the driver saw me , and halloo 'd " watch here 's a thief . " No watchman heard him , and I went on boldly . This made me more bold afterwards . But you know though a rogue runs clear a long time , yet he gets catched at last . How glad I am that I got caught . Supposing the Lord had cut me down in my wickedness , I should never have had that blessed hope that I have now . All this time I kept a little bottle , and when it was empty , I would think , " well , now I will quit this hellish practice of drinking , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prospect of something to steal , I would go and get another pint , and resolve that that should be the last . Many times I have had such horror of conscience , that I have poured what I had in the bottle into the fire , with a firm resolution to quit ; but , according to the old proverb , " I will seek it yet again , " but still again with morning light pursue the road to ruin . At last , one night I was groggy , and broke into a dye shop , and lugged off a lot of clothes ; and the same night I went into a house yard , and carried off a feather bed . Thinks I , I 'll get ready to go to keeping house by and by ; but the bed was what brought me out , for I being two thirds drunk , left it hanging on the fence , where I hired a room up stairs ; and the woman of the house got up before I did in the morning ; " ha ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize on the fence . " I heard her , and went out and owned it ; says I , " I forgot to fetch it in last night . " " Ah , ha , " says she , " you stole it , I know that bed , it is the bed that Mr.  --  lay sick on . " I was so frightened that I knew not where to fly . If I had stood my ground , and carried the bed up stairs , she would have known nothing about it . Here you see how weak a guilty conscience is ; " One shall chace a thousand , and two shall put ten thousand to flight . " I had chance enough to get away ; but it was not to be so : I had run my race , and had made work enough for repentance . I was apprehended and sent to jail half drunk . But Oh ! when I had taken a knap on the floor , and awoke up sober , then began my repentance ; and how thankful I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe is unto Life . Reader , I hardly think you have been so vile as I have been , but remember you are a sinner , and have need of that " godly sorrow which worketh Life . " The next day I was taken to be tried by a justice 's court ; and they favoured me , not making the amount of the things I had stolen , over twenty-five dollars : and so sentenced me ninety days to jail . Then my heart rejoiced , at the thought of avoiding the State Prison . But alas ! my rejoicing was short ; the high sheriff did not recognize me to be an old offender at first , but he soon perceived that I had been sentenced there forty days before ; and that was not the worst of it : the next night , after I got to bed , the doors were opened , and I was called out before a justice and another man who I had injured , but I knew him not . The justice asked me where I got that leather that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and told him I got it down below there , out of a currying shop . He told me that would do ; and then he went to writing for half an hour . Oh ' how miserable I felt all the time he was writing . " Down the river I must go , " says I ; " shall I have to go to States Prison ? " " Do n't you think you deserve it ? " replied the justice . I never felt such horrors of a guilty conscience before ; even when in a dungeon as a murderer . Had I possessed worlds , I would have given them all , to have had them fall on me : the wrath of an injured , good , and merciful God , stared me in the face . Added to this , the fear of punishment , now already begun , and the fear of justly deserved eternal punishment ; the lash was severe : I resolved on a plan which was also severe ; my mind was in a continual frame of prayer . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easy in my mind . Auburn . Auburn What plan was it that was so severe ? Singsing . Singsing Look at the 19th chapter of Matthew , and 12th verse , the one for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . Auburn . Auburn Wonderful ! shocking ! But are you sure you did it for the kingdom of heaven 's sake , or was it only to escape punishment in this world ? God can not be deceived , and will not be mocked . Singsing . Singsing I must own that it was a complicated fear , but all the time I had it in my mind to do it , and all the time I did it , I had my mind drawn out in a frame of prayer , that it might be the means of lifting me above the cares of this world ; and in a great measure it has . All I am sorry about it , is , that I did not do it twenty years before . What a blessing it has been to me already : I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years , whereas I only got two ; and now , while others , no worse than I have been , are drudging out a long sentence , I am enjoying freedom , and the good of the land . Oh ! my Father in heaven , may I be thankful to Thee every moment . Secured from the strongest allurement to sin , I find in all places my heaven begin . Auburn . Auburn But your rasisting temptations will not have the same value as if you had not done this thing . Singsing . Singsing But I have resisted unto blood , striving against sin , and as I am resolved to wage a war with it , looking to Jesus for grace , redeeming the time , running with patience the race that is set before me , I am in hopes to gain the much desired haven at last . " To patient faith the prize is sure , And all that to the end endure The cross , shall wear the crown . " Look at the 56th chapter of Isaiah , 4th and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon condition of doing those things that please Him , and keeping his Sabbaths . Auburn . Auburn Well , let us know how you fared at Singsing , for I have heard that it is a hard place : I thought Auburn was bad enough , but I hear that Singsing is ten times worse . Singsing . Singsing When I got there it was Sunday , about noon ; rattletebang went the doors , and they shoved me into a little hole with a bit of bran bread , and a small piece of shank beef , and a few cold potatoes , there was a board and a blanket to lie on , and a tub that answered for table , chair , and privy ; all that I could see else was stone and iron . What a horrid situation ! the fruits of sin . The next morning I was taken out and stripped naked , and obliged to get into a large tub of cold water , for the pretence of washing ; now remember I was very ill , for I had not got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob 's cattle , and sent me off to picking wool ; such flogging I never saw before . I thought I 'd seen enough aboard of a man-of-war , but it was'nt a beginning : the name of the keeper of the shop where I was , was Burr , and he was about as ugly to handle poor fellows , as a chesnut burr would be to handle . Auburn . Auburn O , I know that fellow , he was turned away from Auburn for his cruelty . I have heard that when any keeper gets turned away from Auburn , if he goes to Singsing , they 'll employ him right off . Singsing . Singsing The Lord makes the wicked his sword to execute his judgments upon others , often not so wicked as themselves . Auburn . Auburn For my part I never had cause , nor inclination , to find fault with any keeper while I was in Auburn . The rules of the prison were very strict , yet there was not much flogging . Once I got a light touch of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved it , because I was so foolish as to get into a fair conversation with a fellow that sat next to me ; and I was strictly forbidden to speak to any prisoner . The keeper seemed very loth to do it , " but , " says he , " it is your own fault ; " and I did not blame him . Singsing . Singsing Ah , there 's a great difference when men take delight in heathenish humanity , or Christian humanity . So , as I was telling you , after a few days the keeper set me to cobbling old shoes , and I made a poor fist of it ; and once in a while the tyrant would come behind me , and give me five or six lounders alongside of the head . " O , " says he , " You shall have fair play ; we 'll try you . " The tools I had to work with were very poor ; the fact was , they thought I was a good strong fellow to work among stone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large shadow , but the substance was worn out in the sea service , and taking mercury . Accordingly they turned me out to work among stone ; then I got with a clever keeper , his name was Tompkins , and he put me on a cart with three others , to draw stone to fill up a dock . Oh ! what misery I was in . When I got out in the morning , I would think , how , how , how can I stand it all night ? I prayed all the time , and read my Bible all the chance I could get ; what should I have done if I 'd had no Bible . But I soon got changed for the worse : Mr. Marshal , the assistant keeper , met me one morning , and sent me up on the hill to Mr. Knap , and he sent me after a large sledge , and set me to breaking up rocks , but it was so heavy I could not swing it : then I got it , the keeper would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cudgel every half hour , says he , " I 'll learn you how to act the old soldier . " Oh ! how I longed for night ; and in the morning my bones would ache so I could hardly stir . I weathered it out about a fortnight with Mr. Knap , and then got into worse hands . He was a youngish fop , his name was Lent , he put me to the wheelbarrow , but I believe it was Mr. Wolsey , the head keeper 's orders ; for he seemed to have more compassion than any of the rest , but he let them ( the keepers ) have too much of their own way . That was supposed to be easy work , but I tell you , I never suffered so much in my life as I did during that time ; I had such pains in my bones that I could hardly stir , and if I stopped a moment , even to tie up my shoe , if the keeper saw me I was sure to get a flogging . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was tempted to do it , but thanks be to Him that kept me from it . You know how they have to march , one after another , close together , so as one 's belly touches the other 's back ; and we had a long hill to go down three times a day . I was so lame in my bones I could not steady myself , and I would stagger about and tumble on the others , and then I would get two or three raps over the head with a cudgel . I could not help but cry almost all the time , and the more I cried , the more they beat me . One day as I was crying in my cell , for sorrow , along came Mr. Half a keeper , and with a jeering laugh , says he to me , " What are you laughing about ? " I gave him no answer , and he went off . I was so hungry that I would watch every chance I could get , to pull up some grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , and there was enough others did so too , while the assistant keeper was selling barrels of provision for swill . I 'll tell one of his zealous tricks ; I was in a habit of applying to the doctor now and then , and that made Mr. Marshal very angry ; one day as I was in the hospital , he came up to me , and found two potatoes , and a little bit of bread , in the lining of my coat ; he made me come down and strip off my shirt , and he made a short prayer before he flogged me ; says he , " I wish the Lord would take you out of the world . " But the Lord did not answer his prayer the way he wanted him to ; but came very near putting it on his own head ; for not long after that , he had a fit of sickness ; and I heard that he was glad to send for a minister to pray for him . I prevailed on the doctor to grant me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook to give it to me ; so he had to give me something : accordingly , when I went into my cell to dinner , I found a little tub with about a pint of burnt boiled rye coffee-grounds : I was glad of it , I had it every day but Sundays , for about six weeks , and I was sorry when they stopped it . Auburn . Auburn I perceive that I have been in paradise , when I hear your story . But did not the prisoners eat all in a room together , prepared for the purpose ? Singsing . Singsing O no , we eat in our cells . As we passed in , in rotation to the prison , we passed close to the kitchen , and there is a hole in the wall , and a roller fixed to set the little tubs on ; and a man turns a wheel , and each one catches his tub off as they shove them out ; the keeper over the cooks stands there very handy by , and if any prisoner takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) he gets a rap or two with a cudgel . Sometimes a prisoner gets a tub with no meat in it , sometimes no bread , or very little ; sometimes , may-be , one or two potatoes , which very often happens , through the neglect of the cooks ; yet if he looks to the keeper to be righted , chance if he do nt get a rap or two with his cudgel . Auburn . Auburn What do you mean by their cudgels ? our keepers in Auburn carried nothing but a little switch . Singsing . Singsing Our keepers used to carry quite large clubs . There were so many heads cut open , and so many bloody faces , when spectators came along , that I suppose they got ashamed of it . I got my head cut shockingly , twice . One time there was about twenty men loading a very large stone on the truck ; I had a crowbar , but the men 's legs were so close together , I could not get it under the stone , and Mr. Haff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar was not under , and he sprung at me , and O what a beating I got ; the blood ran to the ground . After that , I perceived that the keepers did not carry clubs , but something full as bad , a piece of hard wood about two feet long , and two inches wide , and three quarters of an inch thick ; the corners were sharp , and they 'd cut a fellow 's head open quicker . This they carried as a rule , to measure stone with : ( any way to blind the eyes of the humane public . ) Auburn . Auburn Well it serves us right ; for my part I know that I deserved punishment , for I did contrary to a better understanding . How shall I escape eternal punishment ? it seems that I have gone so far in the broad road , that I can never get into the narrow road again . Singsing . Singsing Are you not willing ? that shows plainly that you can . What said the Lord to the ruler whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things are possible to him that believeth ; " But prove your faith by works , according to the gospel plan , " for the end of the commandment is charity , out of a pure heart , and of a good conscience , and of faith unfeigned . " How can a man have a pure heart except the holy spirit cleanse it ? Read the Bible diligently and prayerfully , and follow its directions , confessing and forsaking your sins ; the Lord is " faithful and just to forgive us our sins ; " and let us be humble in heart and soul , and be sure we shall receive the spirit of truth , which shall guide us into all truth ; and if we watch the operations of that spirit which works internally on the heart , and follow its directions , we shall undoubtedly have a good conscience , and that " faith which worketh by love , and purifies the heart , and gives us the victory over sin , death , and the grave . " Auburn . Auburn But how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for St. Paul says that " no man can say that Jesus is the Lord , but by the Holy Ghost . " Singsing . Singsing Search the Scriptures , seek to receive the truth of them , and pray to God to reveal his Son to you , and above all remember , that by doing the will of God the doctrine of his Son shall be revealed to you . St. John 's gospel , chap . vii. , ver . 16 . " Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his ways ? by taking heed thereto according to thy word . " Psalm cxix. 9 . " No good thing will be withheld from them that walk uprightly . " It is utterly impossible for man to describe the feelings a soul has , effectually wrought upon by the Holy Spirit ; our Lord could not do it by example nor precept , nor by all the wonderful miracles he wrought before the apostles ' eyes . But he says " It is expedient for you that I go away , for if I go not away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I depart I will send him unto you . " John xvi . 7 . " And again , I have many things to say to you yet , but ye can not bear them now , howbeit , when the spirit of truth is come he shall guide you into all truth . " John xvi . 12 , 13 . My telling you , or if the apostle John was personally here present , and was to tell you that God is love , you might believe it , but that would not be the cause of your feelings , it might be the means , but God himself must be the cause . Auburn . Auburn Well , I have read my bible through seven times , and it seems all very good , but when I come to St. John 's gospel , and his epistles , there is so much about love in his writing , they seem insipid to me . Singsing . Singsing You may read them as long as you live , and as long as you are carnally minded they will seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enmity against God ? for it is not subject to the will of God , neither indeed can be . But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God , for they are foolishness to him , neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned . " Cor. ii . 14 , " Let us humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God , and he will exalt us in due time . " Auburn . Auburn Was there many died while you was in Singsing prison ? Singsing . Singsing Yes , with the cholera , I believe about one hundred and fifty ; I counted nine , and seven , and five or six a day , for a fortnight . It was shocking to see the poor fellows carried along to their graves , and to see them taken two or three of a day right along-side of me , and in the night to be awakened five or eight times , by the hammer nailing up coffins ; it was a dismal sound in their cells , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how they rap with their spoons on the door , when they want a keeper , ) and groaning when they were taken , how awful a sound ! I believe there was some died before the keeper could get to their assistance . Auburn . Auburn Was you not much alarmed about yourself ? Singsing . Singsing I do n't know that I was . The reason I was not so much alarmed as I think I ought to have been , was because I felt perfectly reconciled to my lot , I do n't remember that I had any anxious desire to come out into the world again , yet I would rather have died than to remain there ; for I was much dissatisfied with my scanty allowance of victuals , yet I do n't believe my belly was my god , for I felt reconciled to the will of the God of heaven . But I did not feel the necessity of being starved to death . When the cholera began to sage in the prison , we were kept in from work , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The head keeper came in with a very important air , and said to the prisoners , " Your rations will be cut short , you will get no meat to-day ; we 'll stop the disease where it is . " But God had determined otherwise , yet the green bay tree continued to flourish . I read much the 91st Psalm during the cholera , and I do n't know that ever I felt less concerned about death in my life . Poor old fellow ! there was an old man that turned grindstone , and he was a very wicked man , he was taken , one day , not more than a foot from me , and he squatted down all at once , and looked up very pitifully to the keeper , and said , " I am very sick . " " Go to the hospital then , " said the keeper ; and that 's the last I saw of him . The old saying is , " one 's meat is the other 's poison , " but here it is reversed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I had it easy the rest of my imprisonment , through his death , for I got his place to turn grindstone . Then I remembered what an old negro told me when I was about ten years old , in New-York . " Boy , " said he , " if you look for pleasure , you bring you self to de grindstone . " How droll that I should be so glad to get to it . During the cholera I got my head cut open again by Mr. Haff , the keeper ; I believe he was an intemperate man , for he showed it by his actions , and when I was near him , I thought I could smell it pretty strong too . One morning we had been out to empty our tubs , and I was the leader of the company , and Mr. Haff stood some fifteen or twenty rods off , and he beckoned which way he wanted me to go ; but as there was another company between him and me , and I being near sighted , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his cudgel over my head , and the blood ran freely again . Some time before the cholera , the company I belonged to was opening a new quarry , and making a road down the hill to the prison . I , with my wheelbarrow , was wheeling dirt and stone down on the road , in as much misery as I could move , with grunting and groaning ; Oh what would I have given for fifteen minutes , yea , five minutes respite , it seemed as if I must give it up every moment . In my severest agony the head keeper came along , and he heard me groaning , and he had compassion on me , and told me to ask Mr. Haff to put me to shoveling . I blessed the Lord for that respite , but it did not last long ; I expect Mr. Marshal told Mr. Haff to put me back to the wheelbarrow again . How different ! the cholera , which put an end to the earthly troubles of so many of my fellow prisoners , and accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to the chief of my troubles , and gave me occasion and time to reflect , and to extol and praise the God of Heaven for his long suffering , and merciful dealings towards me . How shall I humble myself enough ? How shall I praise him enough ? How shall I adore him enough ? How shall I love him enough ? Here Lord I give myself to thee , ' t is all that I can do . Now , after I got to turning grindstone , I had to go about a quarter of a mile from the quarry to the prison , three or four times a day , to the blacksmith 's shop , with tools , to get them sharpened , and there 's a small building on the way , where Mr. Marshal deposits provisions to sell for swill . As I was going up the hill one morning , as the sentry turned his back to walk from me , I slipped into the swill house , and filled my cap and my bosom with good pieces of pork , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught I should have been flogged severely ; then I lived well for three or four days : but I was obliged to carry it about me , for the deputy keeper was searching the cells and tubs , and every where , and if he could find the smallest bit of bread , or a potatoe , he would flog the fellow that he supposed had hid it . Auburn . Auburn That was large business ; the state paid him well for it , I suppose . Singsing . Singsing You are right , but how dear it costs the poor prisoners . I do not say all , for there were many poor puny creatures , such as tailors , shoemakers , weavers , and woolpikers , and they made them their rule , and cut the others short , because some had not much appetite . Sometimes those poor fellows would get a chance to give some of their victuals to another , or another would take it out of their tub , passing along on the galleries , without speaking a word to each other ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Auburn How is it possible there can be so much difference in the rules of two prisons in one state , where the law is the same ? In Auburn the rules are strict , but they are so calculated for the comfort of the prisoners , that very few are disposed to break them . I do n't remember that ever I heard a prisoner say he was hungry while I was there , we all eat in a large room prepared for the purpose ; the tables were furnished with necessary articles , such as plates , knives and forks , spoons , salt and pepper , and a reasonable quantity of wholesome coarse diet . Then there would be two or three half hogshead tubs full of hot soup , and two waiters to every table , to pass back and forward , and if a prisoner held up his right hand , the waiter had to supply him with more of whatever he had a mind to take , if he had it ; and if he held up his left hand , the waiter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the prisoners sitting next each other , by looking towards the keeper , could have any thing they had a mind to . You talk of your plank bed , and your two or three small blankets ! we have in Auburn good canvass hammocks , put nicely on frames , and in the winter four good large thick home-made blankets , and plenty of good stoves , kept well a going in cold weather . But one night we were all , most shockingly alarmed , by the cry of fire , and to our extreme surprise and dread , it was within the prison walls , right close to the windows , where there were , I suppose , one hundred and eighty men locked up in their cells ; an awful situation ! no retreat , and the vivid blazes streaming upon the window sashes ! Oh ! the shrieks and cries were doleful ! it can be better imagined than told ; but the keepers let us out just as the smoke began to fill the cells ; my heart fairly trembled with gratitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a lamentable noise , I did not utter a word : but I walked back and forward in my cell , and said to myself , have I got to be burnt up ? Lord have mercy on me . We worked all-night , with engines , passing along water , and put the fire out . It did some considerable damage ; and when we went in to breakfast , the head keeper , Judge Powers , made a very pleasant speech , in which he thanked the prisoners for their exertions and good behaviour . This Judge Powers was one of the most benevolent and tender-hearted men that ever I saw , for one in authority ; he was elected a member of congress , and when he made his farewell speech , he faltered , his heart was so full he could scarcely speak . " Who  --  who  --  do  --  I  --  leave  --  behind ?  --  Six hundred  --  of  --  my  --  my  --  fellow  --  creatures  --  whom I  --  must meet at the bar of God . I could shake hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Hall ; " and so he did , he went out of the chapel , and as we came down stairs , he shook hands with every one of us ; and he left a humane set of keepers behind him . The deputy was made head keeper , a fine man , as sharp as a hawk . I do like to see good order in any institution ; violaters of any good law ( and we do n't think that many bad laws concerning criminals , is meant to be made in this country , ) ought to be punished promptly , according to that law . But when a man is punished half to death for three potatoes , or a bit of cold mush , or a bit of meat or bread , and that for covetousness sake , because the keeper wants to sell it for swill , to enrich himself , to fill his pockets ; for shame on such work ! What ! pinch a poor miserable afflicted fellow-creature 's belly to show grand in the world ? His gold and silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a witness against him . I suppose that the generality of our law makers think that good Christian keepers would be too favourable to the prisoners ; let no man think so , such ought to have rule over men of this description ; they would be the most likely to keep a clear conscience towards God , and have respect to the laws of their country : for instance , look at the character of Judge Powers as a Christian , and look at the good order of Auburn prison when he left it . Singsing . Singsing Well , if they will shut their eyes against Christianity and humanity both , let them suffer the consequence . I have no doubt but there are many prisoners in Singsing that will stand on sure ground in the great day , while some of the keepers that think they stand firm now , may fall , to rise no more . Auburn . Auburn Did they give you any money when you came out ? and what sort of clothes did they give you ? Singsing . Singsing O yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a suit of old clothes that would scarcely hang together . Auburn . Auburn I fared better than you did then , I got three dollars , and the keeper gave me my pick of all the clothes in the clothes room , to take a suit , and gave me a change of shirts , and waistcoats , and stockings , and handkerchiefs . Singsing . Singsing I think it would be for the credit of the country , to give poor fellows a chance after they have served so long . There are many that are turned out of Singsing so poorly clothed that no one will have them in their houses ; for my part , I had hard work to get a lodging in New-York , and then I got into such a lowlived place , that I got full of German ducks , ( lice ) and when I got out in the country , ( for I could get nothing to do in New-York , the captains of ships that wanted hands would not look at me , ) I was obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed , and strip my shirt off after they all got to bed , and wash it ; till at last I told a young fellow my situation , and he gave me an old shirt that lasted me till I got another . Now what if the authority was to see to it , that poor fellows going out of prison so , were a little better provided for ; if some of them should not make a good use of it , it would not impoverish them , and the Lord would bless them in the deed . But when I consider the dealings of Providence towards me , I should rather be astonished that I have been permitted to pass on in the world not more chastised , than to take it amiss that I have thus been chastened through a life of such repeated , continual , aggravating transgressions and folly ; wherefore am I not consumed ? It is because the Lord 's compassion faileth not , because his mercy has followed me hitherto : and shall I now refuse to tell to all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God forbid ! I confess to the world that I have been worthy of many stripes , but thanks be to his holy name , he has hitherto beaten me with few . O how my heart is drawn out with gratitude to God , when I reflect that in his providence he has kept me from getting rich . When I lived in the East Indies , I had a fair chance to do so , and though it was my foolish wicked heart that kept me from it , yet it is altogether likely that if I had been wise enough to get rich , I should never have been foolish enough to get religion ; for we know that the wisdom of God is folly to the world . Affliction renders the creature tasteless , and the world barren ; and dispels the intoxicating juice of carnal pleasures , and sensual delights ; and brings us to the feet of Jesus . With what propriety I can say with one of old " It is good for me that I have been afflicted , that I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter of religion : but thanks be to God , though my chastoning was not joyous , but grievous , I have been so exercised thereby , that it wrought out the peaceable fruits of righteousness in my soul ; and I know I can say by the Holy Ghost , that Jesus is the Lord . Did not David know this , although he was an Old Testament saint , when he said " It is good for me that I have been afflicted , for before I was afflicted I went astray . " When he said " I hate and abhor every evil way , and thou hast put gladness in my heart more than when their corn and wine increased : " and all his actions showed that he was humbled under the mighty hand of his offended God , with a deep sense of his guilt . He felt that he had offended the mighty God who had exalted him from a shepherd , to be king over his chosen people . Thanks be to God for the wonderful example of mercy exhibited in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what a man bath , and not according to what he hath not , surely David had much to repent of , for he had had much honour given him , and the Lord required deep humility from him , which he was not slack in performing , when he said to Nathan , " I have sinned against the Lord , " and when he confessed before the great congregation to the Lord , " Against thee , thee only have I sinned , and done this evil in thy sight , &c."; Take courage , my soul , and be strong ; and look unto God 's dealings with thee , for his ways can stand the strictest search , as through them all , even in the afflicting hand , Fatherly kindness , and eternal love , shine forth . Now I see what I never saw before , that afflictions sanctified , are indulgencies , and trials the special gifts of Heaven : and I do not wonder that all the saints are , I say not punished , but privileged with them , of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for them accumulate eternal weights of glory in the other world . My not looking into the Divine Wisdom , and to the extent of the promises , has made me have very odd thoughts of afflictions , and conclude them to be the signs of Divine displeasure . I have been ready to question my interest in God , and found it difficult to understand the word of truth . But now I see that though sometimes he sends afflictions to chasten his saints for sin , and curb their carnal afflections , yet at other times he sends them to improve the soul , and exercise every grace in his chosen . Why then do I not , like the great apostle of old , glory in tribulation , which , where grace is in exercise , sets all the wheels of the spirit in motion . Tribulation worketh patience , patience experience , and experience hope ; and hope being no way ashamed to confess her confidence in Him who has shed his love abroad in the heart , by the Holy Ghost , gives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord Jesus came into the world to save sinners , even the chief of sinners ? Not that I would boast of being a sinner , but surely I have been the chief of sinners , the very one whom the Lord came to look after . Who would not rejoice to find an immense treasure which they were looking for ? yea and find it in the possession of their most inveterate enemy , and to recover it , and have it made their own . Just so my soul is of an immense value , and it was in the hands of the great enemy of the Saviour , the devil : and when I felt his galling yoke , and his heavy chain , I used the means the God of glory had prescribed , repentance towards him , and faith in the Lord Jesus , and although the physic was long in operation , at last it worked , and O what joy in heaven ! Christ rejoiced ! the angels rejoiced , and the redeemed in heaven from this earth rejoiced ! and glory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hold out faithful , with what ecstacy shall I rejoice by and by . A little patience , and I am past every one of my troubles , and possessed of all the transports of perpetual day . Whatever is food for the soul , surely affliction is physic . Had I looked a little more towards God , and into myself , it would have been my wisdom , but true wisdom can never shine where saving grace does not dwell . I have been saved from dangers , the relation of which , must astonish ! I am a standing monument of singular mercy . When numbers were dropping down around me , when instruments of death were rattling thick around me , like the hail from the thunder cloud , and falling like drops of rain , I was preserved among the gasping , groaning , and dying . And for a few days since , I have had a kindly remembrance of my singular preservation , and Heaven 's peculiar mercy . But Oh ! the thrilling thought ! how soon have I forgot my kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , but have returned to sin , and proceeded from bad to worse . Had any person been the means of my preservation , I had most likely displayed so much of the grateful man , as never to have forgotten it : but it was God ! and I displayed so much of the sinner , the abandoned sinner , as not to remember it ! never to acknowledge it ! I pursued my sinful practices , as if my life had at first been given and preserved when in danger , for no other purpose . I was an enemy to God , I was hungry , and he has given me bread , I was thirsty and he has given me drink , I was in disease , and he has recovered me , in danger , and he has preserved me : therefore if I continue still his enemy , he will heap coals of fire on my head , while his kindness shall be renowned for ever . When mercies have no effect , judgments shall without fail have most terrible effects at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude write them on my heart for ever . Reader , you may rejoice that you may not have been so desperate a violater of God 's commandments as I have . But I think that I also have great reason to rejoice , not that I have sinned , but that the Lord has not cut me down in my sins . The Lord says , when much is forgiven , they will love much . Now who can doubt the truth of his words ? and if they be true , I think I ought to rejoice ; and I do rejoice ; have I been a great sinner , my Lord is a great Saviour ; he came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . Repentance , what is that ? I can tell you what it is , if you make a wrong calculation in doing some business or other , are you not sorry ? that 's repentance . But that wo n't do , I mean that repentance which makes me rejoice . What ! is it well ? I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation , and I am afraid of hell-fire : well now I am sure that ca n't be it , for that frightens me wonderfully , but have you a heart-felt sorrow for slighting , and forgetting , and abusing , and neglecting to obey the commands of your Creator and your Preserver , who has fed you , and caused the earth to bring forth ? By His power all things that ever you enjoyed , considering that at the same time you were going on in the paths of vice and folly ; this is a repentance , which , though it may slay the natural man , yet it will raise up a spiritual man that shall rejoice as long as he is humble . The labourer gets weary and tired , and wants to rest his weary body , but the harder we work in the spirit ( i.e. ) pray and sing , if we feel a desire in our hearts to serve God , the more we revive . " God is love , " says the sun , " when he sends his illustrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are attached to them , and causes them to reflect light from one to another ; and again he proclaims the same , when he presses his softening rays on our cold frozen earth , after a long winter , and causes it to revive , and to bring forth all manner of food , fruit , and herbs , to sustain every living thing he has created on it . " " God is love , " says the dumb brute , the ox , the horse , the mule , and the ass , when he comes forth with humbleness , to labour under the lash all the day long , and night too , if it is required of him , for the benefit of man ; and what is his reward ? just enough to keep him alive , except the owner wants to fat him to sell : and shocking to mention , I have known many farmers who are too stingy , or lazy , to build shelter to keep their animals from the inclemency of the weather , and still , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In short , we can not open our eyes , but every thing we see proclaims aloud , " God is love ; " and alas ! where is man 's love ? self , self , self , very little of it reaches beyond self . But there are some that love God , and surely they are they that can say , " I am the man that hath seen afflictions by the rod of his wrath , happy is the man whom the Lord chasteneth this side the grave . " Manasseh , all the time he reigned in Judah , though it was a land of light , never knew God till he was taken among the thorns , bound in fetters , and carried to Babylon , where he prayed , was heard , pardoned , and liberated ; and then Manasseh knew that the Lord was God ; just so I never knew God till I was detected , bound in fetters , and laid sore ; and through long continued afflictions my stubborn heart was brought low : yet all these debasing means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . The blessed word of God , the book of inspiration , accompanied with the measure of the same spirit that those had that wrote that book , this was the means of breaking my poor proud heart ; a desirable distress , that discloses and magnifies heavenly excellencies , and diminishes earthly vanities . When much of the world gets into the mind , then little of God is there ; for " if any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him . " Affliction is also a time of solitude for the man that sitteth alone , but God sitteth as a salvatory in the family even in the family of heaven , and comforts them with his own children : in no place better , then , in the profound depth of affliction , does the heir of future glory see the love , the goodness , the mercy , and the wisdom of God ; the excellence of religion , the beauty of divine things , the danger of prosperity , the deceitfulness of riches , the vanity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . I wish I could convince the careless sinner of the great and important means of prayer : there can not be one step taken towards the divine life without prayer ; God says he will be sought unto by the human family for these things : " What things ? " says one . Every thing that we enjoy that has any solid lasting comfort in it , must come from the Father of light : " Ask and ye shall receive , seek and ye shall find . " O comparable privilege , to be allowed to pour out our complaints into the ear of God , to cast our care on him , to plead the performances of the promises , and devolve the burden of our sorrows and necessities on his sympathy and all-sufficiency ! The prayer of faith has won more numerous and more noble victories than all the mighty conquerors , since war was taught among the nations . Prayer is the key of heaven : Elijah prayed , and it was locked ; and again he prayed and it was opened : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any thing but prayer , the ambassador of the renewed soul , the trumpet of faith , the support of the work , the employ of the expectant of glory , and the daily exercise of the Christian . Although it is the duty of a Christian to rejoice in hope , be patient in tribulation , continuing instant in prayer ; yet , sinner , you must begin to pray : you know it is your duty : if you never prayed before , now , before you shut this pamphlet , if you have no disposition , pray God to give you a spirit of prayer . If man never had an inclination to drink strong drink , yet he may get into company where they are drinking , and he may think they feel wonderful well through their jollyness , and be tempted to take a little and the first glass will create a desire for another , and so he goes on till he gets to be a perfect drunkard : just so you may suppose the Christians , when they get together to worship God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must feel well , and so they do ; and although the Spirit does not keep them to such a high degree of animation that causes them to shout glory while they are at their daily business , yet their minds are ( if Christians , ) in a frame of prayer all the day long , and they never get the horrors . The first means of all joy among the spirits of just men made perfect in heaven , was prayer , and although we seem to enjoy many things here on earth , if we do not adore the Giver , and feel continually a thankfulness in our minds , they will be turned into curses , when we are called to render up an account before Him ; be sure your sins will find you out : if they do n't find you out in this life , as mine has me , the word of God declares that the finally impenitent , and stubborn , and prayerless sinner shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the glory of His power . " Oh fellow traveller to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great reward ; look at the mighty , wonderful works of the great Creator : What ! to dwell with him in eternal glory , is it not , worth asking for ? and if you pray , depart from iniquity . " THE END .
