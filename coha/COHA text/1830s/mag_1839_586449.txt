txt In our former article we referred to the origin and design of this system of banking . We propose , in the present , to furnish some authentic details of its operation , for the purpose of showing that its preponderance lowers the standard of moral feeling , throughout all the walks of life , to a degree most prejudicial to*the highest interests of society . Self denial , experience and industry , aw brought into contempt by its ascendency . The demoralizing influence of lotteries , which has been regarded as so baleful as to require their suppression by penal laws , is scarcely worth notice compared with that produced by gambling adventures created and supported by the system of false credit . The sudden increase of paper currency , and the consequent rise of prices , frequently seduce thousands of industrious individuals to abandon their regular employment under the expectation of realizing speedy fortunes by speculation . Individuals become so maddened in pursuit of immediate wealth as to leave their families , in order to participate in the insane schemes of profit which have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of enhancing their own gains by the ruin of the sanguine and credulous . Others not quite so readily transported by delirious hopes are enticed by the contagious malaria , produced by the overflow of factitious currency , into associations contrived by professional speculators , and thus lay the foundation for future dependence and final vassalage . The great instructor and guide of human life-experience-wholly loses its weight in the regulation of the affairs of men of business . Their minds are stretched to such a degree of constant tension by the morbid excitement produced by the continual ebb and flow of a false and factitious measure of value , that all traces of the past are speedily effaced from the memory , and reflection is smothered in alternate paroxysms of exhiliration and despondency . Even the commercial movement of the past year  --  the disastrous consequences resulting from the control of a few irresponsible managers over our great staple and the exchangesare already forgotten . The circumstances attending the late general suspension of specie payments , and the universal embarrassment and perplexity into which the whole community were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have become matters of antiquity . In such a state of things it can not be regarded as remarkable that the monetary convulsions which shook the whole Union , and swept away the accumulations of long lives of diligence and industry in thousands of instances twenty years ago , have now become enveloped in obscurity // nearly as profound as that in which transactions are involved which oceurreci beyond the era of recorded history . But the lessons afforded by the course of events for a few years after the late war are so full of instruction as to the consequences of Philadelphia banking , that we shall offer no apology to our readers for calling them to recollection . The relief furnished by a National Bank to the ( liseased action produced by overtrading was so clearly exhibited at that period , that the contrast between the condition of the country after the application of tbat specific remedy and its present situation furnishes abundant warning and example for the future . Increased stimulus was at that time applied to the monetary movements of the country , until the over-excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was attempted to be aroused by the appliance of Tariffs , Internal Improvements by the General Government , and various prescriptions of quack politicians . The efii*ct of paper currency upon the industry and commerce of the country has been precisely that of alcohol upon the human system , producing a temporary exhiliration followed by a prostration of vital power , destructive to all regularity of moral and physical exertion . The degree of prostration in the several sections of the Union corresponded with the quantity of relief administered-where the greatest buoyancy and the highest apparent prosperity prevailed , despondency and despair became the most general and profound . XVhen the period of the expiration of the charter of the first Bank of the United States approached , as wben that of the late bank was about to expire , numerous banks in every part of the country suddenly sprung up , under the pretext that the withdrawal of such a large amount of capital from mercantile transactions would require the means of granting further facilities to the merchants . In point of fact , little real capital was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to the public Treasury , as we shall presently show from the most unquestionable authority . The Philadelphia system , as originally manifested in the formation of the Bank of North America , which was founded upon the obligations of the stockholders without any specie excepting that furnished by the public Treasury , was substantially adbered to in establishing its successors . The profits enjoyed by the stockholders were derived from the issue and circulation of paper currency upon the credit of the public revenues and the pled e of individual faith . This in times of general confidence encouraged the greatest liberality and profusion in its issues , and produced a delusive state of prosperity in all mercantile affairs-while the slightest adversity shook the whole structure of society to its very foundation . T he multiplication of banks framed upon similar principles was attended with the additional evil of rivalship in the race or profits so easily and so abundantly acquired by their managers . Unfortunately for the security of the productive interests of the country , as will be seen in the progress of our narrative , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the // monstrous usurpation of receiving and circulating as money on the public account the currency of banks , without regard to its equivalency with specie . This practice , which had exposed the public defence to so much peril during the war , and had brought such disgrace upon the national character as well as such multifarious disasters upon individuals , had been fastened upon the country by the management of Hamilton . It became , under the circumstances , the supposed necessary result of the union of Bank and State . The rivalship of profligacy which this union excited and inflamed between the various banks , produced continual changes in the relative value of their currency , and involved all individual transactions of commerce in the greatest embarrassments and inconveniences . The duties levied upon the vast importations of foreign commodities with which the country was flooded immediately after the peace , in consequence of the extravagant prices prevailing here from the enormous redundancy of paper currency , differed in the several ports of the United States according to the rate of depreciation borne by the paper currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These discordant rates of duty were in direct violation of the Constitution , which requires the rate of imposts levied upon the people of the several States to be equal . The same money received into the Treasury for duties must of course be paid to public creditors ; and as more revenue is collected at some ports than is required for expenditure at those particular points , while at others the public expenditure is greater than the receipts* it became impossible to effect payment on public account without continually inflicting the greatest injustice to those who had relied upon the public faith . The condition into which the public finances and the mercantile transactions of the country had become involved from the union of Bank and State , and the only mode of relief at that time deemed practicable , throws a flood of light upon the course pursued by the managers and supporters of the Bank of the United States in 1835 and 1836 , to compel Congress to re-charter that institution . The measures adopted for that object involved the country in general distress and embarrassment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not produce the result anticipated by their projectors . In the former instance the Bank managers had acquired such an absolute control over the political , commercial and productive interests of the Union , as to appal the strongest and most sagacious of our legislators . Congress was fully apprized of their profligacy in inflicting on the whole community " the evils of pouring upon the country a flood of bank paper at their discretion , " ( see Mr. Tucker 's report , twenty-fifth March , 1816 , ) but no means appear to have been considered practicable for the purpose of effectually checking this arbitrary ascendency of fraud . Under these perplexing circumstances many leading politicians , who , upon principle , from the commencement of the Government , had most strenuously opposed the whole system of paper-money banking , were unable to devise any other remedy for the evils which involved the // monetary transactions , both of the Government and of individuals , than a National Bank . A metallic currency could not at that time , by any measures within the power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving irredeemable paper into the public Treasury , be brought into circulation . The only sound and equal measure of value had been expelled from all channels , both public and private : by false and fictitious substitutes . It is only justice to several of the most intelligent supporters of the old Bank of the United States , to suggest that they regarded the powers proposed to be given to the new Bank with great apprehension and distrust-especially those who had been close observers of the operation of the fraudulent banking system which prevailed in New England previous to the war . The charter of the new bank provided that one fourth of the capital stock subscribed by private individuals should be paid in specie by instalments . It was distinctly foretold by Mr. Mason , then a Senator from New Hampshire , that only the first instalment , under the general practice of banking in this country , would be so paid . That gentleman , remarkable both for his natural endowments and extensive acquirements , strongly contended , while the charter was under debate , that the operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depreciation of paper currency by the great addition it would create to the amount already in existence , and would inevitably bring on a general and destructive revulsion . As a remedy for the evils which afflicted the country , he regarded it as similar to Sangrado 's practice-more bank paper of the same sort-more hot water for the same disease . Affording the only practicable mode of carrying on the Government under the manifold embarrassments into which the public finances had been plunged by its connexion with the banking system , the bill chartering the late Bank of the United States finally passed both Houses of Congress , and on the 10th of April , 1816 , received the sanction of President Madison . The Bank was to go into operation on the first day of January , 1817 . To such a pitch had these embarrassments reached , that the Government , with twenty millions of dollars in the Treasury , was obliged to borrow , in advance of the public operations of the Bank , a half a million of the specie paid towards the first instalment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by providing for the dividends due on that day in Boston on the Public Debt-as none of the public money could effect payments in that city . Immediately after the subscription books closed , the stock of the Bank bore a premium . A great part of it had been taken by speculators who were at that period as well acquainted with the various artifices belonging to the science of puffing as at present . It was a great point with this class to obtain the control of the Bank . The provision of the charter , by which the aggregate of votes upon a large number of shares held by one person was lessened in a certain ratio , was wholly evaded by subscriptions in the names of individuals without any real interest in // the stock . La one instance , more than a thousand shares were held in the names of a similar number of persons by a single individual . For the purpose of inflating the price of the stock , Mr. Dennis A. Smith , one of the first Board of Directors , who became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproach on the Baltimore branch , who has since sought notoriety by taking the lead in proposing the late suspension by the banks , and who has recently revived the favorite project of the bank speculators of 1819 , for making Treasury notes a substitute for the only constitutional currency in payments by the banks , introduced the famous resolution for paying dividends on the stock of the bank in London . This proposition was strenuously opposed by the capitalists at the Board , but on the seventh of November , 1816 , was carried by the speculators . Mr. John Sergeant , also one of the Directors of the Bank , was accordingly dispatched to Europe to establish this agency , as well as to borrow or purchase specie to sustain the contemplated course of operations . The result of the various manoeuvres adopted , was , that in the course of a short time the price of stock rose to about 160 . Our sketch of the mode in which the currency of a great nation is regulated by Philadelphia banking must be more brief than its merits require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress in December , 18 16 , that arrangements had been made by the bank to relieve the stockholders from the actual payment of their subsequent instalments . Evidently alarmed at this perversion of the plain intent of the charter , which if practised would destroy the public advantages anticipated from the establishment of the Bank , the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means , Mr. Calhoun , addressed a letter of inquiry on this subject to Mr. James Lloyd , then a Senator from Massachusetts , who was at that time a director of the bank , and who spent the latter part of his life in Philadelphia . The answer , dated ninth of January , 1817 , may be found at length in Gales ' and Seaton 's State papers , Finance , vol. 3d , page 152 . He states that the bank had resolved on the eighteenth of December , 1816 , to make discouats for the purpose of meeting the payment of the second *astalment , and expressly alleges that nearly all the banks of the country had begun their discounts upon payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the former Bank of the United States . Mr. Lloyd , whose means of knowledge of the management of the banks of this country up to that period was inferior to that of no one , and whose per*onal integrity was of the highest character , adds : " Experience has verified , to the conviction of most persons who have had occasion to remark it , that any very strong reliance upoa the constructive obligations of moneyed men , in opposition to their pecuniary interest and in the absence of any special agreement on their part , would form a most fragile dependence for a great banking institution to obtain its operations on . " Such an explanation of a palpable fraud upon the charter of the Bank , given by a person who possessed the best opportunities of appreciating the character of the Philadelphia school , is worthy of the sober meditation of those who have honestly desired to subject the good faith of the // United States to the consequences of such a system of ethics , especially under the more modern improvements which have been introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that even the ceremony of paying the first instalment of the capital stock of a bank was wholly unnecessary . We have been informed by the Legislatur of Massachusetts , in an official report , that the ordinary mode of establishing banks under the more improved system , is to borrow the specie required by law for a single day , and to put the bank into operation for the manufacture of currency , with no capital whatever but the notes of its projectors . Some of the banks of the western States which failed in consequence of the management of the Bank of the United States , to which we shall presently advert , exhibited the benefits of connecting the Government with this improvement on the Philadelphia system of banking , in a striking manner . Having stopped payment with large amounts of public money which had been dissipated in unfortunate speculations , the stockholders surrendered their certificates of stock in exchange for the notes which constituted the sole capital of the bank-leaving nothing for the public indemnity but the naked franchise conferred by the act of incorporation ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes had incurred no personal liability , as the bank alone was responsible , in its corporate capacity . That the Bank of the United States was intended to be conducted on similar general principles , seems to be clearly intimated by Mr. Lloyd in his remark , that " not a smal part of the stock is in the possession of those who very fairly mean to make an advantageous use of the confidence they reposed in the good faith and resources of the coirntrvV ' By the statement of the President of the Bank to the Committee of Investigation , of which Mr. Spencer was Chairman , it is shown that the sum of $1,428,694 45 was paid in specie by the stockholders before the Bank went into operation  --  and this appears to be all which was actually paid . To sustain the credit of its vast issues , which , in the two first months of its operation , amounted to 4,565,000 , reliance was solely had to the control given it by law over the public revenues , its notes being made receivable in all public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 30th of July , 1817 , and the 5th of December , 1818 , the amount imported directly by the Bank was $7,311,750 33 . This specie actually cost the Bank the sum of $525,297 38 above its par value here , besides the $20,000 paid Mr. Sergeant for his voyage to make th negotiation . This is within a fraction of eight per cent . We shall attempt an explanation of the fate of this experiment to keep up the credit and circulation of a redundant paper currency , by means of importations of specie from abroad  --  a policy so often resorted to by the Bank-as it is full of instruction upon the general principles which regulate the currency and govern manufactures , which were advanced in our former article . Immediately after going into operation , the Bank , for the purpose of pushing its paper into circulation , gave a general order that no currency // should be paid out by any of its officers but its own notes , and specie . The notes issued by the branches were only redeemable in specie at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in payments to the United States every where . By paying out no other than its own notes , a great amount was immediately forced into circulation as we have already seen . At the same time , the notes of other banks were received upon an agreement to pay interest thereon , instead of being returned upon them for specie . The evil of an excessive currency was thus continually increasing by the measures adopted by the Bank . On the 26th of February , 1817-less than two montbs from its commencement-  --  the balances against State banks were $8,848,000 , besides their notes to the amount of $587,281 , held by the Bank . It continued to pay out its own notes until July , 1818 , when its circulation exceeded nine millions of dollars . During these enormous issues and importations , the plentifulness of currency here , and its consequent depreciation compared with the lower prices of commodities in specie in other countries , made its exportation the most profitable remittance that could be made abroad . Most of the notes issued by the branches at New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a statement of the President of the Bank to Mr. Spencer s committee , that , during the period referred to , 1,622,800 09 in specie had been sent to Boston , and $6,293,392 01 to New York , to meet this continual drain for exportation , besides a very large sum drawn from the mother Bank , the precise amount of which does not appear by the returns from which we have derived these facts relative to its operations . The immense sums drawn from the local banks of the South and West , which occasioned the suspension of most of them , appears to have been almost entirely exported . Now , during this period , exchange on New York was worth , at least , from five to six per cent . in Kentucky-considerably higher in Ohio , and throughout the South and West , at a premium-in some places as high as ten per cent . As the notes issued by the branches in all these sections of the country could be used in payment of duties , they constituted the most profitable remittance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great profusion with which they were issued throub bout the South and West , very few went into circulation . The notes of the local banks which could not be used in payment of debts , or in the purchase of goods in Nexv York and Boston , but at enormous sacrifices , remained the sole currency of the Southern and Western sections of the Union , while the branch paper issued there , and remitted to New York and Boston , formed the medium in which duty bonds were paid  --  the notes of the latter branches being used , as we have seen , to draw specie for exportation . In less than two years , the rigorous application of this proc*ess , together with the sale of drafts upon the East at large premiums , to which we shall presently refer , had transferred nearly the whole capital of the bank to the South and West , while collections could only be made in those soctions in local paper , as there were no notes of the Bank in // circulation there . To save the Bank from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize this local paper in specie . T his was enforced with so much severity , as to overturn most of the banks whose paper formed the actual currency of those regions . The suspension of these banks , and the continuance of the exportation of specie growing out of the determination not to curtail the paper circulation of the country , nearly caused the failure of the Bank itself Its embarrassments involved the whole country in a degree of suffering and distress which far exceeded any of its subsequent proceedings , disastrous as some of them have been . The Bank had been chartered for the sole purpose of relieving the disorders inevitable from a reduadant paper currency . By increasing this plethora to promote the speculations of its managers , it not only destroyed the commercial credit of whole States , but in endeavoring to preserve its own existence , thousands upon thousands of worthy individuals , who had been seduced by its liberal accommodations , were totally ruined . The losses incurred by the Bank were enormous . In Baltimore alone , they were supposed to reach nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums . Throughout the South and West it held heavy claims upon local banks , the credit of which had been destroyed by its attempt to regulate the currency and commerce of the country in a similar manner as it has recently done . Several instructive episodes , showing its management towards individuals of influence and standing during this period of universal pecuniary distress , might be given , did our limits permit . Some of tbe most extraordinary of these instances occurred in Ohio and Kentucky . In the latter State , an attempt was made to retrieve a portion of its losses by loaning the depreciated paper of the local banks to individuals upon long credit , to be paid at maturity in specie . These contracts were adjudged to be usurious and void by the Supreme Court of the United States . Those who desire to trace the proceedings of the great regulator of the currency during the eventful years of 1818 , 1819 , 1820 , and 1821 , will find a vast fund of information in Niles ' Weekly Register of those years-thou5h that well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years found sufficient reasons for shaping its views more in accordance with the designs of the managers of the Bank . At that period the Bank had not entered the areaa of partizan warfare . Its managers had not found it necessary or expedient to sustain their speculations by a formal alliance with a great political party . The result of less than two years operation of the great institution , which had undertaken to regulate the currency , was to produce a far greater discrepancy between that of the several States , and more embarrassment in the domestic exchanges between the several sections of the Union , than had existed previous to its establishment . Instead of equalizing the currency , which was the principal ground upon which its charter was grant6d , the gigantic speculations entered into and encouraged by its managers had created a tenfold greater destruction of private con- // 105 qwq // 148 Political portraits-No . XIV . propose4 to establish a permanent agency there , connected with his settlement at the mouth of the Columbia river . Mr. Cambrelereg was selectc by Mr. Astor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to await there the result of the negotiations under the Russian mediation . The ship in which he sailed , the Hannibal , had been employed by the Russian Minister in this country to carry out the celebrated and unfortunate MOREAU , who was also a passenger . We are here enabled to give a reminiscence of Moreau from the pen of Mr. Cambrc leng , contained , as the preceding , in a letter to a friend ; which , referring to a period of his life about which little is known , and about which much misrepresentation has prevailed , will not be without a historic vali e , entitling it to record , as well as a deep interest to the general reader . From the acquaintance of that voyage , with the intimate opportunity it afforded of knowing the real man , Mr. Cambreleng has always maintained a firm conviction of his purity and patriotism , notwithstanding the obloquy with which his name has been covered , as a traitor who fell in arms in battle against his country : " I never saw a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife he would never have quit his residence on the Delaware . Throu*h his agency abroad , and the persuasions of Bernadotte , he was induced to quit that quiet retreat . He travelled under the assumed name of Monsieur Cazeau . His manners nd appearance on board ship were truly simple and democratic ; and he would frequently and patiently listen till midni* ht to the long yarns ' of the chief mate of the ship . He told us that , if he succeeded in all his plans , we should see him as retired on the banks of his native river as he had been on the Delaware . Moreau delayed his departure from this country till late in June , obviously without any design to engage in the campaign of that year . He thought that , by the time he arrived in Europe , the Allied Army would be on the banks of the Rhine ; and it was his dcsi*fl to offer himself as a mediator between the French nation and the Allies . These expectations were , however , soon disappointed . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Moreau 's questions , the captain informed us of the battles of Liitaen nod Bautzen . Moreau quickly inquired , Where are Wittaen tein , Schwartzenber* , and Bernadotte V The first was on the borders of Silesia , the second in Bohemia , and the third in the North of Germany . He immediately exclaimed , My God ! they ltave three times the number of the French army ; they never can bent Napoleon except by main force ; they have the power to drive him before them , but he will beat them forever while their armies are separated . ' Tie always spoke highly of the genius of his great antagonist . On one occasion he said , that he did not believe that there ever had lived , or then existed , a general equal to Napoleon for military inspirations in the hour of battle ; ' but after praising him , he would always add : Mais cependant c'est un grand coquin " It will be observed , that it was only bytliis very plan of concentration that Napoleon was finally beaten , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , as Morean said , thrice the number of the French aimy . In the Cattegat , we were spoken by the British fri*ate Hamadryad . On learnin* that Moreau was mong the passeneers , her captain , Chatharn , came aboard to pay his respects to him . It was , then , and for the first time , ( though in his checked shirt , ) that we saw General Morean , who seemed to be a foot taller the moment the British captain came into the cabin . The conduct of Moreau , after his arrival in Gottenbur* , obviously proved that lie moved slowly and reluctantly to the headquarters of the Allied Army . He remained three days on board the ship before he landed , and did not // Icave that place for a week . His death , very shortly after , at the battle of Dresden , was peculiarly unfortunate for his reputation . Had he realized his expectations on quittin* the United States-had ha found the Allied Army on the banks of the Rhine , and successfully presented himself as a mediator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been remembered as the benefactor of his country , and the pacificator of Europe . Had he lived to have executed his other plan of concentration at the battle of Leipzig , and driven Napoleon to Paris , he would , perhaps , have been ranked as the Great Captain of the Age , as he was certainly one of the first . But , as it was , he was denounced as a traitor to France , and execrated by those to whose interests he was devoted , and for whom he would have voluntarily surrendered his life . " Soon after the dreadful battle of Leipzig , Mr. Cambreleng commenced his journey from Sweden , through Pomerania , to Berlin , ( then filled with wounded . ) Potsdam , Dessau , and Leipzi* . The latter place at that time , in December , two months after the battle , was literally one hospital . The hospitals in the neighbourhood had been burnt down , and the sick and wounded were transferred to the city . The churches were converted into hospitals , fires were burning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terrible ; but amidst all this scene the Leer was going on ; merchants from the four quarters of the globe were congregated , and there was the grand supper at the hotel at nine o'clock at night , with the band of music , regardless of the condition of a mourning city . From Leipzi , , , he followed the route of the allied army to Frankfort on the Maine ; to Basle , in Switzerland , and thence to within sixty miles of Paris . It was a journey full of interest and adventures , affording an opportunity not only of seeing the civilized soldiers of Europe , but the Cossac , Calmac , Bashkir , and Tartar . He was frequently in the neighbourhood of unimportant skirmishes and battles , and met occasionally bodies of prisoners marching on foot at the point of the bayonet en midwinter , and the ground covered with snow . After much delay and difficulty , he reached , with two companions , the head quarters of the allied army , at a village about fifteen miles from Troyes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The advanced guard of the allied army was engaged on the turnpike leading to Troyes , and there was much consternation among the Allies at the report that Napoleon had thrown himself into that place at the head of an army of 200,000 men . They started also for Bar sur Seine ; but had not only to pass over one of the terrible cross-roads of France  --  and in winter , too  --  but to follow in the train of more than 1,000 cannon and baggage wagons . They reached Bar sur Seine at nine o'clock at night , after having travelled , by the spirited assistance of a sutler 's wife , the distance of nine miles in as many hours , and were quartered in a house with a German prince and his attendants , who had taken all the house and every thing to eat . The travellers had to sleep in the same room with the master of the house , his wife , children , and servants . On learning that they were Americans , he opened a secret closet , and gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached Chatillon , where was assembled the Congress of Ministers , which was the object of his destination . // The negotiations for a peace were delayed much longer than was anticipated , and Mr. Cambreleng was detained in Europe more than a year . His time was , however , not unemployed . Circumstances which seem to have been anticipated by the sagacity of Mr. Astor made it necessary to assign the concerns of the Hannibal also to the discretionary charge of Mr. C. , if he should at any time see proper to assume it ; and the agents of that vessel , havin* dtffered as to their management , relinquished them to his control . During his detention in Europe , he visited Sweden , Prussia , Silesia , Bohemia , the north and middle of Germany , Switzer* land , France , Holland , and England . Despairing of an early and pacific termination of the negotiations at Ghent , he returned in the Hanni bal to New York , in 1814 . He visited France again in 1815 , and in 1816 , Italy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these voyages , he had an opportunity to remain some time in Paris , and of visiting Florence , Rome , and Constantinople . On his return , he cominenced business again in New York ; which , after a few years , terminated unsuccessfully . In 1825 , he made a tour through England , Scotland , Ireland , and Wales Mr. Cambreleng 's life has thus been a very adventurous and roving one ; it has been replete with striking incident and romantic adventures , for which , as well as for scenery and the novelty of travel , he has always had a strong passion . His observation has been keen and extensive , and he has been very laborious in study in the intervals of occupation , and , especially while his days have been occupied and distracted with business , through the hours of night . He has been more a writer than a reader , and has depended more upon observation , experience , and reflection , than upon the borrowed treasures of other minds . Though his career had been commercial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform advocate of Democratic principles . He had not lone , been permanently settled in New York , before be took an active part in its politics . The doctrine of restrictions on trade for the protection of manufactures was then advocated or sanctioned by almost all our public men , and all who ventured to oppose an increase of duties for the benefit of manufacturers were considered as wanting in patriotism . The Democratic party had been made an instrument , for the promotion of their own interests , by prominent capitalists engaged in that branch of business , and memorials were annually sent to Congress from Tam* many Hall , praying for an increase of the tariff Mr. Cambreleng was among the few more clear-sighted and fearless who then protested against these memorials , and ultimately succeeded in persuading his political friends to discontinue them . In the winter of i8*0 , *l , before he had e.nga , *ed in public life , he wrote his " Examination of the New Tariff proposed by the Hon. Henry Baldwin , a Representative in Congress . By one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex* position of the fallacy of the experiments by which the high tariff school of that day-not yet extinct , though now for the present abashed into silence-sought to fasten upon the young , free energies of this country // 151 the fictitious system of commercial policy , of prohibitions , premiums ,  --  and drawbacks , which , whatever division of opinion exists as to its effects on the true prosperity of England , is at least the most fatal and false to the true spirit of our institutions that we could adopt . It formed an octavo volume of near three hundred pages , and was composed dur* ing the evening hours , when the author was released from the business Qccupations of the day . In the spring of 1821 , Mr. Cambreleng was nominated for Congress by the Democratic party ; and though a powerful effort was made to defeat his election , by his political opponents , and by the manufacturing interest , he succeeded , over a very popular candidate nominated in opposition to him , by a large majority . The seat thus obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election in that city , when the convulsion of the recent political crisis at last effected the object for the accomplishment of which all the former efforts of his opponents had failed . He thus centinued a member of Congress for ei*hteen years consecutively . When the Republican party sustained its overwhelming defeat in 1824 , he was the only member of Congress of that party redected from the State . Yet has Mr. Cambreleng always , from the outset , been opposed by the mercantile interest of that city ; though in reality , however tardy that class may be in recognizing the fact , he has always been , from the soundness of that theory of public policy which has always given its entire shape and character to his public course , their best friend , and a most valuable representative of their true interest . In 1828 , particularly , he was vigorously opposed by the merchants generally , for refusing to advocate a high federal duty on sales at auction . How violent and embittered tIat hostility has been made of late years , by Mr. Cambrdeng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic policy , in relation to the public currency and banking , which the mercantile class are so prodi*iously mistaken in regarding as antagonist to their real interests , is too well known to require comment or notice at our hands . In proportion , however , to this hostility of political opponents have the attachment and confidence of the Democratic party of his city and State increased with the continued manifestation of his unwavering Republican princi*des-his pure and firm political integrity  --  the consistent soundness of his leading doctrines of commercial policy  --  and the eminent ability which he has displa* ed in the advocacy of them . Mr. Cambreleng is now in retirement from public life , and is about to take advantage of an interval of leisure long desired by him , to revisit some of the scenes of his earlier travels and adventures in Europe . But there can be no do6bt that , on his return , no public man will occupy a more prominent position in the confidence of the Republican party , in the Empire State and its - great commercial metropolis , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as a most fit and worthy candidate for the highest honors of further political istinction in its power to bestow . // Mr. Cambreleng 's career in Congress during the eighteen years that he has occupied a seat in the House of Representatives , has been emv nently useful and honorable . He has always preferred that post of duty in the public service , resting on the free election of his constituency* to any other offices of honor or emolument , under the Executive appointment , which his distinguished services , character , and abilities must have mad readily accessible to him . He has always in the House played a prominent and influential part-having been generally chairman of some of the more important committees , Commerce , Foreign Affairs , and Ways and Means ; the chairmanship of which latter is well known as being the nearest approach that our practice admits to the post of leadership of the dominant party in the body . In the exercise of these functions Mr. Cambreleng has been the author of numerous reports , characterized by remarkable ability , research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation , in 1829 , can not be forgotten by many of our readers . Two editions of it were published by the merchants of New York , and a third in London . His report on the *nrplus Revenue , in 1837-on the Independent Treasury and on the Public Expenditure ; at the late and the preceding sessions of Congress-are not less entitled to special notice . Without referring more particularly to his numerous speeches , many of which are elaborate and complete essays of grea value , on the subjects of which they treat , we are induced to extract from his speech on the Independent Treasury , at the Extra Session , the following quotation-with the length of which our readers will s arcely find fault-both as an instance of Mr. Cambreleng 's style , and as a specimen of the broad liberality and sound democratic character of his views on the subject to which it relates : " We have now to notice a formidable objection . It is said we propose to establish a universal and exclusive metallic currency ; and , in the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to effect an absolute subversion of all credit and all commerce-an utter destruction of the whole fabric of society . ' ThL. is , indeed , sir , an age distinnuished for discoveries . We have been for years endeavoring to secure , through our federal legislation , a broader basis for the vast fabric of credit in this country . Gentlemen have cordially cod rated with us in accomplishing a purpose almost universally acknowledged to be necessary to give stability to trade , and solidity to our tottering banking system . But when we propose a measure calculated to forward effectually an object so essential to the morals and prosperity of the Union , they suddenly discover that our design is to bveak up th very foundations of civilized society , to return to iron money and black broth to absolute barbarism . Gentlemen well know that , whatever may be oar abstract opinions as to the effect of paper money on the morals and condition of society , no man i-wtbis bank note age ' can expect more than to reform the abuses of the sys* tem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom they are politically associated , I would admonish gentlemen to consult together , and come to some understanding as to what they mean by an exclusive metallic currency , ' and the destruction of the credit system . ' The gentleman from South Carolina , ( Mr. Le , , are , ) and the gentleman from Yir*inia , ( Mr. Garland , ) considering how harmoniously they act together , have placed themselves in an awkward attitude before the country . The former gentleman denounces the currency of France as the author of her poverty ; the latter eulogises it as the soundest in the world , and recommends it // to us as a model for our imitation ! And now , sir ; what becomes of all the violent denunciations of the gentleman from Virginia about this monstrous attempt to introduce an exclusive metallic currency 3 Who had gone beyond the gentleman from Virginia 3 No bank note circulates in France of a less denomination than live hundred francs , and the whole amount is but about twenty millions of dollars in paper to four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a metallic currency 3 Is the credit system destroyed in France 3 Sir , the gentleman from Virginia will find , upon an examination of his own doctrines , that it will embarrass him to explain in what essential principle relating to currency he is opposed to the present Administration . " The gentleman from South Carolina may also discover that his principles are not so hostile as he imagines , to the separation of Bank and State . Why , sir , he admires the Scotch banking system , the very essence of which is its freedom from all legislative interference . The union between Parliament and this branch of trade has been long since effectually dissolved . Trade , and not Government , re0 ulates the quantity of banking capital in Scotland . He seems struck with admiration at the splendid results of the credit system in that country , and ascribes them to the substitution of paper for a metallic circulation . The gentleman mistakes the shadow for the substance . The astonishing industry and wealth of Scotland , and the moral condition of her people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom she has enjoyed in banking , the best regulator of all trades when free . The act of 1708 did not extend to Scotland ; she was not under the dominion of the Bank of England . She had no gigantic institution to break her local banks periodically , and to throw thousands , nay millions , of laborers out of employment . Beyond the Tweed , capital , free from all restrictions , flowed into this channel , and kept pace with labor , population , trade , and wealth , and sustained the vast increase of her commercial credits . The banks of Scotland are an improvement upon the plan of our savings institutions . They have in that country not only a large amount of bankin0 capital , but more than a hundred millions of dollars , drawn from all classes of society , in deposite upon interest , yieldin* a profit to the community as well as to the bank ; thus mutually benefitting the capitalists and the country , and encouraging frugality and enterprise . Her credit system ' rests upon a foundation almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not , like ours , exempt from responsibility . The public interest and security are not , as with us , sacrificed to encourage the growth of corporations-of partners not individually 4iable for their debts , and not responsible to the country for their management . Her banks are essentially the guardians of the poor , as well as the regulators of trade . It is to these circumstances we may chiefly ascribe the rapid growth of Scotland , notwithstanding her disadvantages of soil and climate , and without the appendage of an impoverished laboring population , as in England and Ireland . It is wholly immaterial to Scotland what may be the character of her circulation . She is an interior province ; exchanges do not press upon her ; England intervenes and sustains the shock . Like our country banks , theirs have little use for specie ; and , like them , they have their specie funds in the centre of circulation . Had she been on the borders of the British Channel , where her local circulations would come in contact with the metallic currency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however convenient small notes may be , the imaginary convertibility of bank notes into coin is but a frail protection to labor , and a weak foundation for the credit and contracts of a nation . Protected by her interior position , as well as by skilful mans , , ement , her population has escaped some of the consequences of this abuse of credit . " But the chief object of the admiration of the gentleman from South Carolina was the triumphant result of the credit system in England . Why , sir , nothing can be more unlike than the credit systems of England and Scotland , as they were prior to // labor steadily employed , and with parental guardianship hoarded the small accumulations of the poor . But it was in England that the gentleman saw the grandest work of civilized life in any part of the world  --  the splendid result of her credit and banking system . Sir , while the classical and intellectual gentleman from South Carolina was admiring the Corinthian grandeur of this proud fabric of the credit system , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on a vnst ruin of violated rights ; lost in his sublime contemplations , he heard not the accents of despair , ' nor the wailin0s of poverty , uttered by millions who had fallen Victims the credit system of England . He had not , probably , examined the poor man s record . He could not persuade himself to believe that , amidst all this bustle , life , and splendor , all this wealth and grandeur , he was in a nation of paupers . He could see it all in his travels through impoverished Fraace , with her metallic cur* rency , but not in En* , land , with her credit and banking system . Well , sir , here is that record of its results which escaped the gentleman 's observation . Two millions four hundred and ninety-three thousand four hundred and twenty-three families receiving relief not included in the returns for this year . ' But , it is added , in this work published by the London Statistical Society , jud*ing from the results here exhibited , the pa persforea the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr* Chairman , is the foundation upon which rests this grandest work of civilized life , ' this triumphant evidence of the blessin* , s of the En , , lish banking and credit system . " Sir , I have travelled a little , too . I have contemplated with delight the rich Lreasures of the Louvre and the Vatican ; the sublime Doric and the proud Corinthian ; but it was in the beautiful valleys of France and Germany-on the Rhine and on the Elbe-it was amidst the mountains of Switzerland and Wales , that I saw , without regard to questions of currency , or even forms of government , sound morality and personal comfort ; it was these scenes that reminded me of our western paradise . And , sir , I could but regret that the tenants of those mountains and valleys were governed by that concentrated power of associated wealth which rules Governments , controls monarchs , and regulates the destiny of every nation in Europe . " Mr. Chairman , we have a great constitutional duty to discharge . We have to regulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a comePon medium , to secure equal taxation to the States of this confederacy , and to preserVe for the whole people a measure of value of ancient on in , for labor , property , and contracts . In discharging this duty , we have not only to encounter the vices of our complicated banking systems , but also a revolution which has been going on more than a century , and one which threatens in the end to substitute a mere exchange of credits for the ancient standard of nations . It commenced with the charter of the Bank of England in 1694 . This substitute first appeared in the form of notes of ' twenty pounds ; in 1759 , it was reduced to ten pounds ; in 1793 , to five pounds ; and in 1797 , the bank suspended specie payments , and commenced issuing one and two pound notes . After a fatal experiment of five-and-twenty years-fatal to the morale and *veifare of the people , however necessary it may have been to Government-the bank resumed specie payments in 1822 . The currency was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to twenty-five dollars ) were prohibited in England and Wales . This was not , however , the most material reform . " The restriction on b* nking , which had been imposed in 1708 , to protect the monopoly of the Bank of En aland , was repealed in 1826 . For one hundred and eighteen years no association could be formed for banking purposes with more than six partners . Under this system , the trade and currency of England were periodically convulsed . The great regulator of banking in that country , by its own alarms and powerful efforts to save itself brought down country banks by the hundred in every revulsion , prostrated trade , and threw millions of the laboring population out of ' employment . The violent revulsion of 1825 brought about the reform of 1826 ; and with the consent ' of the Bank of England , her monopoly was partially relinquished , and the great commercial and manufacturing districts were permitted , like // Scotland , to form as many banks as they pleased . England has escaped some of the violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie payroents . The Bank of England was not saved , as in 1825 , by an accidental discovery of one pound notes ! It was not because there had not been over-trading in En* , land ; far otherwise . There never was a period when there was more extensive speculation in every branch of trade , and when her capital and credit were more widely extended in every quarter of the globe* How has it happened , then , that she did not suffer as in 1825 ? Because the revulsion in that year broke down the monopoly of the Bank of England ; because capital , freed from its dominion , flowed with astonishing rapidity into that branch of trade , and was ready to meet the sudden and large addition which speculation had made to the mass of commercial credits . Some of these associations , it is true , xv crc embarrassed by the revulsion ; the wonder is , that more were not brought down by it . They were all of recent origin and this trade had been effectually prohibited for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remnant of barbarism , the usury law , was also in effect repealed , by exempting all bills having not more than ninety days to run from their operation ; and this has been subsequently extended . The rate of interest , sir , is the safety-valve of credit . It should be permitted to rise and fall with the pressure upon the money market . In this country we have locked it down , and doubly prohibited the free use of capital . The inevitable consequence is periodical explosions . But with all these reforms , it is still the policy of England to substitute credit for a metallic measure of value . That credit , it is true , is not so vitiated as it was ; but by making Bank of England notes a lawful tender , and by authorizing the joint stock associations to issue their notes , redeemable in these notes , they have laid the foundation for revulsions in trade , which are not yet developed . These associations had not been long enough in existence to show to what amount they could increase their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could in6rease them While the use of credit , founded upon property , should enjoy absolute freedom , the abuse of credit , by issuin0 that which is founded upon credit , should never ha encouraged by Government . " The most powerful antagonist , however , of a uniform measure of value is our own banking system , unquestionably the worst in the world . If we had no other motive , we should be compelled to collect our revenue in a metallic currency , in order to preserve something in the country as a standard of value . We have six-andtwenty Legislatures and two Territorial Councils steadily at work , enactin* laws to banish specie from circulation . The present crisis , no doubt , must produce reform ; but it can not be expected to be immediate or general , so long as our laws are made by those who entertain hostile principles of government , especially on thiS question of currency . It is true , there is a common conviction that our banking system is bad , and that our local circulations require reform ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our constitutional standard ? If we do not lay the foundation here , our banking system will never be reformed . It is impossible to imagine a system more discordant , and more embarrassing to trade , than the system of the United States as a whole . Capital is not at liberty to flow into this branch oi ' trade as in England and Scotland . Government mUst regulate the quantity in each State . Our State Government might , with equal propriety and wisdom , regulate the quantity of capital in every other branch of trade* And what is the consequence of this legislative interference with bankin * ? Why , sir , two of our cities have each more banking capital than the State of Nexv York , with her hundred cities and towns , and with more than two millions of population . The commercial emporium of the Union , the centre of circulation , the point upon which the whole fabric of ' commercial credit , internal and external , presses at every revulsion , is permitted to employ , in this branch of trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Such legislation is as absurd as it is unequal . It is calculated to unregulate trade and embarrass the banks . Bankina , legitimate banking , // is a 4rade , and should be as free as all other trades . Let it regulate the quantity of capital , and this branch will keep pace with all others ; it will increase with the increase of commercial credits , and with the growth of trade . As the demand increases , so will the supply ; and no portion of the capital of the country will be unemployed . This is the secret of the success of the Scotch banking system , which is weakened , and not strengthened , by her small note circulation . " Currency , sir , is not a trade . Governments will be called upon to decide whether an attribute of sovereignty shall be exercised by trading companies , and , if so to what extent . They must determine whether such companies are to be permitted to furnish the world with their credit as a substitute for a metallic standard , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the result which seems approaching . The great question to be determined is , are trading associations to be authorized to issue a species of State credit , and to collect a revenue , now amounting to six or seven millions annually , and constantly increasing , , and to indemnify an abused community by producing periodical bankruptcy , poverty , and want I The gentleman from South Carolina knows that almost all the distinguished authorities are against his Credit System . ' " It is a conceded point , that the regulation of the quantity of currency , which is the measure of value , ought not to be entrusted to those whose profits are increased by abusing the trust . You mightas well at once surrender to these corporations the power to regulate the value of our coin , and let them adulterate it , or arbitrarily raise its nominal value at their pleasure , as monarchs formerly did , to the ruin of their people . Upon what ground is it that Government have been induced to give their aid in substitutin* the paper of trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing demand for a medium of circulation and a deficiency of the precious metals . The former is admitted , the latter I deny ; and on neither 5 , round can these issues be defended . Sir , there has been no age of the world when it was so abundantly supplied with circulation , independent of all the small notes , ( I mean under fifty or one hundred dollars , ) in Europe and America . How is it with the precious metals 3 In the work referred to by the gentleman from South Carolina , the quantity of money in the Au ustan age is estimated at less than two thousand millions . Why , sir , since 1492 , we have drawn from the American mines alone , more than six thousand millions of dollars , and the aggregate of coin , bullion , and plate in the world , is estimated at from seven to ten thousand millions . The quantity of specie might have been an object of solicitude in earlier a*es* but of what consequence is it now , when , for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have discovered a mine richer than all the mines of Mexico and Peru  --  the human mind . We have drawn from that inexhaustible mine countless millions of substitutes for specie , in the form of public debts , bank stocks , and stocks of every kind ; of bills of exchange , notes of hand , bank drafts , and bank checks . These are our circulations which give velocity to trade . It is these , amounting to thousands of millions , which have accelerated the growth of wealth among nations , and not the contemptible amount of your small note circulations in Greet Eritain Ireland , and America . In the present age , trade provides its own substitutes for specie , in adjusting balances not only between States and nations , but between individuals , and without the agency of bank notes . Specie is only wanted to adjust balances between nations when credit is suddenly destroyed . It is , however , wanted in every country as a standard for local circulation , and to sustain the increasing amount of commercial credit . The value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the form of bills of exchange , without extendiab this abuse of credit in the form of currency . The former we can not reach by legislation , and we have no right to do so if we could , however injurious its operation is upon trade . The latter interferes with the currency established by the Constitution , and we should adopt every measure that we can to prevent it from destroying our standard altogether . // 157 " This revolution may he accomplished . The precious metals may eventually he banished from the circulations of the world , and we may have no other standard than bank notes . I admit , sir , that , as a mere question of trade , it would accelerate the accumulation of wealth , and the growth of our cit.ies . But what are the sacrifices attending such a system ? Do you not lay the foundation of your cities on the ruin of your population ? Sir , while we sacrifice the poor , we transfer political power from the a*ricultural and laboring classes of society to those thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our free governments , the only interests worthy , in the estimation of our American legislators , to be exclusively cherished , protected , and patronized . Sir , go on with your credit and banking systems ; banish the precious metals ; establish your paper standard , and let the value of property and the price of labor float upon its agitated surface ; let them rise with its expansions and fall with its contractions ; and then , sir , gentlemen may anticipate every five years the return of the awful winters ' referred to by the gentleman from Pennsylvania . One of them is now approaching-an awful winter indeed for the poor ; thousands will be struck down by poverty and want . Sir , I do not ask gentlemen for their charity . I make no appeals to their humanity : but , in the name of HIM who made us all , I entreat them to spare them their taunts-do not sti6matize them-let these poor laborers die in peace and of famine , in a land overflowing with the richest abundance . Pardon these victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , pray that their country might be delivered from your calamitous Credit System . ' " Mr. Chairman , upon the firmness and integrity of the people of this country , at the present crisis , depend the condition of our society , and the character of our Government . It is evidently a struggle for power by some of the corporations of this country , but , I trust , not all of them . It is a great issue ; for every thing moral , social , and political , is at stake . On such an occasion , *entleinen may well discard their prejudices*republicans have been separated on party grounds , but not on Principle-they may readily unite when a question arises involvin* the welfare of the people , and the very existence of free government . In a cause so just , we have little to fear , and every thin , , to hope . I can not believe , that , in the approaching , contest , we shall lose one sincere friend of this administration . Some have , I think , prematurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without proper examination I am sure , no sound republican can , upon deliberation , be ultimately found a , , ainst it . While , sir , on the other hand , the proposition to separate Bank and State must rally and unite the democracy of this country , by whatever questions they may have been hitherto divided . They will never conseat that the Treasury of the United States shall be controlled by the stock exchange of Wall street , or of the royal exchan , , e ; that the public revenue shall be a am made Instrumental in augmenting the disasters of the country ; and that ihe Government shall be periodically embarrassed for want of means , by entrusting its funds to institutions whose fate depends upon the sli0htest counter-movement in any part of the commercial system of the world . Nor , sir , can I believe that any sound republican is prepared to substitute the credit of our corporations for the common medium , and common standard of the world . No , sir : on these questions the democracy will be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor or the interests of their country were involved , as they are at the present crisis . Let not gentlemen deceive themselves ; their victories always come with our calamities , and disappear with returnina prosperity . The concentrated power upon which they depend cai*not yet regulate the succession to the Presidency . " Sir , I have detained the Committee too long . We challenge gentlemen to the vote . Let the gentleman from South Carolina declaim over his iron money and black broth ; ' let gentlemen denounce the measure as an expedient or an experiment ; let them call it a Sub-Treasury scheme , or by what name they please ; but let them // afford us an opportunity to test its advantages to trade , to banks , the Treasury , and the country . We fear not the results of the experiment " During the many years he has spent in the public service , Mr. Cambreleng has had the satisfaction to witness the successful progress of the liberal doctrines of free trade which he maintained before he entered upon public life , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political career ever since . For some years he was their only advocate in the New York delegation in Congress . They were unpopular , and those who administered , or who aspired to administer , our national affairs , had not the courage to avow them . The cause of commercial freedom , however , continued to gain ground at every session . The late Administration was the first , since the war with Great Britain , which boldly took ground in favor of revenue duties ; and we have now the pleasure , under our present purely Democratic Administration , to see restored , and in the fair way to a complete and general ascendency over the public mind , those liberal principles which our free Government was especially designed to establish and perpetuate.
