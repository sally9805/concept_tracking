With my best wishes that your mission may be as pleasant as I am sure it will be useful , I remain , Your 's , truly , ( Signed . ) N. BIDDLE , Chairman . /z/ qwq Gentlemen : Having completed the tour of examination into the state of Education in Europe , undertaken by your direction , with especial reference to the organization of the Girard College for Orphans , I beg leave to present to you a Report upon the information collected . The more immediate direction of my mission , as President of the Girard College for Orphans , was devolved by the Trustees upon their Committee on Scholastic Education , from whom I received detailed instructions . In these I was directed to visit the institutions in the principal countries of " iurope , which might be supposed to afford useful information towards organizing the College , to procure text-books , and other works used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Education : and to collect such philosophical instruments , models , and drawings , as might be useful or necessary in opening the College , or as might seem to me desirable to be purchased in anticipation of the larger collections . My arrangements for leaving home were complete ' at the close of September , 1836 ; and aftv .. having visited the chief countries of Europe , which were the most interesting for my undertaking , I completed my tour in October , 1838 . It is almost needless to say , that I am now not only ready , but /z/ anxious to render available , as soon as possible , in the organization of the Girard College , the knowledge which has thus been acquired . It will be the design of the present Report to state in what way I have executed the instructions of the Committee of the Board of Trustees , and to present the result of the inquiries which they directed . Their instructions contained , besides the general indications of the objects of my journey , suggestions as to the mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for which I feel very grateful . The most important purpose of my mission was the examination of institutions for Education , and my Report will principally consist of descriptions of these , and remarks upon them . The other objects were secondary , and even incidental . Whoever has even glanced at the part of the Will of Mr. Girard , which relates to the endowment of a " College for Orphans , " must have perceived that he intended no ordinary Orphan Asylum to be created with the immense fund which his liberality intrusted to the authorities of the city of his adoption . Mr. Girard has put himself in the place of a father to the orphan , and has determined that talent shall have all the opportunities for development , by education , within the reach of children the most favoured by the circumstances of their parents . This view has been prominent in all the measures taken by the City Councils of Philadelphia , in the execution of their trust ; and the Board of Trustees , to whom they have delegated the direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , officially asserted this same understanding of the founder 's wishes . A due execution , therefore , of the instructions of the Scholastic Committee , required not merely an examination of orphanhouses and elementary schools , but of the various modes of education and grades of instruction . This task I undertook with real distrust of my power to do it justice , notwithstanding the CDCOuragement extended by the choice made of me , by gentlemen for whom I entertain a high respect . I must be allowed to say that , in the course of attempting its execution , I have spared no personal exertion , and that , though I may regret it /q/ was not in abler hands , my conscience acquits me of having wasted any part of the time or means so liberally placed at my disposal by my fellow citizens . Before entering upon the descriptive portion of my Report , I propose to give a brief sketch of the views and circumstances which guided me in the distribution of time in the different countries visited , and to present some of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While there can be no doubt that the general principles of education must be founded upon those of human action , and hence be common to all nations , it must be admitted that systems framed from such general laws would require considerable modification to render them applicable to different countries . Differences in political and social organization , in habits and manners , require corresponding changes to adapt a system of education to the nation ; and , without such modifications , success in the institutions of one country is no guarantee for the same result in those of another . The difficulties , however , of working out a plan of education , from observation , appeared to me much greater at the outset of my undertaking than they do now , that I have seen how very many of the essentials are common to all well organized institutions having the same scope . A consideration of these difficulties induced me to make Great Britain the first point of my tour , since it was reasonable to infer that the successful methods of education there might be more easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other countries . The examination of some of the more interesting institutions there occupied rather more than eight months ; and , lest this portion of time should appear too great in comparison with that devoted to the Continent , it may be well to state the circumstances which absolutely required so considerable an allotment . Owing to the absence of any regular or central system of education , and of any general responsibility in the management of its institutions for public instruction , and to the entire freedom of individual effort , more time is required to obtain access to , and examine the establishments of Great Britain , than of any other country which I visited . A proper idea of the /z/ general arrangements can be obtained only by a study of particular cases , and each institution requires to be approached individually , and often in a different way , to secure a profitable entrance . As entirely different ideas frequently prevail in the orgpization of institutions of the same class , it is not sufficient , as it usually is elsewhere , to see merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special objects of my tour , the eleemosynary institutions were to be carefully inspected ; and in the number of its Educational Charities , its Orphan Asylums , Bluecoat Schools , and Education Hospitals , Great Britain exceeds every other country in Europe . The city of Edinburgh and its vicinity alone contain five such institutions for boys , and no two of these are exactly alike in their regulations and administration , so that it was necessary to visit all to form precise ideas of their arrangements . If this be true of establishments having similar objects , in the same city , it may be inferred of those in different parts of the kingdom , and facts fully sustain the inference . It is true , to such an extent , that in preparing descriptions of these schools to present to the Board , I have found it difficult to classify them , so that by presenting , in detail , one institution as the type of a class , I might avoid the too great extension of this Report . The management of these institutions , the observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may serve in many points , especially in all that relates to tJic material comforts of life , as a model to those of other countries , in many of which I freely admit that more just ideas in regard to instruction prevail . Upon a review of the results of ujy visit to the institutions of Great Britain , it appears to me that Uic time was well l ) estow ( xl , though more profitable experience in regard to instruction was acquired in less time in some of the countries of the Continent . After completing a tour through some of the institutions of Ireland , Scotland , and England , I crossed to the Continent , and vinted , in turn , the principal schools of France , Switzerland , Holland , Belgium , and the chief States of Germany , making also a rapid visit to Italy . The same subjects of inquiry did not , of coune , interest inu eiually in these different countries , and I mTRODUCTION . O proceed to pass briefly in review their respective points of interest . In Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my attention . There , as in mher countries where similar establishments exist , and where no great or recent change has been made in public instruction , the instruction within them resembles more nearly that of the schools of the same grade in general , than in countries where such a change has been wrought . While engaged in visiting them , I did not neglect , however , institutions which afforded a less direct prospect of advantage . To illustrate by an example ; although Heriot 's , the Watsons* , and other hospitals for education at Edinburgh and Glasgow occupied a large share of my attention while in Scotland , I visited , more or less in detail , at Edinburgh , the Model Infant School , the Circus-Place Preparatory School , the Sessional School , the High School , the Academy , the Western Academy , the Hill Street Institution , and the University ; at Glasgow , the Infant and Juvenile Schools of the Education Society , the different departments of the High School , and the University . I also made an excursion to St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Bell . In France , the general system of education , especially as modified in its lower departments , and the schools for science and the arts , formed the special objects of examination . The orphans are , in general , associated with the foundlings , and distributed through the country at the expense of the state ; the system presenting nothing , as far as my inquiries led , either for approval or imitation . The plan , of which I venture to speak thus freely , must not be confounded with the excellent system in the Grand Duchy of Weimar , which , though similar in appearance , differs essentially from it . In Weimar , orphan children , deprived of both parents , are distributed among families , as nearly as possible in the same station of life as the deceased parents , and a real superintendence , both moral and intellectual , is exercised over them by officers specially appointed for the purpose , and by the parochial clergy and schoolmasters . In Switzerland , recent and great efforts , consequent upon the /z/ advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in behalf of general education . The school of Pestalozzi , at Yvcrdun , occupies a prominent place in the history of education ; and the institutions of Fellenberg , at Hofwyl , have been frequently described . Others of great merit , but more recently established , are less generally known , and some of them will , as far as my limits allow , be noticed in this Report . I can not , however , enter into the particulars requisite to present the striking results which the last seven years have produced in many of the cantons . The common school system , as well as the eleemosynary institutions of Holland , deservedly attract much attention , and afforded interesting subjects for examination . There are peculiarities about both , and experiments have been made there which bear upon some of the most interesting questions in education . I need only refer , here , to those of the method of mutual instruction , and of the manner of supplying teachers ; the latter of which experiments has led to a conclusion in favour of schools for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of the different states and free towns of Germany , I visited more or less in detail those of Prussia , Saxony , Austria , Bavaria , Wurtemberg , Nassau , Weimar , Frankfort , Bremen , and Hamburgh . The condition of public instruction , in general , in the different states , as well as of the different departments of it it in the same state , is very unequal . Prussia is at present decidedly in advance of the other larger German States in the education of the people , especially in the manner and matter of the instruction . The ease with which every point connected with the schools is ascertained , is remarkable ; and I look back to the time spent in them , and in intercourse with their teachers , as one of the most profitable portions of that occupied by my tour . As the various accounts which have been given of public instruction in Prussia have , in general , referred to the system more particularly than to the schools , I Hliall , in this Keprt , touch more briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the latter . By reference to their and minute arrangements , it is easy to see where /q/ they would apply as perfectly in a republic as in a monarchy . The instruction in many of the charitable institutions of that country has not kept pace with that in the schools in general , though there are others which have even led the way in improvement . Weimar has followed closely the Prussian model in its system of education , and the schools of Nassau may be said to be derived from the same source . The schools of Saxony were once famous throughout Europe , but the primary schools appear to have lost that rank ; they are now , however , rapidly improving , by the same means which produced the present advanced state of instruction in Prussia - the education of teachers . In Bavaria , changes of system have been too recent to render general remarks of any value . I shall , however , give an account of the method of Graser , introduced into the schools of a section of the kingdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which it was placed by the reforming emperor , Joseph the Second . There can be no doubt that it was once much in advance of the times , though the elementary department is at present behind that of most of the other German States . They still adhere to the incomplete plan of educating teachers in ordinary schools , and to antiquated methods of instruction . The Schools of Arts in Austria rank , however , with the best in Europe , and receive liberal encouragement from the government . Of the many institutions which have claimed my attention , it would be entirely impossible to give even a meagre sketch within the limits appropriate to a Report , * and if it were practicable to go into details respecting all , many would be found not to repay the pains taken in reducing to paper a description of them . In making the selection , which is thus necessary , I shall endeavour to bring to the notice of the Board the countries in which the different departments of education are best carried on , and to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minutiae of as many individual institu- // lions as appear necessary to exemplify the system , and to render its results available for practice ; endeavouring to render each account as complete in itself as the nature of the main object of my Report will permit . The manner of collecting the information which I sought requires a passing notice . The introductions which usually flow in abundantly upon any one known to have a special object in visiting a country , opened to me the earliest and sometimes the best sources of information as to the existence , nature , and extent of institutions , and of the books necessary to give particulars in regard to them , and which are rarely known at a distance . By consulting these and other works and documents , and by comparison of various opinions , I was usually enabled to decide correctly as to the course which I ought to take , to see what was most deserving of attention . However , sometimes erroneous opinions deceived me , and I found that my course had missed some interesting point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occasionally the error was irremediable , but not often . Again , as it was necessary to employ all periods of the year , I found it impossible to arrange my visit so as to pass through a country at the period of greatest activity in the schools . Where the system of public instruction was central , like that of France , or Prussia , recourse to authority pointed out the proper institutions to visit , and gained admission to them . The personal acquaintance which the teachers of Germany have with each other , greatly facilitated my progress in its several states . Almost everywhere , indeed , I have reason to remember with gratitude the kind assistance rendered to me . Having ascertained the places which it would be , probably , profitable to visit and the institutions to be examined , I regulated the time and the attention devoted to them , by the interest which they apjicared to present , returning to the same institution frequently or not at all , according to circumstances . As auxiharies to my investigations during these visits , I procured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also prepared beforehand a series of questions , to which , when modified to suit the particular establishment in regard to INTRODUCTIOJr. 9 which detailed information was desired , I obtained answers from the head , or from one or more intelligent persons connected with the establishment . The written and printed sources of information which are thus at the disposal of the Board , are 1st . A journal of my visits to different institutions , and of verbal information received in regard to them , with my remarks . 2d . Replies to a series of questions in regard to particular institutions , or systems of instruction . 3d . Statutes , by-laws , and regulations of different institutions . Laws and documents relating to public instruction , &c.; 4th . Histories , descriptions , and text-books of different schools . 5th . Particular works on education . These form a mass of documentary matter which , duly arranged and digested , * will always throw the light of experiment upon doubtful points in the working of our system of organization . In many cases the documents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions contained in the works on education . From this mass I propose to draw out some of the more prominent parts , and to call the attention of the Trustees specially to them . The personal experience gained by my tour will , however , as far as the Girard College is concerned , be its most important result . I could not expect the Trustees to follow me through descriptions or even notices of all the institutions which I have visited during my two years ' absence , or listen to a record of the many failures and mistakes which I have seen , and which , though they have formed one considerable item in the experience gained , it would be truly an ungrateful task to record . As best calculated to present the impressions , derived from this examination , of the actual results of education , I have adopted the descriptive form for my Report , and have purposely avoided summing up the conclusions , or presenting a review /z/ of them separately from the facts , that the force of the opinions may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that the remarks must be considered as general inductions from numerous facts , and not inferences from single instances , but these instances serve as their best illustration , if not sufficient , taken singly , to prove that they are just . These remarks suggested themselves at first as queries to be answered by further observation . This Report will be divided into two parts , the first relating to the means provided for the education of orphans , the second to the systems of general education . Corresponding to these divisions there are two groups of institutions which present , in general , different objects for consideration ; in the first , the government , discipline , and domestic economy , as well as the instruction are to be examined ; while in the second , the instruction is the chief point of interest . Every individual institution in the first group should furnish moral , intellectual , and physical education ; many in the second are necessarily more limited in their design . /z/ It is not very material in what order these institutions are discussed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their classification . The institutions selected to present to your notice , are a part of those of Great Britain , of the German States , and of Holland . I shall begin with those of Scotland , presenting next those of England , then of Hamburgh , then of Prussia , Saxony , and Frankfort on the Maine , then of Bohemia , and lastly of Holland . /z/ SCHOOLS FOR ORPHANS , &c.,; IN GREAT BRITAIN . The greater number of well conducted and endowed institutions of this kind are found in Edinburgh , while the oldest is the celebrated Blue-coat School of London . The schools of this class throughout the kingdom resemble more or less the most prominent institution existing at the time when they were founded . Thus the arrangements of the Blue-coat Schools of Chester and Bristol have , until lately , been similar , and the new Blue-coat School at Oldham near jManchester , has been modelled upon the excellent establishment of the same kind at Liverpool . In some of these older schools , as at Chester , changes have been very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their style of education as in the costume of the pupils ; while in others , as at Bristol , great changes have recently been made : in general , however , they are behind the more modern institutions . I propose to present in turn descriptions of the most prominent of the /z/ of this kind which I visited ; namely , of those at Edinburgh , called hospitals , founded by George Heriot , George Watson and John Watson , with a notice of Cauvin 's Hospital , a description of the Blue-coat School at Liverpool , with a notice of that at Oldham near Manchester , a description of the London Orphan Asylum at Clapton , and of Christ 's Hospital or the Blue-coat School of London . In these , and in general in other cases where a formal division of the subject may be necessary , it will be treated under the heads of , 1st . The history , buildings , general government , and domestic economy of the institution . 2d . The reception and dismission of the pupils . 3d . The educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and physical education . There are in Edinburgh seven education hospitals , six of which admit other inmates than orphans . The effect of thus receiving children whose parents are alive , of maintaining , educating , and providing situations for them , is supposed by many intelligent men to be injurious to the tone of social morals , * and to remove a stimulus to honourable exertion on the part of parents , by providing for their children if they surrender them , or , if the parents are disposed to struggle for their education at home , by placing them in unfavourable competition with others so educated . Such an opinion might be brought to the test of numbers , but I was not able to find that this had been done by any who entertained it The grounds of the argument , even if admitted to their full extent , do not , however , affect the establishment of orphan-charities , and a provision for the fatherless seems to have been the governing motive in the original foundation of at least three out of the five of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education , the Orphan Asylum is intended to fit its pupils for service , Heriof s and George Wat- /z/ son 's have each a provision for the higher instruction of boys of talent , and Cauvin 's is intended to educate teachers . The building for the Orphan Hospital is on a fine scale , and its interior arrangements in general so good , that I herewith submit the plans . It is , as to economy and discipline , on a similar footing with John Watson 's Hospital , of which I shall give a particular description , while in regard to instruction it occupies a lower level . On these accounts I have supposed that a special description of the establishment is unnecessary . The government is of the paternal kind , the household forming one family , of which the master is the chief . The moral , physical , and intellectual education , thus depend mainly upon one person , who acts , however , under certain general regulations prescribed by the trustees of the hospital . Fatherless children are received in this institution as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , originally designed for the maintenance and education of poor fatherless sons of burgesses , or freemen , * of the city of Edinburgh , was founded in pursuance of the will of George Heriot , jeweller , dated 1623 . By this will Doctor Robert Balcanquall , Dean of Rochester , and master of the Savoy , London , t was selected to draw up the statutes for the organization and government of the institution , and to decide upon the plan of a building . By the statutes of Dr. Balcanquall , dated July , 1627 , the government of Heriot 's Hospital is vested in the provost , bailiffs , council , and ministers ( of the established church ) of the city of Edinburgh , and the present building was erected between 1627 and 1650 . The charity has been extended to destitute children whose parents are living , and by a late act of Parliament the governors have been authorized to erect day-schools in the city * " For the maintenance , releife , bringing vpp and educaon of soe manie poore fatherlesse boyes , freemens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus of their income , after supporting the present number of one hundred and eighty pupils in the hospital itself. * This surplus is derived from the increased value of the estates held by the governors ; and the application of it to schools instead of to the increase of the hospital , was decided to be advisable , after much consideration and discussion . They were induced , no doubt , by the fact that ample provision is made for destitute children of various classes in the city of Edinburgh , and perhaps also by the doubt , to which I have already referred , of the utility of institutions extending education and maintenance to those whose parents are alive . My information in regard to this institution is derived from the printed documents , kindly furnished to me by the house-governorf and the treasurer of the hospital ; J from an examination of the books kept at the hospital and at the treasurer 's office , which , on stating the object of my mission , were most liberally opened to me ; from replies to my queries by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various hours , and from conversations with the governors and The government of the institution is regulated by the original statutes of Dr. Balcanquall , of which certain parts only are deemed fundamental , and by regulations and by-laws enacted from time to time by the trustees . The building is in the Gothic style , with the irregularities and excess of ornament which it permits , and is beautifully situated , overlooking part of the old town of Edinburgh , and having a fine view of its picturesque castle and of the new town . The house is divided into many small rooms , approached by turret stairs , in the style prevailing two centuries ago , but now deem- The prwent income of the inBtitution is not less than from sixty-five to mmtj thonwnd dollars . t The Hector Holme . j Mr. Bayley. 4 Ae Ibe iooroee of information in regard to different institutions are very tod have already boon stated in a general way , and ore now rei ) eatod I do not think it necessary to restate them at every new description . The Usiof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me 1 . /q/ cd inconvenient . It contains rooms for the meeting of the governors , for the lodging of the masters , a dining-hali for the pupils and for the masters , dormitories and vash-rooms , a kitchen , various offices , and bath-rooms . The room recently fitted up for the drawling-classes , is lighted from above , while blinds at the side windovts prevent cross lights . Many of the rooms have the necessary arrangements for lighting them by gas , and the means of heating have been lately improved by the introduction of warm air . The ventilation of the school rooms is , however , quite imperfect . Indeed , of the many buildings I have seen , very few are even tolerably ventilated , and it should be a matter of congratulation that our architect has devoted much attention to this point. * The court about which the building is erected , serves as a place of play for the boys at certain times , and to give them full liberty in their games of hand-ball , which seem to find more favour among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed on the outside of the lower windows , which protect them from fracture . At first the effect of these gratings of wire , suggesting the idea of the want of discipline , which rendered them necessary as a protection to the windows , struck me unpleasantly , but when I saw the great freedom which it gave to the younger pupils in their games , my first impressions were entirely removed . General Government and Domestic Economi/ of the Institution . The Board of Governors vest the internal management and immediate superintendence of the hospital in a visiting committee , who further divide themselves into sub-committees , meeting at the hospital at least once a fortnight . The housegovernor meets with these committees . It is usual also for members of the board to attend the Sunday evening exercises at the institution . The board is also divided into the following commit- * The consequence of defective ventilatiott , on those confined in school-rooms , has been often much insisted upon , and yet proper ventilation is very imperfectly understood .

Of auditors , who audit , yearly , the treasurer 's accounts . 2 . Of finance , who advise with the treasurer on occasion , and examine such accounts as the regulations do not refer to the treasurer and house-committee. 3 .

Of the superintendence of the boys after leaving the hospital . 9 . Of the erection of new schools . 10 . General visiting committee of all the governors . The officers* of the institution are - 1st , a treasurer , who receives the moneys for the register , pays the bills of the hospital , the salaries of the teachers , the expenses of every week as certified by the house-governor and an accountant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2d .

The checks for the payment of the officers within the hospital are sent there , with one also for the amount of servant wages , which are paid by the matron . 3d . The house-governor , who is the head of the institution , and also one of the teachers , and has a seat in the Board of Governors . He is responsible directly to the visiting committee or its sub-committees , and all the inmates of the hospital directly to him . Besides acting as the head of the family , he is required to teach daily , three hours , the boys of the elder classes , " such branches as shall be interesting to all these boys , whatever may be llieir destination in after life ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history ; geography ; liic first principles of natural history and of mechanical philosophy ; llio elements of English composition ; and the higher branches of religious instruction .

His accounts are examined once a month , by the house-governor and treasurer , and paid by the latter .

They receive the who are admitted by an order from the treasurer , or the house-gornor , and show them the various parts of the hospital . Reception and Dismission of Pupils , The rules require that application for admission shall be made at least three weeks before the periods of election in April and October . The applicants must be above seven years of age and below eleven . The cases are canvassed by a committee of the governors , and selections are made depending upon the degree of destitution , the character of the parents , the degree of instruction which the applicant has received , and his general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have lost both parents are in general considered as presenting the highest claims ; next those who have lost their father , and then those who have lost their mother , and lastly those whose parents are alive. * It is understood that certificates of the marriage of the parents , of the baptism of the children , and of the lather 's right as a freeman , must have been presented . The new comers are separated for twelve months from the rest of the boys at all times , occupying separate places in church and in chapel , and separate dormitories ; taking their meals and exercise , and visiting their relations at different times from the others . By this regulation it seems to me that the force of good example is made ineffective , and that each new set of boys require a new training . I am not aware when it was first enacted . It docs not appear in the original statutes , and was perhaps one of the measures used to break up a most shocking abuse of the system which prevailed many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys were the complete tyrants of the younger ones . So deeply rooted had the practice of this system , known as " Garin law , " t become , that it cost the expul- /q/ sion of some twenty pupils to eradicate it . I have every reason to believe that the true relation of the pupils to each other and to the nnasters , is now much better understood . It is easy to see that there may have been other reasons for the separation of the new comers from the other pupils , but none of those which occur to me seem to make it desirable . These boys are under female superintendence . The pupils in general leave the institution at fourteen years of age ; if a boy is not fourteen on or before the day for regular dismission , he remains another year in the institution , and certain pupils are retained until sixteen . The statutes provide that " hopeful scholars " may receive , for four years , a sum of money to enable them to attend the classes of the high-school as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education at , the University of Edinburgh . The institution pays the apprentice fee of such as are bound out , and gives gratuities to those who produce satisfactory certificates of conduct and progress . The regulations in regard to the arrangements for leaving the institution are highly judicious , and will be found in detail in the Appendix to this Report ( No . III . ) The governors require , six months before the time when a boy should leave the school , a report of his conduct , acquirement , and talents , from the housegovernor . One month before the same time a statement from his parent , or guardian , of the calling which it is wished the boy should adopt , the master who may be chosen , and the arrangements desired to be made for boarding . These matters are discussed , and the disposition made of the boy depends upon the result . The boy having been bound apprentice , the master can not receive the annual instalments of the apprentice fee , without answering certain queries as to the conduct and proficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two other similar series of questions , one addressed to the apprentice , the other to the person with whom he lodges , shall be furnished annually , and the treasurer is enjoined to keep a register of them . * See Appendix No . IV , 90 ELEEMOSVIfARV INSTITUTIOITS . On leaving the institution , each pupil receives an outfit of clothing , The boys intended for the university are maintained and clothed , and receive a certain sum per annum . Education , This term appears to have been considered by the authors of the regulations as synonymous with instruction , and accordingly , they provide that " the education which the boys receive shall be , as much as possible , accommodated to the capacity and prospects of each/'f The subjects of instruction , according to the order in which they rank in importance in the institution , are English ( / . e. spelling and reading , ) grammar , geography , and history , writing , Latin , mathematics , drawing , French , music , Greek , mechanical and natural philosophy , and chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two are exclusively occupied with the English studies , writing , and arithmetic . The third and fourth classes have one hour of Latin . The sixth has but one hour of the miscellaneous English studies , and the seventh has none . Natural philosophy is in fact not taught , and the chemical course has been cut off . Greek is taught only in its very elements . In the attempts to improve the courses of this school , to bring them up to the present state of instruction , the additional branches have been loosely attached , and the course is not now one consistent whole . The only remedy for this , consistent with keeping up with the progress of instruction , is to revise the entire course , from time to time , maintaining due subordination of the separate branches to the general plan of studies . The corps of masters is divided into resident masters and non-resident , a good arrangement when the teachers are numerous . There are resident in the house , besides the house-goveroor , whohas charge of the geographical and religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Om dosen aliirU , half a dozen pairs of stockings , a Bible , and other books . t Tlie kind of innlruclion which apioared necessary in the day of Dr. Balcan- quail , wo Uam from the sUtutes : " and bccaus that the scholleris salbe brocht io lettorU , their nlbo a iK-hoil maiutor whose office salbe to teache the scho- md and wfMtt ScotUs diHtincllie , to cypher and cast all maner of ac M aUo to tMohe yamo Uio LaUne rudimentis , hot no further . " /z/ the English branches , a mathematical , and a classical teacher . The non-resident teachers are those of music , writing , drawing , and French . The music taught is church music ; and the drawing , that denominated mechanical drawing . The principal labour of teaching the various courses is divided among five masters . Of these , the house-governor teaches three hours every day ; the other masters from six to seven hours , besides superintending the studies for an hour , and , in rotation , taking charge of the boys at rising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations being even responsible for them during play time . They are thus decidedly overburthened with labour , and the compensation which they receive for this devotion is not such as to attach them permanently to the institution . The methods of teaching the different general branches do not vary much . Lessons are given to be learned from books , either in or out of the school-room . Oral explanations are joined . The mathematical instruction is chiefly oral . In the English department the method of the sessional-school hereafter to be described , is intended to be practised. * The efficiency of this department seemed to me impaired by the distribution of the classes , each of the two masters having one division of each of the two English classes , so that there were always two divisions in the same master 's room at the same time , in different states of advancement . As but one of these divisions could be taught at a time , the other was occupied in preparing lessons under monitors . The regulation which requires these masters to teach the elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the classical department , by giving a different elementary preparation to the two divisions , which are afterwards united in the proper Latin class . The classical instruction is intended to prepare boys for the upper classes of * One of the English masters , the Rev. Jolm Oswald , has prepared a series of etymological works , carrying out the practice of the sessional-school . His Etymological Dictionary of the English language was republished here , with notes , by the late Dr. J. M. Keagy , one of the Trustees of the Girard College . // the high-school , and ultimately for the university . The Latin course extends to the partial reading of Virgil and Horace - and the Greek includes merely the elements . The principle is recognised that all the pupils are not required to pursue the classical courses , the propriety of which will at once be admitted , when it is stated that of sixty-two boys , forty-seven become apprentices to trades , and a larger number leave the institution at or before sixteen years of age . The plan of carrying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many objections . The study of Latin begins in the fourth class , or after the boys have been three years in the school . The regulations provide that " each boy shall have a fair trial of the study of Latin . If , upon the average of the first year , he be found in the lowest * tuxy-thirds of the class to which he belongs , he shall remain in that class for a second year ; and if , at the end of the second year , he occupy no higher place in it , he shall be withdrawn from the study , and shall be engaged in other employments . " The execution of this rule inevitably detains a boy who has not a talent for language two years in a class for which he is utterly unfit , injuring his habits of attention , wasting time which he might otherwise employ to some purpose , and reacting injuriously upon the class . In fact , a considerable number of the boys never , while they remain in the school , get beyond the fourth class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of those who pursue the Latin studies , very few succeed in securing the university places . Thus , for the sake of the few who can really benefit by the classical courses , the many are employed upon subjects which , to say the least , might better be replaced by others . I am far from being one of those who undervalue classical culture , but I am convinced that to be at all effective it must be thorough , that it can not be thorough when the instruction is terminated at an early age , and that there are certain minds very little or not at all improvable by language , at there arc others similarly related to mathematical studies . If the object of a school were to make professional men , I would have the classical course the rule , and then , consider as exrqttionnl cases those who , from character of mind , want of /z/ industry , inability from circumstances to remain sufficiently long in the school , or other causes , were unable to benefit largely by such a course ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended for trades , I would make the culture of mind depending upon classics the exception . It is easy to see how such a system could be contrived , and there are many institutions on the continent of Europe , which furnish examples of the plan . In regard to the instruction in French , the same seems to me to be true , whether we consider it as a means of cultivating the faculties , or as useful for future application . In point of fact , it is begun too late to acquire much knowledge of it before leaving the institution . With a view to inform themselves as to the results of their system of instruction , the governors have lately required from I those boys who receive pecuniary rewards during their apprenticeship , the presentation of three documents , before referred to , containing answers to certain queries . One of the sets of ques. tions is answered by the master , and relates to the conduct of the boy , as an apprentice ; a second , by the person with whom the boy lodges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , of his hours , &.c.; ; a third , by the boy himself - and inquires , among other points , into his hours of work , his occupations , and relaxation , and the utility of his studies , while in the hospital , to the business in which he is engaged . This excellent regulation has been in force only some three years , and hence the inferences , from the replies of the boys , are not as important as they will one day be . Even with a longer continued average , they will not be absolutely conclusive in regard to the value of the several branches of study , for it requires very good judgment to get rid of the idea that only the immediately useful is at all useful , and to appreciate the effect of general mental culture . As a result , however , of the ; t expression of opinion of forty-seven out of sixty-four boys , nearly all had found use for their arithmetical studies , and some for their English studies , including grammar , geography , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replies , seventeen in number , four were at the university , who , from the prizes which /z/ the " Hcriol 's boys " carry away in classics , no doubt found their Latin and Greek ( especially the former ) studies " useful ; " three were not minors , and two deceased ; leaving but eight out of sixty-four unaccounted for . Should the results of these queries continue to be as just stated , they will one day afford the strongest argument in favour of my position , that the arrangement is a defective one , by which , in an institution for the purposes answered by Heriot 's , the classics are made the basis of instruction . At present , other grounds are stronger . The mathematical instruction includes arithmetic , through fractions , and elementary algebra and geometry , and is upon the plan generally followed in the higher schools , and in part of the universities of Scotland . Oral explanations are given by the teacher , and examples are worked by the pupils , in concert or individually , by the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black board , at the dictation of the boy . This mode is accompanied by the working of examples , by the pupil , on the slate , but so far as the mechanical operations are executed by the teacher the pupil is deprived of the means of acquiring dexterity in wanting or drawing figures , and of ideas of proportion , and thus loses the opportunity of the education of both the hand and eye . This method , further , renders the knowledge of the pupils somewhat uncertain , since the operation of the master may precede the direction of the pupil ; and while it may be convenient in some cases , its general use appears to me injurious . Of this , I believe the intelligent mathematical master at Heriot 's is fully satisfied . There are two special prizes for excellence in this department , which are awarded on competition . The mode of instruction in drawing is the same as that used in the Prussian schools , and to which attention has been called in Scotland by the able Secretary of the Royal Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after learning the first dements of linear drawing , draw from models ; a simple perspective machine being used to give them an idea of the principles which ihcy are to put in practice . At first , simple solids , r heriot 's hospital . 25 bounded by straight and curved lines , are set before them , and drawn upon the slate . Then mouldings , and , gradually , more complex combinations of surfaces are given , and are drawn upon paper with the crayon or pencil . This method forms the eye admirably , but does little , I may say nothing , to improve the taste . Hence , it is rejected by some . Nevertheless it appears to me admirably adapted for the ordinary purposes of life , and especially for the use of those engaged in mechanical pursuits , and much superior to the system of linear drawing from engravings , taught in the primary schools of France . The method has the further advantage , that almost every pupil is able to acquire some proficiency in mechanical drawing and sketching by it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months before leaving the institution . When I visited the hospital , the hours interfered much with those of other departments . There is a writing lesson , of at least one hour a day , for each class , and two prizes for excellence have been established by a late governor . Religious and Moral Instruction , The positive religious instruction is given by the study of the Bible , the Evidences of Christianity , and the Catechism of the Church of Scotland . Family worship also is held morning and evening . On Sunday , in addition , the pupils are occupied one hour in the morning in the study of the Church Catechism , or of a Bible lesson or hymn , which they recite in the evening , and they attend church twice during the day . Besides this , the discipline of the school , repressing what is amiss , and encouraging virtue , acts of course powerfully ; the example of the elder boys , and the good order which prevails , tend to produce regular habits . The results of this combined moral education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pupils , when they are no longer under the fostering care of the institution ; and the answers to the queries before referred to , in regard to the conduct of the young men , given by the masters to whom they are apprenticed , and by those with whom they lodge , exhibit these results in a highly satisfactory point of view . Of forty-seven sets of answers , forty were entirely to the credit of the young /z/ men , on the part of the masters , and forty-six on the part of the persons with whom they lodged . Of the seven falling under censure , three had not made satisfactory progress in their business ; two were , in addition , absent sometimes ; one was complained of as not doing his errands punctually , and only one was of the class considered decidedly vicious . I have found no subject of discipline , in regard to which more diversity of opinion exists , than as to the appropriate amount of intercourse with relatives to be allowed during the stay of a boy in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not breaking such natural ties as the boy may have , is obvious ; and , on the other , the injury resulting from bad counsel , undue indulgence , and even , in some cases , bad example , becomes not less so from experience . According as one or other of these disadvantages predominates in the teacher 's mind , he is favourable or not to frequent intercourse with relatives . In Heriot 's Hospital , the pupils can not leave the house for the purpose of visiting their friends oftener than once in three weeks , unless under special circumstances , of which the housegovernor is the judge . Those who live in town are received at the door of the house by a relation , who is charged with their return at the appointed time . Those whose relatives Hve in the country have , if the visiting committee , or house-governor , see no objection thereto , a vacation of three weeks during the month of August . The relatives who reside in Edinburgh , are not allowed to visit the pupils unless when called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sick . Those who reside in the country , must obtain permission from the housegovernor to make visits . So much depends upon the character of the relatives and connexions of the youth , that it appears to mc no other rule , than to give to some officer a discretionary power to permit the absence of pupils , can be adopted , until the particular circumstances of the institution are carefully studied . To keep in remembrance the good deed of the founder of the school , the first Monday of June is celebrated as his birthday . Cloeely connected with the intellectual and moral education /q/ Stand the rewards and punishnnents adopted in the institution . These consist of places in the class , and in the superintendence over their fellows in the house , in indulgences of visiting or re- I ceiving friends , in prizes for proficiency or good conduct , in the greater or less extent of their instruction while in the house , in pecuniary allowances during their apprenticeship , or to enable them to pursue a university education , and in assistance even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-school , preparatory to entering the university , lodge in the house ; an arrangement which I saw extended with great effect at Amsterdam , and elsewhere in Holland , to all the pupils who are apprenticed in the city . The regulations require that , " the I more degrading kinds of corporal punishment shall be as seldom as possible resorted to ; " and yet counteract the good effect of this provision by directing that " they shall not be inflicted in the private classes , but only in what is called ' the public school , ' in presence of the house-governor , " thus rendering the degradation most certain by the publicity of the punishment . It is true , these chastisements are rarely inflicted , and the regulations provide that " they shall not be resorted to for mere literary negligence , if unaccompanied by moral blame . " The house-governor has great latitude in regard to the character of the punishments , and I am sure exercises a sound discretion in reference to them . There can be no doubt that it is more dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than to harden him by corporal chastisement . Hence such chastisements may be preferable in certain cases , where reproof has failed , to a continuance of the attempt to correct by admonition . This supposes it to be administered in private , without temper , and as a last resort . Some dispositions are better acted upon by the deprivation of indulgences by confinement , and similar penalties of this class , where remonstrances have failed ; while others require something more immediate in its action . In many schools in England , where the rod was once freely used , it has been almost , and in others entirely , laid aside . In schools like these , where the youth is entirely dependent upon the institution , I am fully // persuaded that , with proper treatment , it need be resorted to very seldom , if at all . Few dispositions are not open to kindness , espcpially under these circumstances , and no master has the qualities appropriate to such an institution who prefers the repulsive system to the encouraging . 1 refer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest against the modern improvements in discipline , and their relinquishment of such means is a stronger argument than could be derived from the more gentle discipline of the continent . The spirit of kindness between master and pupil which exists in many of the continental schools , the confidence that renders him , as it were , the head of a family circle , are delightful to witness , and insures , better than stripes , the obedience of his pupils . I believe that this species of discipline , which leads the pupil # instead of diiving him , may be considered as particularly congenial to the American character . The governors of Heriot 's say that " it is earnestly recommended , that as far as possible , preventions of fault be employed ; and that gentle treatment be practised with the children . " Thus , as far as their recommendation goes , they are on the side where I should prefer to range myself . There is one point in which the teachers at Heriot 's have not the means of acquiring that moral control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education during the play hours is not attended to by them . It is true that each of the teachers , in rotation , is responsible for the order of the house ; but he has not the immediate superintendence of the boys . In such an institution especially , this is of importance , and the many hours of occupation in teaching , which prevents the intimacy of the masters with the boys during periods of relaxation , is a serious disadvantage . That such an intimacy it extremely important to moral training , no sound educator now doubts ; and it is certain that much teaching in school is not equivalent to moderate training out of school , to form the moral man . &#9830; Servants can not supply the place of the teacher . The general principle which I would here inculcate , is distinctly recognised in lome of the best training-schools which I have seen , and heriot 's hospital . 29 renders the infant-school system of moral training in Scotland so perfect . Physical Education . A due attention to this branch , though fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding from the common sense of every one a ready assent as an abstract proposition , is yet strangely neglected in many establishments which I have visited . The clothing and diet , at Heriot 's Hospital , are good in quality , and ample in quantity , and cleanliness is sufficiently attended to . The linen is changed thrice a week , the stockings as often in summer , two suits of over-clothes* are allowed a year , and are an adequate supply , in a climate where very slight changes are required for comfort in the different seasons . The bed linen is frequently changed . The arrangements of the lavatory for the pupils are good , each lad having the means of washing and wiping separately from the rest , and the opportunities of bathing are furnished in warm weather.f The boys are brushed and combed daily . The cleanliness in the dormitories , school-rooms , &c.,; appeared to me satisfactory , and the ventilation of the former is unexceptionable , and is made the subject of a distinct regulation , requiring the bed clothes to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in summer and seven in winter ) until ten A. M. , and the windows to be kept open until three P. M. in winter , and seven P. M. in summer . I have already remarked upon the imperfect ventilation of the school-rooms . The pupils walk out frequently in summer , five or six miles , and make excursions dur- * The allowance of other clothing per annum , is three day-shirts , one nightshirt of check , four pairs of stockings , two pairs of suspenders , four pairs of shoes and mending , two pocket-handkerchiefs . The latter are looped to a button in the pocket to preserve them , and must be shown at the daily morning inspection . The making and mending of the shoes , and making of upper clothes , is contracted for . The uniform , when I visited the school , consisted of a brown coatee , which they intended to change for a roundabout , corduroy pantaloons , and a cloth vest . t The change in these respects , within the memory of some most respectable citizens of Edinburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed from one vessel , and wiped on one long towel ! The influence upon moral training of a state of physical education which permitted such things , must have been great . The practices , of course , tended to the propagation of cutaneous diseases . /z/ iDg the tfiree weeks ' holiday of August , when about two-thirds of the school are still together , to Roslin and Stirling . A system of gymnastics was adopted some years since , for affording regular and graduated muscular exercises , but it has fallen entirely into disuse . After the novelty had worn off , the boys grew weary of the exercises , and greatly preferred the ordinary sports of the schools . I have had occasion to remark , as applying to the English schools in general , that the gymnastic exercises , so popular in some parts of Germany and Switzerland , had not taken root in any of them , though in many they had been introduced , and well and carefully taught . At the same time , nothing is more characteristic of the English school-boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schools . The greatest number of play hours is three per day , according to a schedule furnished me , and this seems to me , from comparison with the other schools , quite too small , especially for the younger boys ; and the unbroken succession of several hours in school , is also objectionable . The amount of time which these boys are employed in the class-room , frequently reaching for the elder ones to eight hours a day , and the variety of subjects brought before them in their short course , at the longest but seven years , appears from observation to be highly detrimental to intellectual development . It is , indeed , said to diminish the amount of repressive discipline necessary in tfie institution , by taming the spirit by over intellectual work , but a saving of this sort is a real loss . It is probable that the diet , and Hmited amount of exercise at Heriot 's , may also have something to do with the absence of youthful buoyancy and activity which I noticed among the pupils . The practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the three regular meals will not explain , as I first supposed it would , this observation , since it does not involve necessarily any excess of food . And besides , I found the same practice in schools in Germany , where a like effect is not observable . It prepares the pupils badly , however , for their diet in after life . The kind and quantity of food will be found stated in the Appendix ( No . VII . ) The boys do none of the menial work of the /z/ house , and even that relating to them personally is attended to by servants . The dormitories are cleaned , the beds made , the arrangements for meals provided and removed , the clothes are brushed , shoes cleaned , &c.,; by the servants of the institution . These boys , brought up thus to be waited upon instead of waiting on themselves , must , when they leave the school , find their position of attending to the wants of others particularly irksome . Indeed , many of those persons who receive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other common affairs of life are attended to by them , underrate exceedingly the results of their education . This effect is increased by their ignorance of ordinary life . The masters having no families , those boys who never leave the school have no opportunity of witnessing any other than the peculiar modification of society which the hospital affords , and even those who do visit their friends , form only such an acquaintance with life as a few weeks in each year can give . In the only government school of our country , the Military Academy at West Point , where youths are received , whose parents are in all the various circumstances of life , an opposite plan is pursued in regard to the duties of the house and personal police ; and I have reason to know , from personal experience and an extensive acquaintance with its graduates , that the independent habits thus produced are retained by many as among the most convenient results of their early training . From the documents so liberally put at my disposal in Heriot 's Hospital , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency to remove the pupils from the class , as to occupation , of their parents , and to place them in others requiring a higher grade of mental cultivation . The registers for the last three years contain the pursuits of the father of each pupil admitted , and the occupation of the pupils who have left the institution . The fathers of sixty-seven out of seventy-three boys were tradesmen or shopkeepers . Of the sons , fifty-six became tradesmen or shopkeepers , six followed other occupations , ten were not stated on the book , and two had died . Distributing this number of /z/ twelve , in the ratio of fifty-six to six , we have sixty-six to seven , nearly , as the ratio of those who followed the trades to those who went into other occupations , or nearly the same as above stated in the case of the parents of the pupils . Of these boys , the number who have embraced the same occupation as the father , he being alive , is eleven , and he being dead , two , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son to follow in his father 's footsteps , is of course much greater than in ours , but it amounts only to thirteen in sixty-two in the case under discussion . While , then , the education at Heriot 's has been freely spoken of as reflection prompted me , I do not find any evidence that , under the circumstances which exist in Edinburgh , it can be charged with a tendency unduly to increase the professional classes . Exactly an opposite objection has been urged against the institution , viz. that from its foundation to the present day it has not produced a single great man , in any department . That it has furnished many useful citizens , and some , who in their places have been distinguished , is certain . To use the language of a most excellent divine of Edinburgh , " if it has not produced distinguished men , it has infused into the industrious classes a considerable number of sober , steady citizens . " Many of these have risen to civic honours , and become governors of the institution which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to subject it to the test of producing results to which education is entirely incompetent , is rather preposterous . School systems may aid in developing mind , but it is not their province to produce it . They address themselves to averages of intellect , all of which are below greatness . /z/ This institution , which was modelled on Heriot 's hospital , resembles it in its general outline ; there are , however , some differences which will be worth remarking , especially as I am inclined to think that the proper relations between the pupils and their teachers are here better understood . It is true that Heriot 's contains between two and three times as many boys as GEORGE Watson 's hospital . 33 the Watsons ' , and the difficulty of treating them as individuals , increases greatly with the numbers . Histonjf Building , c . This institution was founded by George Watson , who , by strict economy and prudence , first in the situation of a clerk , and then trading on his own account , died an independent and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacies to his few surviving relatives , he left the bulk of his estates , 12,000 , to found a house of education* for the children of decayed merchants of Edinburgh . The present plain structure was erected about 1724 , by the company of merchants and other trustees of the bequest , on a lot belonging to Heriot 's Hospital , and opposite to that edifice . The organization of the Board of Governoi*s who direct this establishment , is quite similar to that already described for Heriot 's , being however more simple , because they have less property , and a smaller institution to manage . The office of treasurer is now only an honorary appointment . General Economy , The head master performs the duties of the house-governor at Heriot 's , and the matron that of both matron and stewardess . They each receive , in advance , a sum for incidental expenses , of which the master renders an account to the visiting committee , and the matron to the master . The contractors for supplies render their accounts quarterly to the head master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the treasurer . There are two porters , one of whom must be a tailor . He is a married man , and his wife receives an allowance for keeping the gate . The porters in turn have charge of the boys at play hours , of their rising and going to bed , and one superintends their bathing while the other sends them by sections to the bath . AdmissioUy Spc . These boys are , in general , sons of persons who have had more cultivation than the parents of those who are the objects of Heriot 's bounty ; more is required of them * The income is now between thirty-three and thijty-four thousand dollars . /z/ for admission , and they are older when they enter * Those teachers who knew both institutions , generally thought that the greater docility of character observable in the pupils of Watson 's Hospital , resulted from their better parentage ; but I confess that this idea made little impression on me , as the different management of the boys in the two schools would be likely to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The requirements for admission are reading , and a certificate that the child has been one year at school if admitted at seven , two years if admitted at eight , and so on up to eleven , the greatest age at which he can be received . The pupils may thus remain in the school eight years or only four , being required to leave it at fifteen . The less age at entering is in favour of Heriot 's ; but it must be considered that the boys at Watson 's are , in general , those who have a parent , or parents , and may have been well though humbly brought up before entering . I am , therefore , disposed to think that we may reason upon the results produced in the two houses as though the circumstances , in reference to the pupils , were originally the same . The objects to be attained are , however , very different . These boys are intended to be educated as merchants , or for professions . The records which I was enabled , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that out of ninetyfour boys who were apprenticed on leaving the school , fifteen were indentured to merchants , twenty as clerks , nine to professional men , six to occupations of other kinds , and forty-four , only , to tradesmen or shopkeepers . In Heriot 's , the number apprenticed to tradesmen or shopkeepers was in the proportion of qwq /q/ eighty-five out of ninety-four . This leads us to consider the kind of education which is given for the principal object of this institution . Intellectual Education , It seems to me that the regulations recognise the principle that certain branches may be less useful for particular pursuits than others ; and yet , the instruction varies from Heriot 's only in being rather higher , in carrying the pupil further in classics , both in Latin and Greek , and in geography and history . The modern languages are not more particularly insisted on , and the courses , in general , in the English branches , arithmetic , 6z:c. , are not very different from those in the other school , though they seem rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils with a similar effect , a fact which I found admitted by all the masters , though , as they had a certain course to teach , and on the average but six years for its accomplishment , they saw no remedy . The same over-tasking of the masters , and low salaries , lower , indeed , except in one case , than in Heriot*s , on account of which changes were frequent . There is , further , the same injunction to celibacy . The teachers are here promoted in rotation ; and , although the head master had been but three years in the institution , he had passed through the two subordinate stations . This regular promotion has several very good features , as applied to the two subordinate masters ; but , in reference to the head master , it produces unfavourable results , as he is required frequently to give instruction in branches to which he may not previously have attended . With one hundred and eighty boys , as at Heriot 's , the discipline and superintendence are sufficient to occupy one person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited number of pupils in this institution . There are , here , three resident masters for seventy-six boys , and in Heriot 's , five for one hundred and eighty , the advantage being on the side of this school . The resident teachers instruct in classics , Enghsh , and mathematics , the latter courses being under the charge of the head master , who also teaches the elements of chemistry . The pupils are divided into three cor- S6 ELEEMOSYNARY IFfSTITUTIOlTS .. regponding classes . There are no formal meetings of the masters as a board , but the three have similar duties , and take turns each in superintending the pupils at meals , in the dormitories , and , in general , at play . Further , the head master is neither raised above the others by being a governor , nor by various minute regulations , as at Heriot 's , and hence all work more harmoniously together . There is a peculiarity well deserving of notice in regard to the courses here , and I have seen the same in several flourishing institutions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid down , but every year are passed upon by the education committee of the governors , on the presentation of a list by the head master . The programme is , in fact , made out after consultation with the other masters ; but there is no regulation requiring the head master to advise with them , which , as a matter of duty , and not of his own pleasure , he ought to do . That this revision is necessary every year may be doubted , but in an old established institution , where routine is prone to take the place of reasoning , and where it is so difficult to keep the courses up to the actual level of education in general , it may be fairly assumed that the error , if any , is on the proper side . The prizes for intellectual effort and conduct are quite high in this establishment , and their effect is considered to be very great . They consist in the distribution of about ( $100 ) in books , after the annual examination ; the inscription of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the classes for correctness of conduct , on a tablet in the governor 's room ; and in allowing those who are fit to pursue the course of the university , one hundred dollars for four years , to attend there , and eighty-five dollars for two years subsequently , their examinations and conduct being satisfactory to the committee on education . Unmarried pupils of the age of twenty-five years , who are not provided with capital to commence business , may receive from the governors , on presenting satisfactory testimonials , two hundred and fifty dollars . Thus encouragement is held out to merit long after the pupils have left the protection of the alma mater . Those who are apprenticed to lawyers , surgeons , /z/ &c.,; are enabled , by a like liberal policy , to pay the large fees required in such cases . Moral Education . I have already hinted that I consider the relation existing between the teachers and boys at George Watson 's to be an agreeable one . The general system by which this result is produced depends , in part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the masters . Frequent walks are taken under the direction of the masters , depending upon the previous good conduct of the whole school . Ten or a dozen boys are invited to take tea in the teacher 's room during his term of duty as house-master , the expenses being defrayed by the institution . Encouragement is given to their sports , to gardening , &c.; A prize for good conduct is bestowed by the boys themselves , and , in fine , there is a general endeavour to substitute the influence of the good opinion of the instructors for artificial stimulus to intellectual exertion and good conduct . Though the punishments approved are mainly the cutting off of indulgences , yet flogging is allowed ; the article in reference to the corporal punishment in a " public school " at Heriot 's , in regard to which I felt constrained to remark , is here so far modified , that the head master 's presence in a private class is the necessary formality . Those pupils whose conduct has been satisfactory during the week , are allowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Saturday . The teachers believe , from observation , that these frequent visits are of service ; their conclusions , however , depend much , no doubt , upon the average character of the relatives of the boys . Physical Education . Regular gymnastic exercises have never been introduced here , but the boys are supplied with balls , battledores , &c.,; and receive lessons in dancing . Their excursions in summer for several days , frequent walks , bathing once a week , cultivation of gardens , and habitual cleanliness , keep them in general good health . The arrangements for clothing* /z/ and diet are , in the main , the same as at Heriot 's . They are , however , more troubled here with eruptions on the head . Some institutions are much annoyed by this scourge , which requires almost absolutely the separation of the infected from his class-mates . The cultivation of gardens is encouraged by an annual prize ; the gardens are divided into four parts , and each one given to an individual of the same class ; the four thus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is distributed . There is a vacation of six weeks after the yearly examination in August , during which one of the masters remains in the house , with such pupils as have no friends to receive them , or who , from other causes , do not leave the establishment . The dormitories , in general , are not well arranged . Two boys are placed in each bed , and the rooms locked up at night , the head master having the keys . If a boy is sick , there is a bell to summon assistance . These arrangements appear to me to be very defective . The bedsteads are of iron , and answer extremely well /z/ This is the most recent school of its kind in Edinburgh , having been organized in 1828 , and thus the experience which it furnishes on certain points must be most valuable to the board . One of these is , the expediency , and , indeed , the necessity , of the gradual organization of an institution ; and the other , the propriety of leaving the regulations relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment before enacting them into laws . By following out these two ideas , this institution has been organized , brought under its present doioy pMUlooM . Lcnther caps for the house , and cloth for the street .

It can not , however , be said to have yet taken its ultimate form , and I feel persuaded that many modifications will still be made in its arrangements . History , Building , SfC , This establishment , for the education of destitute children from any part of Scotland , was founded from fundsf left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signet , J in the year 1763 . The present capital is chiefly in bank stocks , and exceeds three hundred and fifty thousand dollars ; the yearly income is about fifteen thousand dollars . The building is situated a little out of the city of Edinburgh , towards the northwest , occupies a high and healthy position , and is surrounded by grounds neatly laid out , having a garden in front , and in rear play grounds for the children , and a bleaching ground . It is a neat structure , with a centre and wings , the centre having in front a Grecian Doric portico . One of the wings is appropriated to the accommodation of the girls , and the other to that of the boys , with some few exceptions . I shall speak only of the boys ' accommodations . The interior is commodiously arranged : the basement contains a play-room for wet weather , a bathing-room , laundry , refectory , kitchen , pantry , masters ' offices , and parlour . This playroom is almost an essential , as the school-rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bad weather , the children must have cover either in or out of the building . The bath is well arranged . Between the kitchen and dining-room is a convenient turning-box for supplying the food , transferring the plates , * Of these , nineteen have lost both parents , seventy-two father , one mother , and eight have both parents alive . t The original object of the testator was a foundling hospital . Convinced of the evil of such institutions , a change in the objects of the bequest was petitioned for , and made by Parliament . X Attorneys entitled to practice in the highest civil and criminal courts of Scotland , and forming the society of " Clerks or Writers to the Signet . " The title is derived from the fact that it is one of the privileges of these attorneys to &#9632; ubscribe the writs which pass the royal signet in Scotland . /z/ &C.; On the first floor are the rooms of the master and assistants , of the governors , the chapel , and three school-rooms . An attempt has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entries , but this has not been effectual ; the school-rooms are cold , and the temperature can not be kept up except at the expense of the ventilation . The second floor contains workingrooms for the boys , dormitories , rooms for the sick , and offices , matrons ' apartments , &c.; The whole house is lighted by gas , and is supplied with water from the city works , two most important conveniences , which I found highly appreciated by those who had previously been without them . General Government and Domestic Economy . The general government is vested in fifteen trustees , of whom three go out every year in rotation ; they are elected by the commissioners of the writers to the signet , and meet regularly but three times a year . They have a treasurer , a clerk , and assistant , as permanent salaried officers , and are divided into visiting committees of two , who are expected to visit the hospital every fortnight The officers recognised by the regulations are : a master and one assistant , a matron , a surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the in-door concerns , superintending the boys more particularly , and having the religious instruction specially under his charge . The matron has the care of the girls , and attends to the housekeeping concerns . The master keeps a petty expense book , a waste-book , and ledger , and the matron a book of disbursements for housekeeping . The surgeon visits the institution regularly twice a week , and comes also whenever sent for . The servants of the house consist of a porter , two nurses , three house-maids , four chamber-maids , one cook , and an assistant The porter has charge of the gate and grounds , calls the boys in the morning , superintends them while washing , morning and evening , at play , and wiicn they bathe , and assists at meals . * The pretent head maater in the Rev.

JOHN Watson 's institution . 41 One of the nurses attends specially to the cleanliness of the younger boys , and in general to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the maintenance and education of each child is about one hundred and nineteen dollars . The uniting of the two sexes in one establishment for education , however favourable it may be at a very early age , is afterwards attended with so many difficulties , some of which are insurmountable , that the governors of this hospital have gradually diminished the number of female pupils , and the head master would gladly see the establishment divided into two , neither the instruction nor discipline which is suitable to one sex answering for the other . Receipt of Pupils and their Discharge , The pupils must be between five and eight years of age at entrance ; and it is very perceptible that the early age at which they are received is a decided advantage to this institution . Their pliability and exemption from bad habits are conditions which should not be lost sight of At the opening , twenty-five boys and twentysix girls were admitted , and when they were trained during a year , a further admission took place . Notwithstanding the great care thus exercised to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excels in the kindly character most likely to win upon a child , the training of these twenty-five boys was not effected without much difficulty , and , in fact , three of them were expelled during this year . The first set being well trained , the others have fallen gradually in with the example of their elders , and no further expulsions have been necessary , though seventy-nine boys and sixty-six girls have been since admitted , up to 1836 . In fact , the institution was begun on too large a scale , limited as its organization may have seemed . The admissions are made on petition to the governors , setting forth the destitution of the child , to establish which it is necessary to show that its parents or friends have not the means of furnishing a good education . The petitioners must include in their number a commissioner or writer to the signet . There are no requirements of previous instruction . Illegitimate of /z/ diseased children , are not received . The pupil is first admitted on a week 's probation , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is then fully admitted ; if not , his friends are bound to withdraw him . The pupils leave it at fourteen years of age , and there is no provision whatever for their subsequent superintendence or advancement ; if the children have friends who can take care of them , this is no great hardship , but such children do not seem to be the proper objects of charity . That the orphan should be thrown upon the world at this age , with ten pounds , and a Bible , does not seem to me judicious , and this part of the out-door establishment I should regret to see imitated . The result has been , I was informed , to induce the selection of children of persons who have occupied higher stations and are reduced , in preference to others more destitute . Thus , out of ninety-eight children , the parents of twenty-two belonged to professions , forty-three followed other avocations , and thirtythree were tradesmen or shopkeepers . I am fully persuaded of the very great importance of keeping up a connexion until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution , though it may be necessary to apprentice him to a trade at fourteen or fifteen years of age ; and in a future part of this Report the practice in reference to this , of some of the orphan-houses of Holland , is fully explained . Intellectual Education . The course of instruction proposed by the head master is very comprehensive ; indeed , much more so than I believe the time will allow to be carried through , without distracting the mind of the pupil by the diversity of subjects presented to his notice . This plan of instruction is an extension of that at Heriot 's , and offers a very systematic arrangement of the branches , and a detailed distribution of the time . ( See Appendix , No . V. ) Only a portion of the plan , however , is executed , and I am satisfied that such must continue to be the case , unless an arrangement is made by which different trains of instruction shall be pursued by different sets of pupils , according to their mental development and JOHN Watson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course includes spelling , reading , grammar , composition , writing , plain and ornamental , arithmetic , algebra , book-keeping , geography , general and particular , modern and ancient , history , modern and ancient , drawing in pencil , chalk , and colours , of maps , &c.,; the elements of natural philosophy and chemistry , and of natural history , geometry and mensuration , surveying , and the elements of the Latin and Greek languages . The statutes of the school provide for the appointment of two teachers only , the head master and an assistant . It has been found necessary , however , to have , besides , two sub-assistants , one for each of the three classes into which the boys are divided , the head master exercising a general superintendence of the whole , and teaching only occasionally . To render comparison of the proficiency of different classes more easy , they all recite upon the same branches at the same time , as far as practicable ; thus , for example , all the classes are engaged in arithmetic or reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one to another to obtain an idea of their comparative progress . The present sub-assistants are young men , who have been brought up in the institution , and both , I believe , are attending the lessons of the high-school , preparatory to entering the university ; the assistant was educated at Heriot 's . Each teacher has , in general , charge of one class in several different branches , according to the method now practised in the best schools of Germany . In the other schools which I have spoken of , each master has a subject , or a few subjects , which he teaches , and different classes come before him at different times . This , it is objected , prevents any strong attachment from growing up between the children and the master , of whom they see but little , and who from hour to hour is changed for another . On the other hand , it is contended that a man can not be equally competent to teach different subjects , and thus his instruction in all the branches is not given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the opinions are true , to a certain extent . That the first principle is entirely applicable to elementary education , and the second to a later period , when // the subjects of instruction become more difficult , and the positive knowledge of the master of more importance ; and this happens just at the time when the influence of the instructor would , from the development of the child , necessarily become weaker , and when , if the youth has been properly trained , he is prepared , in a degree , for self-government . Thus each principle is good in its place . The three classes are subdivided each into three sections , corresponding to the different degrees of progress , and which contain boys , when intelligent and studious , of about the following ages : the first class of six , seven , and eight years of age ; the second of nine , ten , and eleven ; and the third of twelve , thirteen , and fourteen . The whole number of pupils in 1837 was one hundred and sixteen , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average class , which is about the same number as that of a class at Heriot 's Hospital . The head master is here very far removed in duties , privileges , age , and compensation , from the under teachers , presenting the opposite system from that adopted at Heriot 's and George Watson 's , of bringing together several experienced teachers of a standing similar to that of the head master . The plan in use here has some advantages in regard to moral education and discipline , where the number of the pupils is not large ; but the other , I am satisfied , produces much better results as to intellectual development . Moral and Physical Education , It is exceedingly difficult to atcertain what is the essence of moral discipline , for , ahhough the regulations in regard to it may be the same in two institutions , yet the practice under these may differ very widely . Kindness or severity of manner and disposition , in enforcing a rule , may render it practically either gentle or severe . The regulations here do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , but the air of family life pervading the establishment can not fail to strike every observer , while , in the others , especially in Heriot 's , there appears to be more formality of discipline ; niid yet . in all three , the rules of the institutions /z/ are adhered to . This is one of the cases in which the teacher may make or mar a system . The means of promoting good conduct are here as in the other schools ; for rewards , the approbation of the teachers , increased opportunities of amusement , social parties at the master 's , and prizes ; for punishments , admonition , flogging , and expulsion . There are offices of superintendents in and out of school , in the dormitories , &c.,; which are considered also as rewards , and which work well under close inspection , and by frequent change of the boys in authority . Small sums of pocket money are given by the head master , at his discretion , to the boys , and the supplies from parents or friends must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the master in administering the regulations , which , probably , more than the laws themselves , lead to the state of things I have endeavoured to describe . First , small indulgences now and then prevent the necessity for grave punishments often repeated ; and second , punishments must be so applied as never to produce in the subject of them the feeling that the measure of the fault has been fully paid ; but , on the contrary , so as to satisfy him that something has been forgiven . The religious instruction does not differ materially in amount and kind from that already described . There are no regular gymnastic exercises , but in the intervals of recreation the children engage in a great variety of games , the implements for which are furnished by the master , and in which the teachers frequently take part with good effect The deprivation of these sports is made a means of punishment The loan of materials for play , such as marbles , &c.,; obviates an objection sometimes urged to certain games of skill , viz. that they produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk out frequently , accompanied by a teacher , make *pic nic " excursions , and celebrate particular days . Cleanliness is carefully attended to ; the face and hands are washed morning and evening , the feet once a week in winter , and oftener in summer , besides which the boys bathe ; on these occasions the pupils are attended by a teacher and the porter . // The arrangements for washing are not good ; basins of tinned copper have been tried , which do not answer well , and a trough is required for the feet . Inspection is made every morning in regard to cleanliness , , and the due order of their dress . Scald heads are frequent as at George Watson 's , and the same means of eradicating and preventing the disease from spreading , are employed . The leather caps in use fitting closely to the head , contribute , I doubt not , to the complaint . ' The diet is the same as at Heriot 's , except that here nothing is taken in the intervals of the regular meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils do no menial offices in the house , except that of cleaning shoes , which is done for the whole family by a certain number of the elcfer boys in rotation , who rise earlier than the others for this purpose . Each boy has a separate bed , except in the dormitories for the youngest , where there are two in a bed , and of which a T nurse has charge . In the other dormitories , one of the subassistants sleeps , or one of the elder boys has charge of the dormitory , and the assistant sleeps near . The clothing is similar to that at George Watson 's . The leather caps are , however , to be laid aside , and cloth ones substituted . Order of the Day , The order by which the distribution of duties is regulated , presents peculiarities , in the succession of study and play , well worthy of attention . The following is for the winter season . The pupils rise at seven ; from seven to half past , washing and dressing . Half past seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . Nine to quarter past nine , breakfast Quarter past nine to ten , play . Ten to half past eleven , school . Half past eleven to twelve , play . Twelve to one , school One to half past one , dinner . Half past one to three , play . Three to five , school . Five to six , play . Six to seven , school Seven to a quarter past seven , supper . Quarter past seven to eight , play . Eight to half past eight , prayers . Half past eight to nine , wash and go to bed . The happy effect of the judicious variety in study and exer- /z/ cAuvin 's hospital . 47 cise , and of the moral discipline of this institution , are proved by the cheerful character of its pupils , and their general health and spirits . The hours of study in this plan are six and a half , and of play four and a half , during the day of fourteen hours , while at George Watson 's they study nine hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about four weeks in the month of July , and the children may be visited once in three weeks by their parents , for two hours at a time . The master here is confident as to the bad effects of allowing the children to leave the institution , for the purpose of visiting parents or friends ; in regard to which , however , I have nothing new to jemark. /z/ This institution was founded in 1832 , pursuant to the Will of Lewis Cauvin , a teacher of French , in Edinburgh ; and is intended for the education and maintenance of the sons of teachers and farmers . As the founder was himself a teacher , and the want of seminaries for teachers was most deeply felt in Scotland , the trustees of Cauvin 's determined that the new institution should contribute , as far as practicable , to the supply of this want . The children enter between the ages of six and eight years , and nearly all those now in the institution have been there about four years ; the twenty pupils required to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible at this early date to draw a positive inference as to the success of the school , and especially of its primary object . The character of the trustees may , however , be considered as a guarantee for the first , and , in reference to the second , there are already indications that three or four out of the twenty boys now in the establishment will probably have a disposition for the profession towards which it would incline them . It may be important to remark , that as these boys can only be at the charge of the school until fourteen years of age , and as this is * The income is about five thousand dollars per annum. // loo short a time to complete their education , those who are most promising will perform their novitiate as teachers in the hospital , thus continuing their education , while they serve as instructors to those younger than themselves . I shall recur to this topic , of the use of orphan- schools as seminaries for teachers , in speaking of the Orphan-house of Hamburgh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interest well educated young men to adopt a profession , the proper exercise of which is of such high importance to our future prospects and the permanency of our institutions . The implements of instruction in this establishment are better than in any other of the same kind which I saw in Scotland ; they have obtained the most approved maps , &c.,*; from abroad as well as at home , and have already the rudiments of a collection of natural history . I have appended certain documents , relating to the form of application for admission to this school , ( Appendix , No . VI. , ) which may be useful for reference . /z/ This institution , in point of order and regularity , is one of the best which I have seen ; and , as a study of how far an establishment may be carried on by the force of routine , interested me very much . At the time of my visit the head master was absent , and the boys ' department was entirely under the charge of a young teacher , formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourable for judging of the point to which 1 have just referred . The arrangements have a military precision about them which is very striking ; and if the object of a school were to perform , as much as possible , with very limited means , t the organization of this one would serve as an Tbeie collections were made under the direction of Professor Pillans , of the University of Edinburgh , one of the trustees , and to whose influence is mainly doe the direction given to the studios of the youth in Cauvin 's institution . t Each child costs for roaintonanco and instruction less than fifty dollars per iMMiin . At the Orphan Hospital at Edinburgh , each costs between sixty-five and MVWUy dollars . At John Watson 's one hundred and nineteen , and at Cauvin 's two hundred and fiAy dollars . /q/ excellent model . Though successful in producing a considerable effect upon the pupils in general , the means of individual education are to be found in the subsidiary arrangements of the school , and not in its general system . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that division of the system of mutual instruction which originated with Dr. Bell , whose precepts and practice , as contained in his Manual , are mainly followed . While the Scotch schools which I have described have obviously borrowed something from each other in their arrangements , this institution is in a totally different sphere , both intellectual and religious . In the regulations , every case which has occurred , or which has been foreseen , of violation of discipline , or interference by parents , and the like , has been provided for by formal rules - a plan , the expediency of which I much doubt . The punishment of offences against morality may be provided for by general regulations , and cases of interference on the part of parents , by vesting discretionary power in some of the authorities of the institution . The regulations required by a contrary course , if read to the school , must suggest many offences otherwise not thought of . In the progress of the institution , the decisions of cases actually occurring will establish precedents which supply the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lodged somewhere and by investing chosen agents with it , the trustees of an institution may be almost certain that it will be exercised with knowledge , and the power of revision , on appeal , must of right be theirs . History , Buildings , c . This institution was founded by voluntary subscription , in 1708 , and assumed something of its present form in 1717 . It is intended to give education and maintenance to destitute children , who have lost their parents , or whose parents have been reduced in life - these children to be taken from those " above the lowest class in society . " It is managed by a board of trustees , * whose executive officer is the treasurer , who , though an honorary officer , is /z/ // nevertheless expected to attend both to the out and m-door management . The head master is the chief within doors , and is assisted by a matron and female teachers for the girls , and by three assistant masters for the boys . A surgeon and physician are the only other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when not in school , and seeing that they go through the routine of the day . All attend in the refectory for the preservation of order , and to ascertain that the wants of each pupil are duly supplied . They also , in turn , attend the boys in their walks , and sleep in rooms adjoining to and having a view of the dormitories . All the boys ' classes are united for instruction in one long room , the whole being under the charge of the head master and senior assistant , and each class being taught by its assistant master , or by the pupils appointed to act as teachers . Frequently the hearing of lessons is delegated to these pupilteachers , the master having previously prepared the class by explanations intended to remove difficulties from the way of private study . At other times , the master hears the lesson himself , or is present when the pupil-teacher hears it , or goes over the ground with the class , after the teacher has done hig part . A class is sometimes divided , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil-teacher , and then changing the divisions . As the higher classes have respectively seventy , ninety , and forty members , it would be impossible for the master , alone , to instruct to any advantage . The youngest class , on the contrary , is quite small , and always in the hands of a junior master . Although the system of mutual instruction , which was first applied by Doctor Bell is , in general , followed , it is , as may be inferred from the details above presented , in a modified form , with a considerable share of the personal attention of the masters in teaching . The place of a pupil in the class depends upon the answers which he gives in the recitations , and upon his conduct , a fixed On an average , in this institution , Uiero arc four sick per week , in the whole Dumber of two hundred and fifty boys and one hundred girls , and one dies in the OMUMofUifMyean. /q/ system of rules being adopted in regard to every circumstance Mhich can cause a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the places are registered every day , and the average at the end of the quarter gives the standing . There is a general new classification of the school every quarter , and those who are fit for a higher class are then promoted . When , however , a pupil is remarkably superior to the rest of his class , he is promoted without waiting for this term . The system of emulation thus adopted , is supposed to excite considerable diligence . It appeared to me to do so really on the part of a very few near the head of the class , who had the competition for honours before them ; but below the middle it did not produce any effect until towards the lower end , where its results were evidently bad . I found all the intelligent persons connected with this institution so thoroughly convinced of the efficacy of the monitorial system , that I paused in drawing conclusions in regard to it until I had compared this school with others upon the same or a similar system ; it is , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell or Madras system , or , rather , of a modified form of it . The gentlemen above referred to are convinced that the pupil-teachers are not only competent to give instruction , but that they frequently communicate it in a more intelligible form than teachers who are further removed by age and knowledge from the boys ; that the emulation among the pupilteachers of different classes induces their pupils to exert themselves more than if under the charge of the master , and that the pupil-teachers are sufficiently exact and impartial in administering the rules of discipline and instruction . I state these opinions broadly , not wishing to conceal that the views of others , who have experience in the matter , are adverse to my own . I observed as closely as my opportunities would permit , here and elsewhere , and came to the conclusion that , in communicating knowledge not merely mechanical , the pupil-teachers are generally at fault , that they fail to keep up the attention of the pupils , and to preserve order among them , except in presence of the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administering the rules . It is true , that if a class // of ninety is to be confided to one master , monitors may be usefully employed to prepare the pupils for him . A similar plan is pursued at the best school on the Bell system which I have seen , the Madras College at St. Andrew 's , Scotland . Further than this , I do not believe that monitors can be usefully employed , and where the means of procuring a sufficient number of good teachers is not wanting , I would not at all recommend the use of the monitorial system in imparting instruction . The branches taught in this Blue-coat School are in accordance with the destination of the boys in after life . They consist of spelling , reading , writing , mental and written arithmetic , English grammar , geography , the history of England , elements of astronomy , the catechism and religious doctrines of the Church of England , and the singing of church music . A few pupils receive instruction in geometry and music , and those who show a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of preparation , by being apprenticed as masters in the school . The opportunity of drawing fron engravings is also furnished . Much time is devoted to the mechanical branches of general instruction , such as writing , making printed letters , and drawing maps , 6z:c . More than nine hours per week are given up by the eldest class to such objects , besides those devoted to printing in the evening . The pupils are so fully imbued with the desire to succeed in these pursuits , that as an expedient to induce a preparation of the reading lessons , those only who have read well are allowed to attend the writing exercises . It has been found advisable to vary the subjects of their reading lessons very considerably . Formerly the Bible was the only book used for reading , and beside that the associations with it as a text-book appeared not to be favourable to religious impressions , the pupils became so used to its phraseology as not to be able to read understandingly other works , although they could read this with tolerable fluency. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the pupils question each other , is well carried out in this school ; every boy thus must ask aswell as ansver questions . It , hovrever , offers considerable practical difficulty . Some hold back from diffidence , others from fear of showing ignorance by their questions , and others are incompetent to it from ignorance of the subjects . Moral and Religious Instruction , One of the things which struck me most on my first visit to this school , was the extensive acquaintance with doctrinal religion which the boys of the eldest class manifested . My surprise was removed , however , on learning the method by which this result was obtained , and which consisted in devoting the morning hours of winter , and at other seasons when the weather did not invite to a walk , between rising and breakfast , to learning commentaries on the doctrines of the Church of England , commencing in the fourth class with the Catechism of the Church of England , * the collects , prayers , 6z:c. ; continuing in the third class with the explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to memory the chief doctrines of the church ; in the first , with committing the references by which the doctrines are supported . I felt bound to examine faithfully the question whether this was a mere intellectual effort , or whether the Christian truths thus inculcated made an impression upon the hearts of these children ; and I regret to state that I was forced to the conclusion that , in the greater number of cases , the heart was little affected by what the tongue repeated , and the intellect assented to , and this conclusion was in accordance with the result of my inquiries . It is true that the seed thus planted may lie hid to germinate in after life , and this , no doubt , sometimes occurs ; but , as a general rule , the measure is found to be unproductive , as far as its immediate effects have been observed . /z/ The religious services in this school , on Sunday afternoon , are very remarkable for their order and decorum . The pupils are marched into the room , and receive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oflf to their places . The prayers are prepared for the school , and are read by one of the pupils , appointed as a mark of approbation . The singing , which is respectable , is accompanied by an organ played by one of the teachers . The psalms and hymns are given out also by one of the boys . A monitor puts part of a class through the catechism . The services are thus from beginning to end carried on by the pupils , with the exception of the assistance in music by the master . The treasurer , and frequently others of the trustees , attend these services , and the parents or friends of the pupils are admitted on presenting a ticket from the treasurer . The revrards for good conduct are , the approbation of the teachers , permission to read the books in the school library , of which there is a very judicious selection , offices of trust in the school , and recommendations to situations after leaving the institution . In regard to the use of the library , which I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a remark . When a judicious selection of childrens ' books has been made , and it is found that there is no desire to read them , the instruction is radically defective . Few children care to read what they do not understand , and , if taught merely mechanically , the books selected for their use will be unintelligible , and hence uninteresting to them . The amount of use , therefore , of the lending library , is a test of the thoroughness of the instruction , and of its being of the explanatory sort . There may , of course , be exceptions to this rule , arising from the over-employment of children at other work , by which they are prevented from using the books , and from other causes ; but I speak now of the general rule , which I found most fully proved by numerous observations . There are vacations of two weeks at mid-summer , and of a wock at Christmas . No punishment other than the position in the class is applied /q/ for not being on a par in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy is " put into Coventry , " and his classmates , when seeing this badge of punishment , are not allowed to speak to him. * Corporal punishment is used , but the rod is not habitually in sight as a motive to exertion . Immorality is punished by flogging , and , if not amended , by expulsion . Physical Education , There are no regular gymnastic exercises or amusements , but all the pupils are taken frequently to walk for exercise , and , during the course of the morning school , which lasts from nine to twelve , each class has , separately , a few minutes of recreation , being marched into the court-yard , under the charge of the monitors . The play-ground is not very large , and is paved with round stones , and there is a covered way on one side for wet weather , an indispensable appendage to such an establishment : under this each boy has a box in which he may keep his ball and other play-things . The menial duties of the house , and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they serve the table , wait upon it , clean their shoes and clothes , make their beds , &c.,; and are nearly independent of the use of servants : in my opinion , aQ admirable regulation . One of the boys even acts as porter , which , as it is a responsible and profitable situation , is made a reward for character , and is attended with certain perquisites , matters of custom in those countries , but inconsistent with the ideas entertained in ours . The allowance of clothes , hnen , &c.,; is the same as in the Scottish institutions . Three shoemakers are constantly employed in making and mending shoes for the pupils . The girls knit the boys ' stockings , and make up their linen , and the mending of clothes , &c.,; is done by persons residing in the house . The diet is very plain , but wholesome-f The entire cost of the food for each child is about forty cents per week , or less * The use of any badge or mark of this sort is liable to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already remarked . /z/ than six cents a day . A table of diet is subjoined in the Appendix . The supper , consisting of cheese and bread , is distribated in the refectory , and taken to the school-room to be eaten , the water being previously drunk at the table ; a custom which produces several inconveniences . The arrangements for washing are by no means convenient , the boys using the wash-room for this purpose morning and evening , and the hydrant in the yard after dinner and supper . They occupy two dormitories , overlooked by windows from the tutor 's rooms . The bedsteads are of wrought iron , the mattresses of straw . Two boys occupy the same bed , a plan upon $ which I have already commented . The pupils sometimes march to and from the refectory to the sound of music , and a very tolerable band of fifers has been formed from among the boys . /z/ As this institution is modelled upon that of Liverpool , * of which I have spoken somewhat in detail , I shsj.ll offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which seem to me of interest . The foundation results from the will of Mr. Thomas Henshaw , f a hatter , of Oldham , a manufacturing town near Manchester , who left , in 1810 , the sum of two hundred thousand dollars to endow a " Blue-coat School . " This endowment now amounts to nearly four hundred thousand dollars , and the school has a revenue of near eleven thousand five hundred dollars , for its support . By the will of the founder , no part of this money was to go to erect a building for his school , and if the town of Oldham did not raise the funds for that purpose , Manchester was to have the option to do so . The sum required for the building was , however , nearly all raised in the town of Oldham , and much of it among the workmen of the different manufactories , who clubbed together when The head nuistcr was brought ap at tliat scliool. f ThU same charitable individual has also left a fund for the education of the /z/ /q/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presented singly . The building , in the Elizabethan Gothic style , is now the pride of the citizens of Oldham , who have erected it . The interior arrangements , of which I have procured the plans , are of unequal merit . Those connected with the diet , clothing , and cleanliness , are good. * The attempt to heat the house by the circulation of hot water has not proved successful . The school-room is covered with an arch , and the reverberation has been so annoying as to render it necessary to hang it with cloth . This is done in the compartments of the Gothic vaults , two pieces of cloth being stretched across at right angles to the axis of the arch , and others intersecting each other , so as to form a St. Andrew 's cross : the appearance is not bad , and the remedy is effectual . This institution was opened in 1834 , when fifty boys were admitted between the ages of nine and ten . There are now ( 1836 ) two hundred boys , and the funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organization were very great , owing to the late age of the pupils , and especially to the number introduced at the opening of the school . Nearly the whole time of the head master has been , heretofore , so occupied in arranging the details of maintenance and discipline , that he has been able to give but little attention to the instruction , which , though the institution had been in operation upwards of two years when I visited it , was by no means in the condition which he desired . These difficulties must have been much lessened by the fact , that the model of the Blue-coat School of Liverpool was followed as closely as possible in all the arrangements ; that the master was educated there , and had to apply his knowledge under very similar circumstances . Notwithstanding this , the task has been very great , and the lesson it teaches ought not to be lost upon us . It was one of the examples which induced me to express myself strongly in regard to this point , when describing the organization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results being the same in these two cases . It is so difficult to unmake , that a preparatory system for the trial of a plan , by which the development may be gradual , and mistakes avoided at the final organization , must be very desirable . The wish to begin an institution on a scale commensurate with its future entire organization , is a natural one , but it should yield to the lessons of experience , which have every where shown that a small beginning is preferable . It is easy to train a few pupils , and those who follow are influenced by their example . In a novel undertaking , the teacher , though of well tried skill in a different school , requires also training in this . Finally , the regulations which work well elsewhere , may require modifications which experience only can point out . If legislation and counter legislation would be avoided , the rules should be tried upon a scale which permits close observation of their results . The application of laws deduced from practice elsewhere , under new circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as theoretical , and , therefore , the laws themselves cautiously introduced . /z/ The Orphan Asylum at Clapton , near London , presents a set of rules so admirably arranged for the application of an ingenious system of rewards and punishments , that it deserves a detailed examination , which I must , however , preface by a few remarks on the general arrangenents of the institution . This Orphan Asylum is supported by voluntary contributions , and hence derives an income of about forty thousand dollars , upon which are maintained and educated between three and four hundred children. * The immediate control of the institution is vested in a board of managers , elected at the general annual meeting of the contributors . From this board is chosen a visiting or house-committee of twelve , who meet every week at the asylum . They superintend the education Actually three hundred and forty-gix in 1836 , of wliom about two hundred wv boya . The coat of each pupil for the year , including his maintenance and waa nearly one hundred and aeven dollars . /q/ and household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such matters as belong to the female department , it does not form part of my purpose to notice . There are two secretaries , a treasurer , who is a salaried officer , and a collector . The building erected for this institution , the plans of which are submitted with this Report , is highly convenient and quite ornamental . It consists of two wings and a retired centre , and the interior arrangements are particularly good . The whole building is supplied with water by a steam-engine in the cellar , and which is used , also , for some of the laundry work . The kitchen and laundry arrangements are , in general , similar to those at Oldham , with the advantage of the use of the steam-engine . To be admitted to this Orphan Asylum a child must be fatherless , and between the ages of seven and eleven . The application for admission must be signed by a subscriber , and accompanied by certificates of birth , 6z ; c. , and by a certified statement of claims to admission . The child must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any imposition is discovered in regard to any of the statements upon which it was admitted , is required to be withdrawn . Two respectable housekeepers must become securities that the child will be withdrawn , at any time , on the requisition of the board of managers . Children who have been in the workhouse are not taken , except under very peculiar circumstances . On the payment of one hundred guineas into the funds , the board may receive , if they see fit , a child not belonging to the class for which the establishment is particularly designed . The regular admissions are decided by ballot , a printed form containing the names of the children , their claims , and other particulars , and a convenient mode of voting , being furnished to the stockholders , on application to the secretary . All the pupils leave the school when between thirteen and fourteen years of age ; and , in case of satisfactory deportment , the board of managers very generally procure situations for them , with the consent of their friends , though they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at leaving , a certificate of conduct , and , on examination , one of proficiency , and the child /z/ is furnished with a suit of clothes , and other articles of wearing apparel , a Bible and prayer book , and printed advice on his conduct ; receives a charge from one of the members of the board , and , in addition , may have presented to him the sum of fifty dollars . To keep up the connexion of the pupils with the institution , an annual meeting is held , for attendance at which each one receives an honorarium , increasing in amount with the time elapsed since he left the school . From these sums contributions to the asylum are frequently made , for special objects , by the former pupils thus assembled . The boys are not allowed to visit their friends , except in case of the illness of the latter . They may receive visits between two and half past four , P. M. , on Wednesdays , and their friends who wish to pay such visits must apply at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in general , but once a quarter . The house is opened to strangers on Monday , between eleven , A. M. , and five , P. M. , on presenting a ticket from a manager . The officers for education and police are , a master and chaplain , the offices being , at the present time , united in the same person ; * assistant masters , a matron , and a mistress for the girls . Besides the house-servants , who are females , there is a gardener , who acts as porter . The master is principal of the establishment , of which he has the entire superintendence , under the house-committee . He gives all the religious instruction , and also teaches , in part , the higher classes in other subjects . He is responsible for the due execution of the plans matured by the board . The assistants are directly under his control , and he has a vote on their appointment , to enable him to exercise which with due care , they are not permanently attached until after a three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school . The matron is a housekeeper to both departments , hires the &#9632; ervants deemed necessary by the committee , superintends the whole domestic economy , receives the stores , and is responsible * The Rev. Mr. Heath . /q/ for them . A table is spread in her room , at dinner and supper , for the mistress of the girls ' department and the assistants . She is the keeper of all the keys , when not required by the masters . The assistants not only give instruction , but attend the boys at rising . and washing in the morning , at prayers , meals , recreation , washing in the evening , and going to bed , performing these duties in rotation . There is , notwithstanding , no appearance of that family feeling which might be expected to grow out of such an intercourse ; probably from the tendency of the regulations presently to be detailed to introduce different feelings . The order of the day in the institution is as follows : The pupils rise at six in summer , and seven in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occupy until seven in summer , ( eight in winter . ) At seven there is school , in summer . At eight , breakfast . Play until nine . At nine , public prayers . From twenty minutes past nine to half past twelve , school . At one , dinner , and play until two . At two , school until half past four . Prayers and play until half past six . Supper and play until half past seven . Muster , washing , bedside prayers , and retiring at eight . In summer they may be kept up until half past eight . They have thus , during one part of the year , six hours and a-half of school daily , and about four hours of play . There are a few regular holidays in the year , and July and August may be vacations for a part of the masters . There are two excursions annually , made under the charge of some of the trustees or masters , by those boys who have merited indulgences . The subjects of instruction are those belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely adapted to the age at which the boys must leave the school , and the system of teaching is a modified form of Dr. Bell 's method . The diet is plain and wholesome . An abstract of the diettables of this and other institutions will be found in the Appendix , No . VII . The clothing is good in quality , and sufficient in quantity , and is admirably preserved under the charge of the excellent matron of the establishment . Rooms are appropriated for the /z/ clothes in use , and they are served out by the boys who have charge of divisions . The cleanliness is superintended by a nurse , who is under the charge of the matron . The continuance of female superintendence over the elder boys seems to me objectionable . Besides the ordinary sports of youth , which an ample playground attached to the buildings admits , the pupils have a species of gymnastic exercise , from half an hour to an hour daily , out of doors when the weather permits , and in doors at other times . The in-door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the body , and in this respect are better adapted than more violent ones , to the true purpose of gymnastics for ordinary life . For youth , I much prefer an extension of their ordinary sports , when out-door exercise is possible , especially if regulated according to principle , to the violent exercises which are commonly adopted in the systems of gymnastics . I am satisfied that a skilful physician would , by observation , produce something much more adapted to the inclinations of our boys , than the very artificial system of gymnastic exercises ; which has , I believe , never permanently succeeded in any institution either in this country or in England . This account is sufficient to give a general idea of the institution , and I now proceed to a description of its peculiar plan of education , before alluded to , in reference to rewards and punishments . There are two tables of rewards , the one for petty , the other for great merits . These classes of merits are compensated , the first by rewards in money according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second by gifts made at the public examination . Among great merits are considered all cases of voluntary , patient , and persevering labour by a child , whether in the business of the school , or in occupation of his own selection . Corresponding to these are two tables of punishments , for petty and great offences , which are visited , the first by fines , and the by flogging or solitary confinement . The ordinary rewards are bestowed , and fines levied in a currency of tokens , bearing the designation of one , ten , /z/ /q/ and twenty mark pieces respectively , and of which ten marks are reckoned at the value of a penny sterling , ( two cents . ) An account of the issues and receipts of them is kept to prevent barter , and as an index of the general conduct of the school . All cases of exemplary punishment are entered into the master 's book . When any pupil has obtained a certain number of marks , he is entitled to present himself before the house-committee , at a monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of using this money are provided - first , a library , to which those who subscribe a penny a month have access , a right to recommend a book for purchase to the master and secretaries of the institution , and a voice in the choice of a boy as treasurer and librarian . The school currency is not received in payment of this subscription . Second , a small shop kept by one of the boys , selected by his fellows for that purpose , at which are sold , at prime cost , articles of stationary , books , useful toys , and materials for drawing and mechanical pursuits . Third , a shop kept by the wife of the porter , where fruit , cakes , &c.,; are sold . Those children , on the contrary , who are fined beyond the marks which they have received as rewards , are considered as defaulters , and must by extra work recover their solvency . While defaulters , they can neither hold office among their fellows nor vote for officprs . The boys who have been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher punishments , are considered as " free bOys ; " they alone are eligible to trusts , and may be candidates for honorary medals . They are , further , entitled to make two excursions a year , with one of the housecommittee or one of their teachers . If a boy have lost his " freedom , " he may regain it by six months of solvency and exemption from high punishment . Those who for a year have been remarkable for diligence and good conduct , receive a " student 's medal , " and those who have held important offices , and discharged their duty to the satisfaction of the masters , receive a high honorary medal , which they wear , unless degraded . The whole school is classified in the order of conduct each fd ELEEMOSYNART INSTITUTIONS . month , and the list presented to the house-committee . This list is suspended in the school-room , two days before its presentation , that any boy may have an opportunity to appeal to the master , if he thinks himself improperly rated . For their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half yearly a prefect and sub-prefects . These latter have charge each of nine boys , whom they select in turn , forming thus a squad of ten , or decad . The master has in this , as in all other cases of selection of officers , a veto upon the choice made by the pupils . These and other officers of the school are rewarded for the performance of their duties , and punished for non-performance , the fines for neglect and rewards for the discharge of duty being in proportion to the importance of their office . A part of the morning of every Saturday is devoted to the making up of accounts , reports , and similar matters . No pupil is allowed to leave the establishment without an examination by the house-committee into his conduct and progress , which , if satisfactory , entitles him to a certificate . A month before leaving the school , the claims of a pupil to have his name inscribed on the " table of honour , " are decided by his fellows , who may petition the master on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is presented to the house-committee . The annual meeting of the children , both in and out of the house , has been already alluded to . Many of these rules may appear trivial to some persons who are in the habit of treating as " boys ' play " the occupations of children , but to those who see future citizens in their pupils , I am sure the details will not appear irrelevant . It should never be forgotten , that the basis of our institution is an elementary school , and that if this basis is unsound , we shall in vain work at the College , which is its superstructure ; we shall in vain try to produce good citizens , intelligent tradesmen , mechanics , teachers , engineers , navigators , merchants , or scholars , unless we have rightly trained the children , who by a wise provision in the Will of our founder , are to bo early placed under the protection of his institution . Of those who view the matter seriously , many object to the /q/ introduction of pecuniary rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as my opportunities would permit , and with the adVantage of a free communication with the amiable master , with his first assistant , and others , to ascertain whether any permanent bad effects had shown themselves , but I could not learn that such had been the case , or that these boys appeared more sordid or avaricious than children generally . In regard to the general effect of the regulations it is certainly good , for the boys are cheerful and healthy , gay and well disposed in the play-ground , with great docility and a reasonable degree of quickness in the class-room . Of course much of this depends upon the judicious manner in which the rules are executed , but if they were radically defective , the results must have indicated the fact I believe that the system of family discipline , duly carried out , would produce even better results , but such a plan is incompatible with a limited expenditure , from the number and character of the agents which it requires . Upon this point , however , I have elsewhere already insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system pursued at Liverpool and the one just described , I should give this the preference . /z/ This is the oldest and most wealthy of all the institutions in Great Britain having a similar object , and it is the one which gives the most distinguished of its scholars , after leaving its walls , the best opportunities of rising to the stations which their talents warrant . We have seen that a few of the Heriot 's boys were sent to the university , but , in Christ 's Hospital there is a systematic selection of a number of pupils for the English universities , where success is sure to lay the foundation of future prosperity . Though this school is not characterized by the practical turn which must distinguish the Girard College , yet , from the age to which a part of its pupils are retained , and the degree to which its studies are carried , it will afford instructive matter of examination . The great scale of the institution , so much beyond any other in Great Britain , and , indeed , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interesting , and the acquaintance formed vvith its intelligent masters and officers , * was a source of great personal gratification . History and Building , Christ 's Hospital was founded in 1552 , by King Edward the Sixth , and was opened in the old monastery of Greyfriars , which had been given by Henry the Eighth to the City of London , for the use of the poor . It seems that from near the period of its foundation one object of the institution was its use as a classical or grammar school , though to what extent it served this purpose does not clearly appear . In 1577 the Writing School , so called , was formed to supply great defects in the English education of the pupils , and in 1673 the Mathematical School was established by Charles the Second , for the education of officers for the naval and merchant services , by special instruction in mathematics , navigation , and the kindred branches . In 1676 originated the Preparatory Establishment for young children now at Hertford ; and thus were completed , within about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four establishments of which it may be considered as at present composed . The number of governors of Christ 's Hospital now amounts to four hundred and twenty , including , as ex-officio members , the lord mayor , aldermen , and council of the city of London . Of these governors a standing committee of forty has the general charge of the affairs , being responsible to the general board , which meets six times yearly. - f-  The capital is invested chiefly in landed or funded property , the latter being the most productive . The income for the year 1836 , deducting moneys paid for stocks and passed to the building fund , amounted to the enormous sum of three hundred and - thirty three thousand dollars , by no means all of which , however , was absorbed by the current expenses , and these are so I WM indebted to William Vaughan , Esq. , of London , for an introduction to the iMtitulion , which opened every avenue to information in respect to it . f In lb3Q tlicre were in the Hospital at London and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , - in 1833 , thirloen buodrod and tliirty.five. /q/ various in kind , that they can not all properly be charged against the education and maintenance of the pupils . There are between thirteen and fourteen hundred children on the charity , the average maintenance of each of whom costs a little over one hundred and ten dollars , and including all expenses except the management of estates , &c.,; about one hundred and ninety dollars . The buildings of the institution at London have , in later years , undergone thorough repairs ; new ones , in a Gothic style , resembling the older ones , have been erected , and the assemblage is now one of the most imposing to be found connected with any similar establishment in the world . They are still constantly undergoing alterations upon a regular plan , and thus a steady improvement in this respect is secured . The large dining-hall , with the offices below , the writing-school , and the mathematical school , are beautiful specimens of architecture , and admirably suited to their uses . The cloisters , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which connect others , are excellent places of play for wet weather . The kitchen , large lavatory , * and other offices deserve examination . General Government . The chief executive officer is the treasurer , ! who not only manages the estates , but has the control of the institution , and is , in fact , its presiding officer . He is a member of the board of governors , is chairman of all committees , and when the committee of forty are not in session , has discretionary power of action . He is allowed a deputy , called a receiver , and a clerk . The standing committee of forty regulate all contracts , and the bills on articles thus purchased are paid by the treasurer or receiver . Other bills require the signature of three of a committee of auditors consisting of twelve members , of whom six are from the larger committee , and six from the general board . /z/ The officers render accounts once a month to the committee of forty , and the cash book is submitted to their examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steward , beadles , &c.,; are paid quarterly , at the counting-house within the Hospital enclosure , by the treasurer . The house-servants ( females , ) are paid by the matron . The out-door servants and labourers , by the receiver , monthly . The steward receives monthly in advance for petty expenses , for which he accounts . To transact the business of the counting-house , the following officers are required : - 1st . A chief clerk , who conducts all correspondence , attends meetings of committees and of the board , ( called courts , ) &c.; 2d . A receiver , who is the treasurer 's deputy , and assists the clerk as secretary at the meetings of committees . 3d . A wardrobe-keeper and chief assistant clerk , who , under contracts made by the committee , inspects , receives , and delivers all apparel , and assists in the counting-house. 4th . Two other assistant clerks , who are selected from among the pupils of the school . 5th . Two messengers . All articles required for the establishment , except provisions , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those who superintend their use . Besides the officers connected with the estates , are a solicitor , and a surveyor , who is also the architect , and who has his office within the buildings . All the officers hold their appointments at the will of the governors , and the treasurer has the power of suspending any one of them , reporting the case to the committee . Besides the servants already mentioned , are a porter for the front gate , a gate-keeper for the private entrance , who also attends to the lamps in the courts , two watchmen , a cook , who is required to keep two servants to assist her , labourers to light fires , bring water , &c.; The porter is expected to attend to the fire-engine and plugs , and to be responsible for their good order . To be sure that the watchmen are on the alert at every hour of the night , the following ingenious plan is adopted . A dial-plate moved by a clock , presents a number of holes corresponding to the hours , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clock-case ; a pin is required to be inserted into one of these holes , which can only be done at or near the proper time ; and if omitted , the want of vigilance is detected . Admission c . The presentations of candidates for admission are made in the meetings of the governors , each member of the board having a right of nomination in turn . The cases are then discussed and Voted upon . There is no precise limit set by law to the income of a parent which would exclude his child , but each case is separately considered. * There is also no qualification as to previous instruction . The age of admission is between six and ten , the same fixed upon by Mr. Girard for the admission of orphans into his college . There is no obligation on the governors either to bind out the children who are to enter their apprenticeship when they leave the institution , or to maintain them in any way ; there are , however , various benefactions , which have been placed at the disposal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals . The boys of the mathematical school are appointed in the navy , or apprenticed in the merchant service , and the most distinguished pupils of the grammar school have various scholarships open to them at the universities . Intellectual Education , Various changes have been made in the instruction at different times since the foundation of the institution , to bring it more nearly in unison with the general condition of education of the day . It is not necessary to detail these alterations , but merely to give some account of the present state of the schools.f The objects of the education here may be considered as threefold . First , to fit boys for trades or mercantile pursuits ; these pupils leaving the institution at about fourteen years of age . Second , to fit boys for the naval or merchant service ; these pupils having a special course in the /z/ mathematical school , and leaving the institution at the age of sixteen . Third , to fit a chosen few for the universities ; these devote themselves to classics , mainly complete their instruction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about eighteen or nineteen . The preliminary school at Hertford is the nursery of the establishment , and from it , as vacancies occur , the pupils are transferred to the London house . It is expected that previous to this transfer , the boys have acquired some knowledge of English , of arithmetic , and of the rudiments of Latin . On arriving at the London school , they join one of two great divisions which are equal in standing , and one of which attends the grammar school in the morning and the writing school in the afternoon , the other alternating with the first , and the time of attendance being changed every alternate week . The grammar school is divided into two departments , called the upper and lower schools , each containing three classes , those of the lower school designated as the junior , middle , and upper classes , and of the upper school as great Erasmus , deputy Grecians , and Grecians . The head master has the special charge of the upper school , giving instruction personally to its two higher classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every six months . All these classes alternate in their attendance at the grammar and writing schools , except the deputy Grecians and Grecians , who attend the mathematical school for three hours on two afternoons of the week . The lower school is directly under the charge of two masters , who use the same books and pursue the same general course , and who are in part assisted by monitors from the upper school . The instruction consists of spelling , English reading , grammar , geography , Latin and Greek rudiments , and an introduction to the church catechism . The classical lessons are Latin or Greek grammar , construing and parsing , and exercises . In the writing school these same boys are taught writing , arithmetic , book-keeping , the drawing of invoices , and all matters intended to fit them specially for the counting-house , and At pTMont tha Rev. Mr. Rice , to whose politcneaii I was muoh indebted . /q/ writing from dictation is added to improve their orthography . There are two masters and two ushers for this school . Twenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing once a week , but as the hour fixed for the purpose is at present during the time of " half holiday , " but little use is made of the privilege . The pupils of the lower grammar school are carried thus as far as the Heriot 's and George Watson 's boys of Edinburgh , and the greater number of them have arrived at the age when they leave the institution to be apprenticed to trades and similar occupations . The courses of instruction here are more concentrated , and in those just named of Edinburgh , include more useful branches . Both are liable to the objection that much time is spent upon matters which are not pursued far enough to secure the mental culture which would otherwise result from them , and yet which have no bearing upon the future occupations of the pupils . In reply to this objection , it may be said , that it is impossible to discriminate between boys at this early age , and to discern who have the aptitude for a thorough training by languages , or who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult may be freely admitted , but that it is impossible I do not believe . With the resources of an institution like Christ 's Hospital , the number of teachers may be so far multiplied as to permit an accurate study and appreciation of the actual talents of a youth , and to watch the progress of their development ; on the average , the appreciation would be just , and remedies for cases of error or of late development are easily provided . But , if we suppose the discrimination impossible , and that all must receive , up to thirteen or fourteen years of age , an education to prepare them for the business of life , in a lower occupation , or one introductory to higher studies - with which individual will the case be the harder ? With him who , having received the lower kind of instruction , has the talent to push himself into the higher studies , and who , besides , remains at the institution for several years for this purpose , or with him who is at once to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in- /z/ formation introductory to his career ? Obviously the latter individual will find his position the more difficult one . But we are not left to such a comparison in this particular instance , for there are less than seventy cases in which the studies may be claimed to prepare for the pursuits of the youth , to more than three hundred of the opposite character . Where the numbers stand thus , I do not conceive that there should be any hesitation as to the course to be pursued . My first position , that it is practicable so to arrange an institution that superior talent shall receive full opportunities for its cultivation , without sacrificing inferior talent by inappropriate instruction , is fully borne out by the experience of some of the orphan schools of Germany and Holland , which I shall hereafter describe . My excuse for so often recurring to this subject , must be found in the fact , that this question must be decided for the Girard College by its Trustees , and I am , therefore , most anxious in regard to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ 's Hospital , thus interrupted , and resume the consideration of the arrangements of the grammar school , with the lower class of the upper school . The boys of the great Erasmus class are pushed forward in the classical studies , being those from among whom the deputy Grecians are selected . In Latin they read parts of Sallust , Ovid 's Epistles , and Virgil , and in Greek of the Diatessaron and of Xenophon 's Anabasis . During the last half year of the course , the pupils who Jiave no expectation of promotion drop off , and are apprenticed by their parents or friends to surgeons , solicitors , &c.; There are from twenty to thirty-five pupik usually in this class , and their average age is about fifteen years . The deputy Grecians are , during nearly half the time spent in the grammar school , under the charge of the head master , and study the following authors and books : - In Latin , Virgil 's iEneid , Ovid 's Epistles , Horace , selected orations of Cicero , Terence , Valpy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abridgment of Zumpt 's Latin Grammar , Edward 's Latin Lyrics and Elegiacs , Latin and English versification . Portions of Horace and Ovid are learned by heart , and themes are written . /q/ In Greek , Scriptores Graeci , Homer , Demosthenes , Edwards ' Abridgment of Matthioe 's Greek Grammar , Huntingford 's Exercises . Portions of Homer are committed to memory . In Hebrew , the grammar . In English , Butler 's Geography , Historical Catechism , English Poetry . An English theme , and practice in versification , alternate with the corresponding exercises in Latin . There are ordinarily from eighteen to twenty in this class , some of whom are promoted to the next higher , and others are withdrawn by their friends to begin the study of a profession , or , having completed their preparatory studies by the same assistance , enter the universities by successful competition for some open scholarship , or at the expense of their friends . The Grecians pursue the studies necessary for admission to the universities , and as one of the scholarships belonging to the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preference , at either university , becomes vacant , the eldest member of the class is promoted , his place being filled from the most promising of the deputy Grecians . Two vacancies at Cambridge every year , and one at Oxford every fourth year , are thus supplied . There are usually seven or eight members in the class of Grecians , which , by the arrangements just stated , must contain pupils in various states of progress , and usually of different ages , some of them having reached eighteen and even twenty years of age . The class is principally under the immediate charge of the head master , and their course of classical studies is very extensive . As already stated , they receive instruction in mathematics for three hours , on two afternoons of every week . Their studies in the grammar school are , in Latin , Livy , Horace , and Juvenal , alternately , Cicero , Tusc . Disput. , and de Nat . Deorum , Pitman 's Excerp. ex Var . Rom . Poet. , Kenrick 's Exercises on Zumpt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and translations into Latin Elegiacs and Lyrics , frequent exercise in Latin and English versification and declamation , learning by heart portions of Horace , Juvenal , and Virgil 's Georgics . In Greek , Dalzel 's Analecta Majora , vols. 1 and 2 , Herodotus , Thucydides , Barker 's Selected Orations of Demosthenes , Homer 's Iliad , Aristophanes , Kenrick 's Greek Exercises , part se-/z/ // cond , Buttmann*s Grammar , Greek prosody and versificationy Bcatson 's Exercises in Greek Iambics , the translation of Greek into Latin and vice versa , the Greek Testament . In Hebrew , the grammar and part of the Psalter . The sons of officers of the navy , and others who have been elected to the foundation , are placed in the mathematical school after they have attained the necessary knowledge of English and arithmetic , and have been until about fifteen years of age in the grammar and writing schools . Here the studies are entirely mathematical , embracing such appHcations as are essential to navigation . Formerly , instruments were in possession of the institution for exercise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buildings ; but I believe nothing of this kind now exists . These boys attend a drawing master two afternoons in the week , and their places are occupied by the Grecians and deputy Grecians . Twice a year the different scholastic departments are examined , viz. in May and November . The examination is not conducted by the masters , but by gentlemen unconnected with the institution , appointed for that purpose , and who report to the governors . Prizes are given in the writing school , to the boys most proficient in writing , arithmetic , and drawing , and specimens of the writing of all the boys are posted for inspection . This plan of examining by persons not connected with a school , prevails in many public establishments , both in England and on the continent of Europe . It is supposed to insure at once impartial dealing towards the pupils , with whom the examiner in general has no acquaintance , and a fair report of the character of the instruction , and was the means , at one period , of rectifying very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Examinations are too apt to degenerate into a show , if public , without some such precaution , especially if viva voce , and yet the method above referred to is liable to serious objections . Besides these examinations , every boy who has attained the age of thirteen is examined in spelling and reading English . The masters of this establishment have in general a right to /q/ receive each six private pupils , to be educated with the boys of the house ; this is a privilege conferred with a view to increase their stipends , which are not considered adequate . The vacations are eighteen days at Easter , four weeks in August , and fifteen days at Christmas , Sundays inclusive . Beside this , the afternoons of Saturdays are holidays , and Wednesday is alternately a whole and half-holiday . Those boys whose friends wish them to spend the August holidays out of London with them , may be permitted to do so ; an indulgence formerly granted but once in three years , but now annually . On such occasions they are required not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital during August , have permission to visit their friends in London three days in every week , unless stopped for punishment 's sake . On certain other holidays , all the pupils are allowed to leave the enclosure , and on the half-holidays those boys who have deserved reward are permitted to leave the institution , returning by an appointed hour in the evening . On these occasions they must wear the uniform of the school , a precaution adopted , partly as insuring the good conduct of the pupil , and partly his safety , from the favourable regard of the public towards the institution . During my stay in London I frequently met these boys in the streets , and never saw one misbehaving , and certainly believe that their peculiar costume insures them protection , attracting much attention from its antique appearance even in that crowded metropolis . To prevent absence without leave , the gates are observed by certain elder boys , who receive tickets of leave to go beyond the bounds as a reward for the discharge of their weekly office . A bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call all together , and detect absentees . The boys receive lessons in singing , but only to prepare them to take part in church music . There are two libraries which may be consulted under proper regulations ; one , of English and classical works , in the upper grammar school , is intended for the boys of that school , and is placed in the Grecians ' parlour . The second is of ELEEMOSYNARY INSTITUTIOlfS. entertaining books , and is under the same control The books are furnished by the governors on the requisition of the head master . Moral and Religious Instruction and Discipline , We have seen that the instruction in church catechism by the masters is one part of the school duties ; the reading of the Bible , singing of psalms , graces , &c.,; and attendance at Sunday vrorship are other means of religious instruction , and are very regularly attended to . On Sunday a Bible lesson is learned , and the boys are questioned upon it by the monitors , and the head master reads a lecture after supper . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grecians , and a psalm is sung , after which a monitor reads a short prayer in the wards before the boys retire to bed . The discipline in the school-room varies , of course , with the instructor , but is in all reasonably good . Corporal punishment is sparingly resorted to , and the opinion of the head master , who has had much experience in the concerns of the institution , was very unfavourable to its frequent use , as tending to harden the character of the boys , and to render them less tractable and well disposed towards their masters and others . Out of doors the pupils* are superintended by the steward , who has under his charge four servants , called beadles , who attend in the different courts , and report infraction of regulations . The older records show that the boys were in former times in the habit of very rough conduct in their intercourse with each other . This is much modified at present , but struck me as still admitting of improvement . On this point I may be fastidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be lost sight of in school , if we would have it practised in society , and that independence of character is by no means inconsistent with kindness in intercourse . The system of fagging which prevails at one of the principal English grammar schools which I visited , and exists in many others , is not allowed here , and the younger boys are not subjected thus to the tyranny of the elder ones . Those boys who are selected for trusts in the dormitories /q/ and in school , are chosen for good character , their selection being entirely at the master 's option , and when they offend they may be displaced by the same authority . In the school the eye of the teacher is upon the monitors , and in the dormitories the authority of the nurse is at hand to control them , so that abuse of their delegated power is difficult . At meals , the boys are superintended by the steward and matron , and certain Grecians . The monitors are selected by the steward , with the advice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the classes of the grammar and writing schools . Besides this class , whose duties in and out of school hours have been stated , there is another class of boys , called " markers , " selected by the head master of the grammar school , and solely in reference to their rank in that school , to hear the lessons of catechism and Sunday reading . These wear a badge , which they are allowed to preserve on leaving the school . The two situations are not incompatible . The nurse and ward monitors are responsible for proper conduct during washing in the morning and evening . Each has a ward in charge , containing from fifty to sixty boys , and has control over the servants of the ward . There are two special nurses for the infirmary . The apartments of the nurse* are at the end of the ward , and look into it . She is responsible for the general order of the ward , has charge of the mending , of distributing clean clothes , &c.,; which she does through the ward monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes them to the infirmary , or reports them to the physician . She reports the number who are well each day to the steward for meals . This superintendence by females struck me as strange , since some of the boys are quite well grown , and the Grecians , who occupy a part of the ward , are young men , frequently nearly nineteen years of age . The singularity of the arrangement , however , disappears , in great part , when it is considered that the same * The rules prescribe that the nurses shall be widows , and above forty years of age . // nurse always has charge of a boy , from his early entrance into the institution until he leaves it , and hence becomes as a mother to him ; and , in fact , some have actually their ovin children among the pupils of the ward . Admitting that care is required in the selection of the nurses , I must say that neither from observation nor inquiry could I learn that in this institution the arrangement was productive of difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another school which I visited , where the selection had been less judicious , and where the discipline was rather relaxed . The nurses are assisted in their wards by the ward monitors , and superintended by the matron and steward . They are present at the prayers said on rising and going to bed . The servants of the wards are named , paid , and may be discharged by them . Corporal punishment is discouraged out of school as well as in it . A few boys may be indulged by sitting up after the others , as a reward for good conduct , but none can be up later than a quarter before ten o'clock . The Grecians have the privilege of sitting up until ten o'clock . It might naturally be supposed that , in so large an institution as this , having within its enclosure between seven and eight hundred youths , one would find an exact code of rules and regulations for discipline . But such is not the case , nor do they seem to feel the want of it . The discretionary power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal instructions are given to the inferior officers by their superiors , but the usages of the school have passed into a common law , well understood by both the pupils and officers . A well regulated gradation of privileges , constituting a gradual assumption of the entire responsibility of his conduct by the pupil is , in my opinion , essential to the success of an institution which aims at preparing youth for the business of life . The want of it is the cause , no doubt , why so many fall away from rectitude on issuing from these recluse establishments , and finding themselves in entirely novel circumstances . Partial attempts have been made , in some schools , to remedy this difficulty ; for example , at the Orphan-house of Halle , the pupil has an /q/ allowance in money for the purchase of his breakfast , that he may learn to dispose of money on his own account . At Hamburgh , the pupils are sent of errands into the city , to become familiar with its localities and the manners of the people . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is applied to a gradation of instruction between the hourly responsibility of the pupil of an ordinary school , and the entire freedom of the member of a university ; and a plan in part resembling this has been adopted at Geneva , in their more recent arrangements for higher education . In this institution the monitors and markers have privileges , but the Grecians are those who are pre-eminently favoured . They receive each fifty dollars a year to dispose of , and each one has a study , and a bed separated by a curtain from others in the dormitories . They have a parlour in common , a superior table , and a dress differing somewhat from that of the other pupils ; retire at different hours from the others , are allowed to leave the premises during the day , except in school hours ; assist in keeping order within doors , being superior to the monitors , and aid the masters in school . These arrangements , as far as they extend , are highly judicious , and productive of good results . Physical Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remarkably good , and their physical development even above the average . They are not overburthened with indoor work , and are kept as much as possible in the open air . Their play-ground , however , is rather limited in extent , and their sports are , in consequence , not of the most athletic kind . The frequent opportunities of leaving the enclosure remedy this defect in part , and their cloisters give them great advantages over boys who have no covered play-ground , especially in so humid a climate as that of England . While at play , they are superintended by beadles , of whom there are four , one having charge of each court . The beadles also superintend the boys at rising and washing , and one of them has charge of the small gate , which is commonly open , and prevents any pupil from egress without a pass . This only applies to the younger pupils , the Grecians , as already stated , having free egress except dur- /z/ ing school hours and after night The steward , besides his duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys while at play and at meals ; no boy can be absent from meals without his authority , and he may punish by confinement to bounds or to the room any infringements of good order . He regulates not only the receipts , but the delivery of provisions , in which offices he is assisted by boys detailed for the purpose . The pupils , under his direction , receive the provisions , and serve and clear the tables . Some of these offices are rewards , and carry with them small gratifications in the way of leaves to be absent from bounds , &c.,; others are punishments for faults committed . The diet is plain , but wholesome ; the mode of serving the table , the utensils , &c.,; are , however , antique in the extreme . The matron sends the portions for their tables to the nurses , who distribute to the boys and one of the Grecians , or deputy Grecians , the nurse superintending , carves , while the boys who are appointed for the purpose act as waiters . A portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sung , before beginning the meal ; thanks are returned at the close , and the dining-hall is vacated at signals from the steward , who presides . Besides the regular meals three times a day , bread is distributed once , one of the boys carrying a basket , and another serving . Of the various offices filled by the boys , I found it impossible to discriminate those considered marks of dishonour from the others , but usage has rendered the artificial distinctions perfectly familiar to the pupils . What remains of the provisions after meals is distributed to the poor . Clothing , The supply of clothing consists of two suits every year , and is ample to keep the boys ' looking neat . Their costume is surprisingly antique , being , in fact , the same which was adopted at or near the period of the foundation , and from which the popular name of the Blue-coat School is derived . As it is entirely inapplicable to the use of a modern school , I may pass over the subject with one remark , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small as to afford a very inconsiderable protection to the head , and being inconvenient is , in fact , not used at all , so that both out and in doors , these boys appear /q/ with bare heads . That this has an effect in preventing complaints of the head , such as ring-worms and scald-heads , I make no doubt from observation , and in some climates , or when weather permits , the practice is , I believe , beneficial . It prevails even more extensively on the continent than in England , and I was quite surprised to see the pupils of Mr. Fellenberg 's school , at Hofwyl , in Switzerland , going bare headed , without inconvenience , out of doors , when I required a fire within . The mending is done on the premises , the clothes being repaired by the nurses , and the shoes by a workman constantly employed for the purpose . The regulation requiring the pupils to wear the uniform of the school when absent on leave from its bounds , acts as a great stimulus to neatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has attracted much attention here , and great improvements have been made in the arrangements for promoting cleanliness . Formerly , the boys of one dormitory washed in common in a trough , and wiped upon one towel . Thus any disease of the head or eyes was propagated rapidly and certainly , and the want of cleanliness tended.to encourage the production of such diseases . Besides a large lavatory , capable of accommodating one hundred boys , and furnished with a supply of hot and cold water , each dormitory has now an adjacent smaller lavatory , well supplied with water ; the boys enter by squads , and each has a stream of running water in which to wash , a towel , soap , tooth-brush , &c.; Besides washing twice a day , their feet are washed once a week in winter , and oftener in summer . These precautions should be multiplied during summer with us , to suit the requirements of our climate . The boys sleep on iron bedsteads , one in each bed , the bedding being supplied at the discretion of the matron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do other offices of police and domestic economy , as already stated . The sweeping of the dormitories is a punishment inflicted for offences in the ward , for laziness , or slovenliness. /z/ Sickness . The sick are taken care of by the nurses , at the infirmary , a building apart from the schools and dormitories , and cases which may be infectious or contagious are treated in separate wards . An apothecary , who prescribes in common cases , resides upon the premises , and the consulting physician attends at the hospital once a week regularly , and whenever sent for . There is a small dispensary attached to the infirmary . The diet of the boys in the infirmary is under the control of the physicians , and , of course , diflfers in general from that of the pupils in health . It is prepared by one of the infirmary nurses , who has a small fund advanced , for the disbursements of which she is responsible : the nurse has an assistant , whan necessary . The friends of the sick boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any article of food or medicine , unless by permission of the apothecary . /z/ /q/ /z/ Having completed an account of the most interesting of the eleemosynary institutions of Great Britain which I visited , I proceed next , according to the plan already sketched , to those of Germany . I have found it impossible , without describing institutions of inferior note , to give the South of Germany its proportion of notice , and , after much reflection , have concluded to confine myself , in reference to it , to an account of the Orphan-house of Prague . I might , indeed , have added that of Stuttgard , in Wurtemberg ; but having been there during a time of vacation , I have collected only printed results in relation to it , and nothing from personal observation . The institution of Frankfort on Maine , belongs , geographically , to those of the middle of Germany , though I am aware that the city is considered by its people to lean in feelings and manners to the south . This chapter will include a description of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Altona , a description of the Franke Foundations at Halle , of the Military Orphan-house at Potsdam , a statement of the courses of instruction at the Military Orphan-house at Annaburg , in Prussia , a notice of the Civil Orphan-houses at and near Potsdam , a description of the Orphan-house of Frankfort on Maine , and of the School for Soldiers ' Children at Struppen , near Dresden , and of the Orphanhouse of St. John , at Prague . /z/ The Orphan-house at Hamburgh was considered , not many years since , as one of the most remarkable in Germany . It had attached to it , or rather growing out of it , a seminary for teachers , the benefits of which were felt not only within , but g4 ELEEMOSYNARY INSTITUTIONS* without the establishment , and the arrangements for education were considered to be well matured and administered . I propose first to give a brief account of what the institution was , and then to notice its present condition ; both the past and present state of the establishment appearing to me fraught with instruction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more from the inefficiency of its teachers than from defects in its arrangements . An efficient teacher may supply many deficiencies in a plan , but there are some cases , of which this is one , in which a defective organization places the remedy beyond the teacher 's reach . History , Buildings , c . The establishment was founded by the exertions of two refugee noblemen from Holland , De Greve and Van Petkum , in 1597 . It was commenced in an old church granted to the trustees , among whom were its founders , and the present buildings were not erected until 1782-5 . The pecuniary resources , the number and kind of pupils , and the general arrangements , have varied frequently . The revenues , which depended in part on payments to be made from church funds , were often inadequate to support the number of pupils , which at one time rose as high as eight hundred . Means were provided for introducing foundlings into the house without exposure , which , after trial , were abandoned , though the house is still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice , the rudiments of a mutual instruction system were introduced early in the seventeenth century , and a method of teaching reading and writing together , which has been since , in an improved form , introduced with good effect , was adopted about the same time . Both resulted from a desire for undue economy ; the first , to economise teachers , the second books , and neither appear , in the form in which they were tried , to have had any success . The spirit which prompted these experiments was not of the kind to render them effective , To the credit of the morals of Hamburgh I ought to mention that , at prcI tent , not more Uian one foundling a year , on the average , is received at this houcc . The mcanu of introducing tliom referred to in the text , was by a turning.box , &#9632; similar to that itill used at the Foundling Hospital of Paris . /q/ if the ideas had been ever so good .

The present buildings are in general commodious , wanting , however , the requisite accommodations for the families of the masters , who , when married , must live off the premises , an evil , the effects of which will be noticed hereafter . There are two divisions of the house , one for boys , the other for girls , and a chapel common to both sexes . On the boys ' side there are three class-rooms , a large room for singing and writing lessons , a room for tailor 's work , in which the boys make and mend their own clothes , an extensive lavatory , and a bath-house ; a dining-hall below stairs , and dormitories above . The sick wards are in the upper stories , in a building joining the two wings . The trustees have a meeting-room in the house , and the economist ( steward ) , rooms for his family. * The institution is governed by thirteen trustees , consisting of the first burgomaster of the city as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight other members , usually merchants , who are elected by the city councils , and one of whom goes out every year . Admission , SfC Fatherless children below eight years of age may be admitted at any time . If healthy , the children are boarded out until they reach eight years , if not healthy , they are placed in the sick wards . Every three months , children of eight years old or over , who are living out , become members of the family within the house . At fourteen the child is apprenticed and leaves the institution . Formerly , as already stated , those who were fit for the occupation , were instructed as teachers in the school itself . Not less than five per cent , of the pupils were found thus qualified , and willing to devote themselves to the laborious occupation of schoolmasters . The teacher 's class contained usually from eight to * The small size of the kitchen required among these people to supply four hundred children with food , would appear incredible to those used to the arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . twelve individuals . The plan of education which follows exr , isted at that time . Intellectual and Moral Education . This was declared to be of a kind adapted to fit a child for some * useful callingy and excluding the higher branches of education . The pupils were divided into five classes . First , the elemei tary class , subdivided according to its numbers into four or five sections , and instructed by pupils of the house who were preparing as teachers . On entering this class the children were usually between eight and nine years of age , and they remained in it two years , passing , every six months , into a higher division . The studies in this class were - first , exercises of speech and thought , orally , the teachers following Von Turk 's Perceptions by the Senses , or Pohlman 's Book of Nature. * Second , reading by the phonic method , which will be described in a subsequent part of this Report . Third , arithmetic , especially mental arithmetic , according to Pestalozzi 's method . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fourth , elementary geometry , notions of form , measure , and construction . Fifth , writing , according to the method used by Pestalozzi . Neither of the books used for the exercises of induction have , I believe , been translated into English , nor have equivalent ones been published in our language . The admirable Lessons on Objects , by Miss Mayo , are designed for children more advanced in attainments and culture than these , though not in age . The infant-school lessons on objects practised in many of the English schools , would come nearer to the requirements of this class , but are still of a different kind from those adopted by Von Tiirk and Pohlman . Indeed , as the locality of a school , the school-room itself , and the implements for teaching afford the most instructive objects for beginning with these lessons , they must vary in a great degree with the school itself , and none other than a general guide can be given to a teacher , which , however , would /q/ be amply sufficient for one fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within itself the elements of all instruction , preparing a basis for elementary arithmetic , natural philosophy , natural history , grammar , geography , geometry , and morals . Its importance can only be fully realized by seeing it well practised . Mental arithmetic having been long used in our schools and in those of England , we have many excellent works on the subject . It serves admirably to strengthen the memory for abstractions , to give the concentration of mind required to draw conclusions rapidly , when surrounded by persons and things tending to interfere with close thought . As it comes to its results rather by ingenious processes than by rule , it gives great readiness in inventing methods in cases having reference to quantity . For the elementary notions of form , our books are again much behind the German school-books , though lately Mr. Reiner has supplied in part this deficiency. * As a basis for geometry , for the useful exercises of geometrical analysis , and as giving to the young mind clear ideas of the connexion between arithmetic and geometry , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method is too well known to need remark ; in general it applies better to the formation of the German written letters than to ours . In 1826-7 , from one hundred and seventy-four to one hundred and thirty-eight pupils were instructed in this class by the pupils who were serving their novitiate as teachers . After passing through the elementary class , the pupils entered one of the three parallel classes , so called because they pursued the same studies and consisted of individuals of nearly the same age . They remained in one of these classes generally two years , or until nearly thirteen years of age . Each parallel class was composed of two divisions , and had one teacher . The subjects of instruction were as follows : - First , Religious instruction , Bible history , and the Lutheran Catechism , Trefurt 's Bible stories . Second , German grammar . Third , arithmetic , /z/ and geometry , according to Von Turk 's method . Fourth , useful knowledge , the teacher using Hoffman 's Instructor in Natural Objects , and Zechariah 's Geography . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works used , probably require some comment . The religious instruction was given in the lower classes orally , by the relation of some of the principal Bible stories , with an exposition of their moral ; in the higher classes by the selection of the historical portion from the Old and New Testament , to be read by the pupils , and then by drawing their attention , in a familiar lecture , to the moral of the history , and by unfolding also its application . Frequent explanations of the peculiar manners and customs of the nations treated of in the sacred volume , and of the natural history of the East , throw a great charm about this kind of instruction . The feelings and dispositions of the children are ascertained by their answers to the questions put by the teachers , and thus the lesson is made a powerful means of moral training . The Manual of Magnitude and Form by Von Tiirk , is another one of his useful productions , which has not , I believe , been translated ; it is the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in regard to the connexion of the two sciences of number and extension . The term " useful knowledge , " by its limitation to certain subjects , being calculated to throw other important ones into the shade , is certainly objectionable . By it , however , is understood a combination of the study of the natural productions of the earth with its natural and artificial divisions , and the history of its inhabitants , or a combination of geography , history , and natural history , admirably calculated to interest the pupil deeply in the elements of these branches . The parallel classes were united for instruction in arithmetic and writing , the lower divisions of the former having their lessons in the morning , the higher in the afternoon . All the pupils having a taste for drawing attended the drawing class , and the elder boys received lessons in vocal music . There were half yearly examinations in presence of the trustees on these subjects . /z/ This instruction completed the intellectual course of the pupils in general , who were bound to trades en leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other qualities which promised that they would make instructors , after passing through the studies of this class , entered the Select Class , which was under the direction of the head teacher , the catechist of the house , and pursued the following course : First . Religious instruction , Bible explanations , and the larger Lutheran Catechism . Second . Mathematics . Third . German . Exercises of style . Fourth . Physics , by familiar lectures . Fifth . Technology and natural history , by familiar lectures and the examination of specimens . Sixth . Geography . Seventh . History , particularly of Germany . To render the instruction in " useful knowledge , " physics , and technology efficient , a small collection of models , apparatus , and products of nature , art , and manufactures ; a solar microscope , planetarium , &c.,; were provided ; this collection still remains , but is by no means extended enough to meet the teacher 's wishes . Nothing can contribute so much to the due effect of such studies as collections , the specimens of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his own observation , and may be led to further observation by his own reflection and awakened curiosity . Such a collection as this must be expensive , and hence it is seldom seen . In the La Martiniere school of Lyons , such collections and methods form the characteristic features of the establishment , of which I shall speak more particularly hereafter . We are most favourably situated for carrying out this principle , and , if it be once practically demonstrated , even partially , the board will , I am sure , encounter the expense of its complete development , in view of the importance of the results . The subjects of instruction heretofore mentioned are still required to be taught , but the plan of classification is entirely changed . The boys are now divided into three classes , one of which contains children of the ages of fourteen , eleven , and eight years ; another of thirteen , ten , and seven ; a third of /z/ twelve , nine , and six ; the same individuals remaining with the same teacher throughout their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruction of three divisions of a class in such very diflerent stages of progress , by one teacher , is impossible . If the instruction is addressed to the highest division , it is too high for the lowest , and if to the lowest , it does not employ the highest . The active mind of the catechist , whose recitations I attended , had adopted various devices to obviate this difficulty , but in vain . Even in the religious instruction , which may be considered as more appropriately addressed than any other branch , to various intelligences , it was obvious that a part of the class answered too readily , and the instruction was lost to another part , who did not even understand the answers of their comrades . In the lectures on physics and on technology , the case was , of course , much worse . Indeed , I do not believe the difficulties inherent in such a plan remediable . It thus happens that an arrangement which , to persons not conversant practicallywilh instruction , may seem to realize some leading ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may bring destruction upon an entire system . In the school for teachers attached to the Orphan-house , as has been stated , there were always from eight to twelve pupils , who remained four years preparing for their duties . The first two years were devoted to theoretical studies ; the second embraced , also , the practice of teaching . In the former years they extended their knowledge of the Bible , of the German and French languages , of mathematics and physics , of drawing and gymnastics , and were taught the theory of music , practising on the piano . The last years they studied anthropology , the art of teaching , the history of the science of teaching , and of its methods . During the latter period they were engaged in teaching under the eye of the catechist , or of the other masters . They were required to pass a satisfactory examination at entering the class , in the middle of their course , and also at its close . This experiment is , in all respects , an encouraging one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the occupation of teaching was nearly five per cent . /q/ of the whole school . While receiving their special education , they were conferring a benefit on the institution by acting as teachers , and , subsequently , diffused the excellent naethods in which they had been trained through their own and neighbouring communities . I pass now to the moral education , which , except in the withdrawing of the influence of the select class and other details , remains nearly as heretofore . The moral education is promoted , first , by the attendance in the chapel , by prayers , morning and evening , and by religious instruction in the school . Second , by the superintendence of the teachers , in turns , during the hours of play . At present , the married teachers not being in the house , this superintendence is confided to the porters , which thus changes its character . I have had many opportunities of observation in reference to this point , and feel that a proper method of providing for superintendence out of school hours , is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is worn out by the additional labour ; and if the pupils are confided to an inferior person , he has neither the influence nor the qualities of observation of a teacher , and thus a very important part of education is lost , namely , that of the playground . The ample endowment of the Girard College requires that the interests of our pupils should always prevail over pecuniary considerations , and in this view we should prefer increasing the corps of teachers beyond what is absolutely necessary for the duties of instruction , that one or more of them in the several departments may be on duty as superintendents , especially in the lower schools . Well trained pupils of the elder classes will make their best assistants . The superintendence in the dormitories and in the lavatory of this institution rests always with the porter , who is assisted by the chiefs of divisions , selected for this purpose from among the boys . Third . Moral training is effected by varied occupation of the hours not devoted to school , particularly by handicrafts and exercise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ill suited to the pupils , because entirely sedentary , that /z/ of tailoring . It is true that general manual dexterity is acquired by this trade , and that it may , in some circumstances , be of utility in after life ; but to keep the pupils at work merely on account of the saving to be effected in making their clothes , is carrying it to an extent which interferes with their proper physical education . Fourth . Moral education is promoted by rewards and punishments , the former consisting in presents of books and money , in permission to walk at hours not allowed to others , in doing the errands of the house in town : the latter in private admonitions , exclusion from the play-ground and from the walking-parties , confinement , reports to the trustees , and , if necessary , flogging . In order to prevent the improper use of money given to the children , the larger sums are deposited with the steward , and they receive parts of these deposits in coin of the house . This money the porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the discretion of the pupils . As a reward for diligence and good conduct , the children are allowed to visit their relations four times a year , and their relations may visit them once a month . During the general holidays , the principal ones being before Easter , leaves of absence may be granted to pupils whose relations wish to receive them . Physical Education . The diet is plain and would be considered with us scanty ; the breakfast is of bread and milk , the dinner of soup and vegetables , with boiled meat , and rarely roasted meat , fruit being occasionally given in addition in the summer ; in the afternoon , rye bread and water ; in the evening , wheat bread and milk . The pupils wash their faces and hands three times a day in told water . The lavatory is at present a separate building , in the yard of the orphan-house . Each boy has his basin of porcelain placed in a trough , and a whole series of basins may be filled and emptied at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enabled to regulate the time of washing . In summer they bathe at least once a week . The clothing is simple but sufficient , consisting of a roundabout , vest , and pantaloons of blue cloth for the in-door winter /z/ dress . Besides walking occasionally , the pupils formerly had regular lessons in gynnnastics ; the exercises are still kept up , but are voluntary . Military exercises are sometimes practised . In winter , the yard , which may be in part covered with water for the purpose , affords a place for skating . Formerly the pupils were taught turner 's work , and the making of pasteboard boxes , &c.,; but these employments have been discontinued . The tailor 's work can hardly be considered as promoting the physical education . The provision for the sick has already been alluded to . A physician and surgeon visit the house daily , and the sick are under the charge of a nurse and assistant . The order of the day is as follows : The pupils rise at half past five in summer , and six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast , from eight to half past eleven are in school , at twelve dine , play from one to two , are in school from two to four , receive a luncheon of bread , and are permitted to exercise from four to half past four , are in school from half past four to six , are occupied with military exercises and walking , or walking and play , from six to eight , at eight sup and have prayers , and retire at nine o'clock . Thus seven hours are occupied in school and study , five are allotted to both exercise and recreation , three hours to three hours and a-half to domestic matters , and eight and a-half to nine hours to sleep . Domestic Economy , The five hundred and thirty-seven pupils of this institution cost , in 1836 , one hundred and five thousand and eighty marcs banco , or about thirty thousand dollars ; the cost of each was therefore about fifty-six dollars . Of these five hundred and thirty-seven pupils , the four hundred which are in the house require for attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , and three male servants , of whom one is the porter ; the female pupils , however , do much of the work of the entire house . /z/ While at Hamburgh , I visited the Orphan-house and schools attached to it , in Altona in Denmark . The number of orphans /z/ here educated is sixty-two . The system of instruction is that adopted generally in the public schools of Denmark , and is a modified Lancastrian method , the lower classes being taught bv monitors under the direction of a teacher , and the upper classes being taught by the teacher himself . It does not appear to me necessary to enter into the details of this method , but rather briefly to state my conclusions . The instruction of the elementary classes , it is assumed , may be left in a degree to monitors , the lessons being revised by the teachers . The monitors , however , did not succeed as far as I could discern in communicating true instruction , and in their hands the method of Pestalozzi degenerated into a mechanical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no teacher can possibly succeed in raising a proper intellectual superstructure . I did not pass sufficient time here to enable me to give a proper practical judgment of all the results of this system , yet I may be allowed to support the opinion just advanced by the negative evidence , that , as far as I saw the upper classes , there was nothing which contradicted it . While visiting the lower classes of one of the public schools near the orphan-house , with an intelligent teacher , the inefficient instruction in arithmetic by the monitors particularly struck me , and the fact that the spiritless repetition of a string of sentences from the Pestalozzian course of addition , and a merely mechanical use of the illustrations by blocks by the monitors , failed entirely to convey a proper idea of the subject to the class , who in general appeared listless and inattentive . The teacher look up the instruction , and immediately the whole scene appeared changed , and it was soon evident that he had interested and attentive hearers , who , under similar instruction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has clustered around it the various foundations known by the name of its founder , Professor /q/ Franke , * of the University of Halle . This institution has probably been more influential than any other in promoting the cause of the fatherless , having led to similar establishments , not only in Germany , but also in Great Britain . It is an example of what may be done with very small means , tracing its origin to the education of four fatherless children in the house of Franke , then settled as a clergyman at Halle . This orphanhouse was established in 1695 , and successively the various foundations now connected with it have been added , all of which are made to minister to the maintenance or education of the orphans . They may be thus divided.f First . Those exclusively devoted to purposes of revenue , and which include establishments for the sale of books , drugs , and medicines . Second . The schools , six in number , viz. an elementary free school for boys and girls , a " higher " school for boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " real school " for boys , a Latin school , and a " paedagogium . " Third . The educational These comprise the orphan-house , the boarding institution , and the paidagogium . These establishments not only provide the public instruction of different grades , required by the citizens of Halle , but collect pupils from other parts of Prussia . As we are especially concerned with the orphan-house , I shall only briefly give an account of the intention of the other educational institutions , make some general remarks on the schools , and , omitting the first division , which sufficiently explains itself , pass on at once to an account of the orphan-house . The educational institutions serve as the homes of the children who are collected here , and who use the schools in com- * Franke was Professor of Greek and Oriental Literature , and pastor of a church at Glauca , a suburb of Halle , where he resided . t This division is by Dr. H. A. Niemeyer , the director of these foundations , , to whose kindness I owe the particulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity of visiting those parts of the establishment more immediately bearing upon the objects of my mission . t These names will be found explained subsequently . This term is used here in contradistinction to instruction , by education being intended training when the pupil is not in school . /z/ mon with the day scholars from the town . All the buildings containing these various establishments are arranged about courts , which communicate with each other , so that the whole series is closely connected . They are very plain , having been erected with a view to furnish the necessary accommodations with the smallest possible expenditure . The Boarding Institution is a large establishment , intended to provide for the education of pupils when not occupied in school . The boys residing in it are under the direction of tutors , each of whom has a division to superintend , and in relation to which he is to supply the place of the parent . As many as eight pupils occupy a room , thus making the expenses of lodging but trifling , and rendering the institution entirely accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys attend are selected in reference to their destination in life . They dine in common , having two tables at different rates , a plan which , however , is not approved of by the director . The Pcedagogium , This is a boarding-school , but is entirely distinct from all the other establishments , providing education and maintenance within itself . It is intended to prepare young men for the universities , and , in its educational arrangements , to afford an eflxjctual substitute for judicious parental control . There is a small parlour and sitting-room for every two young men , and four such suites of rooms are upon one floor , three of them occupied by the pupils , and a fourth by a tutor , who is expected to be their friend and director as well as instructor . The execution of this plan depending upon the personal character of these tutors , has various degrees of success , but in general it works well . The instruction is of the same grade as that of the gymnasia , or grammar schools of Prussia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction . It begins with the common or elementary schools , They pay but from eighty to one hundred rix thalers , fifly-six to seventy doUart , jjcr annum , for maintenance and education , every tiling except clotlies and books being provided . /z/ in which the instruction terminates at the age of twelve or fourteen years ; contains a " higher " or middle school , called , also , a " burgher school , " the courses of which end at fourteen or sixteen years , and where the pupil is prepared to enter Hfe as a tradesman . Also , a " real school , " its courses ending at sixteen or eighteen , and intended to prepare for the higher mechanical occupations ; and a classical school , or " gymnasium , " retaining its pupils until eighteen or nineteen years of age , and fitting them for admission to the university . As the elementary school does not prepare for the middle school , the latter has its own elementary classes , and after passing through them , the student enters the real school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Each school has its inspector or head master , appointed by the director , and responsible to him . And the head of the whole is the provincial school-board of the Province of Magdeburgh , who can not , however , change the system without the consent of the director . This collection of schools furnishes an epitome of the grades of public instruction in Prussia , exclusive of the schools for teachers and industrial schools ; and had I not become acquainted with them by careful study in the capital , st prolonged visit to Halle would have afforded a compendious way of acquiring a knowledge of them . In the schools of the capital there are , however , advantages in regard to the means of procuring teachers which can not be expected here . As the schools of Prussia will be described particularly in the second part of my Report , I shall confine my remarks at present principally to the middle and classical schools , which are attended by the pupils of the orphan-house. * /z/ in four classes . girls /z/ ( ( t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ eight " Superior " " &#9830; * /z/ six Real " " boys /z/ five " Carried forward , /z/ M ELEEMOSYNARY INSTlTUTiONS . General Administration . The director of the Franke Foundations is appointed by his predecessor , and the office has remained , generally , up to this time , in the family of the founder . He has the chief control of the administration , being responsible , however , in regard to the schools , as already stated , to Ihe provincial school-board , and making a report of his expenditures to the Minister of Public Instruction . He is assisted by a council composed of a co-director , as an " economy inspector , " of a syndic , who is the law-officer of the institution , and of a treasurer . These , as well as all other officers , are appointed by him . He has , also , a secretary , and there is an accountant , who assists the treasurer . All benefices , stipends , places of orphans , &c.,; are granted by the director ; all regulations also are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the institution . The immediate administration of the orphanhouse , however , is under an inspector . Admission Discharge , c . To be qualified for admission to the orphan-house , a child must be poor , fatherless , legitimate , healthy , of good morals , and between ten and fourteen years of age . It is preferred that his parents should have belonged to the middle classes of society ; and if he have property , or receive property during his stay in the house , the income of it must go to the foundation during his residence there . Applications for admission are addressed to the Director of Franke 's Foundations , and must be accompanied by certificates of the birth of the child in wedlock , the death of the father , of vaccination and general good health , of previous attendance at school ; and , from the child 's guardian , and the Brought forward , 1950 , CJyranasium or grammar school 300 , in six classes .

These pupils attended the schools , and are counted in the numbers above stated . /q/ chief magistrate of his dwelling-place , of the pecuniary and family circumstances of the applicant , and of his surviving parent . These are sent to the inspector of the orphan-house , who reports thereon , and if the report is satisfactory to the director , the child 's name is inscribed on the list of candidates . Admissions take place according to the order of application , and when there is a vacancy , due notice is given of it to the friends of the child whose name heads the list of candidates . If the child is not presented , and his friends are not heard from at the appointed time , his application is considered to be withdrawn . Cases of withdrawal of the application , or of the death of the child are , however , expected to be reported to the director . On the arrival of the child at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphan-house , by whom he is assigned a place . All control over him is understood to have been relinquished by his relations , who are enjoined not to interfere with him in any way , always excepting the right of complaint to the director . Any pocket-money intended for the child must be handed to the inspector , under penalty of his dismission . Those pupils who are found worthy , are sent to the university , but , in general , they all leave the institution at about fourteen years of age to go to a trade . In cases of misconduct , the friends are bound to receive them back . The institution does not undertake to find situations for them on leaving it , but endeavours so to do , advising with their friends on the subject . Those who leave the institution with credit , are entitled to certain small gratuities . As the parts of the establishment intended for the residence , instruction , performance of religious exercises , and taking of meals , of the orphan pupils , are distinct in their administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions of the house , the schools , the refectory , and the chapel , to the discipline of which the orphans are subjected in turn , during the day or week . The House . The orphan-house is superintended by an inspector , who is responsible to the director of the Franke Foundations . This latter directs the disbursement of moneys for the /z/ school , and all its officers are paid directly from the treasury . The inspector must be consulted before any change is made in any of the rules regarding either economy or instruction . He has a certain sum of money put at his disposal for contingent expenses . Under this inspector are four tutors , who live in the house , sleeping in the same dormitories with the boys . Two of these at a time , and in rotation , have the superintendence of the boys out of school , in their walks and play , one having charge of the boys who are attending the gymnasium , the other of those who are sent to the burgher school . They are also present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist the pupils in their lessons . To aid in maintaining order , and to help the pupils forward in their studies , there are two monitors placed at each study-table , who are selected from among the elder boys , and have charge of the younger ones . They report weekly to the tutors , and then , in a meeting at which the inspector presides , make report to him , and act as a council in advising in regard to measures of discipline . This arrangement , by which each study-table has its chief under the supervision of a tutor , is common in the boarding gymnasia of Germany , and is productive of excellent results . It is said that , in old times , it had degenerated into a system of fagging , and , indeed , one of the rules of this orphan-house was obviously adopted in reference to such a case ; but the superintendence by the tutors , the careful selection of the monitors , and the improved state of general feeling in these schools , have entirely done away with the abuse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of permissions of absence , walks , ( fee ; the punishments are , the suppression of indulgences , excluding from table , admonition , confinement , corporal punishment , and dismission . Offences against morality arc severely punished , and , unless a reform is produced , the offender is dismissed . Scrupulous modesty of deportment is every where enjoined and exacted , as a necessary safeguard from the approaches of vice . Though it is expected that the religious instruction provided /q/ in the house and school , will produce and foster moral and religious dispositions , great reliance is placed upon the moral training , by the good example of the tutors and of the elder boys . Experience proves that the orphan-house gives more satisfaction in regard to discipline , than either of the other establishments , and that of the orphans who leave it , those who enter into trades , and similar occupations , less frequently fall away from rectitude than those who go to a higher career . The inmates of the orphan-house have the usual Christmas , Easter , and summer vacations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at these times : for those who remain in the institution , a temporary order of the day is adopted . The health of the pupils is reasonably good , but their physical development not remarkable . The number of sick is usually about two out of the one hundred and fourteen inmates of the boys ' orphan-house . The boys have a play-ground and garden in which to exercise . Wednesdays and Saturdays are halfholidays . The physician in chief visits this as well as the other houses of the foundations daily , and may be called on when required . Voluntary manual labour in the field or garden , is the principal means of the physical education of the elder boys , and certainly contributes very materially to their health . The boys have no mechanical occupations , which , considering the future destination of most of them , may be regarded a defect , in as much as general manual dexterity is easily acquired at an early age , and almost as a play . The pupils clean their shoes , sweep their rooms , &c.,; for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns . They thus early acquire habits of waiting upon themselves , which will be advantageous whatever maybe their success in after life . The outer clothing is renewed yearly , and they have on hand always two suits for winter wear , and three changes of linen . A frock-coat for the street , of dark cloth ( iron-grey ) , and a jacket for study and play . The clothes are marked with a number . The linen is changed but once a week . The washing in the morning is done in basins , and each boy carries his own /z/ to the lavator ) Two boys use the same towel , which is changed but once a week . All these arrangements are far inferior in character to those of the schools of England which I have described , and , with a few other details of police which I need not mention , struck me as particularly defective . For both departments , male and female , of the school , there are two superintendents of clothing and quarters , and five servants , three male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is handed for examination and approval to the officer who has received the article , then to the accountant , who examines and certifies as to the calculation , and then to the director , who orders payment , and finally to the treasurer , who pays the amount . The cost of the institution in 1837 , was ten thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars , for one hundred and fourteen boys and sixteen girls , or eighty-four dollars for each pupil . Of the total sum contributed to all the foundations , the state gives about ten thousand five hundred dollars , which is nearly half the whole revenue . There is no matron in the establishment for boys , and indeed throughout Germany , there is a great tendency to place all police and instruction in the hands of men . This probably arises from the circumstances of the country , where competition for all situations which yield a support is very great , and from j the respect in which teachers and those having the superintendence of youth are held , which induces a considerable number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exemption from military service , which these situations procure , is an additional cause no doubt of the abundance of candidates for them . The Prussian system of education has , indeed , addressed itself too exclusively to the male sex , a defect , however , which measures have already been taken to remedy . The arrangement in regard to breakfast in this and in the other educational institutions of the Franke Foundations , is peculiar , and intended to habituate the boys to dispose properly of money . They receive each a certain sum weekly ; just enough to buy the i ) ortion of bread and milk absolutely necessary for breakfast for each day . and lay this out as they please /q/ A want of due regularity brings its own punishment , in the loss of the meal . Combinations of several might enable them , perhaps , to evade this regulation , but such are happily contrary to the spirit of the school . In a modified form , such a regulation would fall-in very well with the ideas which I have heretofore expressed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , to fit him for his entrance into life . There are two dormitories , in each of which two tutors sleep , the youngest boys go to bed under the charge of the older ones , and of a tutor , and the others follow . Each boy has a separate bed . The Refectory , This is under the charge of a steward , who provides the boys of the boarding-school and of the orphan-house . There are three difTerent qualities of diet , that of the orphans occupying the middle place , which are furnished by contract , at a certain rate for each pupil . The quality of the provision is insured by the attendance in the hall , in rotation , of the teachers , and the daily attendance of the economy-inspector of the foundations , and further , by sending at each meal a specimen of the dishes from the middle table , in a vessel with a locked cover , to the director , or his deputy . The pupils repair to meals under the charge of their tutors , a grace is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking is allowed . The knife , fork , and spoon of each is brought by him to the refectory and taken away again . The School The school which the boys of the orphan-house in general attend , is that called the " burgher " or citizens ' school , sometimes also called middle school . Its objects are thus defined - first , " so to train the sons of citizens by instruction in useful science , that , at the age of fourteen years , they may be in a condition to begin a handicraft , or other trade ; " second , " to prepare the pupils for the lower classes of a gymnasium , or for the classes of a real school , to accomplish which latter purposes Latin and French are taught . " The lower classes are in fact those of an elementary school , and the boys who leave the orphan-house at fourteen , are instructed exclusively in this establishment . The few who are /z/ selected to remain after fourteen go to the Latin school ; Latin and French both are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , and the aptitude of the orphan pupils for language , is thus put to the test . The school is divided into four classes in reference to the progress of the pupils , and each is subdivided for convenience , with a teacher to every subdivision . Thus the same teacher gives instruction in all the subjects of study , to a class of boys numbering on the average about fifty . The branches taught are : Exercises of speech and thought . Bible history . Religious instruction . Mental and written arithmetic . Elements of geography . ( Knowledge of home . ) Reading and writing taught together . Reading . Calligraphy . Stories from history . German grammar . Composition . Geography of Germany . German history . French grammar . General history . Higher arithmetic . Elements of geometry . Rible lessons . Christian morals . Christian doctrines . Elements of Latin . There are teachers of singing and drawing , besides the regular class teachers . The pupils are examined privately once every six months , and publicly at Easter , when the change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first subject on the above list , constitute the breaking-in , as it were , of the child , and being at the very threshold of instruction , try the teacher 's skill more than many a learned branch . He must teach the pupil to think , taking care that his thoughts are expressed in appropriate words . Pestalozzi , who first practised upon this idea , drew the child 's attention to the human frame , as the subject of contemplation ; others have preferred to bring him in contact with nature , in general , by making simple natural phenomena the basis of the inductive lessons ; others , not surrounded by nature , make man and his dwelling their theme ; others introduce simple lessons on objects of nature and art , which can readily be presented to the child for his examination , /q/ and on whicJi as a basis to rear the superstructure of natural history , physics , and technology , in his advanced course . All these are good in their way , but such as I saw tried seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to be better or worse as the child found means to apply his newly acquired powers of perception , to observe for himself . Of all the plans , when the school is rightly situated for it , a reference to nature produces the best training of the heart , as well as the mind of the child . It would be impossible to present , here , even extracts from the numerous works which contain the methods employed in these exercises . I trust , however , that the board will have an opportunity of witnessing similar ones in our own institution , and that they will consider the power to carry them out an important qualification for a teacher in the elementary department of the Girard College . The Bible history and religious instruction next referred to , are principally given orally , the morals of the Bible and the events which it describes , being put into such a form that when the sacred book itself , at a later day , comes into the child 's hands , he is prepared to read it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employs it as the beginner 's horn-book , and from which , I feel bound to say , I have never seen any good result . I can not enter into details in regard to all the branches , but must be satisfied with noticing two which are here taught particularly well , namely , reading and writing , and geography . The reading and writing are taught at the same time , according to the method of Harnisch , developed by Scholtz . The child makes a letter on his slate , after a copy upon the blackboard , and is taught to name it . The German language having a fixed sound for each letter , when the sound of the letter has been learned , not its common arbitrary name , but the sound which it has in composition , the pupil has made some progress towards knowing how to form combinations , which is the next step , the vowels being placed alternately before and after the consonant . These combinations are first written on the slate , and then pronounced . The next exercise consists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by other simple combinations . These being classified by careful study , the child is soon able to compose simple sentences , in which his ideas are developed , so that the mechanical operation of writing and of reading is interspersed with intellectual exercise . In this the talent of the teacher is strikingly exhibited , and a prescribed routine of instruction would fail in its object . The written letters being once learned , the next step is with the printed , and a reading book is not introduced until the child has felt the necessity of it in his further progress . It is then a relief , and not a task . I saw , here , a class which had been under instruction for only nine months , the pupils of which wrote short sentences very legibly in a hand of medium size , spelled them correctly , and read them distinctly . This method of learning to read is , in a great degree , inapplicable to our language , in which the vowel sounds are so numerous ; but the union of reading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary German writing are composed of very different forms from those of our round hand , and which are more simple , and , in general , angular ; hence no considerable dexterity of hand is required to trace the letters , and only a brief practice in elementary forms is required . I saw classes of children of ten and eleven years old , at Zurich , who , by being constantly practised in this method from their earliest instruction , had acquired a very striking facility of expressing their ideas clearly and correctly in writing . The method produces a facility of composition , in writing , as that of Jacotot does a fluency in speaking . The orphans entering at ten years of age , do not , in general , pass through this class . The geographical instruction , founded upon the method of Pestalozzi , proceeds on strictly inductive principles , and is an example of how much may be done by making the pupil proceed from the known to the unknown . The following was the course of a recitation which I attended on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the pupils of different objects or bodies , a definition of the term body , then led them /q/ to define extension , dimensions , &c.,; and thus furnished them ideas of space . Sunrise and sunset were used for establishing the position of the cardinal points , and that of the class-room was determined in reference to these . Then commencing with home , with a map of the city of Halle , they gave an account of its localities , and the history connected with them . Widening hence in circles , the natural and political features of the surrounding district were described , always indicating the real directions of places , &c.; The pupil thus grasps every step of geographical knowledge ; begins with his own house , rambles through his own town , makes excursions in its neighbourhood , sets out on his travels through his fatherland , visits foreign parts , sees what is worth seeing in the natural and artificial state of the country , finally learns the relation of its parts and of the whole to other worlds , and thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reverse method I compared with this over and over again ; some teachers have found this tedious , others have mixed the two systems , but , judging by the comparative results , I give this method greatly the preference over others , as not only teaching geography , and connecting history with it , but enlarging the general intelligence , while it improves the memory . In the upper classes , the pupils use maps without names , and draw maps on the board , marking localities , &c.; At other times , the places are indicated by one pupil , and named by another , with other variations of exercise . In the lower classes , the responses were frequently repeated by the whole class , and in the upper classes the instruction was more addressed to individuals . With all the inherent merits of this method , I have seen it wholly marred by a dull teacher . The inductive method applied to any branch of knowledge requires time , patience , and some skill on the part of the teacher . The routine method , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The former at every step unfolds the mind , the latter frequently overburthens it . If the positive knowledge acquired by the first is entirely lost , the habit of thinking remains , while , if acquired by the second there is nothing left unless some improvement of memory , and general development of the reasoning powers . // A pupil who has properly improved the advantages of this school , will have acquired a reasonable knowledge of the German language , of reading , writing , and arithmetic , of geography and general history , will be familiar with the history , morals , and doctrines of the Bible , and his general mental and moral development will be such as befits his age . If especially industrious or apt , he will have had an opportunity of beginning Latin and French , and if he prove to have a facility in language , will be transferred to the Latin school . It would seem that , if he have a peculiar disposition for mathematical studies , he should be sent to the real school* to prepare him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this kind yet exists . There are , indeed , some obstacles to it , as for example the difficulty he ' will find of a support before he receives employment in one of these higher callings , the necessity for patronage , capital , &c.; None , however , I believe are insurmountable . If he should have had this advantage , on reaching seventeen years of age he would have added to his stock of knowledge - Further acquaintance with German and French . Latin and English if required , though not regularly taught . History and geography . Natural history . Mathematics . Practical arithmetic . Physics and chemistry .

The Latin school , into which the more intelligent pupil now actually enters , conforms to the general plan of the Prussian gymnasia or grammar schools , which will be more fully des- This school is designed to complete the education of those intended for " shopkeepers , higher trades , economists , military men , architects , or foresters , and especially for those callings for which a learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been added to the other institutions since 1835 . It has five classes . /q/ cribed hereafter . This gymnasium has six classes , divided each into two parts , and forming a connected series of instruction , one part being six months behind the other , except that the pupils of the two parts are sometimes assembled to listen to the same lecture . The branches studied are : Religious instruction , Latin , Greek , French , mathematics , elements of physics , history , psycology , and logic . Poetry and rhetoric , and Hebrew or English , as the student may desire . The degrees to which they are carried , the preparation being for the university , may be known from the studies of the first division of the highest or first class . 1 .

The lectures alluded to , throughout , are rather informal explanations , generally extempore , by the professors , and of which the students usually take notes . They are , in the case of the classics , mostly analytical , critical , and historical . The elements of physics are such a general view of the subject as can be had by the aid of a few simple mathematical principles . The psycology is that of observation ( empirical so called ) now so popular in the German and French schools . It must be evident that if the pupil arrive at a proficiency in such courses , he can not be said to have commenced the study of the learned languages too late in life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at nearly thirteen years of age . The following is the order of the day , by which these various arrangements are carried out , divided into two columns , one showing the occupations of the older , the other those of the younger boys . The Elder Boys , Rise at half past four in summer , half past five in winter , wash and go to study until seven o'clock . Breakfast at seven , and have recreation until eight . Are in school from eight to eleven . Have an hour of drawing , or mutual instruction , on two days in the week . Dine at twelve . Are at liberty to occupy themselves on the farm or in the garden until two , P. M. , or are free until one , and have a drawing lesson of an hour , according to the season . On Saturday change their linen . The Younger Boys , Rise at five in summer , and quarter past five in winter . Brush their shoes and wash . Breakfast at seven , and study until eight . Are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except those intended for the classical school , who take a Latin lesson . Dine at twelve . Brush their clothes , and , on Saturday , change their linen . In general , are free four days , and take a drawing lesson two days , from one to two . A few learn French two days in the week . /z/ Ill Are in school four days and at study two days in the week , until four , P. M. Receive , at four , a piece of bread , and may engage in work in the garden or farm until five , and on Wednesdays and Saturdays , in winter , study . Study from five to seven two days , from five to six two other days , and occupy the remaining time with a singing lesson . Walk on two other days in summer . In winter study , except twice a week a singing lesson of an hour . Supper at seven . Are allowed to work in the field from seven to nine in summer , and play in the house from seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight to nine in winter . Study from nine to ten . Are in school four days in the week , or walking wth the tutors two days until four , /z/ Receive a luncheon of bread at four , and play in the yard ; on Saturday walk until five . Study two days , and receive singing lessons four days in the week from five to seven . Supper at seven . Play in summer out of doors , in winter , in-doors , until eight . Voluntary occupation and prayers . The fourth class goes to bed at nine . The third class studies until ten . As all the particulars of this distribution of time have been carefully studied by the directors of this institution , and in the true spirit , it merits especial attention . In passing it briefly in review , I would call attention , first , to the portions of the day devoted to occupation , recreation , and domestic duties . These are , in. summer , about seventeen and a-half hours , and in winter sixteen and a-half for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former , and seven and a-half in the latter to sleep . I confess that both allotments seem to me entirely too small for boys about twelve years of age ; and , indeed , such as would scarcely be adapted to the average of full /z/ grown men . The allowance is so small , compared with that of every other institution , that , had I not derived the information from the director himself , I should conclude there was some mistake in the matter . The younger boys have an additional time for sleep , the youngest having an hour and a-half , nearly , more than the eldest , and the other three classes about half an hour more . The general arrangement is highly judicious , but it seems to me doubtful whether so great a difference is necessary between boys often and fourteen . For the purpose of comparison of this and the other heads of my remarks with other schools , I have placed in the Appendix , No . VIIL , a table containing an abstract of the orders of the day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report . Next , in regard to the distribution of the day into time for study , for regular school duties , for the extra school duties , for play , and for domestic concerns , the amount of time devoted to each for the elder boys stands thus , on the general average . For study and school in winter nearly eleven hours , in summer nearly ten and a-half ; for play and domestic occupations , in winter , about five and a-half hours , and in summer , about seven hours , the amout of hours employed in study and school exercises being nearly equal in winter , and about in the proportion of four to five in summer . With the German plan , in which so much of the instruction is communicated orally , and at this age of the pupils , these proportions are , probably , quite just and consistent with a high intellectual development . That the development should be of the higher order , will appear by comparing the number of hours occupied in intellectual exercises in this school , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already referred to . In relation to the succession of work and play , there are the following arrangements . In summer , in the evening , there are three hours of study , and in winter four ; in the former case , two hours of recreation out of doors , and in the latter , one within doors . There is , further , time for preparation for the day 's lessons , in the morning , of which an hour is set apart for this purpose . Two hours are passed , also , before school , in domestic /q/ duties , some of which give bodily exercise . The school then continues for three hours , in summer , with an extra hour devoted to drawing or mutual instruction , and four hours in winter . There are two hours of recreation , then two hours of school , and again an hour of recreation , before the evening study . This succession is , it must be admitted , very judicious . An improvement , however , suggests itself , that there should be brief intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that this would be difficult , though not impossible , at Halle , where several schools open upon the same court . On Wednesday and Saturday there is no school in the afternoon , and the pupils walk out under the charge of their tutors . In regard to the younger boys , the arrangement , except in the time of rising , is not materially different , until after the morning school at eleven , when , only a selected number of them , have one hour of instruction until twelve . From twelve until two , on two days of the week , some of the boys learn French , and all of them drawing , and on two other days they are free . This may be considered as an additional school hour to those of the elder boys , but it is to be remarked that the instruction is communicated , in great part , orally to the younger boys , and hence they require fewer hours of preparation and more of recitation . On Wednesdays and Saturdays , they walk from two to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the half-holiday , and study from five to seven , while the others are out . They have four hours more of lessons in vocal music than the elder boys . For all but the lowest class there is an hour of study , from nine to ten . The attention which has been paid to the minutia3 of these arrangements , shows itself every where . The director has the power to carry into execution as soon as he is satisfied of the propriety of a measure , and changes and modifications may be made immediately , whenever circumstances indicate their necessity . The Sunday order of the day is the following : From rising until seven o'clock household duties , from seven to eight study , from eight to nine voluntary occupation , from nine to ten prayers in the common hall , from ten to twelve voluntary oc- /z/ cupation , from twelve to two liberty to go into the garden , from two to four study , from four to seven voluntary occupations , and visits in the town , from seven to nine in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanty supply of religious instruction , but the school plan shows that this forms a part of the every day duty of the school , and that thus it is mingled with all the other exercises . The Sunday occupations , however inappropriate they would be deemed in an institution of Great Britain or the United States , conform to the tone of religious sentiment of the country , and hence I do not consider them a proper subject for comment or objection , in connexion with a single institution . The whole subject must excite much reflection . /z/ These are both establishments for soldiers ' children , and intended to train them for the service as non-commissioned officers . I present the first to the notice of the board on account of its well arranged system of physical education , discipline , and police , from which , though its object is different from ours , some useful hints may be drawn , especially in regard to the strict conformity of means to ends . I am induced to lay before the board the plan of instruction pursued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-organized under the direction of one of the most able and experienced teachers of Prussia ; from a visit to whose school for teachers , and the establishments connected with it , I derived much instruction , and from whose experience and judgment this sketch of the organization of an elementary and middle school results. * I did not visit the school , which was out of my general route , because , having been but recently re-organized on that plan , there was no new experience to be gathered in regard to its working . I am indebted , for a manuscript copy of the excellent regulations of this &#9632; chool , to the kindness of its author , Dr. Harnisch , director of the seminary for teachers at Weisscnfels , in Prussia . /q/ /z/ History , Buildings , and General Government . This institution was founded in 1724 , by Frederick William the First of Prussia . The reputation of Franke 's Foundations induced this monarch to rival the benevolence of the clergyman , and to establish on a scale proportioned to his greater means , a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While , however , the recipients of Franke 's bounty are free to choose their career in after life , and only so far bound to the institution , as a sense of gratitude may prompt , the youth who passes through the Military Orphan-house of Potsdam , must enter the military service for twelve years . Three of these , indeed , are the term of service of every citizen , and I believe the three years in the non-commissioned officers ' school are now counted as part of the twelve , and thus the actual number of extra years of service is reduced to six . The institution began with one hundred and seventy-nine children , both girls and boys being received ; this arrangement continued until a few years since , when the girls ' school was removed from Potsdam , and the establishment at present is for male pupils only . There are between three and four hundred in the elementary or boys ' department . In the early history of the orphan-house two attempts are recorded to introduce manual labour , as a profitable speculation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first of these , the manufacture of Brabant lace , was introduced in 1743 , and after various modifications of the mode of applying the labour of the children , it was finally abandoned in 1795 . In 1744 , the culture of silk was introduced extensively throughout the kingdom , and especially enjoined at the orphan-houses ; but this attempt was not more successful in the end than the other , and the culture is not kept up in this institution . The present spacious buildings were chiefly constructed under the reign of the founder and of Frederick the Great . Additions have , however , been made from time to time since , and the whole plan is hardly yet completed . The institution may be considered as divided into three departments or schools ; an // elementary school , * a trade school , and a music school . The buildings for the elementary school are erected about a spacious court , which serves as an exercising and play-ground . On the ground floor are the refectory , in which all the youth from the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the study and play-rooms , lavatory , &c.; The studyrooms form a long range , and when the doors of communication are opened , one teacher can superintend the whole of the classes . The arrangement of the lavatory is defective , the boys washing together in a large stone trough . The school-rooms are on the first and second floors , and are calculated for divisions of forty boys each . There are six dormitories , furnished with wooden or iron bedsteads , the latter having been more recently introduced , and found to answer well . The bedding consists of a straw bed beneath and a mattress of hair above . Each dormitory is superintended by a teacher , who sleeps at one end of it . There are also dwelling rooms for the teachers , officers , &c.,; and in the courTa very large wash-house , with a drying-room above it . The buildings occupied by the trade and music schools are separated by a street from the others , and with the dwellings of the officers , a room for gymnastic exercises , and musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of structures . The infirmary is near to them , and is under a separate direction ; subordinate , however , to the general executive body . It is divided into rooms assigned to patients suffering from different complaints . A schoolmaster gives instruction to the convalescent . The arrangements in the dormitories of the trades ' school , are similar to those used in the army , and the superintendence and discipline are strictly military . The part of the building occupied by the music-school , contains separate rooms for practising by individuals , class-rooms , and dormitories . There are rooms in the main pile for the meetings of teachers , for a small library , &c.; The literal translation of the title of this gchool is the boys ' house , ( das Knabenhaus. ) /q/ The executive board of this school depends partly on the ministry of war , and partly on that of public instruction ; the former , however , is the controlling authority . Under this board is the military superintendent , or director , to whom the chaplain , the secretaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teachers , commandants of companies , the inspectors of the trades ' and music school , and other officers , are directly responsible . The clergyman is the superintendent of the elementary school , and has a general charge of all the intellectual and religious instruction . Admission , The orphan children of soldiers are received for maintenance , at any age , by the authorities of the establishment , but if under six years , are boarded with their friends or others until six , and then admitted into the house at Potsdam ; they remain there until fourteen or fifteen years of age , and , if of sound constitution , are transferred to the trade , or to the music school , where they remain four years , and whence they pass , if their conduct has been good , to the school for non-commissioned officers . I have never seen a body of young men all so well physically developed as the pupils of the trade school , a result produced by constant attention to their education on this point . Children who are not healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are apprenticed at fourteen , and the institution ceases to have the charge of them . Education , In the Elementary School , the usual branches taught in the common schools of Prussia are pursued , including reading , writing , arithmetic , the German language , geography , drawing , religious instruction , and a little natural history . The boys are divided into four classes , according to their proficiency , and all the classes below the first are subdivided into two sections , each being under the charge of a teacher , and having a separate recitation room . These sections contain about forty pupils each . A monitor of order from among the pupils , has charge of a section on entering and leaving the school-room , and renders such service as the master requires during the lesson ; he is assisted by one of the class in the distribution of the books , slates , and other implements of instruc- // tion . The teachers keep each a roll , upon which the character of the recitation and conduct of the pupils is entered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the board of teachers at their meetings . No youth , who is below a certain grade upon this roll , is permitted to enter the trades ' school . There are about five hours of instruction on four days of the week , and about twenty-three in the whole week . The holidays are , a week at Easter , four days at Michaelmas , a fortnight in the latter half of July , and from the twenty-third of December to the second of January . For those who have no friends to go to , the Christmas festivities are kept up in the school , as in the private families of the country . The board of teachers meet once every fortnight , and the director , or his substitute , or the chaplain , presides . At their meetings , all matters relating to instruction and discipline are discussed . The form of the discipline of the school is military , but a spirit of mildness tempers it , suiting it to the age of the pupils . The boys , in general , are divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * who has charge of the instruction in military exercises , and ranks with the teachers of the school . These companies form a battalion , and are drilled without arms , and inspected by the director , or an officer appointed by him . In turn the commandants of companies , acting as officers of the day , have general charge of the military and police duties . Two of the teachers , also , in turn , act as inspectors of the day , and have the general superintendence of the pupils in study and recreation hours , in the duties of personal police , at meals , and in the dormitories , relieving each other at different parts of the day . They are co-ordinate in authority with the officer of the day , and he is expected to relieve and aid them in the maintenance of order . These officers report immediately to the director . The four companies are subdivided into sections of eleven , A non-commissioned officer of the highest grade . /q/ over each of which one of the boys is placed , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is responsible for the good order of his section , and may be assisted in his duties by one chosen from it . From among these corporals one is selected for the general control and superintendence of the others , and marches the company to the lavatory , to meals , to the dormitory , &c.,; being responsible for them whenever they are collected as a company . The boys composing a section are placed at meals upon the same side of the table with the corporal who has charge of them . The younger pupils do not join these companies at once , but are kept together in a division which is under female superintendence , has a separate overseer , and is under different regulations as to rising , going to bed , and other particulars of discipline and police from the elder pupils . All the duties of domestic and personal police , and some of those of domestic economy , are performed by the boys enrolled in the four companies . They clean their own shoes , brush their own clothes , attend to the police of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and make their beds . That the various duties may be attended to in an orderly way , there are , besides those already spoken of , special overseers appointed among the pupils , who have general charge of them while engaged in certain duties , and of particular localities . Thus there is an overseer of the room where the clothes and shoes are kept , who has charge of the exchange of the Sunday for week-day dress , and vice versa ; an overseer of the room where the shoes are brushed and blacked ; an overseer of the lavatory ; four superintendents of cleanliness , who direct the pupils while washing and combing their hair ; one of hair cutting ; two of serving the table , who have charge of a detail of thirty pupils , who serve and clear the tables and clean the knives and forks ; one , of the manual labour classes ; one , of the sick in the hospital ; one , of those who are unwell , and must report to the physician ; one , of the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the pupils who sing the liturgy in the church ; one to conduct the pupils , whose shoes require repairs , to the shoemaker ; besides , those for the classes and the younger boys , already men- /z/ tioned , and a few others . I make this enumeration in order to show the minuteness of the arrangements for police and discipline , and the extent to which they are conducted by the pupils themselves . The selections for appointments are made by the teachers and officers , and submitted to the chaplain and director for their approbation . A part of the pupils employed as superintendents receive small pecuniary allowances , and all enjoy many privileges . Some of the pupils , who are found to have a taste for music , receive special lessons , and are employed , when sufficiently proficient , to give the signals for the different duties of the day . Eight pupils are thus selected to be taught the bugle and fife , and twelve the drum . In regard to conduct , the pupils are divided into four grades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revision of the classification taking place every quarter , and the director having , in the mean time , the power to displace a pupil in a case of emergency . The first class grade is composed of pupils distinguished for unvarying good conduct , and on holidays its members are allowed to leave the orphan-house alone to make small purchases at discretion , and are neither subject to corporal punishment nor to the stoppage of their meals . The second class is composed also of meritorious pupils , but of a lower grade of conduct than the first ; they are permitted to leave the school sometimes , but not so often as the others , and are generally under supervision . , From these two grades only , the superintendents or overseers are taken . Pupils of the third grade stand between those who are decidedly good or bad , and are treated accordingly . They are the last who are permitted to pass from the elementary to the trades ' school , on completing their course in the former . Those of the fourth , or lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowances , no leaves of absence , are separated , when possible , from the rest of the pupils , and are even punished by an inferior diet . There were very few pupils in this grade when I visited the institution , in 1837-8 , which was justly considered as an indication of its good condition . /q/ The health of the pupils is promoted by frequent bodily exercise , and , when the weather permits , in the open air . Thus they have regular gymnastic exercises four times a week , are drilled by companies four times , and by battalion twice a week , take frequent walks , and , in summer , bathe every day . The regular manual labour in this department of the school is confined to knitting and- tailoring . The gymnastic exercises are conducted by two teachers , each taking charge of one of the companies , of which two attend the lesson at the same time , and assisted by pupils selected from among the most proficient in the exercises . There are two swimming lessons given to each company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , in summer , between two and three hours are allowed for manual labour , the same for recreation , two hours for exercise , and nearly eight for sleep . Their clothing is a neat uniform jacket of blue cloth , of a military fashion , gray or white pantaloons for the winter , and a brown linen jacket and white linen pantaloons for the summer , and their officers are distinguished by badges similar to those worn in service . The diet is rather generous , ( see the table . Appendix , No . VII. , ) and , besides the three regular meals , bread is served to them as a luncheon in the morning and afternoon intervals . The mortality was , in 1831 , but one in two hundred and twenty-three in the whole institution . An opportunity is given to those who are to pass into the trades ' school , to ascertain the trade which they may wish to follow , by a trial during the last year of the elementary course . The order of the day , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in summer , is as follows : The pupils rise at a quarter before five o'clock , and proceed by companies to the lavatory , two companies occupying it at once and alternating , the other two being , meanwhile , engaged in cleaning their shoes . Wash and comb their hair . At half past five the boys detailed to serve the meals proceed to the refectory under their two superintendents . At a quarter before six the bugle sounds , and the companies assemble , by sections , in the courtyard . Morning prayers and breakfast . Those who are slightly /z/ sick report to the physician . At a quarter before seven , the boys assemble according to classes , and at seven are marched to the school-rooms . At a quarter before nine a luncheon of bread is served out to them . School closes at eleven , and the pupils are free for three quarters of an hour . Dinner at about a quarter before twelve . The pupils brush their clothes , and are inspected by the officer of the day . From a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons in school . From a quarter to three until five , are occupied with manual labour in the work-rooms . Part of the pupils receive instruction in music , and the first and second classes in drawing ; a stated number take a swimming lesson ; the drummers , fifers , and buglers also have a lesson . A luncheon of bread is distributed . One of the companies is at drill , one at gymnastics , and the other pupils bathing or walking until seven . Evening prayers in the refectory , and supper . Wash , and have recreation until nine , when they retire . The younger pupils retire at half past eight . In winter , the different occupations of the day are each one hour later than in summer , until half past two , when the hour of review of the lessons is omitted , and the exercises , as far as appropriate to the season , follow in the same order as in summer , until half past five , at which hour the pupils go to the school-room , and remain until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour in the morning is devoted to religious instruction , the other lessons being omitted , except the physical exercises on Wednesday . Stated days and periods of the day are assigned for the exchange of the week-day clothes for those of Sunday , for taking clothes or shoes requiring repairs to the tailor or shoemaker of the establishment , for hair-cutting and combing , for washing the neck and shoulders , the feet , and for other minute matters not necessary to be here presented , since a sufficiently correct idea of the order and exactness of the arrangements may be formed from the specimen of the order of the day already given . Trade School . The object of this school is , in part , to economise the funds of the institution , by making within its walls /q/ articles of clothing required for the pupils , but more to secure the acquisition , not only of general mechanical dexterity , but of a trade , which may serve to increase their emoluments when they enter the military service . There are , at present , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass into the trades ' school from the elementary division , the between fourteen and fifteen years of age , and of a bodily constitution fitting him for the military service . The course lasts three years . The school has a special inspector , or superintendent , who is responsible to the director of the whole institution , or , in fact , to his substitute , who has special charge of this and of the music school . The different trades now taught here are those of blacksmiths , saddlers , tailors , * shoemakers , and lithographers . The last named has but seven pupils admissible to its school , and the next to the last forty-four . These numbers depend upon the demand for the occupation subsequent to leaving the establishment , the space required for the operations of the trade , the difficulty of teaching , &c.; As each pupil i in general permitted , on advising with the inspector , to choose his employment , it sometimes happens that boys are sent into the town to learn a trade not taught in the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes permitted . The blacksmiths are principally engaged in the repairs of arms , the saddlers make the caps and accoutrements , 6z:c. used in the house , the tailors all the uniforms , the shoemakers supply not only this orphan-house , but that of the girls with shoes , and the lithographers are occupied in copying forms for the school or war department , manuals , &c.; They work about seven hours a day , under the superintendence of master workmen from the town . An hour of each day is spent in gymnastic or military exercises in the open air in summer , and in winter in the large room * At this trade the pupils were seated upon a form , or bench , around a circular table , and not , as with us , in a constrained position upon a table . // before spoken of . The military exercises , besides the ordinary ones , comprise some which are peculiar to the Prussian service . The usual exercises of gymnastics are introduced , omitting any which seem to have a tendency towards the tricks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eiselin , * is the guide of the teachers . For instruction in these exercises , the whole school is divided into two parts , and each again into squads , so that the teacher need have but twelve to fourteen under his charge . Non-commissioned officers are the under teachers , and in turn are superintended by higher teachers , and by an inspector . There can be no doubt that to these well regulated and perseveringly continued exercises it is , in great part , due that the physical development of these youths is , on the average , so perfect . Judicious recreation , a proper diet and clothing , great cleanliness , a proper number of hours of work , of instruction and sleep , no doubt , are necessary , each and all in their degree , but great influence must be Besides allowed to the gymnastic exercises . The pupils have two hours of instruction during the day , intended to keep up their knowledge of the branches taught in the elementary school , rather than to teach new ones . Military drawing is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shops , nor in school , nor at exercise , they are superintended by non-commissioned officers . The discipline in this school is military in spirit , as well as in details , and altogether adapted as a preparation to the life which they are to lead after leaving it . Music School . Those pupils who have manifested a decided musical talent in the lower school , are here instructed thoroughly in the theory and practice of music . The object is to supply musicians to the regimental bands . These pupils have a separate superintendence from those of the other schools , and different Mr. Kiel , the superintendent of this department , has not only adopted the new excrciscN of Eiaelin , of Berlin , but has made some very judicious improvement* upon them . /q/ hours of exercise and duty . They keep up the knowledge acquired in the elementary school , as is done in the trades ' school . There are about forty pupils in the classes . /z/ The course of instruction is divided into two parts , one an elementary course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue , singing , writing , and exercises of induction , taught in four classes , between the ages of ten and fourteen . The other , a higher course , taught in three classes , and between the fifteenth and eighteenth years of age of the pupils . In order to rise to the place of a non-commissioned officer , the pupil must have gone through at least the lowest of the classes of the higher school . The subjects of instruction in this school are : religious instruction , arithmetic , singing , the German language , calligraphy , geography and history , algebra , geometry , trigonometry , and drawing . The courses in the different branches are arranged as follows : First . Religious Instruction . /z/ VII Class . Bible stories , psalms and hymns , appropriate to the season . Four hours per week .

Copying flowers , or drawings of implements . I Class . Architectural drawing with instruments , drawings of furniture , &c.; I have allowed myself to present this extended programme , because it conveys , in as brief a compass as possible , excellent ideas of the succession of courses in an elementary school , and in a technical or trade school , for such the higher school must be considered . It should be- remembered that the main purpose is the preparation of youth for the military service , and hence that the wants of the service are especially consulted . Another fact must be remembered , namely , that this is a Lutheran school , and therefore the religious instruction is adapted to the particular views of that church . The course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , seems to me out of its place , for although ur duties to God and our neighbour are of course best learned from his Word , yet their inculcation by precept and example can not commence too early . In the arithmetical course , the union of mental and written arithmetic is absolutely essential . The gradation appears to me good , and the application to questions of common life gives a zest to such studies , attainable in no other way . The theory of arithmetical processes , however , should accompany or follow more nearly their practical acquisition . Indeed , if they are taught as they ought to be , by induction , the theory goes with the practice . If the youth at Annaburg take the same pleasure in the exercises of song , from the elements to the completion of the /q/ musical course , as those of the school actually superintended by the author of this project , the success will be complete . The connexion of orthography and writing , especially if combined with early reading , is natural . The exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn out , deviate from the appropriate track in the fourth class , and in the geographical and historical courses do not return to it . The system in both these branches is rather synthetical than inductive . There is a great temptation to break away from this method , into that of giving positive instruction , from the apparently greater rapidity of progress of the pupil ; some teachers have abandoned it altogether , as too slow , though ultimately to their cost , as appeared to me in cases where I had an opportunity of comparing the results . The writing is preceded by an introduction course of drawing , which might with excellent effect be so extended as to branch out into complete courses of drawing and writing . As this plan results from an extended experience , the number of hours of instruction , per week , necessary to secure the results , is an important datum , and as such I have retained it , whenever it was inserted in the original programme . /z/ Besides the Military Orphan-house at Potsdam , there are two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which I propose here to describe . From their limited number of pupils , and other peculiarities , they will not require a full discussion . The founder of both these interesting establishments is counsellor Von Tiirk , whose enlightened benevolence , aided by the means of his friends , has furnished homes and education , in one of these establishments , for the sons of deceased physicians , clergymen , &c.,; and in the other , for the orphans of country schoolmasters , and of the inferior officers of government . The first , called the Civil Orphan-house of Potsdam , has twenty-four /z/ pupils under its charge , of whom sixteen reside in the house , the otiicrs being assisted at the dwellings of their mothers . The pupils first enter the excellent burgher school of Potsdam , and when they have reached its first class , ( or at between thirteen and fourteen years of age , ) choose , according to their disposition and talent , their future course . According to this , they pass to the trade school , the school for teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fourteen . A teacher lives with them and superintends their studies . Those who have passed through the gymnasium , are supported at the universities by foundations . The road is thus opened to merit in any direction in which it may exhibit itself . The institution is merely the home , and the public schools afford to it , at a very cheap rate , precisely the kind of instruction which is required . The advantages here given to particular orphans are , doubtless , those which our founder intended to be extended to all , and that within the institution itself ; an idea requiring means no less ample than those which he has devoted to it , to secure its successful execution . In the Orphan-house of Little Gliencke , the pupils receive such an education as may fit them for mechanical pursuits , or as introductory to the profession of a teacher in the elementary schools of Prussia . Provision to receive a higher education is made for those who distinguish themselves . The pupils are engaged a portion of each day in manual labour : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , and in gardening , having also an opportunity to learn the management of bees and silk-worms . In the winter , with manufactures of straw and making nets , and some of the elder boys in joinery work , mo- - and smithing . The number of boys is only thirteen , so that but one teacher is needed , who lives with them constantly , giving , himself , nearly all the instruction . Counsellor Von Tiirk takes a share in some departments , to which he has especially devoted himself , as for example the connexion of arithmetic and geometry . The discipline is of the family kind . The boys are divided into classes of two , three , or four , according to their progress . The teacher now in this school . /q/ is one of those instances of ardent attachment and devotion to his profession , such as are more frequently seen in Prussia than in any other country to wiiich my researches extended . /z/ This establishment males no pretensions to giving an education above that intended to fit its pupils for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general mechanical dexterity , applicable to their future pursuits , as well as in the paternal character of its discipline , * it is not surpassed by any of the institutions which I have visited . I am satisfied that this idea of the object of manual labour may be carried out to great advantage in our college , and indulge a confident expectation that , by a judicious selection of masters , the discipline of the institution , notwithstanding its enlarged scale , may be as mild as that of the school now under discussion . The present buildings of the orphan-house are well situated , and commodiously arranged , with a neat garden in front , a pretty chapel at one end of the garden , and the other buildings on a long line at right angles to the front of the chapel . About a century ago the rights of orphans to education from the public were so little acknowledged , that they were ranked with offenders , or when better off than this , with adult paupers . There are many examples of both those connexions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed in the case of the Frankfort establishment , until towards the close of the last century , the orphan-house being , up to that time , a branch of the correction-house . The present establishment shows what a great change in public sentiment has taken place since that period . The buildings date from 1829-32 . The income is derived in part from landed and in part from funded property . It is managed by twelve trustees , usually selected from among the elder senators of the city . Under these is the head master , who controls all the in-door affairs of the This and the present improved general condition of the institution , are dua to the enlightened efforts of the head master , the Rev. Mr. Schaeffer. /z/ institution , and is responsible for its efficiency . He is re-eligible every four years , a tenure quite unusual in similar schools , but attended with advantages in some points of view . Tho economist or steward , who is the only officer allowed to be a married man , has charge , under the head master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , re-eligible every year . The pupils are fatherless children , or , in certain cases , other destitute children and foundlings , the latter being paid for by the city . There are in all one hundred and ninety-five children at the charge of the institution , of whom ninety-five are boys , and thirteen very young children , who are boarded out of the house . The age of admission is six , and that of leaving the school between fourteen and fifteen , or after the celebration of their first communion . Places as apprentices are secured for those who are to leave the house , and they remain under its superintendence until the term of apprenticeship has expired . They are then presented with a suit of clothes and a sum of money , and their connexion with the orphan-house ceases . The intellectual education is of the same grade , and embraces nearly the same subjects , as at Hamburgh ; the division is here , however , into three classes , each of which has its master , the head master passing from class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , and of the exercises of induction , arithmetic , and the elements of geometry . I had occasion to hear , a recitation of the youngest class with him in the inductive exercises , and to remark how much more difficult his task was than that of a teacher in the neighbouring school , who had a class of the same age in the same subject ; in fact it required considerable exertion on his part to induce them to exercise their reflective powers at all . As a general rule in Germany , where the temperament is less lively than in England , youths in this situation , many of them , before entering these institutions , friendless , neglected , or ill used , require very peculiar management to elicit their mental powers , and in all the countries which I visited , I observed that boys thus situated are , in /q/ general , below the average in animal spirits , and frequently in mental activity . The assistant teachers superintend the boys by turns during the hours when they are not in school , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken . Tiiese teachers are re-appointed every year , the trustees judging this method more advisable than any stipulations as to removal . In point of fact , they have generally , after a number of years ' service , I believe , the offer of more important situations , and their places are supplied from the qualified pupils of the institution . The discipline , in general , is addressed to the moral sentiments and affections . No prizes are given to stimulate to study . Keeping the boys from play or work , requiring them to work alone , admonition , solitary confinement , and , as a last resort , corporeal chastisement , are the punishments . The character of each pupil is studied , as far as possible , and the means of repression or encouragement are applied accordingly . A diary is kept by each assistant-teacher , in which he enters not only the progress of every pupil , and of all the classes , but such remarks on the conduct as he may find necessary ; the head master examines this diary , and confers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , besides , regular meetings of the teachers held every week , as is usual in the German schools , and which serve not only to inform the several masters of the character and standing of each pupil , but as opportunities for giving and receiving advice in relation to methods of instruction or discipline . There is one vacation in the year , new year 's day , on which the pupils are allowed to visit their friends . During two hours on every Sunday afternoon they receive their friends , who are provided with tickets for that purpose . There are occasions , however , of breaking through this strict seclusion , by the occupation of the boys in services connected with the town , which take them out of the walls of the institution. * // Besides the religious instruction in the school-room , the children attend chapel once on Sunday , and , as the services are Lutheran , the Roman Catholic children are sent to a chapel in the city . The diet is more generous than that at Hamburgh , as they have moat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of food necessary for nourishment , the practice of the continent , while it is no example for England , seems much more applicable to our country , as far as the similarity of climate is concerned . Though our winters are generally longer , they are not more severe than those of the middle of Germany , * while our summers exceed theirs in heat . The supply of clothing is nearly the same as at Hamburgh . The discipline of the dormitories , wash-house , during the walks , &c.,; is rendered easier by the division of the pupils into squads of twelve , each having a monitor at its head . I am not aware that in any of these institutions the plan adopted at the London Orphan-house Jias been tried , of allowing the monitors to choose their own divisions ; believing it to be attended with good results , I was anxious to see it further put to the test of use under different circumstances . It is under the charge of these monitors that the clothes are served out , and the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron bedsteads , each pupil sleeping separately . The assistant masters occupy beds in the two end dormitories , having thus a general superintendence of the pupils at night , as well as at rising and retiring . The principal house-work being performed by the pupils , one male and one female servant only are required . Besides the employment in handicraft work , two hours every day , the pupils have an hour of regular gymnastic exercises , and on Wednesday they walk , or bathe in the Maine , according to the season . They also do much of the household work which is not appropriate to girls , split and pile the wood , &c.; The pupils , though in general healthy in appearance , were per- During my journey in the winter of 1837-8 , the thermometer was reported once M low aa - 6Jo Fahr. , at Gotha , near the centre of Germany . /q/ ceptibly less robust than those of some neighbouring schools . I do not , however , lay much stress on the comparison , as it leaves out of view many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the health of the parents , and the physical development of the children before entering , and I was satisfied that neglect of physical education could not justly be imputed to the institution . In sickness , a physician is called in , and the boys are transferred to the infirmary . The handicraft employments are well arranged , so as to avoid two difficulties - on the one hand , that of forcing the inclination of a pupil to work which does not suit him ; and on the other , allowing him to acquire habits of unsteadiness by going from one occupation to another . Each pupil is at liberty to choose which of the handicrafts he will engage in at the beginning of any quarter , but when his choice is made , he must remain in this division for three months at least , unless special reasons determine the master to permit a change . The manual occupations are making baskets , mats , cord , turning , bookbinding , working in iron and brass wire , shoemaking , and tailoring . In summer , gardening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taste for music , are aflforded means of improving it . The little boys are occupied in knitting , a very general occupation in the German schools for young children of both sexes . Each trade has its own room , and its superintendent . There are regular instructors in those branches in which the teachers can not give instruction . The articles made are none of them sold , but generally used in the institution . The order of the day is as follows : The elder boys rise at five in summer , wash and dress , and go to morning prayers . The younger boys rise at six . All breakfast between six and seven . The elder boys are occupied in tailoring , or cleaning the hall , or carrying wood to the kitchen , and other household duties , until seven . All have instruction from seven until ten . Are occupied at handcrafts from ten until twelve . Dine at twelve . Are occupied in personal police and play from one to two . In school from two until four , except on Wednesdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread . From five to six , all are preparing for the lessons of the following day , except twelve , who are occupied by turns , from four to six , in the tailor 's room . From six to seven , gymnastic exercises . At seven , take supper , which is followed by evening prayers . The younger boys retire at eight , and the elder ones are , in summer , in the garden until nine , and in winter engaged in handicrafts . In winter they rise one hour later , but in general the order of the day is nearly the same as in summer . By comparing the number of hours employed in this school and at Hamburgh , it will be found that , generally , they agree very well . In the intellectual education thus measured , this school is very little behind Hamburgh . It has considerable advantage on the score of the occupation in trades , while the other excels it in the opportunities for play and the exercises of gymnastics . If we judged only by the programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should place the intellectual education on a pr , except that in Halle some few in the highest class study Latin and others French ; but , on examining the number of hours of occupation , we find four hours of study in Halle to one in Frankfort , and one hour more of school exercise : this is sufficient to show that the studies are pursued further , though the same in kind , a fact confirmed by my examination . The select class , when it existed at Hamburgh , was probably on a par with the oldest class at Halle . This uniformity I believe to be attributable to the common sense view taken by the German schoolmasters , who have given the impress to the present system , of adapting means to ends . They begin by laying down the purpose of a school , and then organize it accordingly , and I believe the boys at Frankfort to be quite as well fitted as those at Halle for the particular position which they are to occupy . When boys are to be pushed in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , then the time of study must be increased , as at Halle , or a select class must be established , as formerly at Hamburgh . It will be observed that in all these schools , the interest of the majority of the boys is made the regulating principle of the instruction . SCHOOL rOR soldiers ' CHILDREJr AT STRUPPEHf. 137 /z/ This institution is under the enlightened superintendence of the Minister of War of Saxony , and under the innmediate direction of a teacher , * who carries out the plan in a thorough way , both as regards manual labour and instruction . The pupils are the orphan boys of soldiers , and are received at an early age , and prepared for apprenticeship in civil life , or for the army . The system is a judicious mixture of instruction and work ; in winter , at various trades and family occupations , and in summer , out of doors , in the garden and fields , as well as in-doors . The institution is beautifully situated on the borders of the Saxon Switzerland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . The grade of instruction is that of an elementary school , the subjects being religious instruction , the German language , reading , arithmetic , the elements of geometry and natural philosophy , natural history , geography and history , writing , drawing , and singing . A portion of the classes were examined upon the principal subjects of study during my visit , t and specimens of their writing and drawing were submitted for inspection . The proficiency of the pupils was highly satisfactory . The distribution of the time which is allotted to ilitellectual instruction , during the winter session , is given below . There are three classes , of which the highest is called " select , " many pupils , however , are apprenticed to a trade , or enter the army as drummers or musicians , before reaching that grade . . The basis of their education is moral and religious , and the principal subjects in addition , are the mother tongue , and mathematics . The study of French by the select class is easily explained , from the peculiar political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German states . /z/ Table of the distribution of study at the School for Soldiers ' Children at Struppen , near Dresden .

The various trades and occupations within doors are tailoring , ( making and mending their own clothes ) , shoemaking and mending , sawing and chopping wood for the house , working in pasteboard , in straw , and in wood , making nets , filling mat- SCHOOL FOR SOLDIERS* CHILDREN AT STRUPPEJf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and school , and miscellaneous house work . These occupations are all carried on regularly , and with a view to defray a portion of the expenses of the institution ; the farm is worked for the same purpose , and there is a large dairy attached to it . The pupils are detailed for the different duties every month , and the regular hours of work are fixed by the school programme . The order of the day in winter is as follows : the pupils rise at six o'clock , wash , dress , and make their beds . At seven , they attend prayers , and take their breakfast . From eight to twelve , there is instruction every week-day , with an intermission of a quarter of an hour at ten o'clock for recreation and luncheon . From twelve until two , they dine , have recreation and gymnastic exercises . From two until five , except in the cases of a few pupils , there is manual labour . From five to six , recreation and supper . From six to eight , study , singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prayers , and at nine the classes retire . In summer they rise at five , at half past six have prayers , and religious instruction until seven . Breakfast , and have recreation until eight . Are engaged in school or manual labour until twelve , with an intermission of a quarter of an hour , for relaxation , at ten . Have recreation , gymnastic exercises , and dine between twelve and two . Are engaged in school or manual labour until six , with an interval at five for recreation , during which , as in the morning , they receive a luncheon of bread . On Wednesday afternoon , they bathe in the Elbe , which is at an easy walk from the institution . About seven o'clock they sup , and then are free until the hour for prayers , towards nine o'clock . At nine they retire . The arrangements of the school are military , the students wear a neat uniform , and those who are appointed to the command of the others at meals , in the dormitories , &c.,; are distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare exceedingly simple . In the morning , flour gruel , or milk and bread is given for breakfast ; at noon , vegetables for dinner , except on one day of the week a milk gruel . They also receive a piece of bread in the interveds of recreation , in the /z/ moriiing in winter , and both morning and afternoon in summer . The appearance of the children is healthy . The number of pupils in the several classes , in 1837-8 , was , in the select class twenty-six , in the first class forty-seven , and in the second class fifty-one . Total , one hundred and twentyfour . There is a principal and two assistant teachers , besides those for the handicrafts . The steward has charge of the farm , and gives the pupils instruction in agriculture . /z/ This was the best orphan-house which I visited in the Austrian dominions , and I give it as containing some of the peculiar arrangements found in southern Germany . History Building , and General Government . The institution was founded in 1773 , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Runigh and others , for the maintenance and education of twenty-five orphans . The funds* have been increased by imperial grants , especially by those of Maria Theresa , and in consequence of a fever of violent type having broken out in the house , which was attributed to its contracted dimensions , that empress gave money for erecting a more spacious one . The present building contains not only all necessary accommodations , but is better adapted to its object than most of the orphan-houses which I have seen on the continent . It contains large halls for school-rooms and studies , for dormitories , and for a refectory , for examinations , and dancing lessons ; also , a chapel with a gallery for the choir , a meeting-room for the trustees , and for the teachers , apartments for the teachers , &c.; The establishment is administered by seven trustees , appointed by the city of Prague , each of whom takes a separate department of it under his superintendence , the president having a general responsibility . They meet once a month at the house , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and receive a yearly report from the superintendent who has charge of all the departments . At present , one of the The income it now about twenty-one thousand dollars . ST . John 's orphan-house at Prague . 141 teachers has been chosen to this office , but continues also to give instruction . There are , besides , three teachers , and one assistant , all of whom , as well as the superintendent , must be unmarried . The teachers hold monthly conferences , to discuss the progress and conduct of the pupils , a system which can not be too warmly recommended , as producing concert of action in teachers of the same age , and improvement in younger ones . The economy of the house is in charge of a stewardess , who receives a fixed sum for the board of each pupil and teacher , and has , besides , a small salary from the institution , with certain perquisites . Admission c . To be admitted , a child must be fatherless , the son of a citizen of Prague , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of six years of age . On application for admission , a certificate of the marriage of parents , of baptism , vaccination , and of having attended school , must be presented . There is no fixed age beyond which children are not received , but in general they are not admitted when over twelve years . Special exceptions to these rules , particularly as regards being the sons of burghers , have been made in certain cases , as , for example , in the orphans rendered so by the cholera . When the claims of several children are considered equal , and the number of applications exceed the vacancies , they are obliged to draw for their places . If it is discovered , after the admission of a child , that any deception has been used , his friends are obliged to pay the expenses which have been incurred for his maintenance , &c.; The admission takes place once a year , on St. John 's day . The pupils are retained until between thirteen and fourteen years of age , and are then apprenticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they receive certain gratuities . As the custom of paying apprentice fees still exists in Austria , and the institution does not pay them , these children are obliged to serve for a longer term than others , as an equivalent . The master to whom they are bound is obliged , if he have fault to /z/ find with his apprentice , to report it to the trustees , and in general can not break the indenture without consuhing them . No regular provision is made for the advancement of the more intelligent . According to the rules of the house , children who are not orphans may be taken on the payment of a certain sum annually . Tliis practice prevailed also formerly in some of the orphan-houses of Switzerland . It was intended partly to benefit the funds of the house , and partly to prevent that isolation ot the orphans from society , which their own friendless condition would tend to produce . It has been found , hovever , not to work well . The objections which appeared here were twofold ; the want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of those who paid , was a source " of discomfort to the former , when the pay pupils were numerous , and the guardians of bad children frequently took advantage of this way of educating them , and thus the mas of the school was corrupted by the introduction of a few immoral individuals . The number of these pupils is , in consequence , in the course of gradual reduction . The whole number of boys in the house , in 1837 , was fifty . Education . The courses of study here are those of the Austrian model high-school , and consist of reading , WTiting , arithmetic , geography , and German and Bohemian grammar . There are three classes , the lowest of which , the first , can be passed through in one year , and the other two in from two to three years . As part of these children speak the Bohemian language only , and part the German , one of the main objects of instruction is to produce an interchange of the two . Accuracy is not attained by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's language by introducing a different idiom . The case is a very different one from that of a single individual placed in a community whose language he wishes to acquire , and the result shows conclusively that this difference is not to be overlooked in determining how a foreign language is to be taught . The necessity for this devotion to ST . John 's orphan-house at Prague . 143 language for its own sake , limits very much the intellectual development of the pupils . Drawing is one of the courses in which very great pains are taken , and boys who have chosen their intended occupations , are directed to the kind of drawing judged most suitable for them . This selection is usually made about a year before leaving the house , so that some time is aftbrded for special drawing . Music is not taught in any form , except to the few who constitute the choir of the chapel ; neither is singing used in the school , which , to my apprehension , is an important omission . The religious instruction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic clergyman , one of the trustees , * who also holds a service on Sundays and holidays , in the chapel . The instruction consists of catechetical exercises , Bible history , &c.; The teachers have not separate subjects precisely , nor yet are they confined to one class , to which they give instruction in several branches , but a kind of mixed system is in use , which is not very advantageous . The reason assigned for this is , that as each teacher must in turn superintend the study hours of all the classes , he must teach every class , in order to be able to keep them in due order . I was not satisfied with the result , and believe that either system , would be preferable , but that for an elementary school , like this , the class system , as far as it can be pursued , is the better . When a teacher is thoroughly trained , for example , as those who are sent out by the seminaries for teachers in northern Germany , he has more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn , is expected to superintend the pupils from rising until they are in bed , which is an excellent arrangement . In this he is assisted by certain boys , appointed to the charge of divisions of six , and who are selected for this purpose at the monthly conference of the teachers . The rewards for conduct and progress are permissions to * Pater Schneider has devoted the small amount now available as a salary for an ecclesiastic acting as instructor , to create , by its accumulation , a fund for a chaplain . His benefits to the institution can not , however , be estimated by pecuniary measure . /z/ visit friends on Sundays and holidays , the inscription of the pupil 's name in a book of honour , presenting him favourably to the trustees , appointing him to the charge of others , and rendering him eligible to prizes at the examinations . These are only bestowed in cases where the conduct of a superintendent has been irreproachable for six months . The punishments are varied in reference to the dispositions of individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is permitted , but is rarely resorted to . There are no mechanic arts taught in the institution , nor do the pupils even assist the workmen , ( tailor and shoemaker , ) who are employed in the house. * They take but little part in the police of the establishment , merely waiting on each other at naeals . Thus they lose much good moral and physical discipline . The gardens attached to the house are rented , and nothing but their pfey-ground reserved for the use of the boys . Their exercises consist of gymnastics and of walks in summer almost every day , and in winter , in walks on Thursday and Sunday , and dancing . Their health is in general good , no indisposition having occurred during the year before my visit , requiring the use of the sick-room . The clothing is ample , in the ordinary fashion of the boys of the town , and is changed from winter to summer . They have an out and in-door suit , which are supplied as the occasion requires . The diet is quite generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of northern Gernmny . They have meat every day but Friday , and in the evening beer , with bread and butter . This fare shows how local such matters are , when we find in the south a northern diet and beverage . Their food is inspected by the superintendent , and by one of the trustees , who attends from time to time for that purpose . The teachers dine in the same hall with the boys , and , with the stewardess , superintend them at meals . The boys who wait at table receive a small gratuity for their services . There arr five female sorvanta , besides a porter for the house service . /z/ ST . John 's orphan-house at Prague . 145 The provision for cleanliness is , in general , good . There is a special wash-house for summer use , but in winter they are obliged to use the school-rooms for this and other duties of cleanliness , which , it is needless to say , is a very bad arrangement . The police of the dormitories is good , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , but the bedsteads are of wood , except in the dormitories of the infirmary , where iron has been introduced , and its advantage recognised . A teacher sleeps in each dormitory , and a lamp is kept burning through the night . The order of the day gives four hours of study , four of recitation , three devoted to household duties , meals , &c.,; four and a-half to play , exercise , and gymnastics , and eight and a-half to sleep , in the summer time . In the winter they rise half an hour later than in summer . /z/ There are two classes of Orphan-houses in Holland , the first are conducted with a view to strict economy as the primary consideration , the second are foundation establishments , which before the French occupation were rich , and are , even now , usually sufficiently well off to look to higher considerations than those of mere economy , and to give those pupils who show great intelligence a better education than ordinary . Both classes of these schools have an interesting provision in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment , which replaces the home of the more fortunate child ; and as the mode of carrying out the provision will appear equally by selecting an institution of either class , I shall take for description the Burgher Orphan-house of Amsterdam , which belongs to the second . In charge of the trustees of the orphan-houses at Utrecht and the Hague , are certain foundations for educating young men of talent , which I shall describe in connexion with a few remarks on those establishments . It is a remarkable fact that one country borrows very little from another , in regard to the organization of such institutions , while similar ideas prevail in nearly all where particular signs of nationality are exhibited . They all have a tendency , too , to retain the organization , in every respect , of a past age , and when the vvorld around them is changing rapidly , are left behind in regard both to matters of little importance , such as dress and diet , and also to the essentials of education . In countries where education is in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit by the changes , an observation which will serve to explain my silence in regard to many of the schools which I visited without the invidiousness of special remark . My mission was /q/ rather to discover , if possible , the good , and to place some account of their peculiarities before the Board , than to notice all indiscriminately . I have considered myself bound to notice defects in those described , where they seemed to bear upon our institution , and have treasured up mistakes of various kinds , as warnings to which we may profitably turn , but I have felt the task of presenting either in this Report an ungrateful one , and have avoided it where I could do so without a violation of duty . /z/ This establishment was founded in 1520 , by a charitable lady ( Haasje Plaas ) , who , during her lifetime , had educated several orphan children , and at her decease left a house and funds to continue this benevolent practice . Subsequent legacies , by citizens of Amsterdam , have increased the funds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the resources either of the city or the state . There are six trustees , or governors , who are named by the magistrates of the city , and have absolute control over the institution and its funds . The Board meets once a week , at the house , and the president is charged , in the interim , with all their duties and powers . They report yearly to the burgomaster of the city . The officers of the establishment are , a director , who attends to the out-door aflTairs , and to whom , when the trustees are not in session , the other officers of the house are responsible . A superintendent , and matron for the boys , and another for the girls , called in the language of the orphan-houses of Holland , the father and mother of the boys and of the girls . The superintendent of the boys has charge of them at all times , but especially when not in school ; has the power to correct them at discretion , reporting the circumstances to the president on his daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their weekly meetings . The other superintendent , the steward of the house , and the two matrons , have charge of the kitchen , of the clothing , and the domestic work . The arrangement by which the boys are intrusted out of school hours to an officer as high as a superintendent , is much better than that of turning them // over to servants , but the danger is , that the inspection comes at last to be really executed by the latter , since the superintendent has many other duties to attend to , and some of which call him away from the house . The servants are , two nurses for the sick , one to take care of the children below eleven years of age , who are united in one building , and five women . A baker is attached to the establishment , receiving a salary , and a shoemaker does the work of the house on his own account . The buildings are very commodious , and so arranged as to admit of an entire separation of the two sexes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverbial to require remark on that score . There is a commodious chapel , and the boys ' department has memorials of deceased pupils who have distinguished themselves in after-life , to serve as a stimulus to the present generation . This institution was founded for the children of those who had the rights of citizenship in Amsterdam , and now that these rights are obsolete , descendants of those who formerly enjoyed them may claim the places , and children of parents by whom a certain amount has been paid may be admitted . Children who have lost a parent have a preference over others , and those who have lost both parents are considered to have the strongest claim . There are three hundred and thirty-nine pupils in the charge of the institution ; of these , one hundred and fourteen are boys below fourteen years of age . The instruction is on the footing of the elementary schools of Holland , and will be hereafter described in detail . It does not require special notice here . The teachers are selected as in the other schools of Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abilities are sufficiently known to the trustees not to make examination necessary . At fourteen , the boys are apprenticed , or begin the studies preparatory to sea service ; they are frequently , in the latter case , drafted into the army at the age of eighteen , but always remain children of the house " until they reach twenty years of age . Those who are apprenticed return to the house to lodge , and /q/ to receive instruction in the evening , and those who go to sea , come back to the institution as to a home , at the end of every voyage . The superintendent of the boys is charged with frequent visits of inspection at the houses where they are apprenticed , during which he informs himself of their conduct and progress . This regulation I regard as much better contrived than that of the English schools , where the boys are to receive money at certain stated periods during their apprenticeship ; so loose a connexion being attended with little advantage . In the former case , the superintendent really supplies the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the orphan child , who , instead of being thrown upon the world at once , from his state of seclusion , is by degrees prepared to begin his solitary career . A theoretical objection , made sometimes to this course , is , that these boys , acquiring bad habits out of doors , return , and may communicate the infection to those within , but there are man y reasons why this result should not take place . The boys are supposed to be well brought up , and to return daily to the family , still under superintendence , the object of which is to prevent the acquisition of those bad habits which they are assumed at once to have acquired . Besides , they do not mingle freely with the pupils of the house ; on the contrary , their return is at stated intervals , for fixed purposes , needing no communication with the others . I took particular pains to inform myself in the different institutions where this practice prevails in the form in which I have described it , and was told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember especially the remark of the superintendent of the Orphan-house of the Reformed Church at Amsterdam , that if the arrangement gave much more trouble than it really did , he was so well satisfied of its good fruits , that he should regret to see it abandoned . The idea is a beautiful one , and I should be most happy to see it fairly tried in our institution , and under our circumstances . The location of the Girard College is an obstacle , but not one that I should consider insurmountable . The practice of over-work with apprentices of an early age , can not be too strongly deprecated , and therefore I do not regard its existence as a bar to // the plan . If fairly tried and diligently watchisd , 1 should not apprehend much risk of a failure , provided the school departments are organized in a proper way . If it were found impossible , on account of the location of the College , a similar but less efficacious arrangement of superintendence , retaining the family connexion with the College , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , limit the number of places for our apprentices to particular quarters of the city , though this could hardly occur , connected as the different parts of the city are by ready and cheap conveyances . The religious instruction given in the Burgher Orphan-house is according to the doctrines of the reformed church of Holland , and dissenters go to their own ministers for instruction . There are two clergymen attached to the house , who hold catechetical and other exercises on Wednesday evening and on Sunday . There are , besides , morning and evening prayers , and the usual grace and thanks before and after meals . During meals , one of the pupils reads aloud from the Bible , a practice which , as conducted , is not only unserviceable , but savours , in my opinion , of irreverence . The punishments are , preventing from a visit to friends on Sunday , admonition , particular places at table , confinement with or without the usual food , and dismission . Corporal chastisement is not used . The location at table is a public punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are no regular vacations , but in the holiday time of other schools the pupils are allowed to go to their friends , if request is made , and there is no objection on the part of the officers of the institution . Small pecuniary allowances are made to the pupils , at the discretion of the superintendent . The physical education of the children in the orphan houses of Holland , on the average , is by no means attended to as in those of Germany . Gymnastics have never found favour in Holland , and amusements out of doors are less in accordance with the spirit of the children than in England , from causes connected , no doubt , originally with the peculiarities of the surface of their country . At the orphan colonics of Williamsoord , the boys are occupied in agriculture , and are certainly /q/ more robust in consequence . The play-grounds of the city orphan-houses are in general very contracted , and do not admit of active sports taking place in them . The following is the order of the day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the younger at seven . Their breakfast of bread and butter is taken as soon as they are washed and dressed , those who live out of the house receiving theirs , which they may take away with them . From nine until half past eleven there is school for the boys of the house , and again from ten until four . They dine at one , sftp at half past eight , and retire at ten . They are free to amuse themselves from after supper until bed time . The time devoted to instruction gives an idea of the limited course intended . There is no provision for the development of higher intellect in regular connexion with the institution . /z/ These foundations are for the benefit of the orphan-houses of Utrecht and the Hague , and the funds are administered by their governors . They were left by a lady , * ( Mrs. Van Renswoude , ) for the purpose of training those pupils who distinguished themselves , to higher callings not requiring a complete university education . There are seven young men now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of those selected have become highly respected in their professions , and several have risen to distinction . This is the more encouraging , that both the institutions from which the young men have been chosen have but few inmates ; neither have now more than twenty , and though formerly the number was larger , they have always been small establishments . As these youths are , upon the average , about seven years upon the foundation , there is only about one choice every year . The pupils are selected for these places when between eleven and thirteen years of age , and then receive , in or out of the orphan-house , a higher grade of instruction than the other children . After spending about two years in general studies , the youth and his teacher fix upon the profession which seems to promise fairest , and the pupil begins the particular /z/ Studies most appropriate as a preparation . He resides in the house until it is necessary to seek in some public school , away from the city , the special branches necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of the pupils on the Renswoude foundation were at Utrecht , attending to clinical medicine in the medical department of the university , one in the veterinary school of the same place , one studying mathematics at Leyden , and one , a pupil of the architectural school , had gained the approbation of government , and been sent to travel , at the public expense , for improvement in his art . Of ten pupils at Utrecht , who have been educated on this foundation , between 1834 and 1836 , one is a surgeon , one a veterinary surgeon , two are painters , one is a surveyor , two are officers in the colonies , two pilots , and one is an organ-builder . The actual director of the hydraulic works of Holland was a Renswoude pupil , and before the existence of special schools for professions requiring considerable scientific attainments , these foundations were of great importance . Before leaving the subject of the orphan-houses of Holland , I may state , that both at Utrecht and the Hague , and indeed also in part at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been apprenticed . xt the Hague they are apprenticed at between twelve and thirteen years of age , a stipulation being made with the master in regard to the hours of meals and of the cessation of work . Both here and at Utrecht the institution saves the gains of the apprentices , and pays them over to them on leaving the establishment , deducting only an allowance for pocket-money . At Rotterdam the institution retains five-sixths of the earnings , as an equivalent for the pupil 's boarding and education . In this latter institution the children are apprenticed at the early age of ten , in the city , and those who go to sea , at twelve . With so many examples there can be no doubt that , under the circumstances of society in Holland , and of the institutions in that country , this plan is not only perfectly practicable , but is entirely approved after full experience . The habits of life there are much more like those in England and the United States than those in any other nation of the continent of Euro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to institutions for orphans and destitute children , as these might be supposed to bear more especially upon the organization of the Girard College . By examples selected from among the best establishments of the kind which I visited , the scope of these institutions has been shown to vary very considerably . In some we have seen provision made for preparing the more able students for the university ; while others confined their training to the humbler walks of life . In others , again , we have found systematic arrangements for educating the pupils to grades depending upon their abilities , and for occupations in life selected according to their particular talents . The foundations which have the means to accomplish the last named result are , however , few in number . There are but two among those in Great Britain which have funds adequate to the purpose , and I am not acquainted with a single institution on the continent of Europe which is thus endowed . The two in Great Britain originated at a period when distinction was only to be attained through the learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has not since been changed . As a general rule , changes are less readily made in institutions of this class , than in the schools at large ; so that when education is progressive , they are apt to be left behind . Nothing is clearer , however , than that Mr. Girard intended his institution to have the entire range of usefulness to which I have referred . Hence my investigations would have been incomplete , had they not included public schools in general , and my Report deficient , did it not present to the trustees some account of the institutions for general education in those countries of Europe where it is on the best footing . From these descriptions various hints may /z/ j PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IX GENERAL . be gathered , and measures suggested which can not fail to be fcrviceable in the general organization or minute arrangement of the Girard College . If this account should further contribute to awaken attention in our schools to improvements which have been introduced abroad , I am sure that the trustees of the Girard College will feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods of education for which separate schools and different materials of instruction have been appropriately provided , are , the Infant , the Elementary or Primar the Secondary , and the Superior . Schools for the one class sometimes include departments for the other ; but , in general , the classification holds good . These four classes include the period up to the age at which education is completed , and the career of active life is commenced . The first period extends , generally , to six years of age ; the second to ten or twelve years ; the third to sixteen or eighteen ; and the fourth to about twenty-one . These limits vary in different countries , under different social organizations , and with different individuals . Circumstances do not permit every one to pass through these several periods , nor are they all required for the different callings of life . Hence the education frequently terminates with the elementary period , which is then extended to the age of fourteen . The limits of secondary mstruction are frequently changed in the same way . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not precisely defined , though the division is , nevertheless , convenient for the arrangement and discussion of facts . The lowest period of education is entirely anterior to that at which the pupil must enter the Girard College , according to the will of the founder ; but , for reasons which will be stated in the introduction to it , I have concluded to embrace a notice of it in this report . It is of comparatively recent origin ; is well developed in but one country in Europe ; and hence occupies but a snrjall space , which is altogether insignificant when compared with the principles embraced . The elementary and secondary periods arc those which the limits of age fixed by the will of Mr. Girard would indicate as especially embraced in our course of education . A portion of that of superior instruction is , however , included within them , especially , according to the /q/ educational arrangements common in the United States . This grade of education , as given in Europe , has two distinct objects . The first is , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher occupations in the arts , manufactures , and commerce . The first kind of instruction is given in the universities , and , in general , the universities of Great Britain forming the exception , the studies are of a professional character or tendency . For this , and other reasons , more fully developed in the remarks introductory to the chapter on superior education , I have chiefly confined myself to the schools of the second division of this grade . In submitting , then , the view of the different periods of education , to which the remainder of this Report is principally devoted , I shall take them up in the succession already mentioned , preceding each by a statement of the order in which the different countries are treated , and with such remarks as may seem necessary , by way of introduction . As it would have been manifestly impossible to give an account of general education in all the countries I visited , within the limits appropriate to a report , 1 have selected in each period , those which appeared to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the whole ground has suggested , and occasionally instituting direct comparisons . Following out the same principle , I have not undertaken to give an account of all the schools I visited ; but have confined my Report to such as seemed best calculated to serve as types of different classes of institutions . After brief notices of certain infant schools , elementary instruction is considered under two heads : the first , embracing the schools for general purposes , the second , those intended for special training , as for the education of a rural or industrial population , and of teachers for the elementary schools . Under the former head will be given a notice of the provisions for elementary instruction in Great Britain ; a notice of the primary public instruction in France ; a more particular description of the primary system of Holland , and of some schools which illustrate its application ; a history and general sketch of the Prussian system , with detailed descriptions and notices of several prominent /z/ &#9632; chools ; a notice of the system of primary instruction in Saxony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the method applied in the schools of Bayreuth , in Bavaria . The second division of primary instruction will comprehend descriptions of certain rural schools of Switzerland and Great Britain , an industrial primary school of France , and of some of the schools for primary teachers in Prussia , France , Holland , and Switzerland . Passing to the head of secondary instruction , the Report will include descriptions and notices of schools in Great Britain , France , Prussia , and Saxony ; each chapter being devoted to a separate country , and preceded by general introductory remarks . I have ventured to propose a subdivision of this head , which appears to me borne out by reason , and by the present state of facts in regard to education ; the argument in reference to it will be found among the matter introductory to that division of the Report . In some countries it would appear , from the nature of their institutions , to be assumed that there is but one way of forming character , and of training the faculties of the mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be educated , must pass , whatever their occupation in after life . In others , a diversity in the methods of training appears to be admitted . In the first , if it be not the lot of the individual to remain sufficiently long under education to master the entire scholastic course , he is expected at least to possess a fragment of it . In the second , fragmentary education is not admitted ; but according to the time the individual may have to dispose of before entering active life , his course of education is directed ; and as this can not be accurately known in early life , the different paths diverge at first slowly , to render a passage from one to the other easy . Examples will be furnished of both these systems ; and , if I mistake not , it will be that the second , while its theory commends itself to reason , if , at the same time , entirely practicable . Under the division of Superior Instruction will be given de &#9632; criplions of some special schools for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Austria , and the higher agricultural school of Wirtemburgh , besides brief notices of a few other similar inititutions. /q/ /z/ As the pupils of the Girard College can not be admitted before the age of six , they are past the infant period , and thus it maybe supposed that I am departing from the rule which I have been obliged to lay down , in order to confine my Report within reasonable bounds . I am so fully impressed , however , with the importance of infant education , that I would not feel justified in passing over the period without a brief notice . The infant school system embraces so much of the philosophy of education , has been made so entirely an inductive branch , has been pondered over by so many minds of a superior order , that we can not fail to derive advantage from a consideration of some of its principles and practical results . I am persuaded , that from the quarter of infant school instruction will one day come the reform of the English juvenile schools , and indeed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juvenile Model School of Glasgow , and must extend widely , by the influence of its school for teachers . The infant school system seems to have originated about the same time in Great Britain and Switzerland . In the former country , the first idea has been steadily improved upon , and there also it is now best carried out . Oberlin , the pastor of Steinthal ( Ban de la Roche ) , collected the younger children of the poor of his parish into schools , where a female superintendent taught them spinning or knitting , and at intervals a little geography , from a Map of Steinthal and its Environs , or , by the help of pictures , a portion of Bible or natural history . About the same time , the children of the workmen in Mr. Owen 's extensive manufacturing establishments , at New Lanark , were collected in schools , for the purpose of healthful recreation , and of due care and of a certain degree of intellectual instruction ; and , subsequently , a similar establishment was commenced by Lord Brougham , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered as the author of the infant school as it now exists , having , in his connexion with a proposed asylum in another part of Indon , first proposed the name , defined the age , and estabhshcd the true principles of infant education . It is mainly by his instrumentality that the present system is now diffused so extensively over Great Britain . Of this system the infimt schools of Liverpool , which he was engaged to reform , offered me an example for inspection , though not of the most favourable kind . The model infant schools of Glasgow , Edinburgh , and London , are improvements on the system , presenting marked varieties : that in London being derived , however , from the Glasgow model . The necessity for the existence of such schools must vary much in diflieret countries , and hence their not being adopted in all is no argument against the general principle of infant education . The want of such schools is most felt in a dense and manufacturing population , least in a scattered and agricultural one . Independently of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various prejudices have concurred to prevent the introduction of these schools into some countries . Certain governments , as those of Germany in general , have not lent their influence to them , and the clergy have , in some parts of Europe , been as warmly opposed to them as in others they have been their friends . The deformed models which have been transplanted from England to other countries , have tended in many cases to foster these prejudices . In some of these the intellectual development of the pupils has been attempted to be carried on to their manifest injury , physically and mentally . In others , a mere mechanical and lifeless routine has been followed . The infant schools which I saw at Paris , called " coles d*asile , " seem to me to educate upon wrong principles , having adopted the mechanical arrangements of the English infant without having seized their spirit . I believe , that depriving-them of the female superintendence which they formerly ' enjoyed , to make them a part of the government system , will react further very injuriously upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Rotterdam , Amsterdam , and Zwolle , I saw good infant schools . In the capital of /q/ Prussia they are beginning to take permanent root . In Austria Proper , their condition is rather languishing , but in the Italian provinces they are deemed most important means of ultimately effecting a great change in the character of the people . At Venice the establishment is fostered by the government and liked by the people . At Milan is an admirable institution , growing out of that founded at Cremona , by the Abbe d'Aposti , who first introduced these schools into Italy . In Lombardy and Venice the schools are under the control of a society . The best infant schools which I visited were decidedly those of Glasgow , Edinburgh , and London . The system of the infant schools of Lombardy , as I saw it at Milan , comes next to the English model , *but is comparatively too verbal and precise , dealing too little with realities. * I propose to give an account of the school at Glasgow , and merely a notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I may not be supposed to dwell unnecessarily upon the subject . Model Infant School of the Glasgow Education Society . This is the first of the schools of the Glasgow Education Society , and was founded in 1826 . At my visit in 1836 , it contained two hundred pupils , and the success of the society had been such as to induce the erection of new buildings to contain their infant , juvenile , normal , and other schools . The principles of the system of education in this school are , first , that the corporal , intellectual , and moral nature of its pupils , is to be improved . Second , that this is to be done by inculcating good principles , and training to the practice of them . Third , that to render such training effectual , the nature of the individual to be educated must be studied . In a day-school like * I am indebted to the Marquis of Beccaria , one of the most strenuous friends of infant schools in Lombardy , for an account of the foundation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1837 , and the " Manual of Education and Administration of Infant Schools , " by the Rev. Abbe d'Aposti , and a " Guide for the Founders and Directors of Infant Charity Schools , derived from the Practice in the Infant Schools of Cremona . " Milan , 1836. t I am particularly indebted , for the opportunities of freely visiting the schools 1 of this society to the intelligent secretary , David Stow , Esq. , author of Stow 's System of Moral Training and of the Training System Adopted in the Model Schools of the Glasgow Education Society , &,c.; /z/ this one , for example , corporal training would include the acquisilion of proper habits of walking , sitting , standing , holding a book or slate , which , with manners , cleanliness , and a variety of others , will naturally suggest themselves . Intellectual training exercises the observing , perceiving , knowing , and reasoning faculties in a due degree , and here the art of the teacher is exercised mainly to judge how far he shall offer food to these . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently forgotten that the amelioration of the heart should precede that of the head , and moral and physical development are sacrificed to intellectual* Not so in this school . Its peculiar characteristic may be considered , the great stress which it lays upon the daily use of the Bible , as a means of both moral and intellectual training , and the constant preference given to such exercises as may be connected with it over all others . I subjoin , in the Appendix , ( No . IX. , ) an example of a Bible lesson , to illustrate my meaning in asserting the connexion of various intellectual exercises with its lessons . In Wilderspin 's system there were twentyfour Bible lessons , selected with a view to avoid any of the points on which sects of Christians differ ; in this there is a lesson for each day in the year , giving the variety which the other system wants , but at the expense , in part , of simplicity . The mechanical arrangements of the school are , first , the school-room , with its platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupying a considerable part of the breadth of the room . Second , the lesson-posts and forms , where the little classes assemble under their monitors . Third , the detached room , where the master may retire with a class . Fourth , the play-ground , with its implements for exercise and amusement , its flowers and fruits . The school-room is but tolerably well ventilated , though , no doubt , this will be remedied in a house built expressly for the purposes of the school . It is hung round with The abuM of intellectual development is nowhere more admirably set forth than in the trcatiie by our countrymun , A. Brigham , M. D. , which has been repobliiOMd in England , and in considered a standard work on the subject . our countrymen , Mr. Abbott , Ktands high as autliority in relaUon to in &ot; culture . /q/ boards , on which , in large letters , are inscribed words or religious sentiments , or on which are pictures of animals , &c.; The raised platform , in steps of due height , and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it enables the teacher distinctly to see every pupil , and in turn the pupils to see the master and each other . Thus the poXver of imitation and sympathy , which play so great a part in education , are brought to bear under the most advantageous circumstances . It is in this gallery that the most important exercises are given . The school opens with a short prayer , adapted to the comprehension of the children , order being first secured , if there are untrained pupils among them , by the aid of short physical exercises , raising and lowering the hands , rising and sitting down , and so on - such exercises never faihng to produce this result . The children assembled here listen to the Bible lesson , the master occupying the front and centre of the little assemblage , with the Bible-stand to support his book , and by its side the whistle and bell , which are to convey signals , intended to secure prompt obedience . The lesson having been read , it is broken up into detached parts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are led to understand them by other preliminary questions , proceeding always from the known to the unknown . Replies from many are secured by the elliptical form of answer , in which the master leaves a simple but emphatic word , or part of a word , to be supplied . These are impressed upon all by a repetition of the ellipsis , the filling up of which all have now caught from those who first supplied it , and finally the whole answer is repeated . The Bible lesson is frequently one of civil or natural history and geography . Simplicity in question is the desideratum in this and other exercises . The master must descend to the level of the child , or he effects nothing . Singing a hymn , or physical exercises , or the inspection which ensures cleanliness , /z/ will vary this course , and above all , care must be taken that the attention of the children is kept up . If this fails , it is the master himself who fails . A principle which , if at all admitted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it deserves . The gallery serves also for the lessons on objects , or pictures of objects , where simple specimens from the animal , vegetable , and mineral kingdom , or of artificial productions , are made the subjects of actual examination or of description . Their properties , as far as may be , are observed by the children , led by the master , who directs their feeble perceptions . Words to express their ideas are furnished , when the want of these words is felt . With those somewhat advanced , the printed or written word is shown and imitated on the slate . At an earlier period the letter which begins the word is selected from a series of large brass letters , cut out for this purpose , and is held before the pupil , and its name or its most common sound in combination given . A word beginning with the same letter is suggested by a pupil , another and another may be written on the board and copied , and all or any of them may be made the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical grammar , which will be explained when speaking of the juvenile school , is added . When places are spoken of , objects or pictures are shown in connexion with them . The children are in the gallery also during their arithmetic lessons , when the ball frame , so well known in all infant schools , is substituted for the Bible-stand , and the teacher gives his lessons by question and answer elliptically , by teaching a song in which the ellipsis of a word occurs in each line , or by the pupils singing simple songs already learned . These impress the easy operations of infant arithmetic powerfully upon the memory . The eye and ear are thus improving with the intellect , or the eye is exercised by the determination of angles by the jointed instrument , called a gonigraph. or by geometrical figures . The children are also in the gallery when hearing from the master a story , embodying circumstances of a moral tendency , or calculated to instruct or amute , or to arouse curiosity . This is one of the exercises /q/ they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master be apt , maybe made as useful as any . The characters of the great and the good may be brought before them , their feelings interested , and thus early elevated , their patriotism excited , and evil tendencies repressed . It is the peculiar feature of this school to draw such stories often from the sacred volume , and in general , as an illustration of how attractive these may be rendered , it may be stated , that when left to choose the kind of story they will have , the children prefer a Bible history to any other . These various exercises of course are not continuous , nor do they even occur , sometimes , on the same day , and each of them is interrupted frequently for exercise , especially with untrained children . elliptical method spoken of is to omit the last or some important word of a sentence , taking care that it is one easily supplied by the children , and which leaves the sentence plainly imperfect until it is given . Thus the children are engaged in a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are parties in it , and watching keenly the sentence , that they may seize the wanting word . In the ellipsis used in this school , the first sounds of a word are frequently supplied , requiring the little assembly to suggest the rest . I observed a great difference in the facility with which the children suppHed the ellipsis of their master , by whom they were in the habit of being questioned , and that of others by whom they were addressed , but found that it arose , generally , from the too great rapidity of the uninitiated teachers , by which they did not allow the children time to think and to answer . This explanation supposes the ellipsis well contrived . The method of responses is frequently varied , by inducing some one or more of the children to ask questions of the class , two or more of each other , or one or more to volunteer to be questioned by the class . From the whole of this method , emulation as a principle is excluded , it is not needed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * This method is stated to have been first announced by Dr. Borthwick GilChrist , in his lectures on Oriental literature . It was adopted early by Mr. VVilderspin. // I was surprised , in witnessing some of these exercises , at the accuracy with which the children stated their questions , resulting entirely from the imitation of the perspicuous style of the master. * On the subject of imitative powers at this early age , many facts might be brought together ; one struck me so much that I mention it here . 1 never visited an infant school in which the voice of the master or mistress was agreeable in singing , without finding melody among the children , and vice versa . It is recorded in this school that nearly all the children learn to sing agreeably . The passage from the gallery to the lesson posts is performed while singing , and always in regular order . Sometimes an interval of out or in-door exercise separates the lessons . The monitors are choisen by the master , or offer themselves by t holding up of hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the gallery . Each monitor has a class of half a dozen or more , to whom he explains the picture suspended upon their particular reading-post , and the letters or words beneath it . The classes change posts , after a reasonable interval , and the monitor has a new set to drill . Such teaching is not to be expected to be efRcient , but it nevertheless answers a good purpose at this age . The lesson-posts are arranged so that the board on which the lesson is pasted may be readily changed , and so that its height may be varied to suit the size of the pupils receiving the lesson . The boards are covered with coloured prints of animals , representations of trades , of costumes , &c.; No formal attempt is made to teach reading , but it is found without it that the children insensibly learn to read . A useful exercise for the more advanced children , requiring study at home , and which also frequently excites the attention of parents , is to give them cards , with questions relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The answers are sometimes required from particular parts of the Bible . Behind the gallery are the places for hanging the caps and of the children , which they are trained to put off and Mr. David Caughy , whcwe wife ii his assistant in the school . /q/ to take again in an orderly manner . The detached room enables a master to hear any class which he may wish , apart from the others , the mistress meanwhile superintending the school , or to teach the monitors , or furnishes a place for the noon luncheon , which many of the children bring with them . The play-ground in the system of this school is considered the " uncovered school-room , " the true place for moral training , where the principles inculcated within are to be carried into practice , and where the tempers and dispositions show themselves more fully , in unrestrained intercourse , than in the school . There is in it a circular swing* for exercise , wooden prisms in the proportions of bricks , for amusement , and flowers and fruits , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public . The master is constantly with , or overlooking them , sometimes mixing in their sports , or showing them new or amusing games , and always attentive to their development of character , but unless in extraordinary cases , his interference is not necessary . The benevolence of some children prevents or remedies the accidents incident to their plays , and justice insures a tolerably equal share of the sports . When a fault is committed , it ' is noticed after the assembling of the children in the gallery , where the public opinion of his equals in age is brought to bear upon the offender by a judicious series of questions from the master , without , however , making the punishment a public one , by directly designating the individual who is under censure . Punishments in or out of school are adapted to the tender age of the child , and addressed to his peculiar temperament . Corporal punishment , even of the mildest kind , is seldom found necessary . * This consists of a mast or post , about eighteen feet high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron , movable upon a pin of the same material , fastened into the post . Four ropes hang from this plate , and each has knots or sticks across it , at heights suitable to the size of the children , who are to grasp them . These ropes being seized , the children run round , keeping them fully stretched . The motion soon produces a sufficient centrifugal force to take them off their feet . If a child lets go of the rope , he is carried beyond the circle where the others would touch him in their course round . /z/ When the play-ground can not be used , the want is supplied , / . as far as possible , by games within doors , which are , however , very imperfect substitutes for those in the open air . /z/ This establishment was founded by the Edinburgh Infant School Society , in 1829 , subsequently to that of Glasgow , and upon principles of education very similar to those of the Glasgow Model School . The necessity of combining moral with intellectual training is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same importance is attached to physical training . The same use is made of the play-ground as in the Glasgow school , and with similar efficacy as to the bodily and moral improvement of the children . The system of Wilderspin was at the outset the guide of both . The general principles which regulate the establishment of a school , however closely it may be the intention of the teacher to follow them , will always receive a modifying impress from his own peculiar views and qualities . Thus , while intellectual education is declared to be a secondary object here , the amount of actual attainment by the pupil is much greater than at Glasgow , from the circumstance that the turn of the master 's mind is constantly towards inventing ways of simplifying the mode of instruction . Some part of the time occupied in the other school in religious training is spent in this in intellectual , and the children leave it , having advanced so far as to read , spell , and parse , and having a knowledge of the elements of geography , history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &c.; The season at which I visited the school , the winter , was unfavourable to a judgment of the physical education , but the appearance of the children indicated that it was good . The moral results appear from published documents highly satisfactory , and the intellectual struck me as perhaps even too high ; a correct decision , however , on this important question would require more time for observation than 1 had to bestow , especially from the fact which I have before remarked , that the talent of the /z/ master particularly showed itself in intellectual training . His multiplied means of addressing instruction through the eye , the products in great part of his own ingenuity in devising and skill in executing , were very remarkable ; added to which he had thrown many subjects into the form of games , rendering them attractive to the children . Among the former were the progressive maps of travel for infant geography , the historical maps , with picture illustrations , the illustrated grammar exercises , the exercises in measures and weights , and in Arabic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was also particularly pleased with a series of moral training lessons , which , beginning with a statement of what the school should be , provides rules for attaining this condition , and reasons for the rules ; precepts in regard to the virtues , and remarks upon faults to be avoided . This school has had as many as one hundred and sixty pupils , and the general attendance averages about one hundred and twenty . The mixed system of lessons in the gallery , and of monitors for the classes , is used in it as at Glasgow , and the other general arrangements are also much the same in the two schools . /z/ " The Home and Colonial Infant School Society " was instituted in 1836 , to promote the cause of infant education , by pointing out to the public the indispensable qualifications of teachers , by providing an establishment where teachers might be received and their acquirements put to the test and improved , and by publishing lectures , lessons , manuals , and other appropriate works-f To carry out the second part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school absolutely necessary . The teachers * Mr. Milne , who has his wife for his assistant in the school . t The society has been fortunate in securing the assistance of some of the most distinguished friends of education in their enterprise , as Doctor and Miss Mayo , of London , Dr. Bryce , of Belfast , &c.; Dr. Mayo is well known as the principal of a Pestalozzian school at Cheam , in Surrey . /z/ were instructed in the principles of their art , but as the schools which they visited did not exemplify these principles , they were not trained in the practice of them , and hence , in many cases , their career did not justify the expectations of the society . The model infant school established by this society is upon the enlightened plan which I have already described , the teacher having been trained in the Normal school at Glasgow ; but it partakes , in a considerable degree , of the peculiarities of the Edinburgh school . Thus , in religious instruction , its aim is to avoid such matter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it carries intellectual education further than its Glasgow model . It is true , indeed , that in the recent official work on infant education issued by the society , a part of the instruction actually given , namely , teaching to read , is not spoken of with special approbation , but rather as a yielding to the supposed prejudices of parents . The method itself draws strong encomiums from the managers of the society , and will be found described in the Appendix to this Report , ( No . X. ) t I was particularly pleased with the lessons given in sensible objects , and the incidental exercises of orthography to which they led . The pictures used are a decided improvement on those commonly employed , but a difficulty in their use has been discovered , from the very precise ideas which the child attaches to them , by which truth appears to be violated , when the same subject is illustrated differently in two pictures . It has been found possible to overcome this difficulty , in a degree , by impressing upon the child that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representations of events which the artist has witnessed . The small play-ground here is better furnished with the means of infant gymnastic exercises than that of Glasgow , but is by DO means commodious . PncUc &l; Remarks on Infant Education , by the Rev. Dr. Mayo and Miss Mayo . It is interesting to sec , in this work , how admirably the natural method of instruction by Pestalozzi adapts itself to the infant school . t It is entitled " Reading Disentangled , " and is divided into twenty-seven /z/ The teachers who are in training receive theoretical lessons , attend the practice of the school , are employed to teach small classes in separate rooms , under superintendence , and , finally , practice with the entire class . The course for teachers is , as yet , however , of too Hmited a duration , being only three months ; but it is proposed to extend it when further means of reducing the cost of the maintenance of the pupil-teachers shall be afforded . /z/ Elementary education may be considered in two points of view , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of the community , or as leading to higher instruction . In the former view , it requires to be complete , as a whole ; in the latter , it is essentially preparatory . In reference to each , its character is materially different . In our country at large , " we have been necessarily more occupied with creating common schools , than with elevating the standard of the instruction given in them . In the meantime , education has been advancing ; and , unless we would be untrue to ourselves and to our political institutions , we must gather experience wherever it is to be found , and apply those practical results which are best adapted to our circumstances . In like manner , on the more limited field of the Girard College , we must raise our system upon the basis of the successful experiments of others , unless we would encounter the vexations incident to the acquisition of experience by our own failures . The importance of primary instruction in both these references , has induced me to extend this notice of its present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiply the examples illustrative of the systems , where the schools are in a flourishing condition . It happens , and I believe unfortunately for us , that the elementary schools of Great Britain are , in general , behind those of otlier countries of Europe with which we are less connected . Desultory , and sometimes conflicting , efforts at improvement have not made an impression proportioned to the wants of the people of that country , and have left them behind olben , Mrho have much less need of cultivated intelligence to /q/ enable them to fufil the duties of citizens . Through the medium of schools for teachers , the importance of which is now recognised , the same rapid reforms may , however , be worked there , as have been effected in some countries on the continent . It will be found that , at present , I have been obliged to draw my examples of the schools for popular instruction in Great Britain from Scotland exclusively , but descriptions of departments for primary instruction will be found in some of the notices of secondary schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools of France are not yet , in general , upon a level with those of Holland and Prussia , I have appended a brief notice of the system and progress of public instruction there . The view affords great encouragement , by I showing how much may be realized by judicious laws , and in a well-arranged system of inspection . A rapid improvement in the schools in general will , no doubt , result from the operation of the normal schools . The system of primary instruction in Holland is particularly interesting to an American , from its organization in an ascending series ; beginning with the local school authorities , and terminating , after progressive degrees of representation , as it were , in the highest authority ; instead of emanating , as in the centralized systems , from that authority . A fair trial has been . given to a system of inspection which is almost entirely applicable to our country , and which has succeeded with them . They have tried an important experiment , in communicating religious without sectarian instruction ; another , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and another , entirely unfavourable to the system of mutual instruction . I have enlarged , therefore , upon the general account of their system of public instruction , and have given rather a general notice of the schools , than of any one in particular . I have , however , made one of the schools for the poor , which seemed to me superior even to those of the same class in Prussia , the subject of special description and remark . The account in reference to Holland is followed by that of the Prussian system and schools . This is the most perfect of // the centralized systems , allowing considerable latitude in the arrangement of the individual schools , while all are subject to the influence of the central authority . It has not , as is commonly supposed , recently sprung into existence , but has been the work of time , has been altered and amended , and is still in progress . Its present condition is the result of experience , and thus it commends itself to enlightened imitation , by which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political or social institutions of the country adopting it , would employ the large amount of useful material which it contains . The schools contain much more that is applicable to our country than the system in general , and hence I have enlarged upon them , particularly upon the higher class of primary schools , which seem to me in better condition than those of any other of the larger European states . It is in what may be called the incidental parts of instruction , and which do not appear upon paper ; in the spirit of the teacher , and sometimes in that of the books ; that the peculiarities of national organization in these schools are chiefly to be found . The chapter on Prussia is followed by a notice of the schools of Saxony , and by an account of the excellent higher primary school , or Burgher School of Leipsic . The Model Primary School of Frankfort on Maine is described in the same chapter . The necessity of confining myself within hmits has alone prevented me from giving an account of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland . The Bavarian schools , according to Graser 's method , follow in the chapter succeeding Saxony . I have omitted mention of the others , as throwing no new light upon the subject . This is true also of the Austrian primary schools . These latter are chiefly characterized by a spirit of system , which exactly regulates the method and amount of what is to be taught , and when it shall be taught , throughout this vast empire . The mode of educating teachers tends to give them rather the routine than the spirit of their profession . My remarks apply to Austria Proper , and have no reference to the number , but to the general character of the schools . I was most favou/q/
