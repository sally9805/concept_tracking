txt THAT Agriculture , in some form or other , always has been , and always must be the great source of subsistence to every community , is a truth generally admitted , though we are inclined to think not appreciated in its full extent . To develope and illustrate it , would be neither a difficult nor unpleasant task . Such , however , is not our present object . Our business is with that branch of this great art , which , from the scale on which it is carried on , is denominated Gardening . This , as a practical art , is generally supposed to be coeval with the human race , and its existence is recognised in the earliest records of man , authentic or fabulous . Passing over antediluvian history , we find the planting of the vine commeinorated , as the first achievement of human industry after the deluge . But horticulture , like other branches of agriculture , had ministered for ages to the support and enjoyment of the human family , before any one had attempted to embody and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be more interesting , than a connected narrative of its early progress ; but the materials for constructing such an account are exceedingly scanty . We are still ignorant , for instance , as justly observed by McKnight , of the native localities of the most highly prized fruits ; and we are equally at a loss respecting the origin of some of our most important and familiar operations in gardening . The origin of grafting , a practice , which , if introduced in our day , would procure for its inventor a place among the proudest names of modern science , and the still higher title of one of the chief benefactors of his species , is mere matter of conjecture ; and the stories handed down to us on this subject , by Pliny and other ancient writers , have neither the merit of truth nor of ingenuity . // In modern times as in ancient , the actual practice of horticulture has preceded , by a long interval , the scientific developement of its principles ; and in every community gardens have been cultivated for centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest authority or value . Our own country , young as it is , forms no exception to this remark . The general existence of fruit trees , in all the compact settlements of New England at least , dates back far beyond the memory of the oldest persons now living . The apple tree must have been cultivated on a considerable scale in the earliest periods of our colonial history ; for we find from the following extract from Laws of the Plymouth Colony , passed in the year 1667 , that cider was then a common beverage . " It was enacted by the Court , that no persoa or persons shall sell any cyder to any Indian , under the penalty of ten shillinges , &amp;c . And that none allow any persons to spend theire time by tippleing any cyder , liquors , &amp;c. in theire houses ; and that in case any cyder be found in the costody of any Indians , it shall be lawfull for any man to take it away from them . " A still more striking evidence of the horticultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought over by Governor Endicott . This is still standing in the town of Danvers , and boasts a green and fruitful old age , after the lapse of more than two hundred years from its emigration . The more delicate fruits , such as the peach and the finest varieties of French pears , were introduced at least as early as the first part of the eighteenth century . According to the tradition prevailing in this vicinity , we are indebted for these valuable productions to the Huguenots , who came over from France in large numbers about that period ; and , though the positive evidence in favor of this supposition is but scanty , there seems no good reason for calling it in question . At any rate , the peach tree at least must have been well established among us previous to the year 1724 . This we are authorized to infer from a passage of that date in the curious Diary of the late Reverend Thomas Smith , of Portland , in which he speaks of this tree as of a plant generally known and cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as // from other sources , that the plum and the cherry tree were raised to an equal extent more than eighty years since . But while the culture of fruit trees has been extensively pursued in New England for so many generations , the few horticultural works which have been published among us are of very recent origin . Agriculture in its more restricted sense could boast , more than a hundred years ago , of the works of Jared Eliot , the father of New England husbandry ; but the earliest production , partaking in any material degree of a horticultural character , was the " New England Farmer , " a journal which was first published in I S25 , and which still maintains its reputation as a most effective instrument in promoting that striking improvement in the cultivation both of our fields and our gardens , so manifest within a few years . Previous to this publication , we had little other written horticultural information than such as might be found scattered through the almanacs . This , as might have been expected , was of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brief suggestions , of very different degrees of merit . Whije the reader was frequently edified by practical statements of important facts , he was quite as often deceived or amused , as the case might be , by the strangest stories and precepts , many of which reappear from time to time , and run the circle of the newspapers . Such , for instance , are grave suggestions , recommending the inoculating of the stocks of trees with mercurial ointment and the kindling of bonfires in gardens , in order to take off the myriads of noxious insects by poison , or to induce them to exterminate themselves in a general conflagration . To these we may add the still more extraordinary assertions , that the scion of a pear tree , when grafted on an apple stock , gr*adually changes its nature and at length produces apples , or that a fruitful apple tree may be procured in two or three years from a cutting which has been inserted into a potato , doctrines which have found a place in some of the most respectable journals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way , which should induce us to speak with some lenity of Virgil 's well-known fables respecting the grafting of the apple on the oak , and the procuring a new race of bees from the carcass of an ox . It is no wonder , that book-learned skill was held in little repute by practical farmers and gardeners , that an agricultural VOL . XLVII. - NO. cm. 54 // author was considered as another name for a visionary theorist , and that the few really valuable works , native or foreign , which we possessed on these subjects , were generally condemned unread . Such was the state of our horticultural literature ( so to speak ) , till within the last ten years . It is scarcely necessary to remind the reader , that a new era has now taken place in the cultivation of gardens as well as fields . Horticulture is now becoming a subject of deep and increasing interest , and the necessity of enlightened and regular efforts for its extension and advancement is daily more and more understood . It seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , like every other important art , has its science , its general principles as well as its practical details ; that there must he written works , in which facts must be precisely stated , and rules systematically laid down and that young gardeners should no longer be compelled to grope their way , one after another , in a mere course of hap-hazard experiment , with little useful light except that afforded by the result of their own errors . These convictions have not failed to produce their natural and proper resuits . Within the period just mentioned , we have witnessed the publication of several works relating professedly and exclusively to the cultivation of gardens , composed by experimental practical gardeners , and therefore abounding in solid information , and at the same time written with a sufficient degree of perspicuity and neatness to render them acceptable to the mere general reader . Such , for instance , are the two horticultural magazines published in Boston , and the works of Bridgeman , Green , and others . Of these works , that now before us may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though certainly of a very reasonable compass , one of the most voluminous . It is evidently compiled with great research , as appears by the catalogue of authors consulted , which comprises the names of nearly all the distinguished gardeners of this and other countries . The liberal manner in which the author acknowledges the assistance received from different individuals is as creditable to his candor , as the use which he has made of his abundant materials is to his skill and judgment . The greater portion of this volume consists of an extensive and wellselected list of the most valuable and beautiful trees , shrubs , and flowers , which will flourish in our climate , interspersed // with brief , but just and sufficiently complete directions for their cultivation . The most interesting portion of the work to the public generally will probably be the Introduction . This is divided into several sections , relating to the cultivation of fruit trees in general . The first section contains some valuable remarks on the climate of the United States , and more especially of the Atlantic region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak chiefly of New England ) has been more frequently compared with that of Great Britain , than with that of any other portion of the European world . Few are ignorant of the fact , that there is a wide difference , and in many respects a striking contrast , between the seasons in the one country , and the other . It is generally known , that our winters are much longer and more severe , than those of much higher latitudes in the Eastern world . It is equally notorious , that our extremes of temperature are greater , and the changes from heat to cold more sudden and violent , than any which occur in the British Islands , and that the American climate was never more correctly as well as concisely described , than in the elegant remark of Washington Irving , that it is " fierce in all its extremes , but splendid in all its vicissitudes . " We know not whether the origin of these peculiarities has been fully ascertained ; and do not propose to discuss , or even to state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . The following remarks are as satisfactory on the whole , as any which we have seen . " The climate of the Atlantic States has been generally characterized as variable and inconstant . These sudden changes are caused in a great measure by the conflicting winds , which blow alternately from the opposite points , - the sources of extreme heat and of excessive cold . Those especially from the southeast , and south , bring alternately clouds charged with sultry vapors , or storms of rain , or the fiery particles and intense heat which they have inhaled in the equinoctial regions . While the winds from the northwest are not only dry , but , coming over the enormous mountains covered with ice and snow , and from the immense frozen territories which stretch towards the Arctic regions , and thence westward , and from the great icy ocean towards the pole , they imbibe , at certain seasons , a degree of cold the most piercing and intense . These adverse winds bring by turns , and often by sudden changes , the heat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions . " - pp. 15 , 16. // " It has also been observed , that within the temperate zones , the western coasts of continents , and large islands , are found to possess a higher mean temperature than the eastern coasts . Our climate , on the shores of the Atlantic , must , therefore , correspond nearly with that of the eastern coasts of China , Japan , and Chinese Tartary , and the islands on its coast . And the climate of our country which bounds on the Pacific , may correspond nearly with that of Europe on the coasts of the Atlantic , in the corresponding latitudes . " - p. 17 . But , however we may speculate on the cause of the superiority in mildne3s of a British winter over that of any part of the New England States , this superiority is too well verified by precise facts , as well as by common report , to admit of question . The northern counties of Scotland , for instance , lie in latitude nearly sixteen degrees north of Boston , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet in those counties , ploughing is frequently carried on in the month of February , a season in which the ground in Massachusetts is open scarcely once in a generation . The blowing of roses in the open air at Christmas is mentioned by English writers as a familiar occurrence , while we need not say , that it is altogether unparalleled in our vicinity . Hence many plants , which endure the cold of the greater part of England , are altogether incompetent to brave the rigor of a New England winter . Nor is it the coldness of our climate , which renders it so dangerous to tender plants , and which so greatly abridges our catalogue of hardy perennials . The great and rapid variations , which usually occur in the winter months are far more perilous to vegetable life . The fluids of plants are often set in motion by a short period of vernal warmth , and then congealed by the sudden renewal of frost . In winters of steady though severe cold , the more tender garden shrubs generally escape with little or no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground has been hidden for a long period beneath a deep bed of snow . The surface is thus covered as with a thick fleece , and completely protected from all variations of temperature . Our mildest winters , on the contrary , are often the most destructive of all ; for , mild as they may be on the whole , they are rarely without occasional intervals of intense cold ; and this unnatural alternation is fatal to many species of vegetable productions , which pass without // the slightest injury through the far more equable as well as milder temperature of a British winter . But , on the other hand , of those plants which can fairly endure the winter months , the greater part ripen their products with far more certainty in the Northern States , than most parts of England . We are accustomed , it is true , to consider our spring as a most variable and uncomfortable season , and to fancy that Shakspeare must have drawn from our vernal months his beautiful picture of the disordered seasons . " Hoary-headed frosts Fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Hiems ' chin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is as in mockery set . " Indeed , Cobbett asserts , with good-humored and not very violent exaggeration , that we have no spring at all , and divides , by a sort of Polish partition , the province usually assigned to that season between summer and winter . But our real spring , or blooming season , call it by what name you will , is we apprehend less perilous to most productions of the garden , and especially to most fruit trees , than the corresponding period in England . The same writer subsequently remarks , that " in this country , when we see the blossom , we know that the fruit will follow ; but that in England and France the trees must be often covered to protect them from the untimely frosts of April and May. ** This remark , or so much of it at least as relates to this country , may be too strongly expressed , but in the main it seems to be well founded . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England is a fact which needs only to be stated , and the mildness and splendor of an American autumn are proverbial throughout Christendom . But the superiority of the American climate ( even in the Middle and Northern States ) for the raising of fruits , over that of Great Britain , is best attested by the different modes in which fruit trees are reared in the two countries . In most of those States the summers are sufficiently warm to enable the apple and pear tree , and even the plum and the peach , to ripen their fruits perfectly well as natural standards ; and , with the exception of a few curious gardeners , no one deems it necessary to resort to any artificial mode of training either of these plants . In England , the peach is almost universally a wall fruit , and // the pear and plum tree are very generally dwarfed and trained against walls or espaliers . Even those more delicate species of apples , usually cultivated on a small scale in gardens , are generally raised in the same artificial mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to think , that the fruits of England are on the whole greatly inferior in flavor to those of this country . Mr. Kenrick informs us , that some of the finest kinds of American peaches prove utterly worthless when grown in England , and that the whole tribe of clingstones especially are given up by the gardeners of that country , as a fruit altogether unfitted to the climate . He adds , that many of the best apples share the like disastrous fate . The comparison between English and American fruits , in point of flavor , does not admit perhaps of being brought to an issue of the most decisive kind . To do this they must be tasted at the same moment ; and , with the exception of the apple , none of the best garden fruits can be transported in good condition from the one country to the other . So far as relates to this fruit , we believe , there is no question . There are indeed a few kinds of English apples highly celebrated in the horticultural works of that country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Pippins , Baldwius , and other American apples of the first class , has never been established by any satisfactory evidence . But , if we compare together such apples as are exposed for sale in the great markets of the one country and the other , ( and we know not why this is not a fair mode of comparison ) we believe that no candid Englishman would hesitate to admit that the result would be greatly in our favor . Indeed , the cloudy and moist climate of Great Britain would seem to be one of the last , to ripen to perfection the more delicate fruits of the temperate zone . These , it will be recollected , originated for the most part under the bright and scorching suns of southern Asia , and , at the present day , are generally better in Italy and the south of France , than in any more northern region of Europe . The truth is , that all the fine fruit in Great Britain is dearly earned ; wrung , as it were , from a frowning climate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a striking proof , far more of human intelligence and industry , than of any fitness in the soil and sky of that island for horticultural purposes . // What advancement might not be made in our horticulture , were one tenth part of the science , capital , and labor , devoted to its improvement , which are expended on the same object by English gardeners . Some further light may be thrown on this interesting subject , by a few remarks on the principal fruits usually cultivated in the open air , in Massachusetts and the adjoining States . Of these , the first in importance is the Apple . This is the only fruit generally raised in New England in orchards , and its cultivation may therefore be considered as standing on the dividing line between Horticulture and Agriculture . We have already adverted to the early period at which this description of tree was introduced . How well it thrives in our climate , has been shown by the experience of more than two centuries . We believe there is scarcely a corner of New England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce fruit , in great abundance and of good quality ; and we have been informed , that many of the most delicious varieties of apple are raised in the State of Maine , where they were introduced by the lamented Benjalnin Vaughan . It is well known , that there is one species of this fruit ( malus coronaria ) which is indigenous to the United States . This is rarely seen in the Eastern States , hut in the State of Illinois grows in such abundance , as to form natural groves of miles in extent . We are not aware , that this species has long been raised on account of its fruit , which is very small , of a green color , and sharp acid taste , and barely eatable ; but its blossom is uncommonly fragrant , and this circumstance has given it a place in many gardens as a flowering shrub . Its very existence is probably unknown to New England farmers general ly . The fruit raised in the Northern States is , for the most part , the product of native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descents from English ancestors . The practice of procuring fine apples by grafting is , we believe , of modern introduction in this country , and , half a century since , was practised by none but a few curious cultivators . The course generally adopted by New England farmers from the beginning , for the supply of their orchards , has been , to sow the pomace , or crushed pulp of the apple , which is taken from the cider-mill after the juice is expressed , and // which , of course , abounds in seeds . Hence , the many kinds of apple which may be found in every orchard of natural , or , in other words , ungrafted trees . The selection of seeds for the purpose of procuring valuable new varieties , has seldom , if ever , been adopted ; and thus our finest specimens of this fruit are mere chance productions . This is known to be the case with the beautiful Baldwin apple , of which the parent tree was in existence till within a few years . There can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplied by a recourse to the more systematic and scientific modes of propagation pursued by Knight , Van Mons , and other distinguished European botanists . It is often said , that the apples of New England are inferior in quality to those of the Middle States ; and it has been consequently inferred , that the climate of that region is better adapted to this fruit . We think the assertion , as well as the inference , quite too hasty . Both are probably founded on the acknowledged superiority of one of the apples of the Middle States , the far-famed Newton Pippin . This rich fruit , has , it is true , no rival in New England , nor , as far as we know , in any other country . It seems equally certain , that the tree rarely flourishes in the climate of Massachusetts , and , though it grows well , proves a very shy bearer . But , if we except this unrivalled variety , we know of no apple which throws into the shade the different , but striking merits , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak at great length of the various uses of the apple in the domestic economy of New England . Every one knows , that , for several generations , this fruit furnished not only much of the food of our predecessors , but their chief beverage , and that cider held the same place for more than a century in the northern states , which has been occupied by light wines in France , or malt liquors in Great Britain . From this position it has recently been driven , at least in large towns . In these it has been exposed to a double competition , from the French and German wines on the one hand , and the pure element on the other , and seems to be falling rapidly out of favor . Should its use , however , be from any cause wholly abandoned , we have the consolation of knowing that our orchards will lose little or nothing of their value . Various and important as have been the purposes to which the apple has // been applied in former times , the list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years . It is now known to form not only an agreeable , but a most nourishing article of diet , both to men , and to domestic animals , and is especially in high credit , among the most intelligent farmers , for its utility in fattening swine , a race not apt to relish or to thrive upon unsubstantial fare . As a matter of profit there are few objects to which the capital and labor of a skilful farmer can be better devoted than to the rearing of good apple trees . Few plants require a more moderate degree of care , or reward that care more bountifully . Seven or eight barrels of apples form by no means an unusually large product for a thrifty tree , and we have seen well-authenticated accounts of some , which have borne no less than four times that quantity . It has been stated by one of the ablest and most exact writers on agriculture , that , a few years since , one hundred and sixty barrels of apples were gathered from an orchard in the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large quantity of windfalls , ) and that the whole product of the orchard amounted to not less in value than three hundred dollars . The size to which this tree attains in New England , and the healthiness of its condition , form , in addition to its productiveness , a striking proof of its adaptation to our climate . We have heard of trees of twelve feet in circumference in the smallest part of the trunks , and have seen several of nine . When the tree reaches a mature age , it bids defiance to our coldest winters and most uncertain springs and , if guarded from the assaults of insects , seems invulnerable to all injuries from natural causes , except those inflicted by the universal and resistless power of old age . At what period it is subjected to these , is a point which is not yet fully ascertained , but which has been investigated with much care by the writer to whom we have just referred . From the best information which he could collect on the subject , he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growth of thirty years to bring it into its most fruitful condition , and that its term of vigor and decay occupies about the same period ; in other words , that the average life of the tree may be estimated at about sixty years . It appears , however , that , in some few instances , this tree like most others , is indulged with a term of existence far beyond the vOL . XLvII. - No . CI . // limits assigned to its species generally . Thus we are told by the same writer , of an apple tree in Hartford , said to have been imported before the middle of the seventeenth century . Although this statement is not very precise , yet from many other circumstances there seems to be no doubt that the tree has outlasted at least two generations of its fellows . It has certainly outlived its usefulness , for we learn that it produces only a few dozen of apples from some scattered branches near the top , and that it exhibits many marks of extreme decay . Similar instances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable productions , and must be considered merely as rare phenomena , analogous to those formed by the lives of Thomas Parr and Henry Jenkins , in the history of our own species . The general proposition laid down by the above writer is , we believe , substantially correct ; and , if it be , the average life of apple trees varies little from that of our own species . Consequently the orchards from whence we derive our present supplies are almost entirely of a growth subsequent to the Revolution . Hence also , if the modern doctrine respecting the decay of all varieties of ctiltivated fruit be true , a point on which we shall presently say more , few if any of our present favorite apples are the same with those which regaled the palates of our grandfathers . Next to the apple , the fruit tree most generally cultivated in New England is the Pear . This has sometimes been reared in orchards for the manufacture of perry , but is for the most part confined to gardens . To a common observer this tree bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researches of botanists , as well as the experience of gardeners , have shown , that the affinity is merely superficial . The wood of the pear is much harder than that of the apple , and , probably for this reason , it is exempt from the destructive attacks of the borer . Its leaves also escape , from some unknown cause , those two formidable and wide-wasting enemies of our apple orchards , the cankerworm and the caterpillar . On the other hand , it is exposed to the ravages of insects which have never been detected on any other fruit tree . But the most striking proof of dissimilarity in the internal structure of the pear and apple is found in the fact , that the one can rarely be grafted on the other with eventual suc // cess , and that , though the scions do not absolutely refuse to take , they scarcely ever flourish , and generally soon perish . The pear tree also differs essentially from the apple in its superior longevity . This has been stated by Mr. Knight at no less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in error , or at least that it is a hasty general inference , drawn from the protracted existence of a few individuals in uncommonly favorable situations . But there is abundant evidence , that the pear on an average outlasts the apple by more than half a century . We have already noticed the tree planted by Governor Endicott , which probably stands , in point of seniority , at the head of the cultivated plants of the country . There is a tree still in bearing near New York , which was planted by Governor Stuyvesant , and is designated by his name , which boasts of an age inferior only by thirty years to that of the Endicott tree . For the finest ancient varieties of this tree we are unquestionably indebted to France , a fact attested not only by their names , but by the uniform evidence of tradition , to which we have already referred . The unfortunate and striking circumstance , that many of the choicest of these varieties are rapidly verging to extinction , both here and in Europe , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is one which could not fail to arrest the attention of scientific gardeners . The fact was long disputed , and , when it had forced itself into credit and notoriety , many flattered themselves with the belief , that it was owing to a temporary cause . It was accordingly ascribed to some change in climate , or some mysterious disease , and it was hoped , that after a cycle of years , more or less extended , these trees would resume their former vigor and fruitfulness . The contrary doctrine was first broached , or at least first earnestly maintained by Mr. Knight of England ; and to him , if to any one , we must award the credit of promulgating the theory of the limited existence of cultivated varieties of fruit , which now seems generally admitted . He found , by repeated experiments for many years , that the scions of many of the finest and most celebrated varieties of apple and pear could no longer be successfully inserted on younger stocks , and that the parent trees themselves gradually became less productive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thence drew the general conclusion , that all buds or scions // which are taken from any seedling fruit tree , as well as all branches which spring from them to an indefinite extent , are in a certain sense mere extensions or portions of the original parent ; in other words they partake of its constitution and can not outlast it ( unless it be prematurely cut off ) , for any long period . When the term of their existence expires , the variety of fruit which they bear is irrecoverably lost , because , as its existence can not be protracted , so neither can it be renewed by planting the seed . For every gardener knows , that the seeds of most , if not all our cultivated fruits , sport to a greater or less degree , and that the trees , which spring from them , almost universally yield , not the same fruit , but one of a different , and in many instances of inferior flavor . The degree to which this sporting extends varies materially in different fruits . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable prospect of procuring a fruit of similar qualities . On the other hand , the same experiment may be tried with hundreds of pear seeds , without succeeding in more than two or three instances ; and with respect to the cherry the variation seems to be still greater . Thus we perceive , that every variety of cultivated fruit springs from one parent tree ; and when this tree has finished its course , the variety itself , as we have already observed , must soon follow . Such is a brief and imperfect statement of the celebrated doctrine respecting the decline of ancient varieties of cultivated fruits . This doctrine was certainly an unwelcome one . Few lovers of good fruit were willing to admit , that the decline of the choicest trees in health and fertility , was owing to a permanent and irresistible law of nature , and could neither be prevented nor delayed by any human effort . The theory was accordingly attacked by many zealous and ingenious writers , with very different degrees of fairness and ability ; and though , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far from being an undisputed one . As year after year , however , affords additional evidence in its favor , or , at any rate , as the fact of the decline of some of the best fruits , more especially of the pear kind , is becoming more and more incontestable and manifest , the replacing of these , by new and fresh varieties of equal value from the seed , is now an object of the most earnest and unremitted efforts of the leading horticulturists of Europe . No one pursued this great object with more science , perseverance , // and success than Mr. Knight himself ; and no one is more entitled to the gratitude of lovers of horticulture , for the constant liberality , which he displayed in diffusing the beneficial results of his labors . The services , rendered by him in this respect to our own country , are we trust too well known to render any further statement of them necessary . Those , who wish for a detailed description of the diflerent modes adopted both in England and Belgium for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Introduction of Mr. Kenrick , and to our horticultural magazines . This country is not altogether without its examples of striking success in this interesting branch of gardening . It could hardly have been expected , that these examples should be very numerous . To procure a new variety of fruit from the seed requires , in most cases , a period of at least five years , a delay which , in our stirring and impatient community , is regarded much in the same light in which a Dutch , or even an English gardener , would look forward to the term of a generation . But , omitting all mention of original fruits which have been produced in other States , several delicious varieties of pears have been raised in Boston and its neighbourhood , which may compete with the choicest productions of the gardens of Knight or Van Mons. Those who complain of the attention and patience which nature exacts , as the price of her most delicious products , would do well to take a lesson from the perseverance and equanimity displayed by the latter of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more distressing character. * The Peach , as we have already stated , has been raised in the larger towns of New England for more than a century . We know not , however , whether this delicious fruit can be fairly claimed as a New England production . It has been little cultivated in the interior of the most northern States , and in Massachusetts is almost confined to the maritime districts . Even here , it must be admitted that the climate is too rigid to raise it in its highest degree of perfection , or in constant abundance . The tree seldom passes through a severe winter without the loss of some of its smaller branches , as well as material injury to its trunk and larger limbs . It has been supposed by many persons , that our seasons have be * The whole story may be found in Fessenden 's .7b'agazine , for 1t130 , pp. 228 to 230. // come less favorable to its growth than in former times ; but this we are inclined to think a mistaken impression , founded on early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this plant should be regarded , in New England , less as a tree than a short-lived shrub . With a few exceptions , its life in this vicinity can not be estimated at more than fifteen or twenty years , and this term is often shortened by its tendency to grow , and in favorable seasons to bear , to excess . It is also subject to the attacks of insects of different species , some of whom prey upon the leaves , and others mine into the trunk . The cultivation of this tree seems as yet to be very imperfectly understood in the Eastern States . It well repays all the protection which it can derive from a sheltered and sunny exposure , and grows best in a light and warm soil . But how far it should be pruned , and in what way , are points on which the best authorities are greatly at variance . Little useful information can be derived on the subject from English works , as in Great Britain the tree is almost universally trained against walls , and as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which no parallel can be found under the temperate skies of the northern portions of Europe. * But probably no system of management could ensure to it either long life or regular fruitfulness , in any part of New England ; and the only mode of securing a constant supply of the fruit seems to be the continual rearing of new trees . The peach seems to be placed , by general consent , at the head of all the fruits of the temperate zone , and is considered by most inhabitants of that region as without a rival in any part of the globe , except perhaps the far-famed mangostan of the tropics . It has derived its Latin name from Persia , a country to which all authors assign the honor of its birth , though the evidence on this point is quite too scanty to enable us to decide either way with great assurance . We are told , that the tree was brought to Rome in the reign of Claudius , about the year 40 of the Christian era . From one or two epigrams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing-houses , or pits , under glass . Sir Joseph Banks even supposes , that these houses were heated with flues ; but * This remark perhaps admits a more general extension . Chancellor Livingston estimated the growth of ' trees in a summer of ' the Middle States , compared with their growth in the same period in France or Great Britain , as five to two . // this conclusion seems to be unsustained by any sufficient evidence . We are told , that the first peaches raised at Rome were poisonous ; and this assertion is deemed by many a proof , that the peaches then known were of very inferior quality . The idea , however , may have been a mere prejudice , like that often prevailing in most communities against newly-discovered agricultural productions . Every one knows the difficulties which the potato has encountered , both in our own and other countries , in making its way into general favor ; and we believe that the peach itself was , forty years since , esteemed an unwholesome fruit by many in this vicinity . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaches of the ancient Romans differed materially in their flavor from any kind now known ; as the existence of any given variety of this , or indeed any other kind of fruit , for two thousand years , is a bold , and if there be any truth in the doctrine above referred to , an absolutely incredible supposition . We have already alluded to the high antiquity from which the culture of the Grape may be dated ; and we may add , that it has always been carried on to a greater extent than that of any other fruit . It is well known , that the product of the vine constitutes one of the great staples of all the countries of southern Europe . As it needs , and indeed prefers a light soil , it enables those nations who enjoy a climate favorable to its growth , to turn to the best account many rocky hills , which , in northern regions , would produce nothing better than a scanty pasturage . Various attempts have been made to form vineyards in different portions of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe seem ill fitted to sustain the winters of the Northern States , and , even in the more southern regions of the Union , are said to suffer materially from violent changes of weather . Indeed , the raising of foreign grapes in the open air , in the Eastern and Middle States at least , seems to be nearly relinquished ; and hence the formation of vineyards of this description in those States , may be considered as out of the question . To insure the ripening of the best table grapes of France in the vicinity of Boston , certainly requires the protection of glass , and we believe the aid of fire also . Happily these expedients can be employed without the slightest disadvantage , as no fruit // seems to preserve its natural fresh and rich flavor , under artificial culture , more effectually than the grape . The vines of this country , though resembling those of Europe in their form and mode of growth , bear a fruit so widely different , that perhaps it should be rather termed a berry than a grape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many botanists the only species of American grape , vitis Labrusca or fox grape , is indulged with a much wider range of climate than any of its European kindred , since it endures alike the cold of the most northern States , and the tropical heat of the Island of Cuba . Several varieties of this plant exist in every part of the Union ; but , though differing from each other in color , shape , and flavor , most if not all of them agree in a few prominent characteristics . The leaf is of a larger size , much thicker and less delicate than that of foreign vines , and the fruit is distinguished by a thick , opaque skin , a tough pulp , and an acid drop in the centre , qualities forming a disadvantageous contrast with those of the transparent and luscious products of European vineyards . Still , as this vine has the high recommendation of hardiness , and as it produces a wholesome , and to many a palatable fruit , it has certainly been treated with undeserved neglect . The raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much success by a few of our best gardeners , and is well deserving of more general attention . There is little doubt that we might thus acquire , in a few years , many descriptions of this plant , possessing the vigor and hardiness of their progenitors , and yet producing fruit which might rival in delicacy several of the grapes of Europe . The sixth section of our author 's Introduction , contains some brief directions on the important subject of Transplanting . Most of these , we believe , may be advantageously followed . We doubt , however , the expediency of treading down the earth forcibly , and pouring on large quantities of water immediately after setting the tree in the ground . Both these practices are pointedly condemned by some of the most experienced writers on horticulture , and the last , more particularly , seems to be a most unnatural and injurious expedient . We doubt not that many trees have been destroyed , or permanently injured , by a mode of treatment , adapted only to purely aquatic plants . If the ground be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // which is admitted to be either the spring or autumn , little else is requisite , than to allow sufficient room for the roots , and to spread them carefully . Even these moderate precan. ' tions are often neglected . " Many people , " says Marshall , " seem to think that they transplant a tree properly , when they merely hide it in the ground . " To ensure success in any mode of transplanting , it is of course a prerequisite that the tree be properly taken up ; and this process is frequently performed with such haste and violence , that all subsequent care must be vain . How often are trees torn from the soil with the loss of three quarters of their roots , and these of course the smaller fibres , through which every tree derives the chief part of its nourishment . Indeed , it is the difficulty , as well as importance , of preserving these rootlets unimpaired , which renders it advisable to transplant all trees whatsoever at an early stage of their growth . We have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is under ground ; in other words that the roots are much more widely spread than the branches ; and certain it is , that they extend themselves , downwards and around , to a degree altogether unsuspected by common oh . ' servers . Hence a great portion of them is often left in the ground on the removal of the tree , which thus receives its death-wound in the very act , and survives only to linger out a sickly existence in its new location . We believe it is now a general opinion among skilful gardeners , that nothing is gained by transplanting trees of more than two or three inches in diameter at farthest . XXTe are aware that these remarks are in direct opposition to a practice lately adopted in Scotland , and , as we are told by some writers of that country , with complete success . It is well known , that , within a few years , attempts have been made to transplant trees of mature age , and thus anticipate the tardy progress of natural growth , and raise magnificent groves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thousands of trees thus removed are now growing at various country seats in Scotland , with as much luxuriance as if originally planted in their present localities . It is further said , that these splendid results may be effected at a very moderate expense , inasmuch as the removal of a tall tree of a foot in diameter can be effected for thirty shillings sterling . We can not hut think , that the success of the experiment has been depicted in quite too flattering colors ; and we are still VOL . XLVII. - NO. ci . 56 // more confident , that the cost is greatly underrated . The removal of trees of a laige size in this country , with a proper quantity of root to afford the tree the slightest chance of surviving , would require an expense of at least ten times the amount stated above ; and no proper allowance for the diflbrent price of labor in New England and Scotland , respectively , will enable us to account for so wide a diversity . We have known some conspicuous instances , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ' growth has been fairly tried ; and , though in each case the greatest care was taken , the manner in which the trees have grown , since transplanting , is any thing but encouraging to similar enterprises . The labor and expense attending the operation were such as would of themselves render the practice , as a general one , entirely out of the question. * We can not but think , therefore , that those , who would adorn their grounds with magnificent trees , should wait for the slow but sure operation of Time , in place of resorting to an expedient , which , to say nothing of its expense , requires to be tried by a long and general experience , and of the success of which we have as yet none but imperfect , and apparently not very impartial , statements . Whether trees can best be transplanted in the spring or autumn , is one of the vexed questions of horticulture . Our author gives a decided preference to the months of October and November . In this , however , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivators , who generally select the spring , although the busiest season of the year . We have heard it suggested by an eminent * In confirmation of this remark , we quote the following extract from Lockhart 's Life of Scott , Vol . V. p. 232 , ( Philad. edition. ) merely reminding our readers , that the price of labor is much higher with us than in any part of Scotland . " In September , the Highland Society of Scotland , at the request of the late Sir Henry Stewart of Allanton , sent a deputation to his seat in Lanarkshire , to examine and report on his famous improvements in the art of transplanting trees . Sir Walter was one of the Committee appointed for this business , and he took a lively interest in it , as witness the Essay on Landscape Gardening , which , whatever may he the fate of Sir Henry Stewart 's own writings , will transmit his name to posterity . Scott made several Allantcmian experiments at Abbotsford , but found reason , in the sequel , to abate something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , comes to pounds , shillings , and pence and , whether Sir Henry 's accounts had or had not been accurately kept , the thing turned out greatly more expensive on Tweedside , than he had found it represented in Cly desdale. " // botanist , that autumnal planting is better adapted to the climate of Great Britain than to our own , inasmuch as our long and rigorous winter may often destroy the smaller roots of newly-planted trees , before they have fairly established themselves in the soil . It is to be wished , however , that the practice should have a thorough trial ; for cultivators are so severely tasked to keep pace in their operations with the rapid progress of vegetation in our rapid spring , that much would be gained by the transfer of so important a branch of husbandry to a period of more leisure . We pass over those parts of our author 's Introduction which relate to propagation , pruning , grafting , and inoculation . These operations are described with great brevity and precision , and in truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation and experience than from the perusal of any description whatever . The tenth section treats of the artificial means by which the fruitfulness of trees may be increased . Most of these , such as dwarfing by ingrafting on a tree of smaller growth , - by inserting , for instance , the scion of the pear on a quince stock , - training more or less horizontally , &amp;c. , are well understood in this country . They are , however , seldom practised ; and , with a very few exceptions , our fruits are the growth of standard trees . We are rather surprised to find the practice of debarking , or stripping the whole tree of its outer bark , down to the liber , recommended as one of these expedients . A tree might possibly be rendered more fruitful for a single season , but we apprehend , that in our climate , at least , the loss of its health , if not of its life , would soon and inevitably follow . A single winter of the Northern and Middle States , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger part of its natural covering . Of this we have striking evidence in the effect of the early winter of 1831-2 , a season which will long be remembered by gardeners in this vicinity . Thousands of young fruit trees were destroyed by the sudden setting in of cold weather , while older trees , of exactly the same description , were protected by their thick bark , as by a coat of mail . The concluding section of our author 's preliminary chapter treats of noxious Insects . Any treatise on agriculture would be indeed incomplete , which should omit all mention of this great branch of the animal kingdom . It has been // supposed by one of the first entomologists in our coun* try , that the bodies of all the insect tribe , if collected together , would form a larger mass than those of all other tribes of animals united . Those numerous species which derive their food frain the vegetable creation , have long been the most dreaded enemies of the farmer and gardener . It is a general maxim , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works both of nature and of man , are effected by the joint agency of numerous individuals , each of whom separately would be utterly unworthy of serious notice . To no topic can this remark be applied with more force , than to that now before us . Separately contemplated , nothing can be more contemptible than the insects which prey on our fields or our gardens ; but their immense swarms render their ravages often as resistless and as destructive , as those of the lightning or the tornado . Human skill and strength can avail little against enemies , which escape our notice by their minuteness , elude our grasp by their agility , or defy our power by their countless numbers . The following remarks , of the late Dr. Dwight , will recommend themselves to our readers by their good sense , as well as their piety . " Nothing can more strongly exhibit the dependence or the littleness of man , than the destruction of his valuable interests by such minute , helpless beings . The animals , which from our infancy we regard with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert , the serpent , the catamount , the tiger , and the lion ; but these mercifully on the part of Heaven are few in number , solitary in their life , and unfrequent invaders of human happiness ,  --  sources rather of solemn amusement and fireside aifright , than of rational or even real anxiety . The great army which God sent upon the Jews , beftre which the land was as the garden of Eden and behind as a desolate wilderness , on account of which an alarm was sounded , afast sanct'jfled , and a solemn assembly proclaimed , was levied from the tribes of the cankerworm , the caterpillar , the palmer-worm , and the locust . These , and their compeers , have been in all ages the army of God , which has humbled the pride , frustrated the designs , and destroyed the hopes of man . " - Travels in ZV'ew England , Vol. iii . p. 301 . Scarcely any fruit tree is so fortunate as to be liable to the attacks of only one species of insect ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in their destructive work in every garden , would occupy several pages . There are three descriptions , however , whose ravages are far more // extensive and COnSpiCUOUS in New England orchards and fruit gardens , than those of any of their fellows , viz , the several species of borers , the cankerworm , and the caterpillar . A complete and convenient remedy against the first two is yet a desideratum . The borers it is true , both of the apple and the peach trees ( for they are two very different insects ) , may be kept from their respective favorites , by a collar of any hard substance placed around the tree , just at the surface of the ground , the point at which both these assailants make their first inroads . The cankerworm , also , may be checked effectually by the process of tarring . But the application of these remedies is extremely inconvenient and troublesome , and requires a degree of attention and vigilance , which few are willing to exert . The caterpillar is completely within the control of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is owing to the gregarious habits of these insects , who retire together at night to their nests , and do not leave them till the morning is far advanced . Hence they may be easily destroyed in their encampments and , if the process is repeated at short intervals , the tree may be thoroughly cleared . The brief sketch here given of our author 's Introduction , will , we hope , serve to recommend his work to such of our readers as feel interested in its subject , and these , we trust , form a large and increasing class . There are few changes which we contemplate with more satisfaction , than the increased interest in the progress of agriculture , recently displayed by the people , as well as the rulers , of this and the neighbouring States . It is not now our purpose to speak of field cultivation , in other words of agriculture , strictly so called , though certainly nothing is more desirable , than that its immense importance should be duly estimated by men of all vocations . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same relation to its substantial kindred art , which the graceful capital hears to the massy shaft , this , however pleasing to its true votaries , was till lately pursued by comparatively a very snmll number , and altogether neglected and disregarded by the community generally . A few years since , for instance , it was scarcely possible to procure the more delicate fruits , at any price , while thousands were every year expended on luxuries of a more doubtful character . Delicate fruits are now rapidly multiplying in our cities and // their environs ; and those , who distinguish themselves in the rearing of them , may hope for a large reward , not only in profit hut in reputation . Few , indeed , can render greater services to the civilized world , than it has derived from the labors of skilful and discriminating cultivators of these exquisite productions . If he who makes two spires of grass grow where one grew before , is a public benefactor , what shall we say of him , who introduces or who disseminates a new variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salutary pleasures not only of his contemporaries , but of nations yet unborn . The gratification , thus ministered to each individual singly , may be deemed trifling ; but , when we consider the number so gratified , how immense is the aggregate of human enjoyment . How long and how gratefully must such a gift be remembered . Of what moment to us , are the undaunted valor , and consummate generalship , displayed by Lucullus in his victories over Mithridates ? They served only to bring one more gallant monarch into subjection to the haughty and gigantic power , whose iron sceptre has long since been shattered ,  --  to add one more jewel to the diadem , which has been for ages trampled in the dust . But the taste arid assiduity of the Roman general in naturalizing the cherry tree to the climate of Europe , have entitled him to the grateful commemoration of sixty generations . The empire , which France labored to establish on this continent , has long since passed away . The chain of fortresses which she erected on our northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a cost , is rapidly vanishing from the soil . Her very language is fast departing from those regions , before the silent and peaceful progress of our institutions . But the orchards of magnificent and venerable pear trees , planted by French settlers on the banks of the beautiful Detroit River , yet remain , a noble monument to the honor of the parent country of modern horticulture . How few can hope for a reputation so extensive , so enduring , and so enviable , as that which will be awarded , both in his country and ours , to Thomas Andrew Knight . How long and how highly shall we honor the memory of this high-minded Englishman , as the disinterested and unwearied benefactor of our infant horticulture ? How nobly has he exemplified the great truths , that the firmest loyalty to our own country is compatible with the utmost liberality towards others , and that , when the // culture of the soil is in question , our views should know no other bounds than those of the great family of man . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those among us , who will emulate his truly honorable , though peaceful , achievements . We speak from high authority , when we say , that the friends of horticulture in Europe are turning their eyes anxiously to this country . They are looking to our bright skies and fresh soil , for new varieties of delicious fruits , to supply the place of those , which , after centuries of existence , seem at last to be yielding to the lot of all earthly productions . Hopes so just and reasonable are surely not destined to return void . To some of our readers , the importance which we attach to our subject may seem exaggerated , if not ridiculous . Such may reniark , that horticulture can form the chief business of life with very few ; that generally it deserves no other name than that of an amusement ; that , even in this point of view , it is better adapted to a country abounding in men of wealth and leisure , than to an economical and industrious community like ours ; and that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves to excite a deep and general interest . Objections like these , however , have been frequently made among us to every secular object of pursuit , except those two leading objects of effort and ambition , wealth and political distinction . We would not refer either to the one or the other of these , with any cynical asperity . The pursuit of property has often been spoken of , by the mere votaries of literature , in a style which is any thing but creditable to their own good sense and candor . The honest enterprise of large classes who are busily engaged in providing for the reasonable comfort of their families , or in accumulating money not for its own sake , but for the sake of what may be procured and imparted by its liberal use , has been stigmatized by the name of avarice ; and the unwearied industry and judicious frugality , which form the solid foundation of so many splendid virtues , and by which New England now is , and we trust ever will be distinguished , have been more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be recollected , that the most active business is not without many intervals of leisure , and that the pursuit of property occupies the whole time of no individual , certainly of no large number of individuals . " Generally speaking , " says one of // the most elegant writers of the present age , " our occupations leave us time enough , if our passions would but spare us . " Nor is it certain that property , or indeed any other great object , is pursued with most success by those who allow themselves least time for repose or recreation . A pursuit , which is absolutely exclusive and unremitted , is very apt to become a feverish one ; and he who pauses occasionally from his labors may gain more in cool reflection than he loses in actual effort . The late Stephen Girard certainly met with a degree of success in his regular vocation , which should satisfy the wishes of any reasonable aspirant ; and yet it is well known , that much of his time was devoted to the cultivation of a country-seat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation with the same zeal and exactness , which rendered him so conspicuous in the commercial world A very small portion of the surplus capital , and leisure time , of the most active men of husiness in any of our large towns , might place its neighbourhood , to a wide extent , in a state of high cultivation , scarcely paralleled in the most beautiful districts of England or Belgium . It is only the taste and spirit , which are requisite ; and any means , hy which these can be enkindled or diffused , must he highly valued by every true patriot . What we have said of the pursuit of weahh , admits of a like application in regard to that of political distinction . That in a country like ours a passion for such distinction should he often indulged to a high degree , is perhaps unavoidable , and those who are under its control , certainly earn their reward . We should be the last to speak slightly of honors of any description , which are fairly earned and gracefully xvorn . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can be well carried on only by the application of a large portion of the talent and character of the community ; and we are aware also , that something of the time and thoughts of every good citizen must be given to the watchful inspection of the conduct of his representatives . We entertain little respect for those , who feel or affect an utter indifference in relation to all political transactions , but who generally are the first to lose their equanimity when the bad consequences of public measures press severely on their own interests ; and , much as we deprecate political bitterness , we // deem it more respectable , as well as less perilous , than political apathy . But it is certainly far from desirable , that the active and aspiring spirits of the country should consider political life as the only sphere of public usefulness , and the only passage to honorable distinction , or that political events should constitute ( as they have done in former times ) the allabsorbing topic of social conversation . It will be perceived , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal towns and their environs . It is to be expected , that horticulture should advance more rapidly to a high state of excellence in districts where the , large markets render it a profitable pursuit to the mere gardener , while the amateur is more effectually inspirited by the sympathy and example of a dense neighbourhood . We trust , however , that its progress will not long be limited to such narrow bounds . Among the farmers , constituting in this country , as in all others of large extent , the great majority of the population , this art is , we believe , already emerging from its neglected condition . Considered as a mere amusement its claims are of no slight moment ; for how often has it been remarked , that the amusements of a community , as they strikingly indicate , so are they most important in determining , the national character . Many of the rougher sports of the rural population of other days are now becoming obsolete ; and what employment is better fitted to supply their places , whether we regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothing and purifying influence have been the theme of praises too trite , as well as too generally admitted , to need repetition . There is an especial reason which should lead us to desire the general extension , throughout the community , of the culture of gardens , and more especially of fruit gardens ; we mean its effects on the progress of Temperance . To all tha strenuous efforts now making for the promotion of this great moral object , we need not say how cordially we bid " God speed . " But it is a cause in which no fair auxiliary should be rejected , and few will be found more effectual than choice fruits . A fondness for these and for the fiery products of distillation can not long exist together in the same individual ; and , with a fair opportunity , the contest between them can not well be a doubtful one . It has been said , that the use of a single fruit , we mean the coffee berry , has served more voL. xLvii. - No. ci . 57 // effectually to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes united , previous to the formation of Temperance Societies . Our remarks have been limited , almost exclusively , to that more substantial branch of horticulture , which forms the main topic of Mr. Kenrick 's work , the rearing of fruit trees . The still more elegant and delicate pursuit , that in which the poetry of gardening , so to speak , chiefly consists , we mean the cultivation of Flowers , is a topic deserving to he considered at far greater length than we could allow to it on the present occasion . We shall therefore close our remarks by some general suggestions in relation to the means of rendering horticulture , in all its branches , a more common and favorite pursuit . One of the most effectual of these means is certainly , as we have already intimated , the publication of judicious elementary treatises . It can not be expected , however , that such productions should become at once very numerous , or that they should always be composed in the manner best calculated to effect their object . Books of this character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , those who practise gardening as a regular business , and those who speculate upon it as theorists . The practical gardener may want the power of communicating his knowledge in a popular style ; and the mere amateur is still more likely to be deficient , in that acquaintance with facts , which are necessary to render his elegant essays of direct , practical value . In other words , works of the one class will generally be made up of dry instructions , and those of the other will possess scarcely any thing of an instructive character . The truth is , an extensive knowledge of gardening is in this country rarely found in any one except a professed gardener , because the study of the general principles of agriculture and horticulture is nowhere made a part of our early education . Scarcely any other art of high practical importance is thus neglected . It is well known , that all systems of instruction in the United States are of a general and superficial character , resembling more those of Scotland than of any other foreign country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of important branches of knowledge , instead of being thoroughly instructed in a small number . It would be an interesting task to trace the causes , as well as the consequences , of this marked peculiarity ; but this // would be foreign to our purpose , and we presume that the fact is unquestioned . We accordingly find the elements of almost every important art incorporated in the text-books of our principal seminaries . It would be deemed a very insufficient reason for passing over such topics , that , in most cases , they will have no immediate and constant connexion with the regular business of the pupil in after life . Hundreds of students are every year compelled , for instance , to study the first principles of architecture or navigation , although nine tenths of the number never advance any further in the practice of those arts , than to drive a nail , or steer a pleasureboat . While it is admitted as a general principle , that no one can be a proficient in any thing but his peculiar business , it is deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discredit , in any one claiming tbe name of a well-informed man , to be utterly ignorant in relation to any subject of high moment to the welfare of the community . Now , although the paramount importance of agricultural pursuits over all others is unquestioned , we suspect there is scarcely a school or college in the country , where a single hour is devoted to the elucidation of their leading principles ; and we doubt not , that many have finished their academical course , able , perhaps , to repeat whole volumes of metaphysics in the words of the author , while they have not merely acquired no knowledge , but have formed no conception , of those familiar operations of the farmer and gardener , to which they are indebted for their daily food . Surely some few days of the ten years of pupilage through which so many of our youth pass , might be profitably given to subjects so interesting , as well as so important , as these.                 @ @ @ @
