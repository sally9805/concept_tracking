TO SIR HENRY FETHERSTONHAUGH , BART . ETC . ETC . ETC . OF UP-PARK , SUSSEX , ENGLAND . Could I dare to anticipate a favourable reception for this Tragedy , I should indeed be proud of dedicating it to you . I do so now with the less reluctance ; conscious , that although , in your refined taste , I submit myself to a judgment about which I can not but be anxious , yet that I may securely look to find in you an indulgent critic . Whatever may be the decision , upon  --  I believe  --  this first attempt to raise a name , not altogether unknown in the English annals , into literary notice ; I feel assured that you will receive this dedication as a proof of the unfeigned personal attachment of , My dear Sir Harry , your faithful G. W. FEATHERSTONHAUGH . HISTORICAL NOTICE . The Pisans conquered Sardinia from the Moors , and divided its provinces amongst their chiefs , the Gherardesca , Sardi , Caietani , Sismondi , Visconti , &c.; These families adopted the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innocent III . acquired great influence in Sardinia ; gave the heiress of Gallura in marriage to one of his relations , and demanded of the Pisans to renounce the government of the island . The Visconti resisted the papal usurpation with firmness , and made war on those who consented to hold of the pope . Subsequently , Ubaldo , one of the most powerful of the Visconti , was gained over . He consented to hold of the pope , on receiving the hand of Adelaide , heiress of Gallura ; and abjured his allegiance to Pisa . This defection occasioned great divisions . The partizans of the empire rallied under the Gherardesca , rivals to the Visconti ; and the two factions , under the names of Conti and Visconti , made war upon each other . Thus the imperial or Ghibelline party at Pisa was called Conti , and the papal or Guelph party , Visconti . About 1274 , count Ugolino , chief of the Gherardesca , whose horrible death has for ever stained the annals of Pisa , married his sister to Giovanni di Gallura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ghibellines , who prevailed in Pisa at this time , began to look upon Ugolino , who was ambitious , with suspicion . They exiled Gallura ; who , with the assistance of the Guelphs of Florence , made war upon Pisa . Ugolino himself was arrested in 1275 , and exiled . He then openly joined the Guelph party , and defeated the Ghibellines ; upon which he was recalled from his exile . At this period , Ruggieri de Ubaldini , an inflexible man , and a firm Ghibelline , was made archbishop of Pisa . In 1284 , war then existing between Genoa and Pisa , a great naval combat was fought between them off the small island of Meloria , near the territory of Pisa . The Pisans were signally routed . Five thousand Pisans were killed , and eleven thousand made prisoners . This calamitous event carried desolation into every Pisan family . The chronicles of the time speak of the public and private distress as most intense . The resources of the Pisans were ruined , and their spirit almost entirely broken . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this free Ghibelline state . The Genoese also determined to keep in perpetual imprisonment the Pisans who had fallen into their power , and who composed the most gallant part of the Pisan population . The people now determined to place count Ugolino at the head of their republic , with unlimited powers for the defence and government of the country . To forward his ambitious views , he ceded many important territories to the neighbouring states ; and fearing lest the prisoners in Genoa should oppose his rule , he found means to evade their proposed ransom . By his rigour , he at length became odious to both parties ; he exiled the principal Ghibellines , and pulled down the palaces of those connected with them . He at length declared himself lord of Pisa . His nephew , Nino di Gallura , now the most prominent chief of the Guelph party , detached himself from the interests of his uncle , and drew near to Gualandi and Sismondi , chiefs of the Ghibellines . To counteract this defection , Ugolino connected himself with Ruggieri , the archbishop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gualandi , Sismondi , Lanfranchi , &c.; The count being thus strengthened , his nephew , Nino di Gallura , and his party , withdrew from the city . The city being thus purged of his opponents in the Guelph faction , he refused to admit the archbishop into the administration of the government , and a rancorous hatred grew up between them . In a fit of passion he slew a nephew of the archbishop , and foreseeing an open rupture with the Ghibellines , he took measures to recall the Guelphs . Upon which the alarm was given ; the Ghibellines attacked Ugolino , who , after some resistance , shut himself up with his four sons and a few partizans , in the palace of the people . The palace was set on fire , and they were made prisoners . After keeping them in the Gualandi tower for some months , the archbishop caused the gate to be barred up , and the key to be thrown into the Arno . He and his children were mercilessly starved to death : a punishment far beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much pity for Ugolino and his sons , as it has produced detestation for the infamous archbishop . This Tragedy , the scene of which is in Pisa in Italy , is founded upon the historical facts thus briefly adverted to , and from which the author has only in one instance deviated . Nino and Anselmuccio are said , in some of the old chronicles , to have been the count 's grandsons . Italian scholars will perceive how much the author is indebted to Dante . Many years ago , the author translated the whole of the Divina Commedia into blank verse , upon a suggestion in the Edinburgh Review . He was preparing it for the press , when the able and faithful translation of Mr Carey appeared . The work was then laid by , with other rejectamenta . Amongst some papers unexpectedly preserved from a painful catastrophe , a selection of translated passages from Dante 's great poem was sound . The terrible images with which the thirty-third canto of the Inferno is pregnant , led the author gradually into the idea of raising a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the which he might preserve some favourite passages , the only memorial to the author of his former labours . They will be easily recognized by those who are familiar with the Divina Commedia . Having made this acknowledgement , he will be extremely flattered if every passage in this tragedy which may have the good fortune to please , should be attributed to the same source . The author was aware that in the construction of a tragedy fitted for representation , dramatic action required that every part should be preparatory and be auxiliary to the tragic interest to be excited by the horrible deaths of Ugolino and his children . In the progress of the work he found this a difficult task . The story is old , and too familiar to leave any field open for suspense as to the fate of the principal personage . The tragic interest therefore rested in the manner of their deaths , and it was to this point , which could only be brought forward towards the denouement , that the author 's mind was principally directed . " Per quel che @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mia su erudo , Udirai . " These are the pathetic words of Ugolino in the thirty third canto , when he is about to relate to Dante and Virgil what no one could know  --  " how bitter was his death . " But neither could these sad scenes be renewed through a whole drama , without weakening  --  in the author 's opinion  --  the effect intended to be produced . The Buffo part therefore , for which he holds himself entirely responsible , was thrown in ; somewhat with a view to soften the character of a work raised upon so dreadful a catastrophe , and because the author believes those who are conversant with the Tuscan manners of that period , will find nothing extravagant in Buffalmacco or Pippo , or in any thing they say . The game of Moro , Footnote : 1Kb which Pippo was playing with Tonetto , under Orgagna 's Picture of the Day of Judgment , in the public cemetery , when he hears of the death of his father , is well known to those who are conversant with Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalmacco and Pippo . Liston and Keeley would make any body understand them . It would be as tedious a task to make some people comprehend what these two unrivalled performers are capable of doing , as what Buffalmacco was capable of saying . If the author should be accused of vulgarity , he begs with deference to say , that Italian nature has always abounded in subjects for Teniers , as well as for Raphael ; and that he who immortalized Juliet , painted Mrs Tearsheet . The author believes that this tragedy , as he now commits it to the press , will be pronounced by many fitter for the closet than the stage  --  and perhaps by some , not fit for either . Indeed he dares only to anticipate one admissible motive for its publication , namely , that it will gratify his friends and himself . DRAMATIS PERSON . Count Ugolino , Former Lord of Pisa .

Enter Anselmo and Bartoli . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Good Signor Bartoli , the morning air Brings you out early , sir ; for by the sun The council hour is still far off , nor aught Of councillors , or preparation , yet Have I , who by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Archbishop 's seen . BARTOLI . BARTOLI Honest Anselmo , this same matin air That breathes so sweet  --  grateful it is to me As unto thee , old soldier , who hast drank I ' the open fields , amidst unsettled camps , More of the purer streams of life , than we , Poor fearful citizens , in crowded streets Are wont . Hence come your fresher spirits , hence The frank and fearless tempers , and the thoughts That lack the seeming earnest which oft clothes The specious utterings of us men of the world . But , as thou art honest , it were not well To use with thee a dubious speech in aught . And though the morning air doth breathe of peace , And health , and universal gladness springs From nature 's face , and all fair living things Seem to make holiday with her ; yet I , Signor Anselmo , by my troth came forth Not to enjoy this bounteous goodly scene , But to commune within myself ; and hold A sober converse with some serious thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I at this same council board assist . ANSELMO . ANSELMO To be called honest is not ill , and then To be found honest is not ill , but well . Well hast thou spoken , Count , in truth most like Unto a city noble . By the mass , You do begin this goodly day right well , And speak me fair , not in a dubious speech . You call me honest , Eh ! Have you been pleased To think me knave enough to wish to wear A cloak upon my name ? Honest Anselmo Is not my name . My name ' s Anselmo , sir . Pray call those good pains taking people so , Who wish the credulous world to think them such . You are early out man-catching ! You talk Like an archbishop , or a councillor , When at the reverend councilboard we sit . " Sweet sir , the plan you have conceived is fit And just , and suited to the state and times . " Marry and then . " But yet I shall propose One which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public good requires that it " ... San Ranieri , Loud . Had I command in Pisa , I 'd root out ... BARTOLI . BARTOLI Nay , prithee , Captain , hush , we are observed ! ANSELMO . ANSELMO Observed ! Ay , there it is again  --  observed ! Let him who doth observe , observe this well , His hand to his sword . Which doth observe small manners with a spy . Signor , your lime twigs are too weak for me . Yet ' t is worth remembering  --  When two rogues meet , T is well that one turns out an hones man . Exit . Enter Monzano . BARTOLI . BARTOLI Good morning , friend Monzano , would thou'dst been A little earlier i ' the square : for here I met Anselmo , and in good earnest Set me on to sound him for our purpose . I spoke him fair , said he was honest too , And was about to open our grave thought , When with sarcastic grin he turned my words Abruptly back upon me ; then brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council board ; got in a choleric rage , And brusqued away e'en as we saw thee come . MONZANO . MONZANO I did perceive him somewhat moved , and feared Lest thou perchance had'st broke our purpose , and That he 'd a mind to mar it . Glad I am To find all right . Anselmo 's humour 's blunt And quick , and , like his sword , flies out at times Without a second bidding , at his friends . But there 's no malice in his angry moods , And his hot temper spends itself at once . Oft have I observed him at the council , On our late urgencies of state , which spring Alas ! too frequent . Would it were not so ! Anselmo 's counsel has been ever wise , Touching our honour and our safety too . And , but he ' s somewhat bolder than the times , Staking too much , as soldiers wont , at once  --  Somewhat too open too to speak his mind ; I know no man in Pisa I would trust , Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noble Monzano , I have ever thought Anselmo true and loyal . Times like these , To men who love their country , urge the more That honest faults to us should be obscured , To let the noble qualities shine forth . Our country needs their aid now most of all . He turns this way . Let 's greet him as true friends , And throw off all reserve . Enter Anselmo . MONZANO . MONZANO Give ye good morn , Noble Anselmo . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Signor Monzano , I am yours ; and , Signor , to you again . I 've walked to the other end of the square , Because the Signor said we were observed , For fain I 'd see who t'was observed me here . By all the ... BARTOLI . BARTOLI Captain Anselmo ; but anon You parted from me not so graciously . Anselmo shows impatience . Nay , I entreat you , hear . What time have I Not shown myself your friend , what time betrayed My country or my friends , that you should turn The courteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what I scorn ; An empty promiser , a flattering tongue , That would begin the day with treachery , And dupe the man I honour ? Sir , you know How high you 've ever stood in my esteem . This honourable Signor and myself Have matters of deep import to the state On hand , yet such as may not well be known To all in Pisa : for it is too true , That all are neither honourable nor firm Nor true nor love their country , as I fear . And , for we value your known worth , I sought , On meeting you this morn here i ' the square , To put the opportunity to use  --  Imparting to ye our most serious thought , And gravest purpose ; which will bear the ken Of honourable men , and such you are . All men , Signor , are not alike well skilled In war , and brave i ' the field . But Pisa still Has honourable men at home , who fain Would risk what ' s left of liberty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land From foreign and domestic foes . Such men , This honourable Signor and myself Dare call ourselves . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Signor , it is most true That conscience is good company , and she Assures you now . Armed with integrity , We are boldly frank . Where the heart prompts the tongue , It doth , like to a master key , unlock Our breasts , to let in honest confidence . And so it is that ye have opened mine , With your most fair and undissembled speech , Which likes me well . And for your purpose , sirs , To help our state by honourable means , That must be mine  --  and I dare offer ye , For that and for yourselves , true hand and sword : Shake hands . Entreating you at times to overlook The wayward temper of an unbred man , Unskilled in courtesies and gentle arts . MONZANO . MONZANO Captain , we 're bound t'ye ; and let the bond That ties our mutual faith , from this same hour , Be confidence most unreserved . ANSELMO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie up Into one heart and mind , three loyal friends . And , gentle sirs , most heartily I 'm yours . Since my return from camps , and when it pleased Ye all to call me to your council board  --  ' T has been , sirs , a fool 's paradise to me . To serve my country , I have ever thought With true intent of counsel and of deeds , And have not spared to speak my mind where'er The occasion called , trusting it was the end And meaning of my office . In like guise In the fair shew and speech I did believe Of the rest o ' the council , taking them all As true and loyal men , who love the land . Which as we all profess , and more , to keep It well in honour and in safety too  --  I 've sometimes marvelled , that amidst this care For the state 's weal , which seems to govern all ; That when an honest plan ' s proposed , and fit By common voice of all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marred . Wherefore it is I know not . Yet I see Our country 's cause grow every day the worse , And none to mend it , as it doth appear . Sometimes I 've thought that all were not sincere , Yet knew not whom the thought might justly reach . Thus a concealed distrust clouds o'er the mind ; Marring the intent of every honest thought , And locking up our cold and sullen breasts , Which fair and shining mirrors well might be Of brother 's love , faith , and the state 's honour . Shuts out that generous confidence , which wins The noble objects , sirs , at which ye aim . Now , since ye have chosen me for your poor friend , Let us not pause  --  unveil your purposed thought  --  And let us haste to sanctify this bond Of honourable friendship , by some deed Of fair advantage to our native land . MONZANO . MONZANO Noble Anselmo , well have ye expressed A patriot soldier 's mind , and well portrayed What many feel , yet few have cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye have said  --  prudence sometimes requires That doubts grow ripe into realities , Ay , and have friends , to back ' em too , if they Perchance observe the heads themselves of the state . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Gentles , please ye , no parables to me  --  But out with it at once . Is't Gualandi , Or Lanfranchi ,  --  or whom else o ' the council ? BARTOLI . BARTOLI What think ye of the Archbishop Ruggieri ? ANSELMO . ANSELMO Your doubts are high ones , sir , and by the mass . The Archbishop Ruggieri is a man , Clothed with the nobleness of mind , as well As holiness , which suit his present state ; And , as I think , hath borne him ever well ; I ' the people 's favour ; never having changed With all the shiftings of the varying wind , That blows the rest about ; but kept him firm , Being a true Ghibelline , and most opposed To the head o ' the Guelphs , the pope himself , Who is the head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might the rather look for state , Were he ambitious , as ye seem to doubt . And thus I 've ever thought of him ; else , sirs , This arm had ne'er bestirred itself that day , When Ugolino , that false tyrant lord , We shook from his usurped signiory , And gave our native land again to breathe The air of freedom . Signors , well ye know What part the Archbishop played on that stern day BARTOLI . BARTOLI Ay , sir , and we were Ghibellines in that turn Of Ruggieri 's state , and were his friends : And , for we thought his purpose was to serve The people 's liberty , by rooting out The Count 's acknowledged tyranny , we lent Ourselves unto the crafty thought that rose In the Archbishop 's fertile mind ; which was To sow some discord ' mongst the powerful Guelphs . Thus of the Judge Gallura having gained The ear , and being by him incited on To seize the signiory by his uncle held : He , the Archbishop , when the Guelphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge His nephew , having risen with their friends , To oppose each other , openly at arms ; Did join the Count , and with him , all the rest Of the Ghibelline strength , and thus expelled The Judge Gallura and his numerous friends . And having thus sent off the flower of the Guelphs , A sudden insurrection , moved by him , Anon breaks out of the people . Loud cries Of tyranny and freedom  --  Ugolino , And the Archbishop  --  in the streets are heard . Thus craftily the Ghibellines being roused , Attack the Count , who being surprised , yet doth Breast him most valiantly against them all . And with some scattering friends , and their bold swords , Win a fair passage to the palace straight . Whence he 's at length unkennelled , but by fire ; Cast prisoner with his sons in shameful bonds Into Gualandi 's Tower , where still they lie . Thus by his priestly art the Archbishop reached His present state . ANSELMO . ANSELMO I do confess his craft Did serve the occasion well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been master here . Yet craft doth not wear well , and may not e'er Become a holy person  --  least of all A mitred head . Yet I confess ' t is true , If I were wanting me some subtle turn , Some triple fine spun thought , to overreach Mine enemy ; it were a grievous wrong To do myself , did I not find a priest To hatch it for me . BARTOLI . BARTOLI Nor hath it worn , sir , Well with us . This general discontent Amongst the common class , and these your doubts , Are fruits , that now are dropping from the tree , Transplanted not too honestly by us To our fair soil  --  which spreading out its boughs , Loaded with all the honours of the state , Draws to itself all that is rich beneath , And monarchs it o'er an exhausted land . ' T is true we have a council  --  but what then  --  When has the council ever acted here ? The council are the Archbishop and his friends . We are nought ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contributions , taxes , all The rich resources of the state , drawn forth By no unskilful hands , i ' the people 's name , And for their urgent welfare as we 're told . Why what becomes of them ? The Archibishop , sir , And his true friends are the people , and ' t is just They keep them all . Yet ' t is in freedom 's name , And to sustain its holy cause , ' t is said That it must e'en be so . What ! is freedom Then not liberty  --  liberty to speak And act , within the reverence of the laws ? And where is liberty , if honest men Must here in Pisa huddle up , to talk In corners of their tyrant lords ? But no , Freedom is but a name  --  In them alone , All that is worthy of the public care Is found , and we the people are but tools , To shape the power and riches of the state Unto their liking . Above all should this , Captain Anselmo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wretched fate of those Who on that day , above all other days Pregnant with misery to our native land , Fought with ye at Meloria . Sir , four years Have passed , since there the Pisan power was shook ; And to this day , ten thousand of the best Of our brave citizens , with the purest blood That Pisa boasts , have unredeemed lain I ' the dungeons of our foes the Genoese . This cries aloud for shame , and seals our name For ever in the annals of the world . And wherefore this reproach ? It was once charged , That Ugolino sought to keep them there , Lest they ' twixt him and his ambitious views Might stand i ' the track . Yet I remember well , It was Ruggieri and his friends charged this , And well they might be fathers to the thought , Who since have nursed it up so well , that though The Count himself hath lain eight months in chains , Still do our matrons mourn their absent lords . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It never rains suspicions but it pours . Now in this of the enlargement of our friends , The Archbishop hath seemed ever prompt : and well Ye wot , that when I moved the council board To give up Castro , Pisa 's pride and strength In our Sardinia , to the Genoese , To ransom them ; he did enforce my words With fair and cogent arguments , by which The council did resolve the affair at once , And sent ambassadors to the Genoese ; Of which great charge now Pisa waits the event . BARTOLI . BARTOLI ' Twill wait in vain . Your plan was favoured , sir , To gain him credit with the people here , ' Mongst fathers , brothers , children , wives ; and then A chance to mar it , having the conduct Of the treaty in his hands . Nay , start not , Captain , I speak no parables to ye . We have , and under the Archbishop 's hand , Letters o ' the very date the council sat , To some o ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , And boldly charging us of the council here , With secret plans t ' o'erreach the Genoese ; And once the enlargement of our friends procured , To cheat them of the promised ransom , sir . These letters by a noble Genoese Were to Count Guido Montefeltro sent , And reached us but last night , by a special friend Of Montefeltro 's . Read  --  assure yourself . Shows a Letter . ANSELMO ANSELMO reads . Why this , fair sirs , is treason , as I live , ' Gainst honour , and ' gainst all that 's good in man . I said I 'd been in a fool 's paradise , Feeling that all was not quite right , and still Yet seeing not wherein ' t was wrong . Why , sirs , This must be met forthwith . We tread on mines That may explode , and blow us in the air . What have ye purposed ? How would ye reward This priestly perfidy ? MONZANO . MONZANO The hour 's arrived Of the council . Yonder Lanfranchi comes , With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how earnestly we 're moved . Soon as the council 's raised , we 'll shape this thing Unto some form . Let 's put on ease , and move To the palace straight . ANSELMO . ANSELMO ' T is hard , I swear , to move Straight , sirs , in such a crooked world as this . Exeunt . SCENE II . A Chamber in the Palace . Enter the Archbishop . Archbishop . RUGGIERI If then the reasons secretly I 've urged , To those of the signiory of Genoa , Should fail me : and their rank pride to lord it In our Sardinian castles , well may move That haughty state . Besides the expensive task , To feed and furnish , and without time fixed , Ten thousand captives , has already caused Some public discontent . Why if they fail , Others more trusty must be found ; and best It would have been , had they been urged at first Fair words and promises make men look round  --  Gold makes them stop . T is gold makes men deal quick  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And gold in Genoa must do this for me . It were a goodly policy in truth , To bring ten thousand Guelphs back to their home , To take the rule of the state , and turn me out Of mine . It were a better game I ween , To make our Guelphs at home give up their gold To keep their friends abroad , where they best are . I marvel that Gualandi hath not been , To tell how Ugolino hath received The offered boon of liberty for gold . His treasures are untouched : but ere he thinks To see the comfortable face of day , They must be ransacked . Ay , and then indeed , Perhaps they may not purchase it for him  --  He is an apostate , and mine enemy . Enter Gualandi . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Signor Gualandi , I have looked for ye . GUALANDI . GUALANDI I thought to have seen ye , sir , at least an hour Before the council met ; but unawares A matter of some interest has engaged The time ; fitting , haply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARCHBISHOP .

GUALANDI At my accustomed hour to sally forth , Pontani , Bargello o ' the Lucchese gate , Came in some haste ; and , being somewhat chased , Reported , that two hours before the dawn , He , being with his sbirri on the watch , Going the rounds of the eastern rampart , Perceived , creeping along the wall , a man . Who , challenged , leaped sudden on the rampart , And began to fly : but , as it would seem , Being entangled in his cloak , he fell . Whereat the guard came up , and went to lay Their hands on him ; but with a voice and port That did not well companion his attire , He bade them all stand off ; then sprang to the wall , Which shouldering him , he in defiance drew , Refusing to surrender ; and the guard Thinking to urge him gently , having odds In their favour , go to seize him . But he , I pray you , thinking too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , With four men more , as they entreated him  --  And fled into the city ; where ' till now , We 've sought in vain to find him . Being late , I left them seeking , and to the palace came . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI It is some brawler , on some vile amour . GUALANDI . GUALANDI Lovers , my lord , on their return from brawls , Are not much apt to scale and leap such walls As ours . And least at the return of day , When they might issue free and unobserved . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Why that is true : they who scale walls , and then At such an hour , perilling too their lives With such a resolute shew , fain must have Grave reasons to avoid being seen or known . Sir , the Bargello must repair his fault , And straight unkennel him . It may well be Some spy , or secret traitor , practising To overturn the state .

You said his voice and port , an I mistake not , Betokened something noble ? GUALANDI .

RUGGIERI Then there ' s disguise to boot . I pray you , sir , Hasten to have this matter brought to a head . It grows upon my mind . He must be found , This bold nocturnal , who thus braves our walls And guards . Let them be vigilant , and bring Him to the palace . We 've means in Pisa To bend such haughty spirits . Torture shall , If gentleness may not , reveal his purpose . One moment , ere you go . What said your charge Last night  --  Ugolino  --  did you sound him ? GUALANDI . GUALANDI My lord , I did ; but like a sullen rock Deep in the changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , More than the turbulent lashings of the storm . I spoke him gently , did entreat him fair , Repeated o'er again your proffered boon . Yet not a word did he vouchsafe me speak , And save but when I spoke of liberty , A look . Yet then he turned , and gathering up All of contempt that in his face could beam , He flung it in that look . Thus I left him . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI There must a way be found to move him , and It shall be found . This night , Gualandi , I Will accompany ye unto the tower . I had not wished to cross him in my life Again . I love him not , nor wish to see His face . But he shall bend , proud as he is , And shall give up that which I want . Else  --  else  --  I 'll see if he is proof against ...

I were a fool To let them cheat me thus . If they trust not One tried so oft as I have been  --  why then , Neither will I trust them . The best of them Shall keep without these walls  --  unless indeed They put themselves within my grasp , and then I 'll put them in such walls as suit those bold Enough to be mine enemies . All  --  all Are enemies to me  --  Guelphs  --  Ghibellines  --  Who seek to balk me of my deep revenge .

RUGGIERI Right noble gentlemen , it were to me , Who most unworthily do occupy The highest place in Pisa 's signiory , A task most grateful , and most cherished too ; As well it would become a patriot prince , Clothed with some sacred offices by heaven ; To fill your ears with welcome news , and touch Your generous hearts ; news that would vibrate too Through every breast in Pisa 's fair domain . Well , noble sirs , should our own heart respond Unto the general impulse . Sweet it were , To publish through broad Pisa 's lands , that fate And our fierce neighbours had relented . Yes , Would it were mine to comfort all the hearts , That much too long have shared the cruel bonds Which keep ten thousand of our best in chains In Genoa . Too long this widowed state Hath drawn forth Pisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brothers , fathers , sons , Have known this sad bereavement . We , who fill The place of common father to the state , Feel most of all ; now at our council board Once more assembled , and remembering well , How we are called on by the general voice For hope and consolation . Hard it falls On us , fair sirs , to say we have no hope , No consolation , to impart . For since Our noble and much honoured councillors , Sismondi and the rest , in embassy Went hence , unto the doge 's state  --  to move The freedom of our captive brethren , By giving Castro to the Genoese  --  A sacrifice  --  indeed  --  would make our sires Start in their graves : and yet , what sacrifice Could be too great for Pisa 's general peace ? And so I deemed it when I moved the affair , As well ye may remember , sirs ... ANSELMO . ANSELMO I trust ' Twill have some pardon to remind your grace , That I it was who first said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home  --  Would be well sold . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI It were small courtesy In you , sir , thus to interrupt my speech ... Methinks ' t would move , as I have said before , Our valiant ancestors now in their graves , That Castro , that great prize , once from the Moors Wrested by their high deeds , should now again , And by a Pisan soldier , rendered be To Pisa 's enemies . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Most noble sir , I pray you not to think a soldier 's words Wanting in every reverence to your grace . That I did move the matter is most true , And stand responsible for it to all . Let them take Castro , so we get our friends  --  And let them keep it if they can  --  But I Have some light fancies that , ere many moons , Pisa will cast her eyes again that way  --  And our fair swords may win it back again . I meant no more than this , most reverend sir . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Sir , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is the council board , and not the mass That doth engage us now . And so , fair sirs , To take up somewhat my thus cleft discourse  --  Although the time is more than fully ripe , We have no word from our ambassadors . Hence ' t is we cherish thoughts from day to day , Nay , and from hour to hour ; to have our hopes Or fears confirmed . This general suspense Weighs upon all , and better far ' twill be To know the worst but once , than have our lives Made daily wretched by it . BARTOLI . BARTOLI True , my lord , Your grace says well in that . The citizens Will feel as if the worst were known , to learn What now your grace hath deigned to say : the worst May fall upon them twice , I grieve to think . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI What is your meaning , sir ? MONZANO . MONZANO Most noble sir , A rumour hath possessed the general ear , Of letters from Count Ricoveranza , Your grace 's noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Your grace 's hands , written in Genoa . And hence the anxious and the feverish thoughts That fill each Pisan breast . And this I ween The noble Bartoli 's fair speech imports . Archbishop and Gualandi interchange looks . GUALANDI . GUALANDI This is some idle tale , my lord , the times Are father to . The public mind is hot , And hatches maggots , like the sun , from nought : He that would hunt them all must rise betimes . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Faith , sir , you are right : and men would need long days , And longer lives to boot . Yet , were it true That public fancies , and those said maggots Are bred in the same way ; then I must fain Imagine rumours have some substance too  --  That is , until I know the glorious sun Is made of maggots . When he shines on nought ; If maggots come of it , they are his own . GUALANDI . GUALANDI You are pleasant , noble sir . When I did say The sun did hatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nought obvious to our wonted sense Of proper causes . My philosophy , Mayhap , is not so deep , fair sir , as yours ; Yet I have lived to know how small a thing May make a mountain bring to bed a mouse , Or a cloud become a man i ' the moon . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Nay , pray you spare me , sir  --  ' t were best , we think , How to allay this public feeling : since Our duty and our love bind us alilleg . Unto our citizens . This must be broke , And kindly , to them . Long it can not be Ere every thing ' s resolved . LANFRANCHI . LANFRANCHI Upon my life , With reverence to your grace 's ear , I say The noble captain is not wrong . In truth This public rumour may have substance well . Your grace has been advised that an unknown , Last night , was found , scaling the eastern wall , And that he fled , and keeps in hiding still . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Ay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You thought this gallant wore some strange disguise , Was it not so ? GUALANDI . GUALANDI My Lord , my own poor thoughts Indeed were those which the Bargello had . This roisterer , it seems , Pontani says , On being summoned quietly to stand , Struck the Bargello down . His hand being in , He lent it to four others of the guard , And knocked them down to keep him company , Then showed them heels as active as his arms . And there the matter rests . Some brawling youth , No doubt . The honour of his light o ' love Has value in his eyes perhaps . ' T is like Enough , the rumour of this fray has reached The town  --  And so we have a man i ' the moon . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Faith if they have such men i ' the moon , sir , It is a mettled race it holds . I would We had an army of them . Genoa Should feel we held her light of love enough . By saint Ranieri , patron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then outrun the rest ! I 've seen bold knights move from the tented field , Display their strength , and rush upon the foe  --  And sometimes haply fly the yielded plain . And in your land , O Aretines , I 've seen Both horse and footmen march in proud array . There too gay tournaments I 've oft beheld , Where many a sturdy lance I ween was broke  --  Whilst trumpets , drums and cymbals clanged around , Drowning the dulcet flute , and martial fire But such a feat as this I ne'er have seen ! If we go on at this rate , we shall have Saint George and dragon back again to boot . Has the Bargello found him not ? i ' faith I 'd like to see this gallant . Metal , sir , Is in him  --  of the right soldier breed , sir . GUALANDI . GUALANDI ' T is the Bargello 's business  --  if he loves His bones , he will revenge them if he can . Though I opine the legs that gallant bore Have carried him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but a brawl : ' twill teach him vigilance , And merits not our care . We must devise Some natural way to ease the public mind , Until some tidings come from Genoa . ' Till that takes place , the best of us , I wot , Will have but little peace . Enter an Officer . OFFICER . OFFICER May it please your grace , As I but looked just now towards the marine , From the great window in the western hall ; All Pisa 's population , I may say I saw , moving this way  --  waving their hats And hands , rending the air with shouts renewed . And , if my ears deceive me not , the name That most their tongues were loud and pregnant with , Was Aldobrandi  --  ' Viv ' Aldobrandi . ' ARCHBISHOP RUGGIERI starting from his chair ' Aldobrandi ! nay , sir , it can not be . Moving this way ! How far are they from hence ? ' T may be some mutiny . The feverish mob Is never safe . The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be under arms , And guard the palace court  --  let no one in Until our pleasure is expressed . And , sir , Bring us some further news without delay . Exit Officer . Now , gentlemen , I pray ye keep your seats ; If there is danger , we must move like men  --  If not , ' t were meet that we be found composed . Conscious authority is ever true Unto itself , a goodly countenance Is a strong host to enemies and friends . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Sir , it is a gallant disposition You show forth  --  and if mutiny ' s at hand , You may command my sword . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Thanks , noble sir , We give you noble thanks ; nor do we deem The danger great  --  not less the prudence though . From the marine , he said that they approached , And ' t is not there ' t would gather to a head  --  But rather in the rank and noisy streets Of Pisa . It doth fret me now  --  what ho ! Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Anon ? SECOND OFFICER . SECOND OFFICER My Lord , the captain of the guard Crosses in breathless haste the palace court , And bends his steps this way . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Straight bring him in . Enter Captain of the Guard . LAMBRUSCHINI . LAMBRUSCHINI It is my duty to inform your grace The ambassadors from Genoa are arrived . With them the Marquis Aldobrandi comes . The populace are beating at the gates , To be admitted  --  but your orders were That no one should come in . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Now God be thanked ! Ever most our friend , when most we want one . BARTOLI AND MONZANO . BARTOLI , MONZANO Amen , with all our hearts and souls , to that . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI We shall find time to thank him , sirs , as meet It were , with all solemnity and form . ANSELMO . ANSELMO True , reverend sir . I 've nought but soldier 's thanks To give . Poor as they are , I give them all . ARCHBISHOP RUGGIERI to the captain of the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them fitting honour in this case . And since the occasion is most solemn too , We with our council have appointed now To give a public meeting in the square , To such dear honoured friends : that all may know How much we cherish them and Pisa too . Two hours from hence , we shall expect , fair sirs , To see you at the signiory , and thence In fitting state , we 'll seek our noble friends . Exeunt Anselmo , Monzano , Bartoli . To Lanfranchi . Hasten , and bid Ricoveranza here , And let him come unseen . Our relative T is true he is  --  but we are acting now Beneath the public eye , and it behoves Us to be circumspect . Exit Lanfranchi . Now Gualandi , Did I not say Anselmo loved us not ? He must be watched . He is a snake i ' the grass , Or they will make him one : but that 's a thought Will keep . What can this Aldobrandi mean ? What scheme is this they 've hatched to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes . S ' death , that the fool Pontani can not find That insolent intruder  --  ' t is some plot . The more I think upon it , more it grows Upon my mind . We ' ve enemies , sir , here , And haughty ones . The people are incensed , And harassed too . The fickle mob is prone , In such a feverish mood , to seek for change . We must be stirring . Haste , Gualandi , haste  --  Thou art a pillar of the state , to thee We look for aid and counsel  --  haste and touch The public pulse ; bring me some news , and  --  stay  --  Command the captain of the guard he use All due precaution , and dispose his force So skilfully as not to hurt the public eye , But yet well placed to stay the public arm . And let the sbirri mix among the crowd , And mark the malcontents , and aid the guard If needful were . Oh what an anxious thing It is , my friend , to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is free , Except the slave that watches o'er the rest . Exit Gualandi . A slave indeed he is who watches thus ! But with these vigils I may rivet still Chains upon these who make me thus their slave . Exit . SCENE II . Court of the Palace . Enter Monzano , Bartoli , Anselmo . MONZANO . MONZANO Why , Captain , how you chased his reverend grace  --  He loves not contradictions . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Nor do I  --  That is my humour . But his grace loves not The man that contradicts him . Did you mark The haughty unforgiving air he wore , When he reminded us it was no mass We were engaged in . Now , God save our souls , I thought that priests loved to be reverend thought , And to be called so too . Yet where ambition comes , Or woman 's favour  --  worldly pride  --  with some Such trifling mortal weaknesses as these  --  ' Priest me no priests , ' they cry , ' but make fair room , Or by the malison we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other stamp ! ' They ' re priests until they ' ve got us by the nose , And then they put humility on us . Why , sirs , six inches of cold steel might serve To show a man a quicker way to heaven , Than all the priestly blessings from such hands . Talking of steel  --  I 've had my day , ' t is true , And so has this companion by my side ; But now we may betake ourselves to rest , Since nameless paladins are found abroad , To knock me down five ruffians at a time . His grace seemed but indifferent  --  ' t is true , These knockings down ill suit the holy cloth , There 's not much mystery in blows . ' T is gests , And dubious words betray the dubious thought ; And this his grace knows well . ' T would please me well To see this gallant . Blows , like these , are wont To fall on high occasions  --  not for love Of fighting  --  least of all in times like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this , Having his councillors to blind  --  for we Rather do sanction his prepared behests Than aid with our advice . ' T is known to me , From an unerring source , his reverend grace Holds this Pontani upon life or death , To find the offender out  --  many a spring Is secretly at work . BARTOLI . BARTOLI I fear to think That this concerns us more than we 're aware . Count Guido 's messenger  --  could it be him ? It might well be . He was to leave the town Before the dawn  --  Should he be ta'en . Ay , then , Indeed our matters draw on to a head . The missives that I gave him ,  --  all conspires To show we stand upon a mine . My friends , Since the Archbishop counsels not with us , Let us with him . He gave us sage advice  --  ' If there is danger , we must move like men . ' Discretion in our heads  --  and  --  in our swords True metal . We are not alone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere long , We at the signiory must meet again  --  And when this solemn ceremony ends , I shall request your private ear . Till then Give you good den . Exeunt Bartoli and Monzano . ANSELMO . ANSELMO This is the courtier 's life , that oft in camps I 've heard men speak of  --  all delight and ease  --  The love of ladies  --  gallant tournaments  --  A prince 's smiles  --  fair gentlemen with caps And hearts too , as they say , in courteous hands , A perfect paradise  --  Ay , true , for fools  --  And such a dreaming stupid fool was I , To come into these courts , where perfidy And plots and specious ways and lying looks Are the true courtier 's arms . My curse on them . Well have I loved my native land , and oft I 've toiled and fought and bled and had small fare To comfort me for wounds and aching bones  --  Yet it did comfort me to think , that I , Poor as I was , was helping to build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought the anxious care of all . But now I find these patriotic chiefs Forget the stewardship  --  the steward ' t is They think for . What is a prince in power , Who casts a selfish eye upon his trust , Better than him he punishes with death , For plundering his too credulous lord 's estate ? He is not better , he is worse . Low minds Lack of those noble virtues a breeding gives To men who are nobly bred . High breeding else Is but an idle term . And if his grace Should prove an arrant traitor in his charge , As much I fear : if by his wily arts He hath so practised with the Genoese , That my brave countrymen , who fought with me , Must rot in dungeons , ' till their rusty chains Shall snap for shame  --  The priest had better shrive , The prince that he 's so near to , his last shrift . Exit , and putting his hand on his sword . SCENE III . Public Square . Archbishop and the Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Stage filled with the Populace . Mothers , Wives , &c.; &c.; of the Prisoners . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Most noble sirs , we welcome you in heart , More than in speech . This long expected day , We trust , brings comfort to some sorrowing breasts : Pisa 's fair matrons look to you for hope ; Too long have they been widowed . Noble sirs , This deep bereavement ' s common to the state , And presses heavy our paternal heart . The father to the state most keenly feels His children 's cares . But heaven , in whom we trust , Now smiles auspicious in your safe return ; And blessed be heaven , and welcome be the day . The which to honour more , we have thought right , With our approving councillors now here , To give you this most solemn meeting , sirs  --  That Pisa may mark well , how nigh you are In honourable observances with us ; As well , how dear the interests of the state We feel . Noble sirs , ye are thrice welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldobrandi  --  unto whom This public ceremonial may not fit , The extent of our affection be expressed ; So well deserved by you , both of ourselves , And at your country 's hands . Now , a n't please ye , With these poor utterings of a grateful heart , And thanks to God , dispenser of all good ; We are prepared to hear the high import Of your late embassy to Genoa . Pandolfini steps forward . PANDOLFINI . PANDOLFINI Most reverend and excellent sir ! Our hearts Are grateful too . To give our thanks to God , In his fair temples on our native land , The scanty time hath briefly suffered . Still They have been sincere . Now , we thank our prince With all affection , and through him express Our duty to the state . My noble peers , Who stand before this presence , have thought meet , That I , the least in honour of the three , Should open this great matter to your grace . Sir , when in Genoa we had arrived , The groans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed as if in chains , All Pisa 's population had been thrown , And to a hopeless bondage was condemned . Our breasts were torn with pity ; and the more , In that we knew not how to comfort them . Remembering our high charge , we straight besought An audience of the doge , and we laid Before him and his councillors , the first , And lightest charge of our instructions . This , As well your grace remembers , purported , To pay in ransom of our countrymen , One hundred thousand ducats of pure gold Of Venice . Also to discharge , by some Fair compensation , equitably wrought , The maintenancing for some four years past , Of our ten thousand countrymen . And then , To ship them home to Pisa at our cost . We were received in honour , and dismissed , Until the council had resolved the affair . Sir , we were well assured the Genoese Were satiated with , to us , the sad And melancholy sight of Pisa 's sons , Bound in their chains  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants well . We were apprized by trusty friends , the state Did entertain our purpose kindly too . But these fair hopes were blighted ; for it seems The council changed their purpose , and , most strange , They urged upon us as their sole intent , Castro 's surrender , our Sardinian strength . Now this was secretly our last resort , So warranted in our instructions , sirs : A strange coincidence ,  --  yet it befell . With much and often communing , at length We did agree to render Castro up . And now we thought the matter at an end . When , lo me , sirs , pressing it on , to haste The necessary embarkations , Another change came on . From day to day , From week to week , not one fair answering Did they vouchsafe to all our wherefores . Nought Heard we more  --  save by some friends , the council Was divided . Some liked the ducats best , And some the fort . Tired out at last , we craved Permission to return ; and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , As he received us . More he did to boot  --  Permitting noble Aldobrandi here , For some brief space to see his native land . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI I am amazed ! Capricious changes these  --  ' T is hard to say whence they do come . Looking at Anselmo . ANSELMO . ANSELMO They come From princes that are traffickers in rags . The case is bad . Money may cure it still . Aldobrandi comes forward . ALDOBRANDI . ALDOBRANDI Most gracious sir , if a poor prisoner 's thanks Might come as present earnest of the love And duty that I bear my native land , I would most humbly lay them at your feet . But prisoners have nought to give , and I Am more than prisoner unto Genoa ; My honour being pawned for quick return . But if again , on some auspicious day , I dare to call myself a freeman here , My sword shall be my warrant , and my voice The trumpet , for the true allegiance , sirs , That Aldobrandi bears . Think not , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by absence wrought To desperate adventure , I am come , To feast my eyes once more on what I love . My father 's halls , I swear , shall ne'er respond To their lord 's footsteps , whilst he wears his chains . What brought me here then ? My country 's honour ! Four years have now elapsed , since that black day Closed in upon my freedom . Reluctant Memory  --  as when some anxious wretch ' Scaped the devouring waves , and gained the shore , Turns to regard the turbulent abyss  --  Looks back upon the terrors of that pass . Oh fatal day ! that into bondage threw More than ten thousand of the bravest hearts , And wrapt my country 's glory in a shroud ! Haply , my noble Lords , in peace at home , Ye have not known , how lengthened absence draws A patriot 's feelings to his native land . How quick his jealous heart leaps to avenge , And guard his country 's honour . Well may then A captive 's breast keep up a keener sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious eyes Are turned to those fair scenes , where all he loves Is found , and liberty likewise . Know , then , Your countrymen , whose bodies Genoa Possesses , but whose hearts are here , through me Now speak unto this noble signiory  --  And say , how this has been they know not , yet , So long ye 've let their chains clank in their ears , That they have learnt so far to bear the sound , As to prefer it for a thousand years To one more grating  --  And there is but one  --  The knell that tolls for Pisa 's glory . Ay , Surrender Castro and that glory ' s gone . Sardinia , by our noble ancestors Wrested from Moorish sway , Sardinia ' s gone . Each illustrious name : the Gherardesca  --  Caietani , the Visconti , Sardi , Sismondi , and the rest , that in our fair And gallant annals shine  --  all blotted out . Fair Pisa left alone  --  defenceless then  --  The prey of some small tyrant for a while , Until our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arno flows , Have nought to nourish tyrants with . The rank And fulsome weeds shall fill our courts , and grass Our solitary streets . Pisa shall be One universal Campo Santo then : Mistress no more of states . Ah wretched land ! Ship , without pilot , tost in raging storms  --  Hear how she calls on ye who hold the reins  --  ' Stop , cruel ones  --  behold your widowed dame  --  Come , and behold her fallen state  --  all  --  all But honour gone . Come , and behold her sons , Her gallant sons in chains  --  Sons , who have sworn Their freedom ne'er shall cost a parent 's fame . Redeem them with her gold  --  take all she has  --  But save her honour  --  for her life is there . And if thus desolate she cries in vain  --  If duty , love , nought can compassion move  --  Come but to blush at the degenerate thought , That thus extinguishes the Pisan name ! ' Grave sirs , it well becomes your charge , to think . Albeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Castro 's gone , the doom Of Pisa is pronounced  --  and better far It were , to yield up all we have , and save A glorious name . For me , my Lords , content Is a poor word , to faintly shadow forth The joy that I shall feel , to render up All the possessions of my house , to bring My countrymen in honour back , unto An honoured land . And well I know , that gold , If amply tendered , will unloose these bonds . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Most noble sir , ye move us too . It were A traitor 's thought to shame the land , much more To be its parricide . This generous warmth , Brave sir , becomes your patriot name , and straight This urgent matter we 'll discuss . You said It was the general voice you spoke , of all Our countrymen in Genoa , I think . ALDOBRANDI . ALDOBRANDI I did , my Lord ; and do believe it is The voice of all true Pisan hearts . ' T is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden hope of freedom had so raised Some hearts that languished most for home , that when ' T was known no ransom but Sardinian forts Would be received , and would be granted too , The love of liberty still blinded them Unto so great a cost  --  and then it was , The noble Ricoveranza urged , in terms Worthy a patriot 's and a Pisan 's breast , The ignominy of the act . Which all , On some persuasion , did assent to . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Oh , Count Ricoveranza ' t was  --  ALDOBRANDI . ALDOBRANDI Fair sir , indeed ' T was him  --  he hath a noble mind . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI A mind That well might grace a soldier 's heart , And hand  --  more prompt to win fair trophies , sir , To Anselmo . Than to surrender them . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Your grace says well . A noble bidding ' t is the Count has done . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Noble sirs  --  we now retire . Our council Shall be summoned to attend . This matter Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It shall have . And so farewell . Exeunt . ACT III . SCENE I. Public Square . Pippo , Madonna Paula , Madonna Giannotta . Pisan People , Women , &c.; &c.; in the distance . PIPPO .

When I hurt myself I always cry , I 'm so sorry always  --  but if I was dead you know , I should be a fool to cry . PAULA . Paula O , Pippo , do n't talk such nonsense . Come , Pippo , ca n't you help to a good turn now ? How shall I get to speak to one of the Ambassadors ? GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta Monna  --  let us go to the palace of the Marquess Aldobrandi : he is a noble gentleman and an affable . It was in his galley that Ceco fought . I 'm sure he 'll speak to us . PAULA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Marquess , I 've been told , refuses to go to his palace , or even to see the Marchesa . GIANNOTTA .

Paula It is too true , Monna . PIPPO . PIPPO Then you had better go , Monna Notta  --  it will only be taking a lesson against your husband comes home . I warrant me if the Marquess wo n't go to see his fine palace , and his beautiful wife ; Francesco , that fought in the same ship with him , will prove a true follower . GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta Come , Pippo , do n't vent your spitefulness on me  --  I never call you Gobbo , and plague you as others do . PIPPO .

Madonna Giannotta And about the Prisoners , have you heard them say anything , Messer ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO They talk of nothing else . A man feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta And did you hear them say any thing of my poor husband  --  He had a charge in Aldobrandi 's galley ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Let me see . There was something said of such a man , that when they came away was to be hanged . GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta For what , sir ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Why for marrying a young Genoese wife , when he had a good old wife here in Pisa . GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta You do n't remember his name , do you , sir ? My Francesco never ... BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Francesco  --  faith , that was the name  --  but no ' t was something else  --  Francesco ... GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta Not Tosoni , sir ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO You 've hit the name plump on the head . You could n't have done it better , Monna . GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta Oh miserable me ! What shall I do ? Oh Monna Paula  --  Monna Paula !

That 's but half my name  --  and Gobbo ' s half thine , for thy hump ' s about one half of thee . PAULA . Paula Ah ! now the humpback gets it . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO What dost thou call this a great day for in Pisa , Signor Pippo , if thou likest that better ? PIPPO . PIPPO Oh Messer , the Ambassadors are come from Genoa . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Well , and thou wert in the square when the Archbishop gave them audience  --  PIPPO . PIPPO Yes , Messer . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO And didst thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Messer , I was too far off . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO And didst thou hear what he said to them ? PIPPO .

BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Thou has seen a great many people , and thou feelest like a greater fool than ever , and all this makes it such a great day in thy eyes , I suppose . PIPPO . PIPPO Messer Buffalmacco , where is your godson Tonetto ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO He ' s gone to an honourable trade , the wars being all over . PIPPO . PIPPO Oh Messer , what trade ? I want to go to a trade . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO He ' s learning to curl the devil 's whiskers . PIPPO . PIPPO Santa Maria ! BUFFALMACCO .

PIPPO D'ye remember , Messer , when Tonetto stole Padre Donato 's cat and sold it to him , skin and all , and how they ate the cat in the refectory for a rabbit guisato ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Ay , it was that got Tonetto his preferment . That cat was the famous ram cat that tempted . St Anthony of Padua . When the Padre ate the carcass , the devil got into Tonetto 's , and set himself up for his own barber . PIPPO . PIPPO O Santissima Madre ! BUFFALMACCO BUFFALMACCO his finger to his mouth . But mum , that 's a family secret . PIPPO . PIPPO I can keep it , Messer . Tonetto and I used to keep each other 's secrets  --  we only used to talk of them in the Campo Santo under Orgagna 's picture of the day of judgment . But , Messer , wont you tell us  --  Monna Paula , Monna Notta , and myself , some of the news from Genoa ? BUFFALMACCO .

Why , how is this ? And weeping too , Madonna ? Why ' t is Madonna Notta . How has this chanced ? PAULA . Paula Some jokes of Messer Buffalmacco , sir . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Ah Buffalmacco , let us crack our jokes Only in places where our swords might strike , If such need were . Not upon womankind  --  And least of all on honoured Matrons , such As Madonna Notta . She is not rich , ' T is true , yet she has what will last Longer than riches  --  She has an honest heart , And hath known better days . I knew the time , When the young Lord of Monteseltro hung On Giannotta 's breast  --  She was his nurse . There He drew in healthy streams  --  and better blood , Could scarce have made a better man . Ay sir , I say a nobler than the Count has proved . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Why now , the foolish dame  --  to weep for such an idle tale  --  This Dossori or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I warrant him . Come  --  come to Giannotta . GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta ' T was not Tosoni , then , sir ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO ' T was one of Buffalmacco 's babies you were cackling after , you old goose , and not your husband ; but sith it comes to that , give me your hand , Monna , and I 'll try to make you amends . I am to feast at Ricoveranza 's this night , and I 'll get something out of him of this Francesco of yours . But where do you live , Monna , now ? GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta In a lone cottage , sir , not far from the Gualandi Tower . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO You shall hear from me , Monna . PAULA . Paula And my poor boy , Gaetano Strozzi , Messer ; wont you speak a word for him too ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Why what are they going to hang him for ? PAULA . Paula O Messer . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Well  --  well  --  addio  --  Monne  --  addio . Exeunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a wicked wag , But I am fain to think you 've got more heart Than some who are higher in the state . ' T were well If they meant quite as honestly as you . The people mean us fair , and we should use The people kindly . You mix more with them , Sir . How does it stand with them ? What think they Of this long captivity ?  --  of these bonds All talk of breaking , yet which ne'er get loosed ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Captain Anselmo  --  you are a frank and honest man . I know you and am not afraid of you . The people are not fools . The women , sir , want their husbands home , their sons , their fathers and their brothers . The bonds that have made them fast in Genoa , have set their tongues loose in Pisa . But the men here who think the most , say the least . There may be some however who think deep enough , to do a wrongful thought to some of those you spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  whom ' t may not suit to have ten thousand soldados here at home . Your soldado  --  saving your presence  --  is an unquiet sort of animal  --  he loves changes  --  and if they wont come of themselves  --  why then  --  ten thousand arms , with one head to carve them out , might bring some changes on , that wisdom thinks were as well off as on . Do I speak by the rule , sir , or shall I put it into jokes or verse for ye ? ANSELMO . ANSELMO I understand you , sir  --  it is enough  --  The people are not satisfied , I ween . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO The people are the most unsatisfied people in the world  --  the more shame for them . And so , sir , my humble services wait upon you . Exit . ANSELMO . ANSELMO That wag has touched the very tenderest chord . Ricoveranza played his part right well . And now his grace must have our gold , to loose , Not bounds , but consciences in Genoa . Gold must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen . ' sdeath , this foul fraud , This specious head and bust , semblance of truth And justice  --  so benign and fair . A crime , One of the basest that a man can do , It were , not to turn up the saintly robe And show the serpent 's tail . I 'll look me up These gentlemen . Exit . SCENE II . Archbishop 's Palace . Enter Archbishop and Ricoveranza . RICOVERANZA . RICOVERANZA Your grace is now possessed of every step I took . These merchant princes have their price . Gold is the merchant 's god . And they were fain To close with us at first . This they had done , Had I not covertly held out the bait Of Castro  --  Then the pride of Genoa Broke loose  --  nor could they bridle it , until Some timely earnests were paid down  --  the dawn Of future largesses . And thus we got , With working on the Pisan pride to boot , More breathing time . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI And that is golden time  --  Time turns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must be now . I must have gold , And I will have it . Pisa is poor  --  Still She has something left . I have kept my eye On one , who has it , and who wants it not , Nor ever shall . This very night I 'll wring It from him . Proud  --  unsubdued  --  Gualandi Says he is  --  no matter  --  the cup he drinks Shall have more myrrh put i n't . But kinsman , say ; Ye spake of Doria , and of some strange news He had from Piedmont . When ye spake of it Gualandi was in hearing  --  things that touch Me nearly , I care not should be known , save But by those who stand near to me , like yourself . RICOVERANZA . RICOVERANZA Why sir , the sum of it was this . The prince , Ere our sojourn was old in Genoa , Gave me in secret , that he had for news , The emperor and the Ghibelline chiefs Had privily resolved , without delay , To send Count Guido Montefeltro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lest The return of such a host to Pisa , Should cause some strange commotion , that the Guelphs Might draw advantage from . And , in good sooth , ' T was plausible enough : it being well known That Aldobrandi is a Guelph at heart , And popular enough to lead them on . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Plausible ! ay  --  there are more workings here Than I am trusted with . What Ghibelline Has been more true than I  --  has ventured more ; Who broke the Guelphish power in Pisa here , Divided it in twain ; shut Gallura Without our walls ; and Ugolino  --  head And front of all their strength  --  within such walls As he may never force again . Are these Light deeds  --  Am I not trusted then ? Others Must reap , it seems , what I have sown  --  ' T is well at least to know it is so . At least We dare to trust ourselves  --  And kinsman , you Are as ourself . Our council is composed Of some who are but dubious friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll know them , true or false , Ere long . Enter Gualandi . Well , Gualandi , hast thou yet heard Of this Bargello ? GUALANDI . GUALANDI Nay , my Lord , it rests In mystery yet ; but we have set such traps , That it were hard , if this affair have such , But that our enemies fall in . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Come , sir , We 'll hence and speak this prisoner . Exeunt . SCENE III . Evening . A Chamber in the Gualandi Tower . Count Ugolino and his children manacled . The children sleeping on the floor . Ugolino looking to the small grated window . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Night falls again ! Thou peaceful sunset hour , That erst upon the desolated hearts Of our first parents stole , closing on them The wondrous spectacle  --  as if their God , Plunging with his spent glories from on high , Was bearing them and nature too along , Into the irrecoverable tomb Of night and death . Thou melancholy hour ! That dost suspend the influences of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature seems to shrink at thy approach  --  E'en now yon distant convent bell , that twangs Amid the evening shades , and strikes mine ear , Seems to feel sorrow for the dying day . Ye soft embrowning shades , that fading light Subdue : and to the wearied passengers Of life 's long journey , bring a rest from toil  --  Fall gently on my senses . Me alone Except not from the general blessing . Let Your grateful influence wrap my wearied sense , My ever waking dream of hope deferred , My ever present , restless misery , In your oblivious shrouds . And when sleep falls , And gently lifts the bonds from these poor babes , Then be it so with me . Let not my dreams Press these accursed chains deeper within My wounded soul . Put not within my grasp That phantom of revenge , that mockery Of liberty . That when my brooding day Is done , my soul may know some rest  --  nor wake , To curse the day , that I was born , to bear This bondage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me  --  for me no passion lives But hatred , rancorous hatred , both to me And mine . I can hate  --  truly I can hate An arrogant deceitful world as well . And my affections , they are compassed In the brief space this prison doth afford . Yet they are strong  --  and more my father 's heart Is wrung for them , than for my wretched self . This artful tyrant , this Ruggieri , Who in my path hath ever stood ; he knows No kindlier movements of our nature . He Is a priest , and has no children . His mind Is bent on garnering for himself alone  --  He has not the excuse , if insufficient , That ambition lends to those , whose name Must be held up , and in some honour given To their fair sons . He has no name  --  no sons . His is one thought  --  how by hypocrisy He best may veil his lust of power . And I , Fool that I was to trust this faithless priest , And call him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but thwarted me , With whom I should have dealt with gentleness  --  But ' t is ambition 's way . We rashly stake Realities , for things , which , when attained , We ca n't preserve ; and so lose all . E'en so Have I done . I have lost all  --  more than all , My own  --  my children 's liberty to boot . A noise . What noise is that ? ' t is an unwonted hour ! They have unbarred the prison door below . Gualandi , may be  --  with some food . ' T was strange They brought no food to-day , and since the morn Of yesterday we fast . I deemed him galled Last night ; the silent scorn he got , might well Ruffle my haughty jailor  --  and I thought He kept it back perhaps to harass me , And try my patience more . Once indeed , thoughts Flashed o'er my mind  --  too horrid  --  They are passed  --  I did not dare to think on them . And now , I wot , he sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arise , my sons , shake Off your sleep  --  here 's food for ye at last . Enter Archbishop and Gualandi . RUGGIERI , GUALANDI Starts Ah ! GUALANDI GUALANDI to the Captain of the Guard . Wait in the room below , and if you hear Me call aloud  --  then instant bring your men . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Count Ugolino . Nay , sir , hear . It were Small policy in you to shut your ears , When haply they may bring you tidings Ugolino turns away ... Well , If liberty hath lost its charms for you And yours  --  then , it is true , you 've nought to hear . You love me not  --  There is a gulph I know Between our loves Ugolino waves his hand . So let it be  --  But here Are some , who stand this side that gulph , and long May stand there , would their jealous sire permit . Ay , and in liberty . Hear this plain tale ! The aspect of this bondage ye are in Is somewhat hopeless  --  Ye are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chains , in hopeless bondage too . The council there look to a ransom , more Than Pisa 's worn out coffers can produce . The people too , exhausted by our wars , As well you know , have little more to give . Your secret treasures , Count !  --  ay , sir , I say , Your secret treasures , may do more than free Your captive countrymen  --  they may free these ! Pointing to his sons . But not yourself  --  at least not yet . When you , Count Ugolino , shall have learnt , that he , Ruggieri , who enjoys your present hate , Can have your sons , in honoured kindness  --  Ay ! Then haply from Ruggieri 's hands , e'en you May deign to take your freedom too . Now , sir , I 've said  --  and wait your answer . UGOLINO UGOLINO after a struggle . Ne'er again I thought to see thy hateful face , or hear Thy cursed voice . If all the fiends of hell Were out , there is not one I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , Daring to trust thyself so far  --  My words Shall be as plain as thine . I trust thee not . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Injurious and proud  --  Prisoner  --  that word Came well , to speak thy impotence . A slave Like thee may rail : thou shalt not chase me so As to forget thou art one . Come , resolve , And if thou hast a father 's heart  --  be quick  --  Thy fate and theirs hang by a thread of time . GUALANDI . GUALANDI Noble sir , look on these fair sons , be wise . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Silence ! base pander to this bloated priest . Meditates . Release my children , and I 'll give you gold . His children cling around him . GADDO . GADDO Nay , father , we 'll not stir from hence , unless He gives you freedom too . We scorn his wrath : We can be happier where our father is , Even in this tower , than under his false care . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Take thy words back again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , and here I swear , Thy children shall be free . I say . I swear . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Swear ! thou perjured fiend ! Thou hast sworn too oft , For thy soul 's comfort , and my body 's too . What are oaths to thee  --  base shuffling priest . What  --  Is it not thy trade , to undo all oaths ? And if thou canst release the stupid fools , Who think that God makes devils saints , why what Can stop thee from absolving thine own self ? I 'll not be caught by such light things as oaths . Fetch the Bargello here  --  I 'll make him swear For half a ducat that I 'll keep my word . His oath is lawful coin  --  thine , base . I swear , And by the unstained honour of my name , I will not trust thee . A father 's heart ! Yes , I have a father 's heart , and these dear babes Live only in it . And if all the gold That as in Christendom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them happy . Never more Than now did I feel for them ; and if thou , Ruggieri , meanest loyally , which much I doubt , go  --  bring thy council here  --  To them , For this great purpose that thou speakest of , I will surrender all  --  on pledges given To liberate my sons . Thee I trust not . No more than this I 'll do . So may I have Comfort from God when most I want his aid . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Thou shalt not dupe me so . A prince 's word May well suffice a prisoner 's doubt . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO What prince ? Thou art no prince , thou lying hypocrite  --  Because thou sittest in a prince 's chair . I am thy prince  --  and were my body chained I ' the darkest dungeon of thy wrath , still Should my soul be free , to scorn thy rancour . False hypocrite ! thou darest not trust , it seems , Thy council with the gold the state must have  --  I thought as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou'dst steal it . I abhor  --  I spit on thee . Away  --  away , tempt me not with thy sight . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Rot in thy chains then  --  Discase and farnine Be your common portion  --  Blenched be your bones ! Where human aid shall be invoked in vain . Exeunt Archbishop and Gualandi . NINO . NINO What said he , father ? UGOLINO UGOLINO aside . I have been too rash To stake more lives then mine . My choleric mood Was up , and could not brook his odious sight . I must await the morrow . ' Till it comes , I must collect my scattered thoughts . Too well I know his vengeful nature  --  yet this gold Will hang about his heart , and must be his , Even at my price . A hammering noise is heard below . GADDO . GADDO Father , they are barring up the outer gate  --  Dost thou not hear  --  below  --  o ' the Tower ? ANSELMUCCO .

Enter Anselmo , Bartoli , Monzano . BARTOLI . BARTOLI Fair gentlemen  --  good den  --  ye are well met  --  I have some notice for your private ear . You are not trusted  --  and to morrow 's sun , When set , will set a watch on me , on you , And many of our friends . The Archbishop , sirs , Is fearful we may come to harm , and so , When darkness comes , dark lanterns will come too , And follow us . This from a trusty friend I have . ANSELMO . ANSELMO ' T is making light of us , at least . Three days are past since audience was given To the Ambassadors  --  And all the world Cries , ' where 's the council , why doth it not meet , To liberate our countrymen ?

These were his own words  --  ' His grace desires your friendly ear at noon . ' And being now near noon , I to the palace Hied me , as I met you . MONZANO . MONZANO Then he will act , And promptly . But he will sound you first  --  lest Some false move should mar his game . ANSELMO . ANSELMO The council , Too , he added , would be straightway summoned For tomorrow at the close of day . See , Noon stands above our heads . I must away . Exit . BARTOLI . BARTOLI The times are keen , and they must be ere long More crooked or more straight . I 've learnt but now , From Lambruschini , captain of the guard , His grace is ruffled to the highest point , And swears to sift the grain from out the chaff . He has been strangely moved  --  and hardly sleeps O ' nights . My kinsman , Lambruschini , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this showing a letter , Monzano , most concerns Us now . A trusty hand hath brought me this . MONZANO MONZANO reads . ' The dame Giannotta ' s near Gualandi Tower , ' And here 's the secret mark . ' T is him ! Why now I breathe again . Why this Bargello , sir , Is but a dolt  --  and has no eyes . BARTOLI . BARTOLI Nay , nay , There is a providence in this . MONZANO . MONZANO And now What is your purpose ? BARTOLI . BARTOLI Sir , I sent him word , To morrow , at the middle afternoon , I would be there  --  that all was safe  --  and begged That he would keep it so . We touch upon The very verge of danger  --  even he Is perilled . Snares are set around , as if A lion prowled abroad to spring our gates . There is a vigilance observed without , That nought could ' scape . ' T is providence . Hath wrought it thus  --  for but another day Deferred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us all . Now we must be Both provident and vigilant and firm , To ' scape a snaring too . MONZANO . MONZANO I 'll go with you . For if to-morrow set its spies on us , We must be timely . BARTOLI . BARTOLI ' T is after sunset ' Twill be done , if it is done at all . First , We shall know the purport of this council . In such sharp times , events come on so quick , They tread each other down . And every hour Must fashion its own thoughts to action . Exeunt . SCENE II . An Apartment in the Palace . Enter Archbishop . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI I will not think on it . ' T is now too late  --  And would not serve . Was it not he that stabbed , And let the precious blood from out the veins Of mine own child ? ' T was he that bore the rule In Pisa then .

That nephew was my child  --  my only child  --  And deeply did I swear to take revenge  --  And dearly have I taken it . No more  --  I 'll think no more about it . Why should I Thus rack my feelings with a vain remorse ? The time is past to help them now  --  and I Must use it in my own behalf . The days Perplex me  --  and the nights , they but renew This weakness of my nerves  --  that makes me start At shadows , when most need I have to brace , And make me firm , against mine enemies . They are both numerous and bold . Ere long , I 'll pounce on some of them , and cover o'er Remembrance of this thing , with blood of theirs . Enter Officer . OFFICER .

But I must mask Myself in courtesies , and smiles , and words Of golden aspect  --  for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when princes choose . Enter Anselmo . ANSELMO I have sent for ye , brave captain , that you May know I do esteem you well . ' T is true You have upon occasions ruffled me , But I have thought on this  --  And now I see I did you wrong . Your soldier 's nature , sir , Comes with a frankness that 's unknown to us , Who are bred in courts , and are apt to mix Some alloy with our honesty . But you Deal in pure gold , and should receive such back . And since I 've done ye wrong , let me entreat Your kinder thoughts of me , who feel more joy To do ye right . I ask ye not to take A prince 's favour at my hand ,  --  ' t is more Than that I offer  --  my affection , sir  --  A friend 's devotion in all honest things . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Your grace o'erpowers me  --  I can not coin Out words to express my feelings , sir . And least Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble boon . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Our friendship shall unite , To give our country strength  --  this common cause Unites all loyal citizens .  --  But we Are bound by stronger ties than that , if such May be . Yet still , when a true Ghibelline Speaks to the loyalest of Ghibellines , As you have ever been , another tie , One that encompasses all Italy , Binds us together  --  And a glorious bond It is , and much I fear that it wants friends , Or soon may want them . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Ay ? What means your grace ? ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI These Guelphs are busy , sir . Aldobrandi  --  He is a Guelph at heart  --  He ' s found the way , To ride there on the light opinions Of our poor countrymen in Genoa . The stupid fickle herd in Pisa casts Its cap before him . What , sir , shall happen , When we have strained our purses hard , to bring Ten thousand angry Guelphs within our walls ? Anselmo agitated . I knew ' t would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a Ghibelline  --  and I have borne A trusty and a constant Ghibelline sword . When I was younger , I too should have said , ' Find me a Guelph  --  I 'll find an enemy ! ' But I have travelled up the scale of life So high , that all the hills and vales and seas Of human passions mingle and confound Themselves unto a barren point : whereat I am more fain to go still higher ; where The realm of justice and humanity And charity is found . And I do say , ' T were better far , my Lord , to let these Guelphs , If they be such , come home , than rot in chains . For they are Pisan citizens  --  and more It might become a soldier here to urge , Since they 're her soldiers too . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI You have said well , Good captain , but the Ghibelline cause ... ANSELMO . ANSELMO Ay , sir , The Ghibelline cause  --  and the Guelph cause  --  too true  --  These words are Italy 's reproach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . What , sir , Is any cause but one ? The country 's cause ! And even these most sacred words too oft Are prostituted , for the selfish ends Of tyrants , or of low born churls ; who chouse , With well set phrases , golden promises , The unsuspecting credulous multitude  --  First of their honest judgment  --  freedom next . And then to hold secure the unholy rule , Corruption and the sword are set at work . Most reverend sir , I hold in all respect Your grace 's love  --  and when Anselmo 's sword , Or counsel can betide his country 's cause , You may command them . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Honest Anselmo , I shall hold your promise dear . Exit Anselmo . Country 's cause ! Ay , I will give it cause ere long  --  to know  --  To know that I am Pisa 's master . Exit . SCENE III .

GADDO Ay , and those precious little ones , Those jewels of the centre of his heart , That fraudful famine now would steal from him . Oh ! I will be patient  --  Oh yes , I will . For your sake , Guccio , for my noble sire , I will restrain me  --  be insensible To all the horrors of this dreadful place , If I could be alive and dead at once . NINO NINO faintly .

I wish I were though , for I feel quite strange . GADDO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; It is for us he weeps . NINO NINO advancing to Gaddo . Oh Gaddo , help ! Falls down . GADDO . GADDO What , sweet one , art ' so weak  --  nay chen look up , And lean thyself on dearest Gaddo 's breast . Raises him . See there 's our father looking at us . UGOLINO UGOLINO looking at them , and clasping his hands . God ! Are thy just eyes then turned away from us , Or , in the depths of thine own counsel , thus Dost preparation make for some great good , Beyond the scope and view of our weak minds ? I dare not speak to them ! ' t is the fourth day Since we have looked on food . All hope is fled . Excuse and consolation  --  all alike Exhausted . One short word can comprehend All that the tyrant priest will send us now  --  And that is death  --  death , that I 've looked upon Too oft perhaps , and dealt too largely in  --  With him too  --  and the turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square accounts with me . But here I die ten thousand deaths each day . There 's not a pang of these dear innocents , But stretches me upon the rack . My soul , And body too , are tortured by this fiend . This is not retribution .  --  Oh my God , Let fall thy wrath on me , but spare my babes ! I am not heard ! Famine alone reigns here . I am grown hoarse with bellowing aloud For help . I am forsaken  --  God and man Have barred the doors of mercy on me . What ! Shall this most foul , most horrible of deaths Pass , without gracing of a dear revenge ? Thou monstrous , murderous priest ! Gnaws his hand in a rage . Children run to him . ANSELMUCCIO . ANSELMUCCIO Oh father dear , I pray thee do not this  --  thou clothedst us With this most miserable flesh  --  and now Do thou , to stay thy hunger , eat of this . Averts his head , and offers his arm . UGOLINO UGOLINO hides his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved ones , and dry A father 's tears . It is for ye I feel , Not for my miserable self . My grief Was rash . Our God hath not abandoned us . The cruel tyrant that hath mewed us up , Hath left me rich in my dear children 's love . Cheer up , my Nino . Gaddo , thou art more Than son to me  --  dear Anselmuccio too , And sweetest Guccio . Come , come , to my arms , Not even famine can divide us now . Embraces them . NINO . NINO Sweet father , now I love to look on thee  --  I was afraid before . But now thou smilest , And kissest us so tenderly  --  indeed I could be well content to die at once . I had a dream last night akin to death , And in that dream I was right happy too . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Come tell it , my brave son . They sit on the floor , he in the midst . NINO . NINO I was oppressed With hunger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , from Casentin 's green hills , That gently trickle down to Arno 's bed  --  Cooling their channels as they murmur on  --  Were ever present to my longing eyes . Much weeping , I suppose , brought me to sleep . When I awoke , some how as if I 'd fled , I seemed , from out this Tower . My spirit felt An airy lightness in it , as I 've thought The butterflies must feel , when they rove on From flower to flower . It seemed as if I flew ; And though I had no wings , I felt as gay , And happy , as a butterfly could do . In what fair land I was , I knew not then . The mild and beauteous orient sapphire hue , Which the serene expanse disclosed around , Far as the pure ethereal spreads to heaven , Struck my delighted eyes . The golden sun Within the glorious expanse was not ; But in his place four brilliant stars I saw . Joyous the heaven appeared with these fair lights . Wondering I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incredulous alike . Sudden a noble voice broke on my ear ; And turning round , I saw a gracious form , Announcing dignity and high command . His silvery beard was long , and white his hair . Mixed , they together venerably flowed , Adown his breast , in full and ample folds The rays of those four sacred lights of heaven , Fell with such wondrous splendour on his face , That even his aspect dazzled like the sun . Moving his venerable locks , ' Fair child , ' He said , ' the precincts of thy earthly home , By thee are past for ever , and to me Is given , to guide thee in fairer land , Where death can make no spoils . ' UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO The child ' s inspired ! NINO . NINO Now , with my guide , most reverently I bent My steps , along a pleasant mountain 's side , Laved by a tranquil and a boundless sea . And as I mused where such an ocean went , Lo now , a light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most rapid flight . Scarce was my eye an instant turned from thence , To speak my guide , when suddenly it seemed Larger , and still more brilliant than before . Something of white at length I could discern , And then methought ' t was one had wings within . My guide , who hitherto had silence kept , Knew well the galliot which now approached , And cried , ' Haste , bend down thy knees to the ground , And clasp thy hands . Lo ! here an angel comes ! God 's minister thine eyes shall now behold . See how of him are human means disdained : His bark he urges not with oars or sails , But with his outstretched pinions gains the shore . See how they ' re firmly fixed , erect towards heaven , Catching the air with his eternal plumes , That like material wings , are never changed . ' As he approached , downwards I cast my eyes , Unable to sustain the extreme of light . The seraph reached the shore . His nimble bark Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast . The heavenly pilot stood upon the poop ; His front was radiant with beatitude . More than an hundred spirits sat within . ' When Israel out of Egypt fled , ' they sang , With one full swelling melody , and poured That soul inspiring anthem to the skies . Then did the angel sign the holy cross , Whereat they instant leaped upon the shore , And he returned , like lightning , as he came . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO ' T is inspiration , rather than a dream ! NINO . NINO Sweet father , but the best of it ' s to come . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Speak on , my cloquent beloved one . NINO . NINO The gentle spirits that were thus arrived , Seemed timid as young fawns , ere they have dared , In coppice ground , to crop the rustling leaves . They looked around , and when they saw my guide , They shrunk as if they feared to give offence . Nor till they heard his mild and gracious voice , Were they assured ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood . As they approached , A strange , ungovernable , yet most sweet And happy feeling thrilled my inmost soul . A longing and a keen desire ; a new Anticipation of a thing , both good And welcome , though unknown , came o'er me . Often I 'd heard men speak of happiness , And I believed that I should know it now . I felt a love unto these gentle shades , Not like to mortal love ; and as I smiled , And looked on them , wondering , I first perceived They breathed not , neither bore their mortal flesh : And stranger still , I found ' t was so with me . Then I began to think that I was dead , And that I ne'er again should hear or see My dearest father , and my brothers here . Whilst I was musing on this wondrous change , One of the fairest spirits rushed i ' the front , Where I was with our guide , and , in his arms , Clasped me with such affectionate desire , That I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Anselmuccio , our dear brother here . Thrice with my arms I clasped the spirit round , And to my breast thrice vacant they returned  --  An airy phantom , but in aspect true . ANSELMUCCIO . ANSELMUCCIO Oh , Nino , I 'm so glad that I was there . NINO . NINO Ay , and dear Guccio , and our Gaddo too , You were all there . I know ye not at first : Spirits , as I beheld them , look so fair And bright , that my true love recognized you , More than my eyes . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO I was not there , oh God ! Agitated . GADDO . GADDO Sweet Nino , stop thy dream , behold our sire ! UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Nay , Gaddo , let me hear and know the worst . If this indeed be prophecy , as well It suits me now to think ; if I must die Eternal death , nor visit those fair shores , Where you are gathered ; then ' t would mercy be . To know the fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . Hear me , dear Gaddo , whilst my spirit ' s strong : And as my love is true to you , dear sire , So shall I truly now relate my dream . Onwards we went , until our guide exclaimed . ' Behold , fair spirits , how the day declines ! And as by night we may not climb the mount , ' T is well to find some pleasant place of rest . Not far upon the right , some other shades Are met ; I 'll bring you there forthwith . ' When but some little distance we had gone , I soon perceived the mountain sloped adown , As in our earthly vales the hills oft sink . ' There in the mountain 's lap , ' our guide exclaimed . ' We 'll go , and there await the new born day . ' Along the brink , a gentle winding path Led us unto the border of the place , Where died the slope midway into the vale . There on the verdant earth , reclined , I saw The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salve Regina , ' pouring to the skies . And as I gazed intent , the sainted host , Of grave and reverend persons seemed composed . And then my thoughts , dear father , turned to you ; But not in sorrow ; sorrow is unknown Beyond the grave  --  save where ' t is nought but woe . This from our guide I learnt , who said , ' Behold The vale of penitents , and this the mount Of Purgatory , where are cleansed the souls Of those , who , deeply stained with mortal guilt , Yet died , invoking blessed Jesu 's name . Amongst the pilgrim penitents ye see , Is one , who , when ye 've gained the mountain 's top , Shall enter with you into endless joy  --  But not till then . The parent and the child , Where they forever meet , is Paradise , And at its gates you 'll meet your noble sire . ' UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Nay , then , man 's wrath is harmless , let it fall  --  And welcome death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with you , my lovely ones , in realms Where sin , and guilt , and mortal pain ' s unknown : Living like little children , in the smiles Of one approving common parent , God  --  Can I look forward to such bliss ? Alas ! Sweet Nino , much thy dream doth move me  --  Still ' T is but a dream . And did it end here , child ? NINO . NINO And now the solemn strain at length was hushed ; When of the shades , I one observed , arise And wave his hand , for silence , to the rest . Both palms he closed , and raised towards the east , And both his eyes intently fixed that way . ' Te lucis ante , ' it devoutly sang , With such transporting tones , my soul was thrilled  --  The rest devoutly raised their eyes to heaven , And with soft voices , and with pious warmth , Did follow it throughout the sacred hymn . The chant being done , the saintly host still kept Their eyes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverent expectation filled . When issuing from the skies and darting down , Two angels I beheld , bearing along Two flaming swords . Most radiant were their brows  --  Green were their garments , like to budding leaves , Borne up by wings of verdant plumes , that fanned , And trained their vestments in the air behind . Adown their heads bright golden tresses fell ; But on the splendour of each glorious face , Vain ' t were to look . In a defenceless part Of this small vale , an evil serpent came , Gliding along , amidst the herbs and flowers , Of that fair lawn . But though I saw them not , The bright celestial falcons darted off ; For well I knew that they were sudden gone , Feeling the air cleft by their verdant wings . The serpent fled , and soon in rapid flight , The guardians both returned , and took their post . And now the deepest shades of night came on ; When the dead silence that prevailed was broke , By sounds , that gently crept upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose To harmonies so blissful , and so keen , My raptured senses could no longer hold , And as I struggled with them , I awoke . UGOLINO UGOLINO rises . It is most wonderful ! that such a child Could think or speak such things : and in a strain More suiting prophecy by one inspired , Than such a youngling . I have sneered at priests , Who call themselves the ministers of heaven ; And suffered their foul vices to entrap My soul , into a fatal negligence Of him who made it . Now , he speaks to me ; Not through the carnal instrument that man Hath wrought into an idol , and hath placed , Most wrongfully , betwixt him and his God  --  As if ' t were better trusting priests , who are made Of mortal weaknesses like us , than trust Our hearts , as true interpreters with him  --  Now , at the moment when my soul ' s at stake , The voice of God comes to me , through a babe That knows no guile , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shipwrecked soul . My life hath not been just  --  deep am I stained , With guilt that mad ambition wrought me to . The lust of power hath seen me trample on Fair rights too often , that a juster sword Would have protected  --  and power should be just , Or else it wars against both God and man . He who prefers the enjoyment of an hour Purchased by wrongs , and unatoned in heart , Pays in eternity . It is God 's law . Eternity ! thou awful word ! How vain The attempt , to poise the world and all its pomps , In the great balance with eternity , How few have meted out a just regard To both  --  making the first , a worthy scale , To climb unto the crowning point of all . May God be gracious to me , and to mine ! I was a blind  --  and he hath oped my eyes . Farewell , false world ! farewell to all its lures ! And farewell , pride of house , and ancient name ! For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blights in general death . Farewell , last weakness of my heart , revenge ! I 'm brought to bay at last , but by my sins  --  Which if I dare to look on , it is God , Who through this babe doth comfort me in it . ANSELMUCCIO . ANSELMUCCIO Were there no little angels in thy dream , Dear Nino ? thou knowest that in pictures , We have often seen the smiling cherubs , With their beauteous wings  --  tell me , dear Nino . Nino swoons . Are children ever angels , father ? UGOLINO UGOLINO moved . Yes , My beloved , you will all be angels . ANSELMUCCIO . ANSELMUCCIO What , shall we die before we ' re grown to men ? UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Oh gracious heaven , strengthen me , I pray ! ANSELMUCCIO . ANSELMUCCIO See , father , Nino does not speak . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO My child ! He faints  --  Help here  --  Alas ! there is no help ! GADDO . GADDO He breathes , and opes his eyes again  --  NINO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? ' T was but just now I had that music in my ears once more . And now it comes upon me louder still  --  Oh heavens ! oh rapture ! father ! brothers ! hear ! I fly  --  oh follow me  --  oh follow me . Dies . They kneel around him , and the curtain drops . ACT V. SCENE I. View of Pisa . Battistery , Leaning Tower , &c.; &c.; Giannotta 's cottage , at some distance , in the view . Enter Buffalmacco . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Now where the deuce does this widow of Ephesus live ? She said it was near the Gualandi Tower  --  but the word ' near ' is pretty much like the word ' dear , '  --  it does n't always mean the same thing . A man sometimes says to his wife , ' My dear , I wish you would n't make such a noise ! ' which means , ' Curse you , mistress ! what do you make such a noise for ? ' And , again , when he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've got no money to pay them ! ' he means , ' You ' re such a dear wife , you cost me so much , that , oh dear , I 'll be cursed if I 've got any money ! ' And so it is with that little match to it ' near . ' When Padre Donato got the mulligrubs with eating his own ram cat , that my pious godson was kind enough to skin for him ; father Clistero , the convent apothecary , told me he was very near going to heaven . Now I wonder how far it is from their convent to heaven , and how long a reasonably slow friar may be on the journey ; particularly if he has got the strongest ram cat in Pisa in his paunch , excepting always himself . I should say if such a saint as Padre Donato was so very near to heaven , such a sinner as myself is in great danger of falling into it every instant of his life . Why this is the most dangerous world I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find this cottage . Here ' s a hundred of them . Some a mile off , and some here and some there . I shall never find it unless I go and ask , that is most certain  --  for I suppose the last miracle San Ranieri will perform this season , will be to send the cottage to find me . A plague on the blubbering widow and her illeg. oldado husband ! I 'll go back and finish my picture of Saint Satanasio , in the Archbishop 's robes . Here comes that blessed imp of deformity , Pippo . Enter Pippo . PIPPO PIPPO touching his cap . Buon giorno , Messer Buffalmacco  --  Padrone . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Good day , Pippo , good day Pippo going . Here , Pippo , are you going to market , Signor Pippo seriously ? PIPPO . PIPPO Oh , Messer , I 've got nothing to sell  --  I wish I had  --  if it was only a cat  --  I could soon get it off . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Ca n't you try to get that off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anima bouza ... BUFFALMACCO BUFFALMACCO taking him by the arm . Here , Pippo , stop , man , there  --  there 's a piece of money for you , to make us friends . PIPPO . PIPPO Thank you , Messer Buffalmacco , thank you . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Did you keep those secrets I told you ? PIPPO . PIPPO Oh Messer ! you was n't in earnest about the Doge , was you ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Oh yes , I was . I was in earnest . I would n't tell a lie about the Doge  --  he 's the only honest man in Genoa  --  his fingers you know are so short that he ca n't steal . PIPPO . PIPPO That 's true , cospetto ! BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO You would n't like to have such short fingers , Pippo ? PIPPO . PIPPO Messer Buffalmacco ! do you know who lives there pointing to a cottage ? Do n't you remember Monna Notta , that was crying about her husband Francesco ? Monna Notta lives there . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Why this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a vengeance to me . I must remember the saint for this civility . PIPPO PIPPO Messer Buffalmacco ! would you like to know a secret ? It has got no short fingers to it , though the Bargello 's claws will be in it to night . I was going this morning to tell Monna Notta that I could n't hear any news about her husband . So I went quietly up to the door , thinking I would surprise her , and looking in at the key hole , I saw a long legged woman sitting near the fire . I thought it was Monna Paula first  --  but it was n't her . Why , lord , she had a voice more like a clap of thunder than Monna Paula 's . And then she called Monna Notta  --  ' dear Giannotta , ' and then there were so many ' dear Giannottas , ' and I do n't know what else , that at last I found it out  --  It was a man ! BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Well done , my weeping widow bewitched ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Messer Buffalmacco , after all ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Why , Pippo , thou hast puzzled me at last . I can not tell . PIPPO . PIPPO No more can I , if I would be saved . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Why , does n't thou know who it was ? PIPPO . PIPPO No more than you know how many friars the devil turns out of his kitchen . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Thou varlet , thou art paying me off then ! PIPPO . PIPPO No , Messer , Tonetto ' s the devil 's paymaster . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Why , thou ... PIPPO . PIPPO Come , Messer , let 's be quits now . And so I crept away again from the door . And as I was going down one of the little streets that lead out into Lung ' Arno , I met Pontani , the Bargello ; and he began talking to me and talking to me  --  and if I knew this man and if I knew that man ; and so I told him what I had seen ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told me to come here and watch the man  --  woman ; and that he would meet me here at dark  --  and that 's just what brought me here , Messer Buffalmacco . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO And so thou hast taken up an honourable employment : ruffiano to the Bargello , eh ? PIPPO . PIPPO Curse the Bargello ! I hate the Bargello and all the sbirri , they ' re always gibing at me  --  but he promised to give me some more money . BUFFALMACCO BUFFALMACCO aside . All alike , all alike  --  Humps , and no humps , Money ! that 's the tune to dance to . Curse the Bargello and the sbirri , I say too ! Blood thirsty hounds ! I ca n't believe this widow is a wanton  --  She is too old . I promised to serve her , and I may serve her for aught I know , more than I am aware of . This imp ' s as wicked as hell , and the Bargello ' s as cunning as the devil , and it ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter of an hour , as well as at sunset . I 'll go and warn her . But how shall I get rid of this essence of ungodliness ? Here , Pippo  --  here ' s a pezzetto that I 'll give thee if thou'lt go an errand for me . PIPPO . PIPPO That I will , Messer . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Run to the convent of the Carmelites , and tell Padne Ghiottone , the prior , that Buffalmacco will sup with them to night , if they will put off supper an hour . And then stop at my house till I come , and I 'll give thee the pezzetto . Exit Pippo . It will almost kill the Carmelites to put their supper off an hour  --  but they will do any thing for my company . I owe them one , and I may as well pay it to them now as another time  --  The last time I was there , they let me go home alone , at three o'clock in the morning , and in the dark , without compass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . Ghiottone wanted to excuse himself the next day , by saying that it ' s against the rules for the convent to go out when it is drunk . They shall wait , and I wont go near them . I 'll deny the whole matter , and so Pippo 's shoulders will get a glorious benediction the next time he goes into that holy larder . SCENE II . Inside of Giannotta 's Cottage . Giannotta spinning . GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta Oh dear , what a miserable woman I am  --  there 's something terrible hanging about my spirits , but what is going to happen I can not tell . I have heard them often say , that misfortunes are felt before they befall us , as though there was some good or evil spirit about us that saw into future things . And that well may be  --  and be a good spirit too . I remember how unhappy I was , just before I heard of the defeat of our fleet , when poor Francesco was made a prisoner  --  but then I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I have been very unhappy ever since I have had to conceal ... But hush , I must not trust even my lips with that  --  And then hearing nothing of Francesco when the Ambassadors came . Besides the horrid noises that I have heard coming from the Gualandi Tower  --  such bellowings  --  such screams  --  I could not sleep o ' nights . Marry ! give orders for nobody to go near the Tower ! I wonder who  --  Count Gualandi thinks  --  would go near it , when such a wicked tyrant as , they say , Count Ugolino is , is shut up there , and keeps frightening the whole country , as he does , with his horrible shouts . I did n't hear them last night though . I would n't live here , and be obliged to hear such screamings day and night as I have heard , for all the wealth in Pisa . Of all the things on earth , what frightens me most , is a human voice , when I do n't know where it comes from . BUFFALMACCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monna Notta ! Giannotta shrieks and falls on the floor . Enter Guido , Bartoli , Monzano , with swords drawn , from an inner apartment . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Speak , dame , what has alarmed you ? GIANNOTTA . Madonna Giannotta Oh , sir , Count Ugolino ... BARTOLI . BARTOLI What of the Count ? speak , instantly ... GIANNOTTA Madonna Giannotta to Guido . You know what horrid noises , sir , have come from the Gualandi Tower both night and day ; and as I live , ' t was but this instant the Count pushed the casement open , and called out in his horrid voice , ' Monna Notta : ' so I thought I should have died , and then I screamed and fell . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO There 's something in this  --  the casement is open as she has said . They rush out of the door and re-enter with Buffalmacco . GUIDO GUIDO DI MONTEFELTRO to Bartoli . Is this some spy ? BARTOLI . BARTOLI Why this is Messer Buffalmacco , sirs . GUIDO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Not set the spy on you , Madonna ; for your manner of taking a gentleman by the threat will betray you before I shall . Oh Lord ! I wish you had such short fingers as the doge of Genoa feeling his throat . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO What does he mean ? Speak , sir , to the purpose ! If yours is an honest one , let us have it . If not , you ne'er shall quit this place alive . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Alive , Sir ! I hope to be alive a long while  --  and to see you in honour , in any place where you may deserve to be . Count Bartoli , and noble Monzano , I bespeak me your good offices . That lady has mistaken my throat for original sin . She could n't have squeezed it harder , if she had had it all in her hand . Ugh  --  Agh grinning . MONZANO . MONZANO Speak , Buffalmacco , trifle not with us , I pray thee  --  thou knowest not what impends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing Signor Troppo here , I must amend my fault and quickly too . I knew not ye were here , but I learnt a while ago , that the imp Pippo had informed the Bargello all listen with interest he had seen a man in woman 's disguise , in Monna Notta 's house , and that the Bargello had sent him to watch , until he should meet him here at dark . I had put some jokes on poor Monna Notta , and I thought to make my peace , by telling her how near the Bargello wanted to be with Messer Francesco 's wife  --  and that is e'en all Buffalmacco ' s got to say . MONZANO . MONZANO Now , Buffalmacco , we will trust thee . Here  --  Take this gentleman , so in disguise , home To thy house , and keep him there awhile . Soon We will relieve thee of thy charge . And then , I promise thee a gentleman 's reward . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Lord , sir , then put him in a litter , and say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he had not grasped me so by the throat , I should say he had more of the gentleman than the lady in him , and so would every body else . Why he strides like all the knights of the Round Table ! I would as soon undertake to walk down the Lung ' Arno alongside of him , and call him Madonna , as I would to walk up it with a comet in my hand . BARTOLI . BARTOLI Hast thou some better thought ? What dost thou say ? BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO If ' t is some pressing matter , sir  --  some pretty homicide or so  --  why , he can take sanctuary , you know . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Nay , I will rather go with thee . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Then may fortune be propitious to us both . But first let Monna Notta make you a little more like the feminine gender . Come , Monna , make haste  --  I never knew a Bargello later than his time . Whilst they are dressing him , the Bargello 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was n't the devil 's own dear self , it was Pontani  --  How to escape . Goes to the door . The sbirri burst open the door and fill the apartment . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Betrayed ! but thou shalt taste my arm again ! PONTANI . PONTANI ' T is him . I know him now . Nay , gentlemen , lay down your arms . I have the prince 's warrant to arrest all of whatever degree , found in this gallant 's company , and if resistance should be made , to deal with you to death  --  so choose . BARTOLI . BARTOLI Show me that warrant first . PONTANI . PONTANI Here it is . BARTOLI . BARTOLI Take my sword . To resist were vain  --  and mad where no crime is . Surrender their swords . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Ah Pontani  --  Buon giorno , Pontani  --  always in active service , Pontani . The prince has an active officer in you , Pontani  --  What is ' t o'clock ? I was going to sup at the Carmelites ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . I like to be punctual at supper , especially where friars are  --  I hate to say an anchorite 's grace , ' God bless the bones . ' Addio trying to get off . PONTANI . PONTANI Signor Buffalmacco  --  you were kind enough to say the prince had an active officer in me . The friars will wait supper for you nodding significantly . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Oh no , depend upon it , they never ... PONTANI . PONTANI I met Pippo  --  he told me you had sent him off my watch , with a message to the friars to wait an hour  --  and so I fancy you will have a full good hour to spare . In the mean time , we will take a walk to town if you please . You can walk between these two gentlemen . Two sbirri take him by the collar . BUFFALMACCO BUFFALMACCO to the sbirri . Have you got long or short fingers ? I wonder if Pippo aside told them how I love them  --  I dare say he did . Oh that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , Pontani , wont you take the cat there ? PONTANI . PONTANI No , Messer . I 'm too good a housekeeper for that . When the cat ' s away , the mice will play . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Ha , ha , ha . That 's a good joke , Pontani . Ha , ha , ho , you blood-thirsty scoundrel , you aside . Exeunt . SCENE III . The Council Room . Enter Archbishop , Anselmo , and others of the Council . ARCHBISHOP .

Now comes the pressure , sirs . Where are the golden keys to unlock these chains ? These are no trifling treasures we must have . We have to deal with keen and wary men . These merchant lords in Genoa must have All courtesies due to a princely state , And gains to keep it up . Honour by them Is only honoured , when the pay is prompt , And when the gold is pure . He that pays true , And largely too  --  he is an honoured man . ' T is merchant law . Therefore we must be prompt , Nay prodigal , if we would move these lords Of trafficking , to such compassion , sirs , As may release our countrymen from chains . These then are our poor thoughts . Now it is meet , The council do determine straight , to keep , Or not , this ancient jewel of the state . Sismondi , Pandolfini , gentle sirs , Possess us of your minds in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , sir , somewhat stirred , too , This matter in our thoughts . Since it appears The general voice  --  and sanctioned by your grace  --  The captive citizens consenting too , That it were best to pay the ransom down In gold , and keep that ancient monument Raised by the valour of our fathers  --  We Join in that general voice . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Noble sirs , The care that rests upon us now , is where To draw , and promptly too , these baser means That we must now employ . Our citizens Are poor  --  our nobles have been drained too much In these late wars . But we must wring again From our reluctant purses what is left , For such a cause as this . ANSELMO . ANSELMO A princely sum It was , we set apart , for this same need , When , as ambassadors , these noble lords Were sent ; and that will somewhat help to bear This greater burden that we now must take . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI ' Twill not bear much . The urgencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home Have drained that too . ANSELMO . ANSELMO What ! all that gone , all drained ? Nay , then , we want no drains abroad  --  if drains At home can carry off so fast . Ere long We shall be dry enough . If thus we drain , We shall want Castro , Pisa too to boot , To ransom us from beggary . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI You use But little reverence to us , sir . The prince Knows best the urgent cravings of the state , And you impugn his wisdom much , when thus ... Enter an Officer . OFFICER . OFFICER My Lord , something of moment to your grace 's Private ear . Converse apart . Exit Officer . Archbishop resumes his seat ; and after a while , ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Sirs , there is treachery abroad . We long Have known it . But the traitors were not known , At least not all . And which of ye dare swear , He is not in this treason to the state . ALL rising . I. ARCHBISHOP RUGGIERI to Anselmo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword shall vouch for me ! ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI ' T is well . The Count Monzano is not here , Nor the Count Bartoli . ANSELMO . ANSELMO I 'll swear for them ! ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI You may do rashly , sir . Look to yourself . Ye may remember , an unknown was met Some days gone by  --  quite early in the morn , And he was deemed a brawler . For ourselves , ' T was not our thought ; but yet we favoured it , To lull him , and his friends too looking at Anselmo , ay , his friends , To some security . For he has friends And careful ones ; since he has ' scaped our keen , And constant vigilance till now . He 's ta'en , Ay , and how ta'en ?  --  disguised with female gear , As it would seem . Who has disguised him ? What ! Are you silent , sir to Anselmo ? Can you not answer For those friends that you can swear for ? I say , This spy , basely disguised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those very friends That you will swear for : Bartoli , Monzano : ay , sir , traitors both . Now swear , That thou art not a traitor too ! What ho ! Enter an Officer . Bid the Bargello bring his prisoners in . And hear  --  Let Lambruschini bring a guard Forthwith . I 'll nip this ere the canker runs Ahead . Enter Pontani with his Prisoners , and the Captain of the Guard with Soldiers . MONZANO . MONZANO My lord ... ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Peace , villain , I will hear thee not . Where is this dainty gallant ? Guido brought forward . Quick , tear off This vile disguising . Thou wilt want ere long Thy manliness  --  to look on death perhaps . GUIDO GUIDO DI MONTEFELTRO drawing a dagger Touch me not ! ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI What is thy name , thine errand ? Speak , or torture shall speak for thee . What  --  dumb ? Wilt thou not speak ? We have a way to teach Such sullen traitors as thou seemest to be . Guido gives him scornful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pontani  --  quick  --  Put him to the rack . Then  --  When thou'st got his name  --  rack him again ,  --  ay , ' Till those scornful looks are humbled  --  then bring The audacious varlet here once more . BARTOLI BARTOLI to the Archbishop . My lord ... ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Peace , traitor , ' twill be thy turn next . GUIDO GUIDO DI MONTEFELTRO throwing off his disguise . My name ! Guido of Montefeltro is my name . All start and rise . ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Perdition aside ! GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Wilt thou rack me now ? ARCHBISHOP . RUGGIERI Guido aside ! To Guido . Can Montefeltro stoop to base disguise  --  Can Montefeltro , like a prowler , come At night within our walls ? Whoe'er he is That thus can stoop  --  he is not Pisa 's friend  --  If not a friend  --  ' t is as a foe he comes . To Lambruschini . Be it your charge to guard this prisoner , In honour  --  till we resolve his fate . GUIDO GUIDO DI MONTEFELTRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have asked mine errand , Why I come . Noble Sismondi , please ye Impart it to these gentlemen . SISMONDI SISMONDI to the Archbishop . My lord , It is a rescript by the emperor signed , Attested too by all the Ghibelline chiefs , Wherein unto the Pisan government Most fully is Count Guido named . ANSELMO . ANSELMO Then thus , Archbishop Ruggieri , I do give Thee thanks for all the traitors thou hast called Me here ; and do arrest thee as the worst Of traitors  --  One who hast tampered foully For the lives of the state 's truest friends , And liberties of all . Most noble sir to Guido , This charge I shall make good . And now , welcome , Most welcome , noble Montefeltro ; all Can join in this acclaim to Italy 's Most cherished son , and our deliverer now . ALL . ALL Viva  --  viva  --  viva , Montefeltro ! GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Bear him hence , and guard him well . Now let us , Noble gentlemen , give ye our thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let gentle mercy have her share Of this contentment . Count Gualandi , you Have been the rigorous jailer , well I know , Of Ugolino and his children . Now Render up your keys , and let us gladden The wearied prisoners of that sad Tower . GUALANDI GUALANDI agitated . The Archbishop  --  his ... imperious commands  --  Oh deep remorse  --  and vain , alas , I fear . aside ! Fly , gentlemen  --  they 've had  --  no food  --  no food  --  For many days . Presses his hands to his face . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Great heaven ! oh haste , bring food : Come , sir , and guide us to this wretched place . Exeunt . Manent Buffalmacco and Pontani . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Pontani , do you think I shall be too late to sup with the friars to-night ? PONTANI . PONTANI Why , Messer , I think you had better make haste and go . You know you told me the friars were bad waiters at supper . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO That 's your advice , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO You do nt think of going there yourself , do you ? PONTANI . PONTANI To the Carmelites ' ! not I indeed  --  I 'm a married man  --  and have too much regard for my character to be seen in such company . BUFFALMACCO . BUFFALMACCO Then , Signor Pontani , to come to the point  --  do you think I had better go by myself  --  all alone  --  without any further ceremonies  --  no gentlemen ushers on each side , eh ? PONTANI . PONTANI Ah , ah , Master Buffalmacco  --  I understand you . Oh , you are quite your own Master  --  Times are changed  --  It ' s your bull ' s broke into the pasture now . BUFFALMACCO BUFFALMACCO strutting . I say , Pontani , you  --  Bargello  --  you . The prince has an active officer in you . You catch tartars , do nt you , sometimes ? They say the Prince , not Prince Passato , Prince Presente I mean , gave you and four of your men the most ungracious benedictions you ever got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time he saw you , I am afraid when he comes to think what an active officer you have been ... PONTANI . PONTANI Never fear for me , Messer Buffalmacco . The Count is a noble and a stout gentleman , and as you say , rubbing his arms when he is in a pious humour , and takes it in his head to give benedictions , he beats all the Archbishops I ever knew . But he knows how to reward those who are faithful to their trust . Besides , the Bargello and the hangman are your true pillars of the state  --  for they never go out of office . So when ever your turn comes again , you 'll always find your friend Pontani ready to serve you . Exit . BUFFALMACCO BUFFALMACCO looking after him . If ever I eat a ram cat , and am near going to heaven  --  the last thing I should like to say , would be , ' Curse the Bargello and all the sbirri . ' Exit . SCENE IV . Gualandi Tower . Ugolino seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children drawn up around him  --  blind and deranged . Enter Guido of Montefeltro and the rest . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Now may the blessed virgin hover us ! Oh , sirs , what a most wretched sight is this ! The noble Ugolino , as I live . Look on him . ANSELMO . ANSELMO God be merciful to them , That have wrought this . This doth exceed all guilt . MONZANO . MONZANO Why this is more than murder  --  this is death Beyond the compassing of man . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Hist , sirs . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO I thought I heard a voice . It was the wind , That whistles through the boughs , breathing a dirge Like sadness ' mongst their fluttering playmates ; Warning them of their fall . Autumn does this To all  --  ay , to the stoutest pine that stands ! I 've often heard that music in the woods Creeping along my ear , when I was young . It smelt of rosemary and death ! Yes , that Was in a wood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for their leaves Are evergreen , and cling to life . The oak Holds out  --  he moans not  --  ' till some pinching frost Sets him a clattering too , and then he gives The earth his spoils . So with the mortal seed Of Adam 's race ; it falls to the ground  --  Death Gathers all . MONZANO . MONZANO He looks on us , yet sees not . GUIDO GUIDO DI MONTEFELTRO putting his hands before Ugolino 's eyes . His sense of sight is gone , and much I fear His noble mind hath sunk before this storm . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Storm ! Why winter ' s coming ! to be merry , It brings storms along with it . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Noble sir ! Count Ugolino ! be entreated  --  pray  --  You are surrounded here with friends  --  kind friends  --  Here is food , sir . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Ah , that is a man 's voice  --  ' T is not the melancholy wind I heard just now . Friends , sir ! Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long since I have seen my friends ! Are they all well , sir ? I am benighted In a fearful wood , and how I got here  --  Indeed  --  excuse me  --  for I dare not look Back to the manner of it . Long ere this I would have travelled on  --  but it grew dark , And I have taken root here in the soil . I was o'ertaken by a whirlwind . Sir , Have you not heard , when from the torrid climes , The furious and remorseless winds invade Our woods , rending their blossomed branches  --  how They make the dusty welkin roar again , And beasts and shepherds scour before the storm ? Just such a storm came maddening over me  --  I could not scour and fly as they did , My roots were fixed too deep . And so it stripped My trunk of all its branches . Here they lie , Scattered around me . I had four branches , That were pleasing to behold . Now the stem , Like many a barkless and moss covered shaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next blast shall tear up roots and all . It can be lopped no more . ' T was pleasant though To hear the babbling of the little leaves , That every breeze of life would rustle so ! But they are quiet now  --  old age wants quiet . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO He must be gently raised  --  Bring here a chair And give him food forthwith . Nay , noble sir ! ANSELMO . ANSELMO Come , noble Count , we are your friends  --  we bring you food . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Stop  --  I hear a noise . Why , then , shame To make such noises , when an old man dies . But still they make it . Oh ! I have it now  --  They ' re barring up the outward gate of the Tower . Now we shall have him fast  --  the prelate ' s caught  --  He wanted gold laughs , and gets an old man 's bones . He said they should be blenched  --  that takes some time . He must be paid for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a child  --  and then It must be watched too , else it runs away . You ' ve got more gold than you can carry , sir  --  Are you going home with some , to make you glad , And your fair friends  --  or do you spend your life , Here in the wilderness to watch it all ? There were some thrift in that ! Pray , sir , take mine , And watch it too ! I am provided for ! But you must never sleep  --  not even wink  --  You must be jealous of your charge  --  nor let Your nerves be touched with charity . My word , She ' ll put you off your guard  --  and you may lose A ducat . You will want no sleep  --  for gold Is all a dream itself  --  and oft men wake From it , to wish their souls asleep for aye . Shivers I 'd think a thousand ducats poorly paid For a good garment , sir  --  it is so cold  --  So cold  --  so  --  where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re here , I know them  --  This is Nino laughing , I know him  --  How the black flies are gathering round him ! Tenderly Every thing hath loved him ! and now the flies Will kiss him up , if I do n't brush them off . Mutters Well , well , and what of that  --  they died so quick  --  I had not time to bury them , in sooth . He was the dreamer  --  When will this dream end ? I sometimes think that I am in my sleep , And I were proner still to think it so , Could I but waken up one blessed hour , To know all this was but a mockery  --  Nay , dreaming , could I dream it but a dream . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO There  --  gently they lift him up . Now the food  --  his strength is gone . Alas ! he can not swallow it . Some wine  --  He swallows that : give him some more  --  he faints  --  Give him some air  --  fan him  --  thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he dies  --  Heaven rest his soul . GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Not so  --  It is the unwonted food hath overcome , For some few moments , that most slender thread , His life is held by . Bear those bodies hence  --  Stop  --  he revives . UGOLINO UGOLINO gazing . I am lost in wonder  --  Is this a dream , or do I wake from dreams ? GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO This is reality , most noble Count ! We are your friends  --  we bring you food , fair sir , And honourable liberty . The wretch That gave you to these bonds , is now in chains Himself  --  Ruggieri 's tyranny is o'er  --  Come , gentle sir , now take some food . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO And to whose courtesy , are my poor thanks , Kind sir , now due ? GUIDO . GUIDO DI MONTREFELTRO Guido of Montefeltro , noble sir , Now stands before you . UGOLINO . COUNT UGOLINO Then do I think that I am waking . Count , Your generous nature doth assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Deal with my enemy , I pray , In mercy , as I trust God will with me . Nor let the manner of my death be cast Upon him altogether . It was pride , Ungovernable pride  --  and haughtiness , And rage in me , that partly drew me to it . Deal with them then , I say , in mercy , sirs . My generations die with me ! So let My wealth go back unto my country  --  thence We had it . Ransom the poor captives , now In bonds in Genoa . Ah , there they lie seeing his sons ! Often I called on them that here lay dead  --  And , being blind , did grope and feel them o'er . But I shall join them ; for I know I 'm called . A lightness grows on me  --  a thrilling sound Of distant heavenly music fills my ears  --  ' T is Nino  --  my loved Nino  --  speaks to me . Famine at length does that which grief could not . Farewell , kind sirs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angelic trumpet sounds , When I shall see the great avenging Judge , I wake no more . Dies . Curtain drops . Back matter THE END .
