txt CowPER 's genius , character , and singular history would alone account for the interest that has been felt in the particulars of his life ; but several circumstances have no doubt aided to strengthen and sustain it . A large part of his Biography being composed of his familiar letters , and even shadowed forth , not ambiguously , in his most popular poetry , an acquaintance next to personal has been established between the author and his readers . Again , the whole of his case was not laid at once before the world by his biographers ; some facts , and not the least striking , were disclosed at distant periods . If attention had drooped , it was sure to be revived by some new form of horror ; and curiosity was no doubt animated by the suspicion , that there was yet more in reserve . And further , the undisputed facts of his life have led to differing opinions , sometimes upon points , which , to say the least , are exceedingly curious , and at others upon those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are always agitating . There are questions not yet at rest concerning the religious aspects of his case ; new theories are still offered to explain the phenomena of his mental disease ; and , unnatural as it may seem in connexion with Cowper , a portion of the zeal that is now manifested in relation to him bears some marks of party feeling . Hayley , his friend and earliest biographer , was induced , by tenderness to the living and to the memory of the dead , and no doubt by a reluctance to injure the pleasing idea which the readers of his poetry had formed of the man , to withhold or touch lightly upon , the particulars of his insanity . He // called it by gentle names , or softened it by circumlocutions . The great body of Cowper 's correspondence and papers was submitted to his inspection , that he might select what he deemed illustrative of his life , character , and writings , and honorable to his memory . The rule he prescribed for himself in the use of his materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is to be seen in his writings ; but it shows tenderness to the good fame of his friend , a profound reverence for his character , and a sense of his own responsibleness in the discharge of a delicate office . " In the whole course of this work , " he says , " I have endeavoured to recollect , on every doubtful occasion , the feelings of C owper and made it a rule to reject whatever my perfect intimacy with those feelings could lead me to suppose the spirit of the departed poet might wish me to lay aside as unfit for publication . " Hayley could not see that the public had any more concern with what was going on in a madman 's cell than ordinarily in a sick man 's chamber ; or why , because Cowper was a great moral poet , it was therefore important to give a minute history of his life at a time when he was mentally and spiritually sick or dead . A mere medical report of an important case of mental disease can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the light that may be thrown on a class of maladies . But in a merely biographical view , be thought it every way advisable to give the least painful representation of the poet which he could give with honesty . Accordingly , he passed over most of the particulars of Cowper 's remarkable Narrative of his early years and first attack of madness ; his repeated attempts upon his own life ; his melancholy communications with the poor schoolmaster at Olney , to know what was the divine will and purpose concerning him : and while he intimated , more or less clearly , the visitations of insanity or depression , lie said nothing of the fact , that for nearly thirty years before his death his friend was rarely , if ever , relieved from the harrowing conviction that God had forsaken him for ever , because he had failed to offer up his life , when he knew that Heaven demanded the sacrifice , and had given him power to accomplish the act of obedience . Hence his ceasing from all " attendance upon public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " till madness in a different form tempted him to try , and try in vain , what prayer could do for him . // In a series of Letters , published by his kinsman , J. Jobnson , about twelve years since , we have Cowper 's communications to Newton respecting the horrors of his spiritual condition , and which Hayley had rejected . The " Memoir of his Early Life , " written by himself , and before referred to , had been published a few years earlier . These , with still added disclosures of a later date , have probably informed us of all that Hayley omitted , and , it may be hoped , of all the forms of mental agony which this suffering man was called to pass through . We know not that any general rule of selection and exclusion can be laid down to regulate posthumous publication . Hayley , in following a rule which he made for himself , may have been over-scrupulous ; while others , in printing every thing they could lay hands on , may be charged with rudeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must say , that we see reasons to condemn , and none to justify , the publication of a considerable part of what may be called Cowper 's secret history , or that of his insane delusions . The most obvious objections are , that it is calculated , with many other stimulating kinds of composition , to create or minister to a false appetite and taste , and to give an imperfect and false idea of the man , even though every thing put down be strict matter of fact . Of these we may speak presently . There is probably a more hidden objection , which in some minds will operate quite as powerfully as those we have stated , though it may not pass for much with others . It is , that the recent disclosures do violence to a preconceived and cherished impression of Cowper 's character ; to the impression naturally received from his poetry . When Cowper first met with an extract from Dr. Johnson 's Diary , he said to Newton , " It is certain that the publisher of it is neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author 's memory ; for , by the specimen , it seems to contain only such stuff as has a direct tendency to expose both to ridicule . " But Johnson 's memory would suffer less from such irreverent exposure than his ; for no such delightful idea of him had been received and bound to the heart , as Cowper has breathed from his rural walks , his winter evenings , his green-house , his occupations , and his friendships . It is not pretended , on any hand , that our knowledge of the mental diseases of either has lessened one jot our respect for their general intellectual vigor . But as a mere matter of sentiment , one is loth to have a sweet // remembrance poisoned , and a love almost personal , wounded . Men may call such regrets as mawkish as they are unavailing , and contend that they are selfish and hostile to truth , and that the secluded poet , whose very last thought would have been to call the public eye to his hideous griefs , was no more entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates and wrongs and contempt , all that he felt or affected , upon the general notice . Still some will feel that irreverence has been offered to a great name , and that our moral delicacy and self-respect are liable to be bluuted by the slightest indifference to the fair claims of the living or the dead , and that Cowper has so completely blended himself with his poetry , that the influence of his sentiipents , and even of his descriptions , must be lessened , if the spirit we have always associated with them is no longer there in its original beauty . But without dxvelling on this point , let it be asked , whether indeed the cause of truth ( that much abused plea for irresponsible violence ) is aided , and Cowper more truly understood , and his life a more instructive one , because we now know every particular of his malady . Is his malady a plague that has infected his whole mind , so that we must take it with us in order to interpret and modify all that he says ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double existence , - a joyous and sane mood , that was as little disturbed by his insane tendency , as it was able to control or mitigate it . The clear , and the turbid waters , ran side by side without mingling . Nothing can be more distinct , than his mind when brooding over its sufferings and recounting them , and when surrendering itself to its natural humor and sympathies . Near the very time that he was giving to one friend the most heartrending descriptions of his state , and with the same clearness and energy that marked his correspondence generally , he could write letters to others that were radiant with playfulness and wit , and full of good sense , changing their topics with the most graceful ease , and as sincere as the frolic of a child . Both these views of Cowper ought undoubtedly to be exhibited . The letters to Newton ought to be placed in their proper connexion with the gayer ones to Unwin , and Lady Hesketh , and Rose . Nobody would mistake for an instant the true state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives to invent pleasing sketches of maniacs , but to see that their facts do not induce false judgments and impressions ; to be // prudent and discriminating in selecting their materials and in the position they give to objects . In the present case , the danger is that a minute history of insanity , preying upon a delicate and gifted mind , - the image , too , perpetually , urgently brought before us in fragments of confidential letters , and in the very heart of things most foreign to it , - will give a prevailin0 hue to our conception of the whole man ; that the haunting remembrance will ever be uppermost . In a life so uniform and inactive as his , the facts of his madness will he most like stirring incident , and of course draw more attention than the ordinary habits and employments which belong to his happier state , and to far the larger portion of his existence , and which accordingly are most indicative of what he really was . It will be well then , if we do *ot fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , than actually existed in his own mind . This very Biography before us will probably leave more than the inevitable impression that Cowper was an afflicted man , with whom , however , we can for the most part sympathize in his distress as we do in his cheerfulness . There is so much of wretchedness and degradation to shock and repel , or , at best , to create a morbid interest , that the pleased and the true memory of him we once enjoyed may fade , and those who are yet to become acquainted with him may never obtain it . There will be more curiosity about his case , than perception and love of his character . " I could draw the picture of Despair , " says he , " at any time I could delineate the country through which he travels , and describe his progress , could trace him from melancholy to rage , from rage to obduracy , and from obduracy to indifference about the event ; and this I could do in prose or verse with the greatest facility but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Bedlam gate , the representation might be allowed to be just , but if it were admired , would be so only in proportion as it shocked . " Some may doubt the evil effect of such minute details as we have deprecated , because his little circle of friends lost nothing of the beauty of his life by living with him and knowing all , even to the grossest forms of his malady , and themselves his keepers in the sanctuary of his home . If the rudest assaults upon their sympathy and respect harmed not the influence of his delightful qualities , why should we of another generation be thought to lose the spell of his healthy genius and // his happy days by passing within the veil of his terrors and reading the secrets of his prison-house ? Let it he considered , however , that personal intimacy with , and care of the sufferer , while it gives a definite character to his calamity , limits its power over the imagination ; the reality is viewed and treated hy itself , and the return to health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his true state , to what we love , to what made us watch with trembling through his hours of darkness , waiting for the day . We should not for a moment recall what was past , and connect every thought of our friend with the distresses and humiliation of his disease , while we were with him in his blest seasons of light , of alleviated pain , and of the free , generous exercise of his affections and powers . Knowing and feeling the truth in its precise extent , we can not deceive ourselves , and we can not exaggerate . He was dead , and is alive again . But , on the other hand , a mere reader of his Life can not have , in equal degree , these sources of sympathy or these means of correction . He is to draw a picture for himself , of an entire stranger , by the aid of his imagination , from a history of a whole life crowded into a small space , where the good and the evil are in close connexion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtains his whole idea of him during a brief but strong exercise of this faculty , and not in the more temperate and gradual method by which the senses , however highly excited , conduct him to truth . And this idea once received , is established for ever ; for with him there can be no years of intimacy to obliterate or modify it , and there can he no personal affection to give his happy recollections the predominance ; and it is scarcely to be expected that a strong first impression will be much impaired by any subsequent reasoning upon the duty of discrimination . We are not questioning here the general utility of a sound imagination to the right conception of facts , but offering a suggestion as to the kind of influence this faculty may exercise upon a reader of the history of Cowper 's insanity . But whatever x%re the motives or the imprudence of those who have brought this history to light ; whether they sought to impair his authority on theological questions by showing that he was a madman , or to vindicate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to set his peculiar religious opinions more fully before the reader ; or // whether they acted from a questionable idea of biographical fidelity , or a desire to make his story more captivating , and to exhibit some new view of his power in his calm and vigorous and most searching descriptions of his religious frenzy ; or , idlest of all , to account for a supposed inconsistency between gloomy passages in his poems and his sprightly letters to his friends ; it is too late to enter a complaint now . Mr. Sharp says to Dr. Southey , " The painful facts are so well known , that you must fairly tell the whole story of his derangement ; " and our author has addressed himself diligently to his work . With a number of difficult questions brought before him for judgment , Dr. Southey shows patience , fairness , and sagacity in informing himself of the truth , and making up his decision . He is evidently fond of his undertaking , and aware of the singular advantages not less than of the embarrassments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a satisfactory opinion of the whole life of a man , who had been made a frequent topic of controversy , but never , it is believed , on any point connected with his genius , his moral character , his taste , or the popular influence of the books published by his own authority . The Biography is an elaborate , skilful mosaic , and more in this style than the author wished , for reasons stated in the Preface . Detached particulars are collected from Cowper 's extensive correspondence , from his private narratives and notes , from the recollections of the living , from the papers of deceased relatives , and from contemporary biographies ; and this variety of materials is wrought into a continuous narrative , requiring , no doubt , greater labor of comparison and selection than many an admiring reader will think of , and a steady activity of imagination to enable the relater of details to see and present something like a consistent whole , or preserve that natural unity which belongs to truth . While we acknowledge the skill with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care that was necessary to give it shape . Dr. Southey writes with the confidence of one who knows that he has made all safe , and yet not with the perfect ease of one who has gathered his knowledge of a man from intimacy and sympathy . He is seeking for truth in records , and not arranging the results of personal observation . He encounters difficulties which m*ist be explained , and representations and opinions of others which need correction , and hence the work often has mark . of a critical examination // instead of unembariassed narrative . Under the circumstances , all this was inevitable ; and it is only surprising that what is strictly of an argumentative or speculative character should he introduced so easily and conducted so rapidly , as rather to fall in with the narrative than appear to he added to it , and that there is so well-connected a story where there was so much to break it in pieces . We do not allude here to his setting apart certain portions of his work for the consideration of particular topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for instance , the ample notice of Churchill , and of Cowper 's companions of the Nonsense Club . These are understood to he of the nature of episodes , and to have their privilege . But it is ohservable even of these and other digressions , - where the strict biography is interrupted for the sake of critical dissertations or summaries of literature , or to place before us passages in the literary history of the period that are little known , but important in connexion with the growth of Cowper 's mind and the formation of his taste , and with his habits of life before and after he retired from the world , - that the main interest is far from being painfblly broken , and the reader returns to the story with increased light thrown upon its progress , and grateful for the author 's free use of his almost boundless information . Joined to these and other qualifications of a biographer , which place him in the first rank of this class of writers , is a calm , unaffected , transparent style , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also of his possession of his subject , and a devotion to it as sincere as if he were preparing an account of himself . It is delightful to have a memoir of Cowper from one who resembles him in purity of diction and in simple elegance . When the services of an editor and biographer , every way so competent to the business , had been secured , it would have been gratifying to add that we were at last put in possession of a complete edition of Cowper 's writings . But the embarrassment of copy-right in different hands is not yet wholly removed . The reader will learn from the Preface that Dr. Southey , while he brings valuable additions to the former collection , is debarred from inserting entire an important series of letters already published . Such a variety of topics is presented in the Life alone , that it seems advisable to set limits to the range of our remarks // and perhaps by dwelling chiefly on Cowper 's personal character and private habits , we may give a clearer idea of him in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Biography . Cowper 's natural temper was scarcely less remarkable than his genius , if indeed it can be considered as not making a part of it . A gentle , inoffensive disposition , averse to action , hut in perfect harmony with vivacity of mind and gayety of spirits , seemed for a time to promise him a happy life of literary and social leisure . In a beautiful letter to Mrs. Bodham , thanking her for the present of his mother 's picture , lie says ; " I was thought in the days of my childhood much to resemble my mother ; and in my natural temper , of which at the age of fifty-eight I must be supposed to be a competent judge , can trace both her , and my late uncle , your father . Somewhat of bis irritability ; and a little , I would hope , both of his and her I know not what to call it , without seeming to praise myself , which is not my intention , but speaking to you , I will even speak out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation to his share of the family irritability , we read in this passage , what indeed is legible in his whole life , that his amiableness was not a weak or indolent passiveness ; for he was alive to injuries , neglect , and ingratitude , and could express his resentments ; not indeed querulously , as if he thought of himself more than of the wrong , but feelingly , like a man instinctively tender of the rights of another , and duly mindful of his own . It was not in his nature however to retain ill-will , or support the bearing of a proud man who remembers a wrong for the purpose of keeping up his dignity and vindicating his rights . Thurlow and Colman might neglect him in his retirement and incur his resentment ; and his connexions , those whom lie loved dearest , might separate themselves from him , because they could not sympathize with him in his religious sentiments . But his heart yearned towards them , and lie delighted in the occasion , though at a distant day , of renewing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impaired his memory of their looks and manner , or of those trifling incidents of their intercourse , * which are generally the most strongly associated with old friendships , and most expressive of the terms on which people live . To what but the charm of his disposition can we ascrihe // the affection he inspired in minds the most various and the most diversely occupied . It was not his sufferings that first bound them to him , nor sympathy with his religious opinions and experiences , nor homage to his genius , nor a wish to he known as familiar with an eminent man . Entire strangers , men of the world , Romanists and Protestants , females of apostolic sanctity huried in the shades of a country village , and females , the wittiest and most accomplished , from the capital ; Hayley , in the splendor of his fame ; Rose , a youth just from College ; and Hill , loaded with the husiness of his office , are all drawn alike to the recluse at Olney and Weston Lodge . The spot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no noise in the journals , and probably would not now he known hut for his description of them in his familiar letters . Some of his most valued friends discovered him by accident ; and though they might well deem it the great event of their lives , they could scarcely dream that the terms on which they lived with him were to associate their names with his for ever . Before he was at all known as a writer , and when long sequestration had made him as one dead and out of mind to the intimates of his youth and early manhood , the same charm had won him friends , which secured those who visited him in the days of his far-spread fame . So far from courting attention himself , his excessive shyness made him apprehensive at the approach of a stranger , and even of his dearest friend after long separation ; and though dependent upon society , he wished it small and of the most domestic kind . But when the countenance beamed upon him or the voice was heard that harmonized with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart opened to them , and confidence was given and established . The ways in which his friends showed their devotedness are deserving of the particular notice which Dr. Southey has taken of them , for they are tokens of their character and of his ; and in many points they are illustrative of his habits , taste , and circumstances . Sometimes these offices were imprudent and exceedingly injurious , but they were not the less affectionate and well intended . We can not hut observe in almost every case how unpretending and considerate are the attentions he received . Mrs. Unwin 's maternal devotion of her life to him , and the prudence and overflowing tenderness of Lady Hesketh 's care , call for higher language . We refer to humbler // services ; to the charge taken of his little property hy an early and constant friend , while others , who had a right to confer such a favor , are engaged to make up any deficiency . A neighbour offers him the free use of his grounds for his retired walks , where none shall intrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seashore ; seeds and plants are rememhered in season for his garden ; some are urging him to write , and proposing subjects , and transcrihing his verses , and others are finding him a better residence , and furnishing his study , or tempting him to journey . Take his years of illness and health together , and his life seems to be one continued reception of kindness , and his poetry , the fruit and return of friendship . We may see in this nothing but proofs of his helplessness and their compassion . But does mere helplessness draw forth such various and cheerful service , and from strangers ? It would be wrong , however , to speak of Coxvper as a mere burden to others , or , at best , as rewarding their care with his letters only , or his muse , or his conversation . He was far from being wholly inactive , though his power was every way small to serve a friend or the people of the village . He was in no respect a selfish man , though with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose here , to name his devotion to Mrs. Unwin in the feebleness of her old age . It forms one of the most affecting passages in his own or in any life ; and to feel all its beauty and sadness , we should read every particular of their long intimacy . He had been as dependent upon her as a sick child , and had contemplated the possibility of her death with a childlike dread of desertion . And when he saw her mind , which had been his guardian and cheering light , failing , and the support and even the restraint of religious principle growing feeble with her own weakness ; when he saw her , whose charge he had been , now impatiently exacting attentions from him , which his depression at her changed state , and his common infirmities , made it next to impossible that he should render ; though himself old , he went to her with a child 's love , and in his turn ave himself wholly to her comfort . " I can not , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me , while she is in effect in solitude , silent , and looking at the fire . " His strength sunk under his care of her and the absence of his customary supports . A mournful scene follows of impotent // devotedness , and then of humiliation and misery till death . Let us return to the days of his happier intercourse with his friends . Flow unlike it is to tbe intercourse we commonly read of , between a distinguished writer and his circle of courtiers , or to what usually passes during the calls of a traveller upon a celebrated author . It was altogether domestic and affectionate , and full of simplicity and ease . There is no flattery on one side , and no imperiousness or vanity on the other . The noble and wealthy come without ostentation , and the humblest friend is never reminded of his inferiority . His letters give many beautiful pictures of his social habits and pleasures . We see in them , as if present , the manner in which he and his friends lived together . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good sense and natural variety of the letters . lie was essentially the same man in his conversation and his writings . He did not reserve a part of himself for the public ; but all that we call his genius ran easily into homely , familiar use . There is no reason to think that those who were most intimate with him were at all surprised , when , past middle life , he produced his first great poems ; so perfectly was all he wrote an image of himself as they familiarly knew him . And if we have a feeling of home in the mere readiiig of his poetry , how must they have enjoyed it , who , day after day , in summer walks or by the evening fire , lived in the presence of his purity , good humor , and beautiful fancy . His occupations , or , as he would call them , his amusements , are illustrative of his temper . We allude especially to those of the ten or twelve years after his recovery from the second and lengthened attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant exercise and employment in the open air ; and his occupations denote the simplicity of his taste , and his readiness , which he never lost hut when overpowered by disease , to do any thing that was blameless , which might give him strength and turn his thoughts from madness . He never had recourse to false stimulants , nor to the relief of sullen despair . Cut off for a season from reading and mental exertion of every kind , he was content with the care of plants and a vegetable garden , or with tan'ing hares . He says , " from thirty-three to sixty I have spent my time in the country , where my reading has been only an apology for idleness , and // where , when I had not either a magazine or a review , I was sometimes a carpenter , at others a bird-cage maker , or a gardener , or a drawer of landscapes . " No matter how little the object , if it served to amuse him . As he says in another letter ; " 1 delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am pleased with a frame of four lights , doubtful whether the few pines it contains will ever be worth a farthing ; amuse myself with a greenhouse , which Lord Bute 's gardener could take upon his back and walk away with ; and when I have paid it the accustomed visit , and watered it and given it air , I say to myself , this is not mine ; t is a playthin* lent me for the present ; I inust leave it soon. * And then what an amusing importance does he give to his turning the greenhouse into a summer retreat . " I might date my letter from the greenhouse , which we have converted into a summer parlour . The walls hung with garden mats , and the floor covered with a carpet , the sun too in a great measure excluded , by an awning of mats which forbids him to shine anywhere except upon the carpet , it affords us by far the pleasantest retreat in Olney . We eat , drink , and sleep where we always did ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find that the sound of the wind in the trees , and the singing of birds , are much more agreeable to our ears than the incessant barking of dogs and screaming of children . It is an observation that naturally occurs upon the occasion , and which many other occasions furnish an opportunity to make , that people long for what they have not , and overlook the good in their possession . This is so true in the present instance , that for years past I should have thought myself happy to enjoy a retirement even less flattering to my natural taste , than this in which I am now writing ; and have often looked wistfully at a snug cottage , which , on account of its situation at a distance from noise and disagreeable objects , seemed to promise me all I could wish or expect , so far as happiness may be said to be local ; never once adverting to this comfortable nook , which affords me all that could be found in the most sequestered hermitage , with the advantage of having all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly afford me . " It was for occupation 's sake that he betook himself to poetry . " At fifty years of age I commenced an author . It is a whim that has served me longest and best , and will probably be my last . " He delighted in the most laborious exercises of // his art , in the revision of single verses and of whole poems again and again , to make all as perfect as possible ; and when a book was once carried through the press , he felt that he had parted with a summer and winter friend , a patient soother that was ever ready at his call . The labor to which he regularly subjected himself , though probably far greater than some poets of " more mercurial powers " have endured for an equal fame , seems to us as nothing , because we regard it as the prudent remedy or solace of a diseased mind , and as a part of the arrangement of his daily life . If it answered its immediate purpose , there was time enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of the celebrity he was actually winning . The period of life , and the circumstances of Cowper 's first great poetical effort , deserve attention . At the age of thirtytwo , we find him a man of letters in London , fond of classical studies and of the society of wits , by profession a lawyer , and properly an idler. rrhus far he has published nothing that foretells the author of " John Gilpin , " " Yardley Oak , " and " The Task . " Then follow nearly two years of insanity and despondency , during far the larger part of which he was under the care of Dr. Cotton , till his recovery in 1765 . According to Dr. Southey , Cowper may be said to have been first introduced to the public as a poet by the " Olney Hymns , " which were not published till 1779 . His contributions to this collection had been made at a much earlier date , but the publication had been delayed by another access of madness , which lasted several years ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bordering on fifty , that he undertook any considerable work . It seems , that on his last recovery , Mrs. Unwin urged him to give his thoughts to poetry , and to a poem of some extent ; and proposed for a subject the Progress of Error . His mind was first directed and kindled to a great achievement , after its recovery from a longer , if not severer attack , than he ever suffered till its final obscuration ; at a time of life too when we commonly expect no new developement of power , and at the instance of the faithful woman who had been his nurse and guardian through this scene of woe . He was living in a retired spot , where the calls and influences of society could not easily reach him , and where the power of habitual indolence , and of exemption from ordinary cares , had every means of fatally establishing itself . His recovery , too , had not been // entire , for he was never wholly relieved from the delusion which took possession of his mind during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of his resources and strength , and enters upon his great poetical career . We can not receive the superstition that insanity is allied to inspiration , and thence conjecture that some mysterious accession of power was going on in this dreadful repose of the mind . All that we perceive is , that he is more judiciously treated hy his friends , and that a more happy direction is given to his faculties , than when he was wasting life in the frivolities of London , or was absorhed in his scarcely less hurtful religious excesses at Olney . His attachment to a country life was formed early . He had enjoyed the city , and lived on equal terms with many distinguished young men whom he associated with there ; and he had been driven from the town , and from all general intercourse with society , hy his calamity . But in his healthiest state , he was most in his element in a quiet seclusion . What is commonly called a life of action was not only revolting to his taste , but he probably could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its callings , hy any strength of principle or exercise of self-discipline . He says , he had never been ahle to conjecture what nature expressly designed him for , so universally disqualified did he seem to himself for the common and customary occupations and amusements of mankind ; and he was probably nearer the truth in this , than when , speaking to Rose of his own wasted years in an attorney 's office and at the Temple , he says " Had I employed my time as wisely as you , I had never been a poet perhaps , but I might by this time have acquired a character of more importance in society , arid a situation in which my friends would have been better pleased to see me . The only use I can make of myself now , at least the best , is to serve in terrorem to others , that they may escape my folly and my fate . " Men may be expected to take different views of themselves at different seasons , according to the present weight of a particular motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God had given him " an unambitious mind , content in the low vale of life , " we believe that he partly erred ; for he had ambition , and he acknowledges it as freely as in other // places he avows his apathy to fame . See what he says on this point to Lady Hesketh . " I am not ashamed to confess , that having commenced an author , I am most ahundantly desirous to succeed as such . I have ( what perhaps you little suspect me of ) in my nature an infinite share of ambition . But with it , I have , at the same time , as you well know , an equal share of diffidence . To this combination of opposite qualities it has been owing that , till lately , I stole through life without undertaking any thing , yet always wishing to distinguish myself . At last I ventured , ventured too in the only path , that at so late a period was yet open to me ; and am determined , if God have not determined otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so long my portion , into notice . Every thing , therefore , that seems to threaten this my favorite purpose with disappointment , affects me nearly . " But whenever he refers to rural life , the tone , we believe , is always the same . The contemplation is a happy one , as if he again felt his first-breathed atmosphere , and the presence of his native prospects . He was indeed scourged thither and so the tempest may drive us to port , and afflictions , to Heaven 's light . Read his beautiful confession . " The country wins me still : I never framed a wish , or formed a plan , That flattered me with hopes of earthly bliss But there I laid the scene . There early strayed My fancy , ere yet liberty of choice Had found me , or the hope of being free . My very dreams were rural ; rural too The first-horn efforts of my youthful muse . " Task , Book iv . With such love of the country , and its influence being always most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , his poetry would naturally turn much on rural topics . In addition to this , lie wanted to make the inhabitants of large towns aware of their privations and evils , and come out to inhale a purer life , in the quiet and verdure , and amidst the sounds and employments of farms and villages and woods , and the border of inland streams . His descriptions of these have been his most popular compositions ; not however because they present truer pictures of his mind , or , in general , juster views of things , than are to be found in those of // his poems which are more strictly occupied with man ; nor because there is less nerve and variety in the latter . But in describing natural scenes , he had the advantage of a subject which was likely to excite sympathy , and raise agreeable images and trains of thought in all . Even those who knew the least of the matter , had yet wants ungratified , and such as they might for the first time be made distinctly acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a poetical description of nature . And though they still lived on in crowded cities , they could dream with delight upon the new conceptions , which were thus formed in their imaginations . What would particularly recommend such topics to Cowper , was the conviction that moral and religious truths could he more powerfully urged , if they were interwoven with images , that were both in beautiful accord with them , and naturally agreeable to 211 minds . And he could anticipate their general good influence from what he knew of himself . He knew the charm which the contemplation of such scenes , and the description of familiar objects in a life of rural seclusion , could exercise over the most afflicted mind . He rested upon the pure bosom of the earth , as if it were a mother 's . From his safe retreat he saw men at a distance , and was less disturbed by their hot contentions . The strain of his poetry grew more in sympathy with the generality of readers . There was more sweetness in his devotional sentiments . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet how frequent are the intervals of serene contemplations of nature , and of the breathings of spiritual peace , as if he could not escape the soothing tone of his general subject , and wished others to feel it with him . Dr. Southey t**inks , that the humble and quiet scenery to which Cowper was accustomed , was peculiarly suited to his disposition , and to the spirit of his most characteristic poem , " The Task . " We apprehend , however , that the calm and domestic air of his finest descriptions , is owing in part to a natural turn of mind , which would have shown itself , even if he had been placed in a wild and picturesque country . He would not have sought chiefly those points in a prospect which are most apt to create wonder , but those which he could subdue to his fancy and common feelings , and which would wear best as old acquaintance . He would scarcely have busied himself with making grand pictures , merely // because the materials were ready at hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but simply because it had become a companion and image of his ordinary thoughts . And with his ingenious fancy and thoughtful humor , he would find such objects on the ocean side , or amongst mountains , as well as on " the sandy flats of Buckinghamshire . " He expresses , however , a different opinion in a letter from Eartharn ; but it was written when he was longing for the shelter of his home , and the renewal of habits that were become necessary to his happiness . " More beautiful scenery I have never beheld , nor expect to behold ; but the charms of it , uncommon as they are , have not in the least alienated my affections from Weston . The genius of that place suits me better ; it has an air of snug concealment , in which a disposition like mine feels peculiarly gratified ; whereas here , I see from every window woods like forests , and hills like mountains ; a wildness in short that increases my natural melancholy . " Cowper 's religious history and character are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dreams of madness , that the sweetness and beauty of his devotional spirit are in danger of being overlooked or indistinctly conceived . His early discovered and profound feeling of God was the terror as well as the solace of his boyhood ; and afterwards , upon the fuller developement of his constitutional tendency , it allied itself to his mental disease , to inspire him with perilous raptures , or plunge him in depths of woe to which sin alone might seem doomed . Still the devout feeling breaks forth from the clouds and fires that environ it . And how submissive s it , and filial , and dependent . God is the nearest being be knows ; the only being . To be separated from him , is to lose all good , and life would he a terror . Nature is filled with his presence ; life is his constant power ; events are his permission or command . Even behind the darkness , and when despair is on every side , God 's mysterious agency is as real to him , as when he rejoiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impair his benevolence or sense of duty ; and were it not for compassion and grief , we should feel that it gave them even a sublime character . He alone is shut out from mercy ; and , himself a castaway , he yet preaches to others , deeming it the appointment of Providence that // he should labor for them , though no longer permitted to do any thing for himself . Shall we say that he is equally insane in either conviction ? Why not rather , that faith had power to subdue selfishness , and in a degree to control madness ? He tells his friends , that he mingles pleasantry with his seriousness , that his writings may have attraction for the worldly and inconsiderate . It is more probable that the humor came naturally , and was fearlessly indulged because a consciousness of right intention , and an almost instinctive good taste , assured him that he should never fall into unseasonable levity . And if his views of human life are often dark , and his remonstrances severe , we need not ascribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brightest days . The l ) rophet of old went not with pleasant minstrelsy to his idolatrous countrymen . A mind in the highest sense spiritual , absorbed in religious feelings , and believing that men generally are content to be slaves to what is present and perishable , would be mad indeed or worse , if it feared to employ words and arguments and images that would break their slumber , however those might be offended who would not be made free . Cowper is never soured with the world , but amazed and afflicted at its blindness . It is admitted that there is often an air of exaggeration when he speaks of spiritual subjects and of sin , which is not to be observed in his descriptions of outward objects , or when he draws a moral lesson from some simple occurrences that fall under his notice . This must always be expected ( even in minds far better strung and regulated than his ) whenever they are strongly impelled by a generous purpose and an exalted feeling . The overstatement is not falsely hyperbolical ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the hounds from excessive eagerness . And it can not be denied , that in such cases the extravagance often places the truth in the only light to affect the mass ; or perhaps more properly , their minds could be animated in no other way to see , in its full force and verity , what to the more apprehensive and thoughtful writer is instantly visible in its whole importance . Cowper never exaggerates in the sense of telling what he does not feel . He has long felt it . He has dwelt upon it perhaps till his views have grown morbid . There is no mark of sudden impulse or vexation , however wrong the judgment may be . He is thoroughly sincere in the condemnation he // passes upon his own course of life in London , and in arraign-* ing a corrupt clergy , and public and private offenders of any class . It is remarkable that when relating mere matters of fact , let them be of the most exciting kind , ( for instance , in his Narrative of what occurred during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and simple and low-pitched , as if he were speaking of ordinary topics . We doubt whether many strangers could tell the story , half so deliberately and distinctly . So in the letters which describe his sufferings , a temperate tone seems to be borrowed from his very despair ; and , as if despair had made him disinterested in the contemplation of his own case , he shuns not to relate every thing , as far , at least , as language can go . He does not , however , press his griefs upon others , nor ask for sympathy , nor betray egotism , as if he were vain of his peculiar affliction . He does not return to the subject from habit , nor does the lapse of time , or frequent recurrence to it , lessen its weight and power . Year after year the description is equally fresh and vigorous , and though the language and images vary , yet the strain is always the same . Let us read one or two passages from his letters to Newton . " The weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . A thick fog envelopes every thing , and at the same time it freezes intensely . You will tell me that this cold gloom will be succeeded by a cheerful spring , and endeavour to encourage me to hope for a spiritual change resembling it ; but it will be lost labor . Nature revives again ; but a soul once slain lives no more . The hedge that has been apparently dead , is not so ; it will burst into leaf and blossom at the appointed time ; but no such time is appointed for the stake that standS in it . It is as dead as it seems , and will prove itseW no dissembler . " " I have been lately more dejected and more distressed than usual ; more harrassed by dreams in the night , and more deeply poisoned by them in the following day . I know not what is portended by an alteration for the worse , after eleven years of misery . I now see a long winter before me , and am to get through it as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is hollow , it is agitated , it suffers shocks in every direction ; it is like the soil of Calabria , all whirlpool and undulation . But I must reel through it ; at least , if I be not swallowed up by the way. ** // " My experiences have this belonging to them : that , as they are not fit for recital , being made up merely of infernal ingredients , so neither are they susceptible of it ; for I know no language in which they could be expressed . They are as truly things which it is not possible for man to utter , as those were which Paul heard and saw in the third heaven . If the ladder of Christian experience reaches , as I suppose it does , to the very presence of God , it has nevertheless its foot in the abyss . And if Paul stood , as no doubt he did , in that experience of his to which I have just alluded , on the topmost round of it , I have been standing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has passed since I descended . In such a situation of mind , encompassed by the midnight of absolute despair , and a thousand times filled with unspeakable horror , I first commenced an author . Distress drove me to it ; and the impossibility of subsisting without some employment , still recommends it . I am not indeed so perfectly hopeless , as I was ; lsut I am equally in need of an occupation , being often as much and sometimes even more worried than ever . I can not amuse myself as I once could with carpenters ' or with gardeners ' tools , or with squirrels and Guinea-pigs . At that time I was a child . But since it has pleased God , whatever else he withholds , to restore to me a man 's mind , I have put away childish things . Thus far , therefore , it is plain that I have not chosen or prescribed to niyself my own way , but have been providentially led to it ; perhaps L might say with equal propriety , compelled and scourged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or were I permitted to make it even now , those hours which I spend in poetry I would spend with God . " One important and regular occupntion of Cowper 's better years , was letter-writing ; genuine letter-writing too , of the most familiar kind , in a correspondence with the nearest friends , and growing out of present occurrences , impressions , and exigencies . The Letters may be considered in several* points of view . In the first place , they give us the best possible account of the writer . They take up nearly all the ground of an avowed Biographer , with the advantage of not doing it on purpose . Where there is any perceptible chasm in the correspondence , there was also a blank , or nearly so in his mind and history . With the aid of a few notes , the Letters would leave little else to be required for a satisfactory view of his life ; such an impression is there of completeness in the information . They are full of him , either as they show // his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to day , or his opinions on recent and indeed on any topics , his estimate of literary ohligations , and of the connexion between an author and his reader ; or , in fine , as they answer almost every inquiry that could he raised from reading his works generally , from reading the letters themselves , or the accounts of him that have been furnished hy others . It may he proper to add , that to understand the value of the Letters in a biographical view , or indeed in any other , they should be read in their order and read through . Such scattered fragments as we find in the Life answer the immediate purpose very well , but give a very inadequate idea of the correspondence . The simple , the precisely stated facts of his early life are few , though no doubt as numerous as ought to be expected . But he has contrived , by his manner of referring to this period in his letters , to fill it out and make it singularly beautiful and interesting . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinite allusions , such as his old acquaintance would fully understand , are not likely to give us what we call information . Dim regrets , laughing recollections , and indications on every hand , that while he seems absolutely to live in the past , the present is still in and about him , that he is himself a changed man and yet touched as of old , and even more , by revisiting his former haunts , - all these marks of truth and helps to truth would be every thing in the eye of the friend he was writing to . But why is it that they affect us so deeply and familiarly ? Without any orderly narrative , without notes to fill up or clear up , all appears luminous , real , present , and entire . And it is all delightful , both for the truth , and the way the truth falls from him ; the broken , incidental way ; the absence of all thought of making a dream of boyhood or a choice of its beauties . His feelings illuminate his hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , we are able to interpret , to complete and make real . We too were with him at school , at the club , and in Southampton Row , and we are now talking together of our old times and former selves . But whatever be the topic , and whether of former or present days , he runs on with freedom and lightness ; there is not the least appearance of keeping a Diary or rendering an account ; and no pressure of responsibleness , not even from the // necessity of getting something ready when he has nothing to say . He takes this very easily ; far more easily than Sterne , who says that he made half a dozen different beginnings to say nothing , and could no way please himself . Cowper enters upon the vacuity in the highest spirits . The want of a topic seems to be the best state of things possible to begin a letter . He is " put to entreaty , and there begins new matter . " The whole case we are now considering is stated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me ; this is a very good reason why I should write . But I have nothing to say ; this seems equally a good reason why I should not . Yet if you had alighted from your horse at our door this morning , and at this present writing , being five o'clock in the afternoon , had found occasion to say to me , - Mr. Cowper , you have not spoke since I came in ; have you resolved never to speak again ? ' it would be but a poor reply , if in answer to the summons I should plead inability as my best and only excuse . And this by the way suggests to me a seasonable piece of instruction , and reminds me of what I am very apt to forget , when I have any epistolary business in hand , that a letter may be written upon any thing or nothing , just as that any thing or nothing happens to occur . A man that has a journey before him twenty miles in length , which he is to perform on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out or not , because he does not readily conceive how he shall ever reach the end of it ; for he knows , that by the simple operation of moving one foot forward first , and then the other , he shall be sure to accomplish it . So it is in the present case , and so it is in every similar case . A letter is written as a conversation is maintained , or a journey performed ; not by preconcerted or premeditated means , a new contrivance , or an invention never heard of before , but merely by maintaining a progress , and resolving as a postilion does , having once set out , never to stop till we reach the appointed end . If a man may talk without thinking , why niay he not write upon the same terms ? A grave gentleman of the last century , a tie-wig , square-toe , Steinkirk figure , would say , My good sir , a man has no right to do either . ' But it is to be hoped that the present century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last ; and so , good Sir Launcelot , or Sir Paul , or whatever be your name , step into your picture frame again , and look as if you thought for another century , and leave us moderns in the mean time to think when we can , and to write whether we can or not , else we might as well be dead as you are . " // Cowper makes it almost a condition of the correspondence , that he may " scribble away and write his uppermost thoughts , and those only . " But these sudden products of his mind bear marks of more than its activity . He can trifle and gossip ; and little things have their uses , if a man have the wit or philosophy to find them out . Horace Walpole raised gossip very near to the dignity of a fine art , and could set off sober wisdom the better in a crowd of vanities . With him , however , letter-writing seems to be a profession ; while with Cowper , who probably gave to it as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightness of something called forth by a pleasing accident ; and the riches and variety of his mind would have been far less known but for this sort of irresponsible exercise . And though a letter be gloomy throughout , or one of grave advice , or sympathy , or criticism , or occupied wholly with his literary engagements , the freedom and despatch are equally visible . If heavy spirits and a reluctant genius compel him to make efforts , he tells us how it is with him , or we should suspect nothing of the matter , so soon does the exertion create facility . As to literary merits , the better opinion seems to be that a letter should have none , or at least none which are susceptible of being critically defined . Walpole says , he hates what is called a good letter . Cowper observes , that West 's Letters are " elegant and sensible , but have nothing in them that is characteristic , or that discriminates them from the letters of any other young man of taste and learning . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own letters had been praised by Unwin for being " entertaining and clever , and so forth , " he makes a remonstrance which shows that he thought there must be something wrong in a letter that sought or received admiration . " I found this consequence attending , or likely to attend the eulogium you hestowed ; if my friead thought me witty before , he shall think me ten times more witty hereafter ; where I joked once , I will joke five times , and for one sensible remark 1 will send him a dozen . Now this foolish vanity would have spoiled me quite , and would have made me as disgusting a letter-writer as Pope , who seems to have thought that unless a sentence was well turned , and every period pointed with some conceit , it was not worth the carriage . Accordingly , he is to me , except in very few instances , the most disagreeable maker of epistles that ever I met with . " // To say that his letters have every property of good style which is suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style at all , might be deemed ( however near the truth ) an affected mode of expression ; so that we are tempted to specify a few particulars ; for instance , the purity of his diction , and the consummate grace and dexterity with which he uses the language . There is a music in the arrangement , which is felt as much , and observed as little , as a pleasant voice in conversation . The sentence takes its shape from the matter , and the manner varies with the topic or feeling , or the party addressed . In short , here is perfect English composition , in its kind , and a reigning harmony ; and the result is , that a body of familiar letters , in the first copy , has passed into English libraries as a monument of prose , and an established classic unequalled in its own department . It is agreeahle to know that Cowper found relief and amusement in his part of the correspondence . It was more to him than an exercise and expression of his love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may see the diversion it afforded him , in one striking characteristic of the Letters we mean the unexpected turn he gives to common things , and usually a playful one . The grotesque is delicately applied to raise and set off a very simple matter . The comic and serious are so mixed as to have the effect , with seeming* ly no purpose , of irony . He is evidently amused himself ; hut to all appearance he is entertained with something he has discovered in the thing he is describing , and not with the whimsical conceits it has suggested . It was of great moment to his happiness , that his fancy should he easily directed to objects that would make it active without producing strong emotion ; and he seems to have so trained it to his service , that he could go to it for relief in his dejection as hopefully as another might have recourse to music . In the milder states of his melancholy , his strange and diverting fancies came forth , like the day-spring , to mingle with and scatter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces under the influence of despair itself , as if it were the inspiring power , and the flashes and floods had waited till the cloud were thickest . How much of real joy there was in such a revel , is hidden . Madness , we may suppose , has many alleviations of which we know nothing ; and Dr. Southey has suggested one in the case of Cowper , which // though foreign to that we have just spoken of , may have a place here . " Our retrospect of any individual 's history is colored by the fortune of his latter days , as a drama takes its character from the catastrophe . A melancholy sentiment will always for this reason prevail , when Cowper is thought of . But though his disease of mind settled at last into the deepest shade , and ended in the very blackness of darkness , it is not less certain that before it reached that point , it allowed him many years of moral and intellectual enjoyment . They who have had most opportunity of observing and studying madness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , know that the same degree of mental suffering is not produced by imaginary causes of distress as by real ones . Violent emotions , and outbreaks of ungovernable anger are at times easily excited , but not anguish of mind , not that abiding grief which eats into the heart . The distress , even when the patient retains , like Cowper , the full use of reason upon all other points , is in this respect like that of a dream , - a dream , indeed , from which the sufferer can neither wake nor be awakened ; but it pierces no deeper , and there seems to be the same dim consciousness of its unreality . " - Vol. xi . p. 70 . We will close with one more extract from the Life , that is not without a cheering influence , though its tone is melancholy . " Happily there was nothing irksome in any of the business to which he was called . His correspondence , - except only when , upon writing to Mr. Newton , and to him alone , the consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasurable . He had his own affliction , and that was of the heaviest kind ; but from the ordinary cares and sorrows of life no man was ever more completely exempted . All his connexions were prosperous . Mr. Unwin was the only friend , whose longer life must have appeared desirable , of whom death bereaved him . From the time when in the prime of manhood he was rendered helpless , he was provided for by others ; that Providence which feeds the ravens raised up one person after another to minister unto him . Mrs. Unwin was to him as a mother ; Lady lies . keth as a sister ; and when he lost in Unwin one who had been to him as a brother , young men , as has already been seen , in the instance of Rose , supplied that loss with almost filial affection . Sad as his story is , it is not altogether mournful ; he had never to complain of injustice , nor of injuries , nor even of neglect . Man had no part in bringing on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him leave the herd ' like a stricken deer , ' it was owing that the genius which has consecrated his name , which has made him the most popular poet of his age , and secures that popularity from fading away , was developed in retirement ; it would have been blighted had he continued in the course for which he was trained up . He would not have found the way to fame , unless he had missed the way to fortune . He might have been happier in his generation ; but he could never have been so useful ; with that generation his memory would have passed away , and he would have slept with his fathers , instead of living with those who are the glory of their country and the benefactors of their kind .
