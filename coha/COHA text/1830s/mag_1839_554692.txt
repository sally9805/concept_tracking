txt WE recur to the subject of education . Indeed , we can hardly pass it by , if we would have our journal keep up with the progress , the changeful progress , of opinion ; for it is evidently about to take its turn as a prominent object of interest . The usual signs of incipient excitement are to be seen and heard . Periodical journals are devoted to it . Societies are formed ; lectures pronounced ; conventions held ; speeches made ; offices created ; and , what is perhaps in this country the surest sign of all , funds are provided . To say the whole in a few words , Education begins to promise much notoriety , and some money , to its foremost partisans ; and the obvious , inevitable consequence of this is a struggle to be foremost . Out of which there may come some evil , but there must come much good . We must have a hobby of some kind ; because , if we may judge from the past , society is so constituted here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic . The common duties , the regular ongoings of life , hi*ye not interest enough ; and , therefore , Antimasonry , Non-resistance , Bran-eating , and the like , chase each other along . But Education , when its turn comes , is not likely to excite much anger and bitterness . 8one there will be , for all our controversies are zealous , and zeal is seldom pure . Still the questions to which this subject may give rise , can hardly kindle a fire which shall burn so fiercely , that no one may pass through it , to go to his brother ; and in this respect , Education will have greatly the adv*intage of most of its predecessors . But the interest of this subject is great , is obvious , indisputable , universal ; penetrating the whole mass of society , and all its component parts ; embracing within its sphere , religion , government , letters , and all things else of mind or heart ; and reaching in its influence through an unending future . It may be hoped , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common agitation , and multitudes are active about it , it will call into its service good sense , sound principles , the energy which is not rashness , and the prudence which is neither fear nor indolence , seldom as these qualities are found in popular excitements . And hence , also , it may be hoped , that wbatever zeal be manifested in the cause of education , it will not be intemperate ; and that , in the effort to reform education and diffuse its blessings , it will not be forgotten , that all reform should be cautious and kind if it would not confirm the evils it assails , or substitute new ones for those which it removes . Any consideration of the subject in its whole length and breadth , will convince one , that , before new truths and higher principles can have an opportunity to improve the processes of education , much is to be done in making ready for them , and in securing to them the possibility of free and successful activity . For it is certain , that no improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not based upon the correction of some errors , which are , at once , very prevalent and very injurious . The work must begin with the establishment of new and better principles , as guides in all thought , feeling , and action , in relation to it . Among the very foremost of these errors , is that which regards education as occupying a secondary place , if any place , among the great objects of human interest ; as something , which , if it be let alone , or intrusted to the aids that chance puts within our reach , will take very sufficient care of itself . It is looked upon as extending its domain over a very narrow portion of life , as excellent employment for the child or the youth , when they must be doing something , but can not yet do man 's work ; and all its fruits are thought to be secured , if the boy is fitted to take his place among men when his beard is grown , without discreditable want of common acquirements and with equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say that these are the views concerning education which now prevail in society , we do not mean that this is the way in which men talk about it , but that it is the way in which most men act . And while these views , low , mean , false , as they are , prevail , a thousand practical errors spring from them and can not be corrected . Education is the perpetual law of our being ; beginning // when we begin to live , its future course is measured by our own immortality . If the duty of education falls first and chiefly upon parents , it is because they represent in this the Universal Parent ; and it is not too much to say , that his perpetual and universal Providence is always doing for all men , and all spirits , the work of education . All the circumstances which make up the feeble life of the wailing babe , are educating him ; and when the older child is brought under the discipline of a school or of his home , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work or at play , sleeping or waking , subjected to constant influences which are moulding him for manhood . And when he is " free , " his education " finished , " as is said , and a place given him among men , then is it still true that his education is growing in importance every day ; and the value of every hour , of every act and every emotion , is to be measured by its usefulness in building up within him that spiritual being , which death only liberates for future developement . And all reason and religion concur in assuring us , that progress is still the law of spiritual life , - progress from state to state ; where all that is , for ever reaps the harvest of all that was , and sows the seeds of all that will be . And therefore , whatever efforts are made in the cause of education , or in the application of its principles to individual cases , it is plain , that they can succeed only so far as they coincide with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who live , and only so far as they seek the same end which the Author of all life regards as the end of life . In other words , education can not be viewed from too high a ground , for it occupies the highest . The search which would detect its ruling laws , and learn the science which combines them into orderly arrangement , and attain to the wisdom which teaches to use this science to good purpose , can not penetrate too deeply into the mysteries of man 's constitution and destiny ; for in the inmost depths of his being these laws are at work , and at the earliest moment of his being they began their work . We have no purpose of following these views into those questions of psychology and of human destiny , which open before them . The discussion would be out of place here it would require more room than other topics could afford , and a mood of mind , a measure and a quality of attention , not precisely those , which a Review is in the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we have adverted to // these views at all , we answer , that the mere magnitude and importance of the subject lead to some results which we propose presently to consider ; and , if it were not so , something is gained whenever the views we have expressed are remembered . Something is gained , if education stands the higher in the thought and care of a single individual . We do not suppose , that in any thing we have said , we have published a discovery . Such things , in substance , must needs occur , and must always have occurred , to whoever reflects upon the gifts and the wants of his own nature ; for they can not but be suggested by the consciousness , that its wants are those of one born for a spiritual immortality , and the hope that its gifts are those which may make this an immortality of happiness . But these truths , however often , however plainly , they may have been seen , do not yet form a part of the common daylight in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them so , however feeble , is a good effort . Indeed , the world , too , has its education ; and the law of its progress in knowledge seems to require , that truths should sink down into the mass of its common thought gradually and very slowly . In this way every generation goes forward . Truths at first painfully won by laborious effort , and afterwards acknowledged or used but by a few in succeeding generations , and perhaps veiled again , for a long period , by the clouds of a dark age , yet gain , surely and constantly , and extend their influence , and entwine themselves with more and more of the interests of human life , until they are at last a common property ; truisms which none assert , because none deny or doubt them , and principles which influence the conduct of all , while they seldom come distinctly into the consciousness of any . It would not be difficult to show , even by a cursory analysis , how much , how very much , of every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have thus worked their slow way into the very heart of human belief , feeling , and life . One effect which would result from the more just appreciation of the value and importance of education , because it would necessarily follow the elevation of education in the public sentiment , is the corresponding elevation in the social position of those engaged in it . Great improvement has taken place in this particular ; but there is room for a vast // deal more . It is only of late , that the business of instruction could be regarded as a profession ; and now it holds no equal rank in the public respect , in influence , or in emolument , with those of medicine or law . In and near our great cities , there are successful teachers who earn much money , and others attached by their office to some time-honored institution ; and the position of these men may seem high enough to satisfy any reasonable ambition . It is so ; but , if we compare them with the most eminent physicians and lawyers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public repays the labors of instruction with a far inferior recompense , whether we measure it by money , by extent of reputation and influence , or by the social regard which determines the place which a man holds in society in a way that is very distinctly felt , though it can hardly be described . And if we go down the scale , the difference is still greater . In our country villages , for instance , the doctors ' and the lawyers ' houses are usually among the best , testifying , with " green blinds and brass knc.cker , " and all other things in conformity , that their owners are sufficiently " well to do " ; while , in this same village , the education of the whole generation of children may be intrusted to a boy , who spends there a college vacation , lengthened by a few weeks ' " leave of absence , " whose pay is that of a good farm laborer , and whose food is such as he may get from those who find it convenient to pay their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board it out . " This picture , it is true , represents the state of things a few years since , rather than now . But the change , though great , is not entire , for in many places things remain much as they were ; and the change is nowhere great enough . Happily , there is no precedent among us of any thing quite so bad as the condition described in the well-known anecdote of Stouber , the predecessor of Oberlin . Upon his arrival at Walbach , he asked to see the school-house . He was conducted to a poor cottage , where he saw a crowd of children , doing nothing . He inquired for the master , and found him a feeble old man , lying on a bed in a corner . " What do you teach , " said he . " Nothing , " was the answer . " How happens that ? " " I know nothing . " " What are you here for , then ? " " Because I had grown too old and too weak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they put a younger and abler man // in my place , and sent me here to take care of the children ! " Mr. Goodrich , in the work before us , alludes to this story , and remarks , that it evinces a degree of stupidity not to be met with in this country ; but , he adds , with great justice , that , " even here , there is a popular and prevalent notion , that anybody can be a schoolmaster . " We would have the labors of education more highly estimated and better recompensed , not for the sake of those who are engaged in them , but for the sake of the public , and for the good of the whole community . There are no interests , and , while civilization remains , there can be no interests in human life , with which education is not directly involved . Indeed , it is capable of demonstration , if it be not rather too obvious to be stated , that there are none of these interests which do not greatly depend for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the manner in which the offices of education are filled and its duties performed . And it is plain , that if the profession of education , - the very phrase sounds awkwardly , although we speak of the profession of law , and the profession of medicine , without misgiving , - but if this profession were more honored , and more adequately rewarded , men of higher minds would be drawn into it , and all who were engaged in it would be roused , if only by competition , to greater activity , and more watchful , more constant , and more successful endeavour . It is a profession ; it is one which yields in importance , in its universality of interest , in its demand for the wisest efforts of the best understandings , to none . But it is exercised , and it is regarded , as a trade , and as a mechanic art . Until of late , no great department of human care employed so small a share of the attention or exertion of genius . The work went on according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were usually applied with little or no inquiry into their meaning and fitness ; and thus the labor 0f education became almost mechanical . Schools were provided , in which children might pass so many hours ; during these hours , such and such books were to be committed to memory ; and to ascertain whether this was done , at appointed times the scholars recited memoriter . We need hardly use the past tense , for just this is the case now in the majority of our common schools ; and if the calculating machine of Dr. Babbage could be altered , so as to register a recitation and // note the blunders , it would be just such a master as most of these schools require . Familiarity with the fact deadens our sense of its strangeness ; but truly strange it is , that there should be so little discrimination as to the manner of teaching . History , - or what passes under that name , - science , language , are all taught in the same way as the multiplication table ; taught as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is read , sometimes with much regard to emphasis , and sufficient care that the right and left hands do their respective duties in the way of gesture ; but the poetic sense , the imagination , vivid and sensitive in children , and demanding early and wise culture , is forgotten or unknown . Books , too , are constructed on the principle , that every thing is done when words are learned , and much ground nominally passed over . One may find a Philosophy " abridged , for the use of schools , " pretty much as an egg would be abridged by sucking out its contents ; and " science made easy " simply by being made good for nothing . These books are bad enough ; but the evil can not be wholly remedied by making better ones , because it arises in a great measure from the way in which school-books are used . *V here is hardly any one so bad , that a good teacher might not make it useful ; and none so good , as not to become worthless when ill used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations between the master and the pupils ; in awaking the faculties , the higher faculties , of both ; in producing an actual conviction in both , that the master needs and uses something more than his ears and his hands , and the child something more than his memory and his lips . Books are , in the present system , the principal instruments of education ; they are the only actual educators ; and the office of the master requires of him only to see that the books are used . We regard this as just about the reverse of what should be . By the help of discipline , the " master " ma*T indeed deserve that name ; but the idea that he should be also the " teacher " of the school , scarcely occurs in theory , and in practice it is sadly lost sight of . But successful education requires , as its first and indispensable condition , that the mind of the teacher , his whole mind , be wakeful , active , and earnest , and that the pupil be roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doubted , whether books would need to be used so largely as at present ; and it may // be doubted also , whether school-books would not be made for the use of the master rather than of the scholars . They would be text-books in the proper sense of that term ; books intended to guide and aid the teacher in his instruction , but not to do the whole work in his stead . The Prussian school system ( open as it is to many objections ) is remarkable in this particular . The youngest classes use , literally , no books ; the elder ones use them sparingly ; and throughout the course of education , the principle seems to be acted upon , that tue books are for the master , and that they should promote and facilitate , but by no means supersede his labors . It may seem as if too much would be demanded of the master upon this system ; more than he could do unless his school was very small ; more than could be done for the whole community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very numerous , this fact would prevent their receiving such compensation as could alone secure for this great interest the best endeavours of the best understandings . But discipline , and a wise system of action , would go far towards diminishing the necessity of personal labor in the care of a school ; and we should rely confidently upon the assistance to be derived from a fact in the nature of children , little known and less used . We mean the fact of their sympathy with each other ; of the immense influence which a child exerts upon a child ; of the power by which one will excite , instruct , and expand the mind of another , without effort and without consciousness . The systems of Bell and Lancaster , founded empirically on this principle , astounded the world by their success ; and , in despite of the large admixture in them of quackery and folly , they have retained , in a great degree , their hold upon public opinion , because , wherever they are tried , the results they produce , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising . The improvement of education will reach this matter also ; and a system of mutual instruction will be in time devised , by which the ill effects of the first experiments will be avoided , while all the good , and much more than all which they effected or promised , will be realized . It is from no wish to discourage efforts to improve education , nor is it from any want of hope in the practicability of this improvement , or any feebleness in our conviction that the improvement is needed , that we venture to suggest , that there // should be great caution in the changes which this improveinent implies , greater than will always be used ; and therefore we must expect some errors , - not the less errors , because they are the opposites of other errors , - which will require , in the friends of education , patience , skill , and perseverance . Some of the faults in education are so great and so obvious , that , the moment general attention is drawn to them , the zealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short time ago it was not even suspected , that a child could be made to acquire book-knowledge too soon , or in excess . A bright boy was urged to learn , and then to show off ; and it occurred to few , if to any , that either his heart or his head could be hurt by this process . This was an error , a most gross error ; to be paralleled by nothing but the custom , which certain travellers tell of , in the kingdom of Borneo , where beauty and obesity being considered identical , young ladies who give promise of peculiar attractiveness are crammed into perfection with boiled rice and suet . But the cramming system , whether of mind or body , can flourish only where there is still a considerable measure of barbarism . When any one , who is capable of thinking , attends at all to this subject , it is seen at once that the forcing culture of the understanding is bad in every respect . It is bad for the bright boy ; for it cultivates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strains and overtasks him , disease of mind or of body are produced , his health withers away , and his acquirements are converted into food for his vanity . With the dull boy , it is as bad . Faculties , which by a wise culture might be developed and gradually strengthened into vigor and activity , are crushed into hopeless debility , and he hates learning through life , as one hates an instrument of torture . This was easily seen ; and the more easily , because a corresponding change of opinion in regard to the value of learning was taking place in the world at large . Some centuries ago , learning was rare and difficult ; it required great devotion to its pursuit to overcome the obstacles which lay in the way ; and , when they were overcome , the scholar became one of a small class . He had powers and implements which others had not ; and he was regarded with an admiration , which was none the less sincere , and sometimes none the less acceptable , because it was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , combined with other causes , has made learning cheap and accessible . It gives no longer so great an actual , nor so great an imaginary superiority . The character of the age demands action and result as the proof of power . And he who possesses " erudition , " without the power of turning it to account in the way of actual utility , has much the same sort of respect paid to him which we feel for Dominie Samson . But has not this change gone too far ; or rather , is it not beginning to go too far , both in school and out of school ? We hear so much , now-a-days , about the " whole man , " and the like , that the very phraseology begins to excite disgust ; it affects one like slang words . Learning alone , we admit , may be of no great value ; but the worth of learning , as a means and instrument , is infinite , and its necessity for the best efforts of the best faculties of the human understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that education has greatly erred in placing amount of acquisition before the culture of the faculties ; most true it is , that a change in this respect was needed ; but it is also true , that we can not duly exercise and strengthen the faculties but by means of learning , and that a healthy , vigorous , well-proportioned , and well-disciplined mind , wholly without learning , ( if such a thing could be supposed , ) would be oppressed and paralyzed by its penury . It is time , however , that we speak of Mr. Goodrich 's book ; for it is quite too good to be made merely an occasion for remarks on education . Without pretending to great originality , or a profound and searching inquiry after concealed truths , it gives , in clear and often forcible language , the results of much consideration and experience . The author is wise enough to know , that the faults in domestic education are not to be attributed to the want of known truths and principles ; but to the fact , that these truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered . And in this volume he brings together views , suggestions , and advice , which embody a great amount of practical wisdom on this important subject , with a very small proportion of error . It was evidently the design of the writer to make a useful book ; and he has succeeded . Of the importance of domestic education he speaks thus ; Let us go forward to the period of youth . The mother holds the reins of the soul ; the father sways the dominion of // the intellect . I do not affirm , that there is an exact or complete division of empire between the parents . Both exert a powerful influence over the mind and heart . I mean only to state generally , that the natural power of the mother is exercised rather over the affections , and that of the father over the mind . It is a blended sway , and if exerted in unison it has the force of destiny . There may be cases in which children may seem to set parental authority at defiance ; but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may be regarded as exceptions , which are said to prove the rule . Remember the impressible character of youth , and consider its relation to the parent . Is not the one like the fused metal , and has not the other the power to impress upon it an image ineffaceable as the die upon steel ? Nay , is it not matter of fact , attested by familiar observation , that children come forth from the hands of their parents stamped with a character that seldom deserts them in after life ? Are they not impressed with manners , tastes , habits , and opinions , which circumstances may modify , but never efface ? If the countenance of the child often hears the semblance of the father or mother , do we not still more frequently discover in the offspring the moral impress of the parent " Is it not true , then , that parents are the lawgivers of their children ? Does not a mother 's counsel , does not a father 's example , cling to the memory , and haunt us through life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains of thought , and if we seek to discover the origin of these , are we not insensibly led back , by some beaten and familiar track , to the paternal threshold ? " - pp. 68 - 70 . " The fireside , then , is a seminary of infinite importance . It is important , because it is universal , and because the education it bestows , being woven in with the woof of childhood , gives form and color to the whole texture of life . There are few who can receive the honors of a college , but all are graduates of the hearth . The learning of the university may fade from the recollection ; its classic lore may moulder in the halls of memory . But the simple lessons of home , enamelled upon the heart of childhood , defy the rust of years , and outlive the more mature but less vivid pictures of after days . So deep , so lasting , indeed , are the impressions of early life , that you often see a man in the imbecility of age holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the wide space between that and the present hour is a blasted and forgotten waste . " - pp. 71 , 72 . In the following passage , Mr. Goodrich speaks of follies that are unhappily far too prevalent . // " I will venture to make another suggestion to parents , which is the more important from the fact , that selfishness sometimes puts on the guise of virtue , and deceives even those who are concerned in the trick . There are parents , who , from the ambition to have their children shine , stimulate them by base excitements to exertion , thus sacrificing the purity of the heart , and often the health of the body . There axe parents , who , from a frivolous vanity , dress their children in an extravagant manner ; thus tarnishing the youthful spirit with the same paltry vice which sways themselves . There are some people , who are flattered if their children appear precocious , and these usually attempt to make them prodigies . " I once knew a mother who was possessed with this insane ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy , of bright intellect , but feeble constitution . There was , by nature , a tendency to a premature developement of the mental faculties , and this dangerous predisposition was seconded by all the art and influence of the mother . The consequence was , that while the boy 's head grew rapidly , and at last became enormous , his limbs became shrunken and almost useless . His mind too advanced , and at the age of eight years he was indeed a prodigy . At ten he died , and his mother , who was a literary lady , performed the task of writing and publishing his biography . In all this , she seemed to imagine , that she was actuated by benevolent motives , and never appeared to suspect the truth , plain and obvious to others , that this child was as truly sacrificed by a mother 's selfishness to the demon of vanity , as the Hindoo infant , given by its mother to the god of the Ganges , is immolated on the altar of superstition . Let parents beware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own vanity or ambition , to lead them into the sacrifice of their children 's happiness . Let it be remembered that premature fruit never ripens well , and that precocious children are usually inferior men or women . Parents , therefore , should be afraid of prodigies . Nothing is in worse taste than for parents to show off their children as remarkably witty , or as remarkable , indeed , for any thing . Good breeding teaches every one to avoid display , and well-bred parents will never offend by making puppets of their children in gratification of their own vanity . " There are other mistakes into which parents are led by selfishness , which assumes the semblance of disinterestedness . Thus , in the choice of a profession , and in marking out the plan of life for a child , a parent frequently consults rather his own ambition than the real interest of his offspring . In educating him , he takes care to cultivate those powers which enable // him to command wealth , rather than those which insure peace of mind . He excites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of duty ; he infuses into him a love of high places , rather than a love of his fellow-men . And what is all this , but the immolation of a child on the altar of ambition by a parent 's hands ? a sacrifice rendered still more odious by the hypocrisy of the pretence , that it is for the benefit of the victim . " - pp. 80-83 . The truth and propriety of the following passage will be admitted by all who have observed the faults to which children are most liable . " There is another still more disagreeable exhibition of selfishness among boys in their treatment of girls . They are often exceedingly tyrannical , rude , contemptuous , and even cruel , * towards the gentler sex of their own age . This demands the assiduous correction of the parent . The claims of the weaker upon the stronger sex for scrupulous justice and chivalrous protection ought to be inculcated and enforced , especially by mothers , from the earliest periods of boyhood . If this is not done , there is danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rude exercise of his power , may increase with the advance of years , and at manhood lead him to treat woman , though it may be in a more gallant guise , according to the dictates of caprice , rather than those of justice . " - p. 100 . On the other hand , in the following paragraph Mr. Goodrich expresses a common opinion on the subject of punishment , which we believe to be a common error . But , after all that may be done , it is impossible to lay down rules on this subject that will answer for every case . We may remark of punishment in general , as of physic ; Use it as seldom as possible , but when necessary , take a sure dose . " - p. 126 . By " sure dose , " of course he means a large dose . Now many a man has suffered sadly from the doctrine , " Take medicine as seldom as possible ; but when you do , be sure to take enough . " And nothing would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by excessive punishment , following at once upon long and patient forbearance . We believe punishments of some kind and measure to be very frequently necessary ; tokens , often slight , that obedience must be rendered . But we also hold , that severe punishment is very seldom necessary , and very seldom indeed , unless through the fault of the master . Punishment need not // be corporal punishment . Yet it is a sad mistake to suppose that other modes of punishment are necessarily milder and safer . It is easy to hurt a child , body and soul , more than could be done by any supposable flagellation . We never heard of a boy 's dying under his master 's hand ; but we have known an instance , and have heard of more , where children were frightened , by solitary and dark imprisonment , into convulsions and idiocy . In a chapter on Religion , Mr. Goodrich speaks of it as an indispensable element of all education . The strength and universality of the testimony , which is now borne to this principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting Report , stated that his inquiries on this subject extended to " all classes of teachers , and men of every grade of religious faith , instructers in common schools , high schools , and schools of art , of professors in colleges , universities , and professional seminaries , in cities and in the country , in places where there was a uniformity , and in places where there was a diversity of creeds , of believers and unbelievers , of rationalists and enthusiasts , of Catholics and Protestants , and I never found , " he adds , " but one reply ; and that was , that the Bible is in itself the best book that can be put into the hands of children , to interest , to exercise , and to unfold their intellectual and moral powers . " Victor Cousin 's Report on Education in Prussia , fully confirms this . It contains a particular account of the principal schools of various kinds in that kingdom , and of the studies pursued and the books used ; and in none of them is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon education in England and Scotland , and in this country , evidence , that the same principle , and the same practice , are coming into general acceptation there , and are beginning to be recognised here . The work on " Home Education , " by the well-known author of " The History of Enthusiasm , " " Physical Theory of another Life , " and other similar works , will perhaps sustain his reputation for vigor of thought and of expression ; but his faults are as conspicuous in this as in his former writings . He is frequently vivid and forcible , both in language and in meaning ; hut his occasional extravagance indicates a warm temperament , a fully sufficient confidence in his own // opinions , and a habit of deriving them from theory and speculation , rather than from practice and observation . He is also , and quite too often , liable to the charge of indefiniteness and obscurity , and suggests the suspicion , that he did not himself see clearly what he wished to say , and purposely wrapped up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a work intended to be practical , and of which the subject is education . Still , this work will not be without its interest and value to those who are disposed to study it ; although , for practical purposes and general use , it is inferior to that of Mr. Goodrich . In one respect , the contrast between them is instructive . It is , however , a contrast , not so much between these particular works , as between English writers on education , generally , and American writers on the same subject . We allude to the manner in which the subject of discipline is treated , - the word being taken in the sense of coercion . We should do injustice to Mr. Goodrich , if we did not admit , that he states very clearly the necessity of coercion . It is , indeed , seldom the fault of our American works on education , that they neglect to urge this with much einphasis . But while English educational books assume , at once , that this necessity always exists and is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the prevailing habits of the country threw the burden of proof upon all who take this ground . English writers rarely make any direct mention of the need of enforcing obedience by compulsory means until it becomes habitual ; but it is always plain , that this principle enters into all their systems of education , and is but little dwelt upon because it is always understood ; while Americans write as if their readers would supply no omission on the subject of discipline , or its basis , obedience , and the whole matter must , therefore , be set forth in its length and breadth . They discuss the subject much as if they could do nothing in relation to it , until they had overcome an habitual fear or distrust of every thing which savours of compulsion ; while their transatlantic fellow-laborers rest on the supposition , that all civilized men know the value of obedience , and the necessity of enforcing it by compulsory means , and that the common feeling on this subject sustains any doctrine respecting it , if it be , in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting point in // the character of our countrymen . As our democratic institutions differ entirely from all those where the possession of power ascends hy an acknowledged gradation of ranks , from the lowest , who have none , to the highest , who are regarded as the fountain of all , they can not hut exert an influence upon individual character , not yet developed , and not yet *appreciated ; perhaps not yet suspected . The manifestation of this influence meets us in its effect upon the relation between the young and the old , the child and the parent , the scholar and the master . These relations have not , with us , the definiteness or the power , which they exhibit and exert in monarchical countries . There , all men feel and live as under authority ; here , as the source of authority ; there , as subjects ; here , as sovereigns . Hence the principle of obedience , in all its forms and influences , is weaker here . And it is an irresistible inference from the whole constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizen a lighter hand than ever before rested on the subjects of human government , must needs relax the rigor of discipline , of constrained order , of obedience , everywhere and in every way . This circumstance imposes a peculiar duty upon all who are engaged in the work of education . If " order is heaven 's first law , " or any law of heaven , and of every thing on earth which is not the opposite of heaven , obedience is the indispensable prerequisite of order ; and it is the only foundation upon which order can rest securely . If , then , the master , or teacher , or parent , would give to those whose future welfare is intrusted to him , a hold upon any thing good , he will teach them obedience ; he will teach them the wisdom and the good of obedience ; and he will fasten it upon them by practice and habit , until its living roots go deep into the central affections and principles of life . But at least equal care needs to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it be slavish and dead ; if it be mechanical only ; if it be nothing more than the evidence and effect of a pressure which has overcome all elasticity of spirit ; if it belong wholly to the outside , and have no origin and no support but fear ; - then is there no good in it , and no good will come from it . Having no conformity with the institutions of the country , or with our prevailing habits , it will make the man unfit for them . He will be a // fearful and enfeebled being , shaken by every adverse breath ; or he will cast his fears aside , and thenceforth have no other thought of obedience , than as of one of the pains and terrors of childhood . Hence , the problem , which is to be solved , demands the reconcilement of all that is good in obedience , with all that is good in freedom . We live under institutions which promise an expansion , a growth and free developement of the elements of humanity , moral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present knows not yet wisely to hope for . Great mistakes will doubtless be made , and the progress must be one of ebb and flow . It is certain , however , that the prevailing system of education should conform to the exigencies of the country ; should acknowledge the duty of supplying its demands ; and should , therefore , with the perpetual improvement that comes from watchful experience , endeavour to lay the foundations of universal order , deep in the universal habit of willing obedience . This subject demands the attention of all who are intrusted , in any form or measure , with education , for a reason which is not generally regarded . And this is , the influence of obedience as a means of intellectual culture . Its necessity for moral discipline , few deny ; but its utility in respect to the understanding , is equally certain . Whatever instruction is given , whatever truth is taught , relates either to the mind alone and is of a scientific nature , or it relates to motive , conduct , and life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the affections ; that is to say , all instruction concerns the thought only , or it concerns the thought and the will together . Now , when we are speaking of obedience , we include in our meaning , not only compliance with command , but self-control , and conformity with the just requirement of circumstances , and a yielding of one 's will to the right , however that be ascertained and expressed ; for all this can be secured and made an integral part of the character , only by early and regular habits of obedience . The utility of all this , in the study of merely scientific truth , is as certain and as obvious , as the utility of peaceful , undisturbed , sustained attention . But the other half of intellectual instruction , - that which touches upon morals and duty , and the relations of social life , and the principles of self-government , or which , in other words , regards the education of the affections through the understanding , and thus the formation of // the character , - demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salutary influence of obedience . We believe that this subject , in its widest extent , would well repay investigation . The text , " If any one will do His will , he shall know of the doctrine , " expresses one of the vital truths of human nature ; the truth , namely , that our ability to know aright any matter , which touches upon conduct and motive and duty , depends greatly upon our moral condition in relation to it ; and this principle bears directly upon education . There was once an attempt , by some philosophers , to persuade men , that understanding and belief were wholly independent of affection and motive , and the state of the will ; and , although this folly has disappeared , the opposite truth is hardly appreciated . The strong tendency of these days to found all obedience to law or command upon a previous satisfaction with its propriety , is one expression of this falsity . It is often just the wrong way ; and especially is it wrong when applied to the education of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is necessary for the very reason that something is to be done which is not desired . If , in this state of the case , we begin to reason about it , all views or arguments which can be offered in favor of the law , encounter not only an adverse inclination , but the belief , that , if a conviction of the reasonableness of the law be successfully resisted , - as of course it always may be by dulness or inattention , - the law will lose its power , the command will not be enforced , and the inclination may be indulged . Let this course be pursued , and there never lived the child who could estimate aright the truths thus offered for his consideration . He can not but look at them through a disturbing medium ; and the oftener this happens , the worse will be the habit of his mind . It is the demand , therefore , not of kindness only , but of justice , to draw this veil aside , and release him from its obstruction . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and he stands at once in a new position . Then , his reasoning powers are not called upon to act at a disadvantage ; they have at least fair play ; and they have also the aid of experience , which will often , perhaps generally , speak audibly in favor of the right . It is neither wise nor safe to say , in theory or in practice , that we will not resort to constrained obedience , because we trust to truth , to reason , and to conscience for then is truth not aided , but disturbed and shackled , // and reason is confounded and obscured , and conscience exposed to certain injury , and to the danger of decay and death . We have dwelt the more on this subject , because we would willingly induce others , who have the means for further and fuller investigation , to give their attention to what we deem the important principle , - that obedience is among the most essential requisites for the highest and most valuable culture of the understanding . Nor is this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political aspect . The child 's obedience to rule , or to command , becomes the man 's obedience to law ; and still retains its quality and all its characteristics . It was once said , - with more justice , we fear , than would belong to the saying now , - that this country was distinguished from all others , by the fact , that law , as such , and for its own sake , and its own power , is here held in reverence . When this can be no longer said with any truth , corruption will have done all its work , and resistance to corruption will have ceased ; and one symptom , that this melancholy consummation is more than a remote possibility , may be found in the prevailing disposition to subject all public laws to the tribunal of individual opinion . It is not enough , that they should be the expression of the public opinion , uttered by its appointed organs . It is not enough , that each man holds in common with all others the right of bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure and enactment of the law through our republican institutions . It is not enough , that every man not only possesses this right , but is bound to exercise this right , to the very end that the law may thus reflect the general sentiment and enforce the general wish ; but a growing and almost prevailing disposition now permits the individual thereafter to submit the law to his private judgment or personal inclination , and ask of that , as of the court of ultimate sovereignty , whether the law is , for him , a law . Let this habit go on , and acquire the sanction of general usage , and nothing will remain for the country , and the whole fabric of its government , but to be swept away as a cumberer of the earth . We believe , that in this disposition lies one of the greatest dangers to which we are exposed ; and we believe also , that this disposition is to be checked first , and most successfully , in childhood . Then , if education reeognises the duty , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its true ground , and enforces it , not with fretful anger , nor with the tyrannous violence of mere love of power , but with the mildness and the firmness of unfailing affection , and associates it indissolubly in the minds of children with all progress , all safety , all happiness , then , and then only , will the children of this republic be fitted to become its citizens , and hold in their hands its destiny . Nor is this a work to be done in the schools only ; on the contrary , it is precisely that in which our schools and our homes should unite . The subject of Domestic Education , as distinct from School Education , is of great magnitude and moment ; hut we do not propose to enter upon it at this time . Indeed , whatever can be said of it , is perhaps comprised or implied in the principle , that the school is better in proportion as it is a home , and the home is better in proportion as it becomes a school . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization and in character , and the difference between them is not to be lost sight of . Nevertheless , they are one in the end which lies before them ; for this is the education , the leading forth of all the physical , intellectual , and moral powers , into fulness of stature , and strength , and health , and into the utmost capacity of enjoying the happiness of usefulness . In these things they are one ; and , while the patient kindness , the warmth and tenderness , of an affection like that of parents should fill the school with sunshine , and make its laws only the expression of its love , the home can not fail in discipline and order , without mournful consequences , which no school can avert or remedy . One of the pictures of Shakspeare represents the schoolboy as creeping unwillingly to school . Like all his pictures this is true to nature , to the nature he drew from ; but it is , in this instance at least , a false and injured nature , for not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the child should go unwillingly to school , more than there is why he should go unwillingly from his school to his home , or to his play . What is a school ? It is a place for moral discipline and for intellectual instruction . Now , most true it is , that no child ever lived who did not , as he grew up , manifest tendencies and feelings which required rebuke , opposition , and constraint ; and the school is the place for this ; but it is not the only nor the chief place for // it . If all constraint is at once relaxed when the child leaves the school ; if he breaks from its thraldom into full license the moment he goes to his play ; if , amid his fellows , or under the paternal roof , he is unwatched , unrestrained , unrebuked for evil deeds , little can his school do for him , and weighty and fearful is the responsibility of his parents . In point of moral discipline , therefore , the school should be no bugbear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the sight and hearing of a child , and does not know that he hungers and thirsts for knowledge ? The babe of a week old seeks not its mother 's breast with sharper appetite , than will urge him , when infancy expands into childhood , to question , and question closely , father and mother and brother and sister , and everybody near him , about every thing in his sight or in his thought . This is the first and natural manifestation of the desire to know ; and it is wise , though not very common , to follow this desire somewhat as a guide . It is often easy to silence it by a little impatience or contempt ; but the desire is still there , always there , deeply implanted in our nature . Education is fouuded upon this desire ; acts through it ; and most grossly errs when it afflicts or disappoints it , and by so doing makes the school distasteful to the child , and compels him to regard it as a place of imprisonment and punishment . And hereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more what schools should be , the child will seek the school as the hbme of his mind ; and there will his mind expand and grow , as flowers and fruits open and ripen in the sunshine , without pain and almost without effort . At present there are few such homes , and few such schools ; and the hope , that such things may become realities , must abide the common fate of all aspirations which look far forward . But the sneer which may rebuke can not extinguish this hope ; for thitherward tends all improvement in education , and the progress of this improvement will measure the advancement of man.
