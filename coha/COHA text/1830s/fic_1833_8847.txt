My Dear Sir : The interest you have ever manifested in the cause of the dramatic literature of our country , and the zeal with which your efforts have always been directed to its advancement , embolden me to dedicate to you my first attempt at tragedy . A stronger reason , however , exists , to justify the liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name upon this page , and it is found in the recollection of the frequent manifestaions of friendly regard I have experienced at your hands , and which I am gratified in having the opportunity , thus sincerely , however feebly , to acknowledge . With sentiments of esteem , allow me to subscribe myself , your grateful and attached friend , JONAS B. PHILLIPS . This Tragedy was written during the summer of 1830 , and , probably , would have remained in obscurity , but for the friendly interest of H. G. Pearson , Esq. , who undertook the study and personation of Camillus , and introduced it to public notice on the 8th of February , 1833 , at the Arch-street Theatre , in Philadelphia , the city of our mutual nativity . Whether it is to this circumstance , or to any intrinsic merit the play possesses , I am indebted to the flattering reception it received , and the favourable notices of the critics of Philadelphia , the public will now have an opportunity of judging ; and in throwing myself upon the indulgence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is my first invocation of the tragic muse . Though not present at its performance , its success , and the established reputation of the actors , are sufficient guarantees that the respective parts were skilfully delineated : and I avail myself of this opportunity to tender my thanks to Messrs . Jones , Duffy &; Forrest , the managers of the Theatre , and particularly to Mr. Pearson , for the care and attention bestowed upon its production . The unanimous award of praise to Miss Riddle , who personated the character of Camilla , assures me that I have every reason to be gratified that the part was entrusted to one so capable of giving it effect . One other fact I mention with pride , and which , perhaps , an author has seldom had an opportunity of noticing , is , that my tragedy , an American production , was performed , and well performed , by American actors . To the gentlemen , who , though entire strangers , so kindly furnished the prologue and epilogue , I tender my most grateful acknowledgments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public , I can not announce the name of its accomplished author . This Tragedy is now the property of my fellow citizens ; and if its publication tends , in the slightest degree , to advance the cause of American dramatic literature , I shall be amply remunerated in having contributed , even thus slightly , to the promotion of an object of deep and heartfelt interest . New-York , July 18 , 1833 . PROLOGUE . WRITTEN BY A FRIEND , AND SPOKEN BY MR . THAYER . If we retrace the line of mental light , To where its birth delivered it from night , We 'd find it , lessening back from age to age , To have first dawn 'd on the dramatic stage . Will you not then rewardingly regard The maiden Tragedy of our young bard ? And let us , in your patriot fiat find , Exotics do n't monopolize your mind . For you , he has explor 'd Rome 's classic ground , Where heroes , bards , and patriots were found ; Among them , did the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy skies . Nor last was he to break the Roman 's yoke , Since Music first , among the stars awoke . Wide o'er the world dark desolation threw Her hopeless clouds , and veil 'd the patriot few . No vista gave a solitary ray , No orient crimson hail 'd the coming day ! But dark-eyed calumny , with tow'ring crest , Expell 'd from Rome her bravest and her best , Who wept e'en to behold his foeman bleed , While coward slaves stood smiling at the deed . Beside the gate , to speak his farewell will To those who stood in friendship , changeless still , Stood proud Camillus , with dishevelled hair , His mind with grief diseas 'd , his bosom bare ; And then in bitterest anguish wept the doom Which thus consign 'd him to a living tomb . And thou , resplendent daughter of the morn , Of smiling Heav'n for weeping mankind born , Bright Liberty ! when , driv'n by envious ire , Thou did'st behold thy noblest son retire , Thou couldst not find another rampart then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men ; No friendly land on which to build thy shrine ; No worthy altars , for thy fires divine ! Hopeless around didst thou creation view , And spread thy wings to bid the world " adieu . " But hark ! what shouts awake the weary skies ! What glorious vision greets thy longing eyes ? As Justice loans her scales , in which the slaves Must sell their only home for foreign graves , Camillus comes , to make the foeman feel , If Rome must fall , t is not by " gold " but " steel . " So persecuted man asserts his right , And fires the patriot , for th ' impending fight . O'er their throng 'd ranks the glittering eagles play ; Fierce for the strife Camillus leads the way : With fearless arm he strikes the deathful blow , And frowns his country 's vengeance on the foe . Each crimson 'd field , each trophied conflict braves , A people rescues and an empire saves . Oh ! if one virtue brighter than the rest Still lives to dignify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning that we feel For our dear native land , in wo and weal ; It is to mingle with her tears our blood ; Weep at her grief , and gladden at her good ! It is , that be her foeman ne'er so strong , We still defend " Our country , right or wrong . " Main text ACT I. SCENE I.  --  A Street in Rome . Flavius and other Citizens assembled . 1st . Cit. 1st Citizen Come they towards us , worthy Flavius ? Flav . Flavius I can not tell ; my sight is indistinct , And can not penetrate the gather 'd crowd . But is not yonder , Licinius Stolo ? 1st . Cit. 1st Citizen The same , and with a hasty step he comes ; There is a cloud upon his brow . Flavius , Methinks this triumph of our Camillus Likes him not . Flav . Flavius Gently , neighbour ; he is here . Enter Licinius Stolo . Good morrow , sir ; a merry greeting t'you ; A proud day this , for Rome ! Licin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud day for Rome ? come , tell me , sir ; Yesterday , the sun shone full as bright upon her , The wind was balmy , as it is to-day ; Her citizens went to their daily toil With cheerfulness and gayety . To-day , They stand in idle groups about the streets , And noisy acclamations , rend the air . I say you speak not truly , then , fair sir , For Rome , this is a day of grief , not pride . Flav . Flavius Does not Camillus come , with conquest crown 'd From Veii ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus And how comes he ? didst ever hear Of any victor who so enter 'd Rome ? In regal pomp , drawn in the sacred car , Attir 'd in costly robes , jewell 'd , and crown 'd , And painted with vermilion like a god . Flav . Flavius He has done much for Rome . Licin . Licinius Stolo And so have you . I have heard you boast , that you were father To four as gallant boys as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good men , And you will then have done as much for Rome As your new deity . Flav . Flavius You do him wrong . A better Roman and a braver man Exists not . See , he alights , and this way , Follow 'd by th ' admiring crowd , approaches . I pray thee , stay , and wear a calmer brow . Licin . Licinius Stolo And join the noisy throng , and , like them , leap And throw my cap in air , and shout hurrah ! Or upon bended knee , with voice subdu 'd , Do homage to your idol . Shall I so ? ( Shouts without . ) Flav . Flavius Come , come , take down your hands , close not your ears Against the hearty shouts of gratitude . Listen ! the soul of every Roman Is pour 'd forth ; you can not now depart , The victor 's here . Enter Camillus , Pontus Cominius , Lucius Apuleus , and Citizens . Shouts and flourish . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Enough , enough , kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeds my poor deserts , And claims my gratitude . Hie to your homes , Suspend your daily toil ; be this a day Of mirth and recreation to ye all . To one and all , once more I yield my thanks . Cit . Citizen Hurrah ! long live Camillus . Exeunt Citizens and Flavius . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Pontus Cominius , thou canst tell , perchance , Why thus Licinius Stolo stands aloof , And seems not to partake the gen'ral joy . Pon . Pontus Cominius He is of sullen humour , and when smiles Beam upon other brows , frowns rest on his . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Lucius Apuleus too : but then , he came And tender 'd his congratulations ; yet With an air so cold , an eye so jealous , I plainly saw , they came not from the heart . Licinius has not spoken . Pon . Pontus Cominius Not yet . Shall I remind him of your presence ? Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus No . I would not have you do so , Pontus ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompting to perform his duty . I have not seen my gentle daughter yet , And she will chide me for my long delay ; You shall speed on , and warn her of my coming . Pon . Pontus Cominius You have assigned me to a pleasing task  --  I hasten to perform it . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Have with you . Home , is the soldier 's only spot of peace ! And the bright smiles that welcome his return , Affection 's sunshine , give bloom and lustre To the flowers of life , repay his cares , And make his laurels ever green . Exeunt Camillus and Pontus . Licinius Stolo and Lucius Apuleus come down stage . Licin . Licinius Stolo Well met , Apuleus ; I thought not to have seen you in the throng , Following the chariot of yon self-made god . Luc . Lucius Apuleus You spoke not . Licin . Licinius Stolo No , I could not school myself To play the flatterer , so bit my lips In silence  --  where go you ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Stolo ; this conquest Shall be a dear one to the conqueror . Licin . Licinius Stolo What mean you ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus You shall know all ; follow me And I 'll unfold to you my purposes . Licin . Licinius Stolo I attend you . Something should now be done ; The people are as sudden in their hate , As they are ever in their love . Luc . Lucius Apuleus ' T is so , And I will turn the honey into gall . ' T is but to wear a smooth unruffled brow , Until the hour of accusation comes , And then ' twill be so bold and back 'd with proof , Even his worshippers will cry out , " shame ! " I 'll tell ye more anon . Come , it grows late , And we must lose no time , Licinius . Exeunt . SCENE II .  --  An Apartment in the Mansion of Camillus . Enter Camilla , meeting Rhea . Camilla . Camilla Now , quick ; what tidings Rhea ? I prithee tell ; Comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That I , love wing 'd , may fly to welcome him ? Now answer me . Rhea . Rhea There 's one without , who bears A message from him  --  shall I admit him ? Camilla . Camilla ' T was a needless question : comes he not With tidings from my father ? You tarry . I would that you were younger and more swift . But , behold , he does not wait my summons . ' T is Cominius  --  thou might'st have said ' t was he ; Thou should'st have ta'en the message from him . Thou canst leave me , Rhea ; if need , I 'll call thee . Exit Rhea . Enter Pontus Cominius . Camilla . Camilla I gladly welcome thee , Cominius , And joy sincerely in thy safe return . Where does my father tarry ? ' t is most strange He should have been so many hours in Rome , And not have stolen one to give his child . Pon . Pontus Cominius You wrong him , fair one , for his heart was here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Until the day thus far has spent itself . He now wends homeward , but bade me hasten , To allay your fears , and warn you of his coming . Camilla . Camilla Thanks , good Cominius ! a thousand fears , Caus 'd by his long delay , had fill 'd my soul With gloomy apprehension  --  now , tell me , Is he well ? have not the toils of war Impair 'd his health ? has he escap 'd all danger ? Now , answer , I beseech thee , gallant Pontus . Pon . Pontus Cominius See where he comes . His presence answers thee . Behold the glow of health upon his cheek ; Does not a step so firm betoken strength ? Enter Camillus . Camilla meets him . Camilla . Camilla My dear , dear father ! my silly heart 's so full , It can not speak its welcome or its joy . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus ( embracing her . ) My own fair girl ! Pontus , if thou shouldst live To be , like me , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind , Are those to which paternal love gives birth ; And no sublunar joy can equal that Which the fond duty of a child affords . Come still closer to my heart , Camilla ! While thou art here , the wild and painful throbs Which the loud plaudits of the multitude , And the excitement which this conquest cause , Give place to gentler feelings , such as spring From the sweet calm of natural affection . Tell me , how have you far 'd ? how sped your time ? Health cheer 'd you in my absence , or else Your cheeks , that wear a bloom so beautiful , Speak falsely , which thy tongue has never done . Camilla . Camilla I have indeed been well , save when my fears For thee , dear father , in these times of peril , Have caus 'd a sudden sickness at my heart , Which , for the moment , might perchance o'ercome me . My good old Rhea has , since thou left us , Been father and mother to thy spoil 'd child ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never dar 'd to press his suit before . But it matters not . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus It matters not ! Didst thou say so , Camilla ? but it does ; For when thou saidst so , girl , there came a cloud Dark'ning the sunlight of thy brow . I must know Who this same suitor was ; and thou wilt tell , For thou hast never us 'd disguise with me . And , see , Cominius changes colour . I gave him right to woo thee , so didst thou ; That blush confesses it  --  come , speak frankly . Camilla . Camilla I would not disobey thee , but I fear When thou shalt know the man , thou wilt not heed My terrors , and may proceed too rashly . Promise thou wilt not do so . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Camilla ! Thou wert not wont to make conditions With thy father . I bid thee say who ' t was ? Camilla . Camilla Lucius Apuleus  --  but indeed He will not dare renew it . Camillus . Marcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come  --  stop ; what did you say ? Speak quick , Camilla ; how didst thou act ? Camilla . Camilla As I deem 'd comported with my honour . I scorn 'd his suit , bade him leave my presence , And when he disobey 'd , order 'd Palo To thrust him from the door . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus And he did so , Did he not ? Camilla . Camilla ' T was not requir 'd : when woman Is resolved , there is a stronger power in her eye , Than in the arm of man : he saw me firm , And left me . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus My brave girl ! thou art all Roman ! Come , Cominius , we will seek this gallant . Camilla  --  foolish girl , why hold my robe ? Camilla . Camilla My dear father ! my best Cominius ! ' T was this impetuosity , I fear 'd ; I do beseech ye both , to let it rest  --  He will not dare renew his suit . Pon . Pontus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and press it too ? He dar 'd to clamber to an eagle 's nest , And when the parent bird 's protecting wing Stretch 'd not its shelter o'er its noble young . Camilla . Camilla Cominius , if , as I think , you love me , Pursue not thus a broil so idle . I 'll cling unto ye both ; ye sha' n't go forth , Till ye have promis 'd to forget it all ; And , on my soul , if he again renews His odious suit , ye both shall know it . Upon a day like this , when the pure air Is fill 'd with acclamations in thy praise , Wouldst thou , my father , see thy child in tears , Care on her brow and terror in her heart ? The lustre of a glorious vict'ry Still is upon thy sword ; say , my father , Would not blood like his dim it for ever ? Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus It may be so . Rest , my poor trembler , rest ; I promise all you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little girl , Will die with terror else , the silly one ! Camilla . Camilla Now you are kind again , and I am happy . But I forget the little feast that waits ; Come , do it honour . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Cominius may : I must to the senate , where I 'm summon 'd : They want explanation ; something about A silly vow I made , and had forgotten . Go with her , man ; partake her little feast ; Amuse her with the stories of the war , ' Till I return ; and if Apuleus comes , She will not need old Palo 's aid again . Farewell , farewell  --  I shall not leave ye long ; Tho ' if I staid ' till midnight , ye would deem My coming speedy , love 's hours are so short . Again , farewell . Exit Camillus . Camilla . Camilla Come , Cominius , If you would cheer me with your presence , Banish that frown , I pray  --  why lingers it ? We have some rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pon . Pontus Cominius Thy pardon , gentle one ; but I am chaf 'd Whene'er the insolence of Apuleus Recurs to me . I 'll look on thee and smile ; Forget past cares , in present happiness , And only talk of love  --  I 've much to say . Camilla . Camilla And I have much to ask  --  how sweet that love , Which , like ours , my Cominius , commenc 'd In childhood , and which has grown and ripened , Beneath the sunshine of a parent 's smile . Let us within , and we will then compare The soul recorded notes of past events . Pon . Pontus Cominius Call it the journal of the heart , sweet love ! The hallowed register of feelings Pure as the dreams of angels .  --  I attend you . Exeunt . SCENE III .  --  A Street in front of the Senate House . Flavius and Citizens discovered . Enter Licinius Stolo . Licin . Licinius Stolo What make ye here ? are ye all men of wealth , That ye can leave your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , Who knows ye pliant , meek , submissive dolts , And leads or drives ye as his pleasure prompts ? Home , home , I say ; here ye are out of place . Flav . Flavius We cry your mercy , sir ; we 're Romans all ; Freemen , whose rights are equal to your own , And ' t is befitting that we all should know What our Senate decrees in this behalf . Licin . Licinius Stolo Why , what should it decree ? your hero came , And boldly said he had forgot the vow That he would yield a tithe of all the spoils Unto Apollo ; so it was ordained That the poor soldiers , who received the same , Should each produce a tenth part of the value ; And then it was resolved , a vase of gold Should be presented to the Delphian God . 1st Cit. 1st Citizen And ends it there ? and will they sanction thus This trifling with a vow made to the gods ? Licin . Licinius Stolo Sanction ? why , perjury is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without . Hark to that shout ! I should not marvel now , If they confer new honours on the idol ! Enter Lucius Apuleus . Tell me , Apuleus , what new folly 's this ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus Hold ! what mean you , honest Stolo ? folly ! You impeach the wisdom of the Senate , Which has a third time made noble Camillus Tribune ; and , behold , he now approaches , To be confirmed here by the people 's voice In his appointment . What say ye , citizens , Are ye satisfied ? 1st Cit. 1st Citizen We are not satisfied ! Luc . Lucius Apuleus Why , this is well , what honest Roman is ? He does not merit your affection , friends ; And his ambition overleaps his claims  --  I 'm glad to hear ye say ye are not pleased . Flav . Flavius Who says so ? ' t was but a solitary voice ; And that , from one who speaks but for himself . I am content with what has been decreed , So is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcus here , and old Ventinus  --  Speak ! are ye not ? Citizens . Citizens We are all satisfied ! Luc . Lucius Apuleus Who bade you speak ? I say they 're not content . They spoke dissatisfaction thro ' the voice Of yonder independent citizen , Who boldly dared to speak his feelings here , And not disguise them with fine words , like you . Silence ! I say . Flav . Flavius Listen , good citizens , I charge ye listen , how this pure patriot Would control our speech , and bid us silence , When we dare speak our honest sentiments . Shouts without . Lo ! the hero comes  --  mark yon discontent , Yon " independent citizen " that spoke , His cap is first in hand ; ' t would honour him Beyond his poor deserts , to force his flight , So let him e'en remain ; his shame is dumb . Enter Camillus , followed by Citizens . Shouts , &c.; Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Thanks , friends and countrymen ! had I the gift To coin fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find me niggard of my speech . This unsought honour thrice conferred , and now , At the very hour when your foes and mine , The enemies of liberty and Rome , Sought to deprive me of your envied love , Has tenfold claim unto my gratitude . I pray ye , to your homes . Let those who will , Prepare to join me ' gainst the Falerians . Speak ! who will follow me ? Citizens . Citizens All , Camillus , all ! Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus With such defenders . Rome is ever safe ! Once more I bid ye home , and quick prepare , For in this war , we needs must use despatch . Exeunt Citizens . Lucius Apuleus , those are honest men . Think you , that one of them would dare intrude Into the dwelling of a citizen , And in his absence , offer to his child The daring insult of an odious suit ? Speak out  --  what think you , sir ? Oh ! you are dumb . Now , by the gods ! but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rome , in open day , I would chastise thee , like a worthless slave ! What ! is your hand upon your sword ? You will not dare to draw it , fearing mine Should from its scabbard leap . Be quiet , sir ; My sword is for the brave and honourable ; For such as you , scorn is the sharper weapon . Lucin . Lucius Apuleus Apuleus , will you endure all this ? You can not fear him ; I am at your side . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Oh ! you are valiant . sir , and would abet This honourable man . Why , look ye , sirs , Ye dare not strike a bold and open blow ; And you , Lucinius , trembled even now , Lest brave Apuleus should accept the aid You proffered him so very gallantly . Luc . Lucius Apuleus You shall repent this public outrage , sir , Upon a citizen , this gross offence Against the city 's quiet . Look to it . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Didst thou speak ? thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen , And dare to threaten me , in Rome 's wide streets ? Tempt me no more , lest I forget myself , And cloud the glory of my ancestry , By punishing thy insolence with blows . By all the gods ! I swear , I am abashed , That I have been betray 'd into the shame Of holding parlance with so vile a thing . Good day , fair sirs , friends of the injur 'd people , I leave ye to your patriot conference . I know ye , masters ; ye have much to learn , And your experience shall be dearly bought . Exit Camillus . Licin . Licinius Stolo Was it forbearance , Lucius , that withheld Thy hand , or fear ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus Fear ! he holds no thunder ! Tho ' ' t is well he can not rob high Jove Of that dread attribute of pow'r supreme ! Hark ye , good Stolo , if prudence sometime Did not temper vengeance , too often Would our acts defeat our ends . ' T is as bad To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it till the time has past . Had I slain him then , what would we have gain 'd ? Nought but the people 's hatred . We must wait . The fever of the times will soon grow cool . There 's still another charge to blast his fame , We yet can make , well fortified with proof ; And in a dearer point I yet shall wound him . Licin . Licinius Stolo And that is  --  Luc . Lucius Apuleus What not even thou must know ; Mine is a private animosity , And must not clash with that in which we 're leagued . Have you sounded Marcus Manlius ? Licin . Licinius Stolo Yes ! He may be won in time . He does not love Camillus , nor yet hate him . Give but spur To the ambition of young Manlius , And we secure him . Have you seen Quintus ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus Yes ! It is now the hour he appointed To meet me at my dwelling . Come with me ; Some others will be there you 'll joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear us ! Exeunt . SCENE IV .  --  The Garden of Camillus . Enter Pontus Cominius and Camilla . Pon . Pontus Cominius Thanks , my Camilla , ' t was a gentle strain , And I would bid thee , fairest , still sing on , Had I not now thy kindness overtax 'd . Music of peace , like that which you discourse , Falls on the soldier 's ear as the soft strains That angels warble in their Paradise . Camilla . Camilla Go to , you are no camp-bred soldier , Pontus , Inur 'd to wars , and to the din of arms ; You have grown a pretty flatterer ; A coiner of fair and silken phrases , To suit the vanity of womankind . Pon . Pontus Cominius For once you are unjust . I am not school 'd In that soft art , known to the plum 'd gallant , Who starts and trembles at the trumpet 's sound , But sinks like a lull 'd infant to repose , When the soft music of a mandoline , Touch 'd by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your father comes ; his step is quick ; There is much earnestness upon his brow  --  Something of sudden import has occurred , And it disturbs him strangely  --  he is here . Enter Camillus . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Camilla , I have left some toys with Rhea , That will delight thy girlish fancy much ; Go , examine them  --  I 'll send for thee anon . Camilla . Camilla ( taking his hand , and looking earnestly in his face . ) My dear , dear , father ! Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Well , what would'st thou have ? There is a world of question in that look , An anxious speaking in those eyes of thine , To which thy tongue will give no utt'rance . Speak , what is't thou seek'st ? thy doves are dead ! Well , I have ordered others for thee . Not that ! well what is it then ? speak boldly , girl . Camilla . Camilla I will , since you command me so to do . I am a silly girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless wandering eye , That something has occurr 'd to mar thy peace . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Why , what should do so ? I am much belov 'd , The people throng around me as I walk , And the Senate have again declar 'd me A tribune of the military ; yet My peace was marr 'd ; I saw Apuleus , Saw and heard him speak , and , would'st believe it , I did not strike him down , tho ' my hands itch 'd To grasp the caitiff 's throat , and yet they did not . Camilla , Rhea is waiting for thee ; Why dost thou linger thus and hang on me ? I will not leave thee and not bid farewell . Go , timid one , I 'll summon thee again : I would confer with Pontus  --  lingering yet ? ( kissing her . ) There , take this kiss , and go . Exit Camilla . Now , Cominius , Raise my standard quickly , for we must march , With all due speed , ' gainst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves We needs must keep our citizens abroad . Sedition poisons the pure air at home ; They must be taken where it can not reach . Pon . Pontus Cominius Thou canst not fear sedition ; ' twill not reach The brave , protected by the people 's love . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus The people ! The winds are truer to a point , Than they are ever in their love . To-day , The glory of a brilliant victory , Wins their applause , and we miscall it , love  --  To-morrow , their same idol , fails perchance , And he is hunted down , a thing disgraced . I tell you , Pontus , there are foes at home , Who strive with venom 'd industry , to spread Sedition thro ' the city . Camilla ! To Camilla , entering . Did I not bid thee wait my summons , girl ? Thou heard'st me , did'st thou not ? Camila . Camila Pardon my fears , That urg 'd me to thy presence . My father , There is a crowd without , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Camillus  --  I saw thy ready armour in the hall ; And as I pass 'd , beheld thy gallant war-steed At the gate ; my heart has sadly answer 'd That I came to ask , again you leave us . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus And it has answered truly ; so it is  --  My country bids me to the wars again , And I have ever tutor 'd thee , Camilla , To bow submissively to her commands . Noise without . Enter Palo . What means means that tumult , Palo ? Palo . Palo The people Throng around the gates , and claim admittance . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus What do they seek ? Palo . Palo Permission at your hands , To follow you to the Falerian wars . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Why , this is well  --  go , Palo and admit them . Exit Palo . Camilla shall behold , by what brave men Her country it defended . Cominius , What would Licinius Stolo say to this ? This looks not like sedition , think'st thou so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tho ' it were best that we should seem confiding . My Camilla , why dost thou tremble , girl ? These are our friends that come  --  Romans , not foes ! Enter Marcus Ceditus and Citizens . Welcome , all welcome , friends and countrymen ! This bold forthcoming in our country 's cause , Gives earnest of success , and claims my thanks . I 'm ready on the instant to set forth  --  Are ye prepared to quit your firesides ? Ced . Marcus Ceditus We are prepared , and joy that you accept The humble aid we proffer in the cause Of Rome and liberty ! Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus I could not wrong The country of our birth , by a denial Of your patriot suit . Camilla , Here in the presence of our countymen , I bless thee , my fair child , and bid farewell . No tears  --  thou art a Roman ! Camilla . Camilla My father ! Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Wil't thou not say farewell unto Cominius ? Come cheer thee , girl ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , Or seem to fear , the issue of this war . We must succeed , and I shall soon return Again , to see my fair and darling one Smile a bright welcome on her fond father . Camilla . Camilla I will obey , and act as thou would'st wish , Although my heart should break  --  go , my father ! Cominius , countrymen , I bid ye go . Parent to child , and husband unto wife , Brethren to sisters , lovers to weeping maids , A safe , a jovous , and a quick return . I yield a blessing , and farewell to all . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus ( embracing her . ) My own brave girl ! thy pray'rs will prosper us . To Rhea , entering . Rhea , thou hast come in time to take thy charge , And guard her with an ever jealous care . There , let her weep upon thy breast , old Rhea ; She can not longer struggle with her tears . He places Camilla in the arms of Rhea . Camilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Pon . Pontus Cominius ( kissing her hand . ) May all good angels guard thee , gentle one , And Heaven bless thee with benign protection . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Now , Cominius ! now , my countrymen ! Follow ! on to Faleria  --  away ! Rushes out , followed by Cominius and Citizens . Camilla breaks from Rhea , and kneels in an attitude of prayer . END OF ACT FIRST . ACT II . SCENE I.  --  The Garden of Camillus . Camilla discovered . Camilla . Camilla How weary are the hours of loneliness ! How sad , and dull , and spiritless time flies , When beguiled not by the joyous presence Of those whose smiles give lightness to his wings . I have heard that solitude was pleasing , But could it e'er possess a charm for those It sever 'd from the scenes of early life ? Ah , no ! ' t is sweet to listen to the voice Which first broke on the ears of infancy ; To gaze upon the face which first we lov 'd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the very sunlight of existence , Impart unto the fragile plant of life Its bloom and lustre ; such are the pure charms , Of which cold solitude deprives mankind . With those we love , the dreariest spot on earth Would be a Paradise ; deprived of them , The fairest ' neath the sun becomes a desert . Who comes ? is't you , good Rhea ? Enter Lucius Apuleus . Luc . Lucius Apuleus No , fair one , Not thy old nurse , one who would cherish thee With tenderer care . Camilla . Camilla Apuleus ! Luc . Lucius Apuleus Yes , proud maiden ! the scorn 'd Apuleus ! I am not one whom a cold look could freeze ; Or haughty words from scornful beauty 's lips , Fright into abandonment of purpose . I love thee , and I tell thee so , Camilla : Despite of that cold frown and bitter smile , I dare to tell thee that I love thee , girl ! And more , will have requital of my love ! Camilla . Camilla Requital ! yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumption meeds . Think'st thou that tho ' my choice was free as air , I could yield up my heart to one like thee ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus I ask it not ; it is a foolish creed , Which tells us of the interchange of hearts ; ' T was only made for fools and sickly poets . I do not ask thy heart  --  I want thyself  --  Heart , soul , jewels and casket must be mine ! Camilla . Camilla Am I the daughter of Camillus ? A free born maid of Rome , and doom 'd to hear Language like this , from lips that I abhor ! Twice hast thou dared to persecute me thus  --  Twice in my father 's absence , knowing well , If he were here , thou durst not thus presume . At once , I do command thee from my presence ! Luc . Lucius Apuleus I can not , fair one , . yield to that command ; Thy charms have chained me to this fairy spot . But now I heard thee rail ' gainst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence  --  To leave you to your cheerless loneliness . I will not go . Camilla . Camilla Will not ? what ho ! without ! Palo ! Servius ! where are all the slaves , That not one comes , to rid me of his presence ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus Listen , Camilla ; all thy cries are vain . ' T is said thy father wends a homeward course , And all thy bondsmen have gone forth to meet him . I have come here to tell thee , that on thyself Depends the future greatness of thy sire ; A breath of mine can blast him . Camilla . Camilla Dost threaten ? The air of grateful Rome , I know too pure For calumny to live in . I fear not Thee , Apuleus , nor thy idle threats . The love thou canst not win , thou shalt not force . Once more , I bid thee hence ! Luc . Lucius Apuleus ( Kneeling and taking her hand . ) Not ' till I swear , And swear on bended knee , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride . Camilla . Camilla This is too much ! my swelling veins will burst ! Oh for a dagger to avenge myself ! Unhand me , insolent ! help , Rhea , help ! Pontus Cominius rushing in . Pon . Pontus Cominius Who calls for help ? is it thou , Camilla ? Seizing Apuleus . Ha ! have I found thee slave ? art here again , And daring to pollute hee with thy touch ? Now could I strike this poniard to thy heart , But that the filthy blood , it must let forth , Would taint the atmosphere Camilla breathes . Camilla . Camilla Let him depart , Cominius , I pray ; He is unworthy of thy noble rage . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Unhand me , sir ! I will not be detained ; I am unarmed , and you most valiantly Avail yourself of the advantage , Which my defenceless situation gives . Pon . Pontus Cominius Poor braggart , hence ! thou art too vile a thing , E'en for the chastisement a rod could give . Begone , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camillus in the face : he 's there The conqueror of the Faliscii , The hero of a bloodless victory ; The news is wormwood for thee  --  hence , serpent ! Luc . Lucius Apuleus Serpent ! dost think me one , Cominius ? Beware my sting  --  beware the serpent 's venom . Exit . Pon . Pontus Cominius He threatens , but fear him not , Camilla ; He trembles while he does so  --  the dastard ! Call back the truant roses to thy cheek , For I have news to joy thy filial heart . Thy father has return 'd again triumphant ; No widows ' tears or hapless orphans ' cries , Embittering the sweets of victory . At the Senate house , awhile he tarries , But with his presence soon will gladden thee . How now ! why dost thou tremble so ? art ill ? Camilla . Camilla I do not tremble  --  do I , Cominius ? It is not for myself , indeed it is not , But for my father , whom I fondly love . Haste to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch Apuleus , For he has sworn his ruin  --  delay not . Perhaps ' t is idle fear , but oh ! I feel As though some unknown sorrow o'er me hung . Thy arm , Cominius  --  nay , do not chide This silly weakness , even with a look . I have borne much , and borne it with a pride , Befitting well the daughter of Camillus  --  But we lose time , and I would have you speed . Impart not to my father what thou'st seen ; Say I but sent thee to urge his coming . Thou wilt not sure deny me ? Pon . Pontus Cominius Deny thee ? Nothing , my gentle one , that thou could'st ask . Quiet thy fears , Camilla ; be assured The people 's love gives safety to Camillus . Apuleus dare naught , but vent his spleen In breath , noisy words , the pointless weapons The envious use , that dare not strike a blow . Thy father 's corslet is a well spent life ; The traitor 's dagger can not pierce it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Which guards him ' gainst the shafts of calumny . Fear not , I soon shall bring him to his home ; Thy love will make him then , invulnerable . Exeunt . SCENE II .  --  The Senate Chamber . Servus Sulpitius and other Senators . Camillus and others discovered . Ser . Servus Sulpitius Camillus , the Senate confirm the league Which you have made with the Faliscii . The fathers , from your lips , through me , request Narration of this bloodless victory . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus I gladly yield compliance , though unus 'd To play the braggart , or be historian Of my own adventures . The tale is this  --  The city schoolmaster , a paltry knave , False to his country and his sacred trust , Conducted artfully unto the gates , The children of the noblest citizens Faleria could boast ; and braver boys Never gave gladness to fond parents ' hearts . The slave would have me hold them prisoners ; And crav 'd that when the fathers claimed their sons , I should demand the city as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my birth , To cherish for an instant the base thought , That she could prize a conquest bought with treason ; So spurned the traitor , and bade the lictors Strip the caitiff 's back ; and when obey 'd , Plac 'd in the hand of every boy a rod , And saw him lash 'd , e'en through the very streets Of the fair city he would so betray . Then came the wond'ring Falerians forth , And when they learn 'd why I chastis 'd him thus , They own 'd that Justice , not the sword , subdu 'd them . Thus , fathers , was Faleria obtain 'd . Ser . Servus Sulpitius A conquest brighter than the sword could win . Enter Pontus Cominius , who whispers Camillus . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus She sent thee to haste my coming , say you ? The fond one ! we will delay no longer . Fathers , I crave permission to depart , Unless state business my presence claims . Ser . Servus Sulpitius We have already wrong 'd they daughter 's love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Camillus is about leaving , when Lucius Apuleus and Licinius Stolo enter . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Back , we demand thy presence ! Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus You demand ! Fathers , your pardon if I now remain , In opposition to the leave just granted , And learn why these good men demand my stay . Ser . Servus Sulpitius We are amazed that you , Apuleus , And Licinius Stolo , men of years , Should so rudely come into this presence . Your object , masters ? Licin . Licinius Stolo To serve our country ! To strip yon traitor of the gaudy plumes , In which his foul ambition hath array 'd him . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Eternal Jove , hear this ! that he should breathe This calumny ' gainst me . Camillus traitor ! Luc . Lucius Apuleus Will not the Senate hear the accusation ? Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Hear it , fathers ! I do entreat ye , hear it ! I will be silent until all is told . Ser . Servus Sulpitius This is sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apuleus  --  let no private wrath Poison the accusation that you make  --  Proceed with calmness , ' t is befitting truth . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Believe me , fathers , ' t is the public good , Which I am ever anxious to promote , Prompts me to make this open accusation . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus The public good ! I cry your mercy , sir ; ' T was inadvertence ; proceed , I pray you . Oh ! I will be silent , mute as marble ! Ser . Servus Sulpitius The charge , Apuleus ; what is it , speak ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus Still grosser frauds , relating to the spoil Ta'en in the Tuscan wars . And this , not all ; I do proclaim that for his private gain , Camillus , felon like , conveyed from Veii The city 's brazen gates . This the plain charge , Which to sustain there 's proof to be adduc 'd , Which must condemn him in the people 's eyes . Ser . Servus Sulpitius Speak , Camillus , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Need I reply ? I promised to be silent , I will remain so , will be silent still . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Mark , fathers ! mark ye the convicted one ! He dare not oppose a bold denial ; But , coward like , shrinks from investigation . This is the man who so adores his country ! He loves her very truly , does he not ? Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Oh ! all ye gods ! this forces me to speak ! Do I not love my country as my life ? You can tell , old Manius , how I lov 'd When with the pith of fifteen years of life , I engag 'd the Equii , and the Volscii ; When in that battle , wounded as I was , I plucked the javelin from my bleeding thigh , And still fought on , and put the foe to flight . Luc . Lucius Apuleus I crave the Senate to restrain his speech . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus They dare not , slave ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shall not be restrain 'd . Not love my country ? Gods ! is my nature chang 'd ? Have I become the senseless , heartless thing , He would describe me to my fellow men ? Did I not love my country , when I strove With anxious zeal to dry the orphan 's tears , And soothe the widow 's sorrows ? I could speak , Could make you serpent writhe , and vainly strive To shun the gaze of man ; but ' t is a theme Uninteresting to the public ear , A private wrong , for private punishment . Luc . Lucius Apuleus I do entreat the judgment of the Senate . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus And so do I ! What is the Senate 's judgment ? I do beseech ye , fathers , call for proofs , Weigh cautiously this mighty accusation , Proceeding from a source so very pure , That all defence weighs naught against the charge . Ser . Servus Sulpitius We 'll meet again and listen to the proofs ; Apuleus , doubtless , would not make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , Without strong evidence in its support , You will attend , Camillus ? Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Why should I ? To listen to you venom 'd slanderer ! Again to be betray 'd into the shame Of being mov 'd by aught that he could say . If I am needed , ye can send for me , I will obey your summons , be assur 'd . Ser . Servus Sulpitius Be it so then , the senate is adjourn 'd . Exeunt all but Camillus and Cominius . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Cominius , summon my friends quickly . And bid them meet me at the city gates ; Excuse me to Camilla  --  dost thou hear ? Pon . Pontus Cominius Excuse you to Camilla ? Your meaning ? She waits your coming , with an anxious heart . Return , I pray you . Camillus , Camillus Why should i return ? To fill her heart with keener pangs ; At once to meet and part from her again ? I tell you , my Cominius , I must live Where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rome is poisonous ; Ingratitude , makes it unhealthy , sir . Pon . Pontus Cominius Will you not wait the issue of this charge ? Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus The issue ? I know it , Cominius , Know it as well as though it were pronounced . I read it in cold looks ; the ready pens Of those who listen 'd to th ' accusation ; Recorded it , ere scarce the charge was made . By all the gods ! I am prejudg 'd , condemn 'd , And will not wrong myself to make defence . I am resolv 'd , and will abandon Rome . Nay , urge me not : hadst thou the power To drive old Neptune from his monarchy , Or stop the glorious sun in his career , Then would my purpose change . But , my daughter ! My ever gentle and confiding child ! No matter  --  thou wilt protect her kindly  --  I know thou wilt . Go to her speedily ; Invent  --  no , do not ; tell the honest truth , Lest rumour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too rudely to her ears . Once more , farewell ! I 'll to the city gates ; Send my friends thither , and in an hour hence , I shall expect you , for a last adieu . Exeunt . SCENE III .  --  The City Gates , and environs of Rome . Enter Camillus . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus It has come to this ! had a seer foretold That I , Camillus , would abandon Rome , I should have call 'd the graybeard liar ! And yet to this , has envy driven him . Eternal city of the seven hills ! I gaze my last upon thee , while the sun , Sheds on thy temples his departing beams . Not love thee ! answer , ye gilded heavens ! Did'st e'er behold Camillus weep ' till now ? He has seen sorrow , and these founts were dry ; But now they open and pour forth their streams , To dew the soil , which ne'er again perchance Footstep of his shall press . Beautiful home ! Soil where my fathers sleep in blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , ye winds , And bear it with my blessings o'er the land .  --  Who comes ? the friends I summoned ? no , ' t is he  --  He who hath driven me to this extreme  --  He who has sought to stain my rising fame  --  He whom I hate , and thus will trample on . Rushing on Lucius Apuleus as he enters , then throwing him from him . No , no , poor reptile ! take thy worthless life ! Death at my hands would bless , not punish thee . I would have thee live to curse existence  --  Live to become degraded and despis 'd  --  Live to be scorn 'd by every honest man ; Thou and thy base coadjutors , that dar 'd , With falsehood to assail the fame ye envied . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Hear , Camillus ! Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Silence ! I 'll hear you not . You must hear Camillus ; hear , and obey ! ' Twill gladden you to learn that I leave Rome  --  Mark what I enjoin on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the first rose The balmy breath of summer warms to life ; As pure and spotless , even in her thoughts , As angels are that guard the throne on high . You have dared to look on that chaste being , With thoughts that only dwell in minds like thine : Nay , you have dar 'd assail her with rude speech . I leave her betrothed unto Cominius . Approach her not , her father , tho ' away , Leaves one to guard his treasure and defend it . Hence ! you have heard me ; honest men approach , And ' twill degrade me in their sight , if found In parlance with the vilest slave in Rome . Hence ! Exit Apuleus . Camillus looking after him . How he casts his eyes upon the earth , Afraid to gaze upon the broad-fac 'd sky . He mends his pace . Already lost to sight ! ' T is well  --  I 'm glad they have not seen him here . Enter Flavius , Cominius , Marcus Ceditus , and other Citizens . Welcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , that we have met to part . Mar . Marcus Ceditus Nay , we entreat you to forego your purpose , Nor rashly quit the country of your birth . Whatever fine the Senate may decree That you shall pay , we freely will discharge . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus It may not be  --  I 'll hear no more of this . The gods attest that I am driven hence By envy and malignant hate , not crime ; Ye all bear witness to it . Now , farewell . Cominius , your hand , my son . Hear , friends ; I call him son , my fair daughters ' husband , If he will deign accept an exile 's child , A voluntary exile , if you will , Yet still a banish 'd man . Pon . Pontus Cominius Nay , mock me not ; Wrong not my nature by such words , I pray . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Cominius , she is thine  --  my daughter ! To bless thee with her love , while thou art kind ; To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purest blessing will become a curse , When once man feels that he deserves it not . But such can never be thy case , my son ; Thou wilt protect and prize thy peerless bride . Pon . Pontus Cominius Give me your hand , Camillus ; feel my heart ; Let each pulsation be a holy vow , Which binds me to protect the sacred gift  --  To guard her with an ever watchful eye , And cherish her until each pulse is still . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Enough , I know you will , Cominius . Friends , to all I leave a Roman 's blessing , And to my foes bequeath a Roman 's scorn ! ( At the Gates . ) City of my proud ancestors , farewell ! Oh ! may you learn how much Camillus lov 'd you , And curse the faction which compelled his flight . If you should need him , his ears will hear your cry , His arms be ready to defend you still . As Camillus enters the Gates . Camilla . Camilla ( without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and falls in his arms . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus My Camilla ! my heart 's pride ! How very pale she is , Cominius . I 'll close my eyes , while I imprint one kiss Upon that marble brow . Kissing her , and placing her in the arms of Cominius . Now take her quickly , If I gaze longer I shall be unmann 'd . Now , Rome  --  now , friends  --  now , daughter  --  fare ye well ! Rushes through the Gates , the Citizens with outstretched arms gazing after him . END OF ACT SECOND . ACT III . SCENE I.  --  An Apartment in the Mansion of Camillus . Enter Pontus Cominius and Camilla . Pon . Pontus Cominius Thou say'st thou hast a little suit to press ; I half suspect its nature , gentle one , And therefore can not say ' t is granted , love , Ere it be nam 'd . Camilla . Camilla Yet I will urge my suit , And press it with the energy of love . Cominius , take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? My presence , dear Cominius , will prove A solace to his grief , and heal the wound His country 's base ingratitude has made . Pon . Pontus Cominius It was thy father 's wish , his mandate , sweet , That you should stay in Rome . Camilla . Camilla And without him ? Remain in Rome , and he an exile from her ? Impossible ! you know , Cominius , How when a very child , with careless heart , I listened for his step , and with the shout Of joyous infancy , ran forth to meet him . With what delight I look 'd up in his face , And read in his bright smile and tear-fill 'd eyes , How much he loved his own Camilla . That smile has ever beamed on me through life . Without my father I 'm alone in Rome . Pon . Pontus Cominius Alone , Camilla ? did'st thou say alone . And Cominius , thy husband , here ? Camilla . Camilla Yes , my Cominius , I said alone ; The gods bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is he who gave me life . A husband 's love is as of yesterday  --  That of a parent lives ere we exist , And even after we have ceased to be . Wilt thou not take me then to Ardea ? Do , dear Cominius ; the fearful dream Of which I told thee , hangs with heavy weight Upon my memory , and fills my heart With dread forebodings of approaching wo . Pon . Pontus Cominius Forget it , dear one , it was but a dream , A shadow of the imagination , Which never slumbers , though our eyes are clos 'd Its wild creations should disperse with sleep , And leave no trace of terror on the mind . Enter Palo , hastily . Well , Palo , you are pale  --  I can read much , Yet naught distinctly , in your anxious look . What are your tidings ? speak at once , old man . Palo . Palo Quintus Ambustus has sustained defeat  --  The Gauls , with triumph flush 'd , march against Rome , And even now are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have they enter 'd Rome ! where are the people , That all is quiet at a time like this ? Where 's Flavius and Marcus Ceditus ? Palo . Palo ' T is said they have assembled in the forum . Pon . Pontus Cominius Camilla , I will leave you for a time ; There is no danger , love , can reach you here . I will but see if aught can now be done , That may avert the threat'ning ruin . Camilla . Camilla Go , Cominius , go to the people , And tell them , when their dark ingratitude Drove Camillus hence , Rome was abandon 'd To the just indignation of the gods , And now their doom awaits them . If not too late , they may repair the wrong ; They yet may call Camillus to their aid , Preserve their country , and appease the gods . Pon . Pontus Cominius Thus inspired , I leave thee , my Camilla . If danger threatens , I will soon return , To guard you as my life from its approach  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cominius ; Go , for the good of Rome  --  husband , farewell . Exit Cominius . How my heart sunk when I pronounced the word ! What terror strikes me to the very soul ! Alas ! I fear ' t is the dread certainty Of coming evil ; it steals upon me Like the silent and cold approach of death . I am very faint  --  thy arm , good Palo  --  Lead me to the garden , where the pure air Will cool the burning fever of my brain . Exeunt . SCENE II .  --  A Street . Enter Flavius , Marcus Ceditus , and Citizens . Citizens . Citizens Camillus ! we will send for Camillus ! Flav . Flavius What ! call ye now upon Camillus ? Now that the Gauls already are in Rome , ye learn to prize the hero ye have lost , You , who joined the cry Apuleus rais 'd Against the purest of Rome 's citizens , Now change your voices , and cry , " Camillus ! " Go to Apuleus and Licinius Stolo , They are your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive the Gauls from Rome . Citizens . Citizens Down with Apuleus ! down with Stolo ! Flav . Flavius Peace ! peace ! this is no time for idle brawls ; We have wives , and children , and aged men , To place in safety  --  we must look to them . See where Cominius comes in breathless haste . Enter Pontus Cominius . Pon . Pontus Cominius Hence , for your lives ! our streets are filled with Gauls , Who , savage like , spare neither age nor sex . Hence to your homes , while yet your homes are left  --  Hence , if ye would preserve your wives from shame , Your daughters from the foe 's licentiousness . Flav . Flavius Our wives and children , where will they be safe ? Pon . Pontus Cominius In the capitol , guarded by Manlius , And a band of husbands and of brothers . Know ye old Manius Papirius ? Mar . Marcus Ceditus We know him well ; he must be protected . Pon . Pontus Cominius He is beyond protection , Ceditus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Where he sat ' mong the fear-gather 'd people , The prototype of silver-bearded Time  --  And others have been murdered in cold blood . Mar . Marcus Ceditus Unhappy Rome ! where now is thy Camillus ? Pon . Pontus Cominius Where yet her voice may reach him , Ceditus . The Senate have assembled in the capitol . There conduct the people , and in their name , Demand at once that a decree be passed , To call Camillus from his banishment , Invested with the office of Dictator . Mar . Marcus Ceditus Rome is surrounded by her enemies ; How can a messenger , with such decree , Escape their vigilance ? Pon . Pontus Cominius Gain the decree , And I will bear it through a host of foes , In safety to the self-exiled hero . What say you , Citizens ? Citizens . Citizens To the capitol ! It shall be so decreed  --  Ceditus , lead on ! Pon . Pontus Cominius Then speed at once , ye have no time to lose ; I 'll meet ye at the capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have promised , and must leave Camilla ; Leave my fair bride , e'en at a time like this , When most she needs protection .

Takes out tablets , and writes . Flavius , bear this to my Camilla ; Tell her to be of light and fearless heart ; All will be well  --  our barque will safely ride Over the troubled ocean of existence , And reach at last a haven of security . Use despatch , good Flavius ; meet me soon , And bear her answer to me  --  fare you well ! Exeunt . SCENE III .  --  The Gardens attached to the Mansion of Camillus . Enter Camilla and Rhea . Camilia . Camilia He comes not  --  ah ! whither does he tarry ? Danger frowns , and all I love are absent ; I am alone , defenceless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle mistress . Camilla . Camilla Yes , hopeless ; Suspense has made me so : anxiety , Which naught relieves , blights the fair flow'rs of hope  --  I hear a footstep  --  look out , good Rhea . Is it my husband  --  my Cominius ? Rhea . Rhea No , lady , ' t is our neighbour , Flavius  --  He is here . Enter Flavius . Camilla . Camilla Welcome , my good Flavius ; Thrice welcome , if you come to soothe my heart , With tidings of its lord , Cominius . Speak , your errand ? Flav . Flavius ( presenting the tablets . ) These tablets speak for me ; They are from Cominius , fair lady . Camilla , Camilla ( having read them . ) Gone to Ardea , for my dear father ! His country calls him to her arms once more . Rome will be saved ! Camillus will return ! My blessings go with thee , Cominius ! And yet he should have come to bid farewell , Perhaps a last farewell , to his Camilla . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dims the bright picture , fancy fain would draw ? Why is it that the whisperings of hope Fall coldly on my heart , and my sad mind Is filled with gloomy images of death ? Flav . Flavius Gentle lady , Cominius bade me say , That he would have you bear a careless heart ; Dispel the shadows of sickly fancy , And cherish hope , that all may yet be well . Camilla . Camilla If again you should meet Cominius , Bear my farewell and blessing to him . Tell him , how weary ev'ry hour will pass , Until his safe return shall gladden me . Say I am well , quite well , good Flavius . I will strive indeed to wear a cloudless brow , And banish from imagination 's eye The fearful phantoms that appal my soul . Flav . Flavius Farewell then , lovely lady  --  peace to Rome , Safety to thy lord , and happiness to thee ! Exit . Camilla . Camilla Happiness to me ! it sounds like mockery ! Once did I dream that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after day , Visions of earthly joy before us rise , And when within our reach we fancy them , In all their loveliness they pass away , Like frost-form 'd landscapes melt beneath the sun . Rhea . Rhea Sweet lady , you ncourage melancholy . Let me conduct you to your couch within ; Sleep has become a stranger to your pillow  --  Strive , I pray , once more to court the rover . Camilla . Camilla Sleep ! ' t is for the happy and light hearted . The mind that 's tortured with suspense and dread , Knows no repose  --  ' t is true , the eyes may close , But who can call it sleep , when waking fears Pursue us in our dreams , and rob sweet sleep Of all its pure and balmy influence ? Rhea . Rhea Still let me urge it , for the late alarms Have stolen all the colour from thy cheeks , And dimm 'd the lustre of thy gentle eyes . Camillus will not know his rosy child , In the pale bride of young Cominius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful , kind old nurse ! I will , if it were only to repay Thy kindness , with obedience to thy wish . My tender Rhea ! thou hast watch 'd my growth From infancy to womanhood , with the pride The gardener views a fav'rite flower Bud and ripen into bloom and brilliancy ; And when the gale that sears it shall arrive , Thy tears will fall to dew its lifeless form , But give no freshness to the blighted plant . Come , my good Rhea , my cares have made me Prematurely old ; and thou art youthful , When compared with one , who needs thy arm To lean upon  --  think me an infant yet . Exeunt . SCENE IV .  --  A view near Ardea . Enter Camillus and Lucretius . Lucre . Lucretius Listen , Camillus ! ' t is the voice of Rome , Who , in distress , now calls you to her aid . Camillus .

They will prepare ye to resist the Gauls . Why have ye fled from Rome ? back and defend her ! Lucre . Lucretius Led by you , we gladly will , Camillus . If not , we will remain in Ardea , And bid farewell to Rome , for ever ! Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Look ye , Lucretius , Rome still exists , And , exile as I am , I 'm still a Roman ! I would resign the last red drop of life To serve my country , give up all I prize , Save that which all her kindness could not give , Which all her cruelty shall not destroy  --  Pure honour , a spotless reputation , Evergreens that bloom when all the laurels Won in the battle field have wither 'd . There is a Senate still in Rome ; I say , I will not stoop to them that injur 'd me , And proffer aid : they shall solicit it . Lucre . Lucretius The people 's voice calls loudly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it through the proper organ , then , The Senate , sir . Lucre . Lucretius Think of your ancestors ! Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus I do ; can you not read my thoughts of them In the determination of my speech ? Lucre . Lucretius Think of your daughter ? she is still in Rome . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus My Camilla ! she has a brave husband ; The shield of wedded love protects my child ! Lucre . Lucretius But at a time like this , when Rome 's in danger . ' Think you Cominius will abandon her , And for a wife , desert his country 's cause ? Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus I would curse him if he did , Lucretius . He will consign her to the care of heaven ! No more of this ; I hope to die for Rome , But then my honour must outlive my life . Tell me of my child  --  forget the soldier , Think only of the father  --  is she well ? I left her half dead , in the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Answer me . Lucre . Lucretius When I left Rome , Camilla was in health . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus And happy , was she not ? Lucre .

Well , it may be that I may yet behold her ; Again be welcom 'd with her gentle smile ; And , perchance , her filial hand may close My eyes in the last hour of existence . Lucre . Lucretius You will return , then ? Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus When I am summon 'd : You can not move a rock , which the loud sea Has lash 'd , yet left imbedded in its place As firmly as though storms had ne'er assail 'd it .

Camillus discovered . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus The foe in Rome ! a fierce and savage foe , Razing the temples of the gods to earth , Staining their altars with her noblest blood ; And I not there to strike a single blow In her defence ; an exile from her soil . No , not an exile  --  he is an exile Who with him bears his heart in banishment ; But mine I left in Rome , as full of love As when it beat within this scarred breast , To nerve my arm against her enemies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! My own Camilla ! may I say she 's there ?

Enter Pontus Cominius , disguised . Pon . Pontus Cominius A Roman and a friend . You know me not ; And yet our hands have oft been knit together , Our hearts throbb 'd with love for the same object , And our swords been in the same cause unsheathed . Do you not know me now , Camillus ? Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Yes , Pontus Cominius , my daughter 's husband ; And he from Rome , when Rome is in distress . Thou hast no ties to bind thee to her now ; And I am childless , else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with other tidings  --  Heaven grant , That my fair bride may still exist in health , As when with her approval I left Rome .

Behold , Camillus , here 's the just decree , By which the Senate , with the people 's voice , Name you Dictator , and implore your aid . Camillus takes the paper , glances over it , and , falling on his knees  --  Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus I thank the gods ! I yet may die in Rome ! Die and bequeath my honour to my child , Uncompromitted and unsullied still . Rises . Welcome , most welcome , my Cominius ! Now tell me all  --  who of my friends are slain ?

Why every furrow in his cheek could tell The story of a year , and every lock , Which Time 's cold hand had bleach 'd , confirm the tale . Why I have sat upon that old man 's knee , And listened with the glee of infancy To his recital of some gallant fight ; How such and such a wound , which he would show With proud delight , was gained  --  and he is dead . Well , he shall be revenged . Proceed , Cominius . Pon . Pontus Cominius ' T is a sad catalogue  --  let us haste to Rome ; Her desolation will tell all at once . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus True , we will use despatch . First to the camp ; I must inform the Ardeans , my friends , That Rome once more has call 'd me to her arms . Behold , it is in sight . Some gallant hearts are there , Enlisted in the cause of Rome , but waiting For the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

SCENE II .  --  An Apartment in the Mansion of Apuleus , Camilla discovered on a couch , sleeping  --  Lucius Apuleus watching her . Luc . Lucius Apuleus She sleeps ! how very beautiful she is ! Though sorrow and alarm , with wintry touch , Have blanched her cheek , blighting the healthful rose . She sleeps beneath my roof , within my power , Without a friend to call upon for aid ; Yet when I gaze upon that pallid face , So lovely in its pale , chaste purity ; Or meet her speaking eyes , and in them read The fearlessness of virtue  --  I tremble . Tremble to pluck the fruit so long desired , Which fate or fortune placed within my reach , As though to tempt , then laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Cominius ! father ! help me , or I die  --  The serpent twines his hideous folds around me . Wilt thou not kill him , father ? Waking . Where am I ? It was a fearful dream : Rhea ! Palo ! Alas ! I had forgotten  --  I am indeed Too near a serpent now . Grief has a claim To solitude  --  why is mine invaded ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus Hear me , Camilla ; ' t is not that fortune Made me the happy saviour of your life , That I claim privilege to watch your slumbers , And tell you how I love . Camilla . Camilla Talk of love  --  of life , When all I love in life , to me are lost . It was no generous spirit nerved the arm , Which from the Gaul 's rude grasp delivered me ; Else hadst thou ta'en me to the capitol , Where all the matrons of invaded Rome Have found a sanctuary  --  hadst thou done so , Then would my heart have prized the gift of life With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me thither . Luc . Lucius Apuleus I can not part with thee  --  Thou art as safe beneath my roof , Camilla . Camilla . Camilla Safe ! yes , as the lamb that seeks a refuge In the gaunt wolf 's den . And yet I fear not ; Base as thou art , thou durst not do me wrong . Although thou art surrounded by thy slaves , And I a lone , defenceless , hapless woman , I do defy thee in thy very halls ; Laugh at , and scorn thee , and despise the still . There is a hand , that will ere long release me . Luc . Lucius Apuleus What hand , Camilla ? Camilla . Camilla The blighting hand of death , Which breaks the fetters of the hapless slave , And gives an eternal manumission ! Already do I feel it on my heart , Where all is cold as ice . Luc . Lucius Apuleus And still you smile  --  Smile while you speak of the approach of death ! Camilla . Camilla Do we not smile on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction falls , That the grim monarch of the grave is nigh , Thou wilt not smile  --  how thou wilt tremble then ! Tremble like a terror stricken infant . So do the guilty shrink from his approach , While the pure consciousness of well spent life Supports the good , robs death of all his terrors . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Camilla , banish these gloomy images ; There 's lustre in thine eyes , and on thy cheek Returning bloom speaks health . Camilla . Camilla Mistake it not  --  It is the fever that consumes my brain , Kindling my eye , flushing my pallid cheek . Hear me  --  I would not die beneath thy roof ; Take me to the capitol ; there would I yield My soul to the possession of the gods . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Talk not thus , Camilla . Camilla . Camilla Ha ! thou wilt not ? Then will I go alone . Detain me not ; I have grown strong  --  thy power is nought to mine ; Pursue me not  --  I will outstrip the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luc . Lucius Apuleus Think of the peril  --  no , you shall not go ! Camilla . Camilla Shall not ? there is more peril ' neath thy roof , Than in the foe-beleaguer 'd streets of Rome . Unhand me instantly , Apuleus ! Struggling . Luc . Lucius Apuleus I will not part with thee , Camilla ; Now thou art here , think'st thou I will resign My cherish 'd hopes ? when once the miser Grasps a long-sought treasure , he holds it firm ; No power can wrest it from him  --  still I say , Thou shalt not go ! Camilla , Camilla ( breaking from him . ) Poor idiot ! Why , what an infant guilt has made of thee ; Did I not say thy strength was nought to mine ? Approach me not  --  dare not impede my flight . A virtuous death amid my country 's ruins , Will be more welcome than a life dishonoured , E'en in the splendid mansion of Apuleus . Exit . Luc .

What ho ! without there ! follow in pursuit ! Going , is met by Licinius Stolo . Licin . Licinius Stolo Where in such haste , worthy Apuleus ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus I can hold no parlance now , Licinius  --  Camilla  --  Licin . Licinius Stolo I know the pretty story . The dove has ' scaped the talons of the kite  --  Well , let her fly  --  methinks that times like these Are ill adapted for an am'rous war . It is reported that Camillus comes . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Her father ? then she will find a refuge In his arms , ere I could overtake her . ' T is better so , than he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Licinius Stolo We can not help it , Lucius . And when he comes ' t is Rome 's deliverance ; The tide of public love again will set In favour of the hero ; we must strive Still to divert its current , and make it turn Towards young Marcus Manlius , the youth Who saved the capitol , and by that exploit , Gain 'd the people 's love  --  shall we so , my friend ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus The means , Licinius ? Licin . Licinius Stolo Time will provide them . All now is calm  --  the Senate is about To listen to the terms proposed by Brennus , To which if we accede , the Gauls at once Will leave the city , ere Camillus comes , To force them to abandon it . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Where do they meet ? Licin . Licinius Stolo At the foot of the Capitoline hill . Shall we go thither ? we may do so now Unquestioned  --  we there can also feel The pulse of the people . Luc . Lucius Apuleus I attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes , If perchance he comes ere all be settled , They will again extol him like a god . There 's Flavius and Marcus Ceditus , Who have not lost a jot of love for him . Flavius will say , ( I know his humour , ) It was the geese that saved the capitol , Not Marcus Manlius ; and the wise people Will cry out , " so it was ! " and there ' twill end . Licin . Licinius Stolo Still let us make the effort . We will not lose A probable advantage , from the fear , That though we seek it , it may not be gained . It is idle to quit an enterprise , Because , forsooth , the timid conjure up A thousand obstacles , which ne'er exist , Save in imagination  --  airy nothings . Come , then ; on what now art thou brooding ? Luc . Lucius Apuleus I may meet Camilla . Licin . Licinius Stolo Well , and thou dost ? She will not strike thee dead  --  where is thy soul For enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , once more Apuleus . Why , boys , to see you thus , would laugh at you . Come among men again ; you have too long Remain 'd at home inactive  --  follow me . Luc .

Licinius Stolo Why this is well ; I know you now again . Follow at once ; if we would reach the hill Before the sun has taken leave of it , We must use speed . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Lead on , Licinius , Whatever be thy course , I 'll follow thee . Exeunt . SCENE III .  --  The Capitoline Hill .

Citizens Camillus ! hail , brave Camillus , hurrah ! Bren . Brennus What means all this ? Camillus , pointing to Cominius and Soldiers , who enter . Camillus .

Lucius Apuleus Such is the people 's voice ; they sigh for peace . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Silence ! I ask 'd the gen'ral voice , not thine . I marvel that you dare uplift it here . Speak , one that I can trust ; what say the people ? 1st Citizen . 1st Citizen Rome is in ashes ; we have not the means Wherewith to rebuild her walls again , Nor hearts to do so ; we will go to Veii .

SCENE I.  --  An Apartment in the Mansion of Lucius Apuleus . Enter Lucius Apuleus and Licinius Stolo . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Said I not truly , good Licinius , That when Camillus should return from exile The people would with open arms receive him , And hail him the deliverer of Rome ? Licin . Licinius Stolo Ay , truly ; and yet I tell thee , Lucius , We still may rob the eagle of his plumes . Camillus has oppos 'd the general wish To leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veii ; with faint hearts , The citizens rebuild their fallen homes , And murmur that perforce they must remain Dwellers in poverty ' mid desolation . Luc . Lucius Apuleus What should we do ? Licin . Licinius Stolo Go forth among the people , Sow wider still the seeds of discontent , And give a motive why Camillus wished That they should dwell in Rome , and not in Veii , Luc . Lucius Apuleus And what the motive you would so ascribe Unto the course Camillus has pursued ? Licin . Licinius Stolo Could we not say , and plausibly declare , That his ambition , not restrained by age , And thirst of glory , no success can quench , Craves still a higher title than Dictator ? In forcing them , weak , weary as they are , Thus to rebuild a ruin , when he knows That a fair city 's ready to receive them , He would invade the right of Romulus , And be styled no longer General , Or Dictator , but Founder of fair Rome . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a maiden 's word , And comes with an ill grace from Apuleus . Fear ! why , I and all that know you , sir , have seen Sparks of high spirit flash from you  --  fear , indeed ! Luc . Lucius Apuleus So , when the flint is struck , you may behold The fire it emits , that for an instant Glows , and dies . If pride , revenge , or hope of gain , Prompted me ever to o'erleap my nature , To speak as though I car 'd not for the world , Or strike a blow perchance , the next moment Saw the flame extinguish 'd , and beheld The timid creature nature made of me . Licin . Licinius Stolo Pshaw ! this is a schoolboy 's prattle . Go to , You wrong yourself ; or else , like a vain girl , That cunningly denies her charms , to court A compliment , so you declare yourself A very coward , to hear me praise you For a gallant man . Come , we will abroad . Luc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow presently ; I have business to transact at home That will awhile detain me . Licin .

I do not like that voice  --  Without there ! bar the entrance ! Camillus , Camillus ( without . ) Down , base slave ! I will not be denied  --  give way , I say , Or , by the gods ! I 'll strike thee to the earth ! Rushes in . Ha ! there he stands , the lord of this proud mansion ! Who would have barr 'd his gates against Camillus . Come , sir , where is she ? Luc .

Marcus Furius Camillus Not here ? where is she then conceal 'd ? Thou liest , slave ; she is beneath this roof , And thou wouldst rob the father of his child , The husband of his wife . Luc .

Then hast thou seen her  --  she was in thy charge . Have a care , Apuleus  --  I doubt you much ; I do , indeed ; a damning dark suspicion Fills my mind , with thoughts I would not name . Luc .

And she 's the type of all that 's chaste in heaven . No , ' t is thee I doubt , and not my gentle wife  --  She fled from thee , and she is spotless still .

" We 'll shrink not from the pestilence , which drives Even the mother from her dying babe ; But we will gaze on each unburied corse , And trace the livid lineaments of death , Until perchance among the tombless victims , The lifeless form of her I love I 'll find . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Horror ! Pon . Pontus Cominius Where are we ? I should know these ruins  --  Here once the mansion of Camillus stood ; Perchance she 's here  --  Camilla ! love ! my wife ! We 'll seek her in these desolated halls . Come , Apuleus  --  nay , struggle not , sir ; Anxiety has made me almost wild ; Thou shalt not leave me until she is found , Or I have had revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Pon . Pontus Cominius Nay , not thy life , Apuleus , not thy life . Aid me to find her ; why should'st thou refuse ? ' T was thou compelled her flight , and if indeed She 's lost to me , why thou must answer for it . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Permit me to depart ; I can not aid you . Would to heaven , thou could'st find Camilla . Pon . Pontus Cominius Is such thy honest wish ? then follow me . Come , we are losing time  --  away , away . Exeunt . Enter Flavius , Marcus Ceditus , and others . Mar . Marcus Ceditus Rages the pestilence so fiercely then ? Flav . Flavius In every section of the city , sir , Despair and death now grimly walk abroad . Man avoids man ; even the dying wretch Who craves for drink , to cool his fevered lips , Receives no succour , and he dies unheeded . The streets are sepulchres ; all nature 's changed ; Infants draw poison from their mother 's breast ; All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Mar . Marcus Ceditus Ah ! hapless Rome ! What make ye here ? why linger in the city ? Flav . Flavius Here , ' t is said , the atmosphere is purer , And hither we have come to seek a refuge From the fell destroyer , trusting , too , to find Among these ruins , our loved Camillus . Mar . Marcus Ceditus Where is the hero ? Flav . Flavius When last I saw him , With an anxious heart , bowed down with grief , He sought his child , the wife of young Cominius . Methought I saw but now a form glide by ; Perchance ' t is he  --  follow , good citizens . Exeunt . SCENE IV .  --  The dilapidated Gardens of Camillus . A plain marble Monument , at the foot of which Camillus is discovered kneeling , with Camilla , dead , in his arms . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Dead ! my darling one ! my fair daughter , dead ! She whom I loved ; so young and beautiful ! Upon this breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy sleep has sunk to rest , For ever  --  ay , for ever ! Well , what is life ? To drain the cup , that is presented to us , Or taste the food , daily before us placed , Ne'er constituted life , as life should be . To live , we must be useful , and to be useful , We must possess affection , friends , and hopes , To move us on to this same usefulness . But none of these have I  --  I am a lone one On this peopled earth  --  a blighted being , With a broken heart  --  old , hapless , useless ; I now am in the sear  --  my age is reft Of all that rendered life to me a blessing . I feel my hour is coming ; the coldness here , Laying his hand on his heart . Tells that death 's icy hand is on me now . The atmosphere is dense ; my breath grows short ; My brain 's confused ; oh ! I 'm sick at heart ! Lays the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleep by thy mother  --  I 'll watch thee ; The dying shall watch the dead . Gently  --  who comes ? Enter Pontus Cominius , Flavius , and the Citizens , with whom Lucius Apuleus has mingled . Ha ! Cominius ! look , look here , my son . ' T is she ! I found her , Cominius , found her A wandering maniac ! she died upon my breast . Look , look , what was once thy wife . Pon . Pontus Cominius ( bending over the body . ) Eternal gods ! Camilla ! ah ! Camilla ! Wilt thou not look on me ? wilt thou not speak One word , one little word , to bless me , love ? She hears me not  --  she ne'er will speak again . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Nay , never weep ; behold , I do not weep . I , that shed tears to bid farewell to Rome , Shed not a tear , when I beheld my child , Fade from this earth , for ever . Pon . Pontus Cominius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her parting blessing ; Thus found , when lost for ever ! Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Arouse thee , man ! Where is he ? where the wretch who drove her forth To breathe a pestilential atmosphere ? Approach me not , Cominius ; behold These livid spots , the poison 's in my blood . Fly for your life ! Have ye come , citizens , To join again the standard of Camillus ? Stop , I 'll not quit the field  --  I 'll still fight on ; First pluck this jav'lin from my bleeding wound ; Now then  --  charge ! charge ! ha ! bravely done , my friends ! Pon . Pontus Cominius Nay , Camillus  --  I do entreat ye , friends , Bear with him . Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Off , off ! I tell ye I am strong ; This wound is nought . Ha ! we have traitors here ! In Roman ranks a traitor ! O ! shame ! shame ! Will ye not drive him forth ? there he stands . This is he . Snatching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . Luc . Lucius Apuleus Help ! save me from this madman , Or I 'm lost ! Camillus . Marcus Furius Camillus Behold the sword of Justice ! I am her minister , and use it thus . Stabs Apuleus . I have obeyed the mandate of the gods ! Falls , overcome , by the body of Camilla . Luc . Lucius Apuleus ' T was to the heart ! I do entreat your prayers , And to the gods divine , commend my soul . Dies . Camillus , Camillus ( partially raising himself . ) Ye all look strangely on me . Look your last . The blood of life runs coldly in these veins . Thy hand , Cominius  --  nay , give it not ; I had forgot , there 's poison in my touch . All forms grow dim before me ! one is bright ! It is my daughter 's  --  see , she beckons me  --  Her voice is in mine ears . Yes , Camilla , I am coming to join thee , my fair child , For ever  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the body of Camilla . THE END . Back matter EPILOGUE . WRITTEN BY J. A. SHEA , ESQ . SPOKEN BY MISS RIDDLE . Admirers of the histrionic art , You of the lofty soul and tropic heart ; To-night you 've seen capricious fortune bear Camillus through his bright but sad career . His brow now circled with the laurel 's leaf , Rome 's conquering leader , and her people 's chief . Now by a fiend-born enmity pursued , Now wandering in self-exiled solitude ; Now , when his penitential country calls , Driving the Goth invader from her walls ; Now glad with hope ; now phrenzied with despair ; Fierce as a lion bounding from his lair . Beholding now the pestilential stain , Plague in his breast , and madness in his brain ; And to his country 's fortunes faithful still , Falling beneath an avalanche of ill . With what illustrious sorrow did that sire Behold the daughter of his heart expire ; That angel who , through all her star-like life , Loved as a daughter , worshipped as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virtue her shield , and dignity her guide . And oh ! what pride to see that dying dove Bless with her latest sigh her father 's love , And sinless , flying that defiling slave , Expire upon her buried mother 's grave . This lesson , friends , with Roman greatness fraught , Is by a young and native tutor taught . In our Camillus you behold a heart , Noble as well by nature as by art . Yes , yes ! in Pearson did you not behold , The patriot and the Roman lightning souled ? In the devoted daughter , you have one , Upon whose birth this classic city shone . Pride of my heart ! unmingled and alone ! The poet and the artists all your own ! In earlier days , when the barbarian horde Showered round Athenia 's walls with lance and sword , Minerva stood before their startled sight , And struck them with her eye 's electric light . Will not Columbia , too , her own defend ; Her Athens , Philadelphia  --  you her friend ? When foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched , bled , battled , and prevailed . Not less imperatively do we now , Request your laurels for a native 's brow . Then were you marshalled for your native land  --  To-night you 're not a less efficient band : By freedom 's banners you were then combined  --  To-night you join the banners of the mind .
