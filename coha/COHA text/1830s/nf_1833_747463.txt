txt /q/ thereof the archbishop pardoned Ursus . As a doctor , Ursus wrought cures by some means or other . He made use of aromatics ; he was versed in simples ; he made the most of the immense power which lies in a heap of neglected plants , such as the hazel , the catkin , the white alder , the white briony , the mealy-tree , the traveller 's joy , the buckthorn . He treated phthisis with the sundew ; at opportune moments he would use the leaves of the spurge , which plucked at the bottom are a purgative and plucked at the top , an emetic . He cured sore throat by means of the vegetable excrescence called Jew 's ear . He knew the rush which cures the ox and the mint which cures the horse . He was well acquainted with the beauties and virtues of the herb mandragora , which , as every one knows , is of both sexes . He had many recipes . He cured burns with the salamander wool , of which , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retort and a flask ; he effected transmutations ; he sold panaceas . It was said of him that he had once been for a short time in Bedlam ; they had done him the honor to take him for a madman , but had set him free on discovering that he was only a poet . This story was probably not true ; we have all to submit to some such legend about us . The fact is , Ursus was a bit of a savant , a man of taste , and . an old Latin poet . He was learned in two forms ; he Hippocratized and he Pindarized . He could have vied in bombast with Rapin and Vida . He could have composed Jesuit tragedies in a style not less triumphant than g BY ORDER OF THE KINO. that of father Bouhours . It followed from his familiarity with the venerable rhythms and metres of the ancients , that he had peculiar figures of speech , and a whole family of classical metaphors . He would say of a mother followed by her two daughters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two sons , There is an anapaest ; and of a little child walking between its grandmother and grandfather , There is an amphimacer. 80 much knowledge could only end in starvation . The school of Salerno says , " Eat little and often . " Ursus ate little and seldom , thus obeying one half the precept and disobeying the other ; but this was the fault of the public , who did not always flock to him and , who did not often buy . Ursus was wont to say : " The expectoration of a sentence is a relief . The wolf is comforted by its howl , the sheep by its wool , the forest by its finch , woman by her love , and the philosopher by his epiphonema . " UTS as at a pinch composed comedies , which , in recital , he all but acted ; this helped to sell the drugs . Among other works , he had composed an heroic pastoral in honor of Sir Hugh Middleton , who in 1608 brought a river to London . The river was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knight came and took possession of it . He brought a brigade of six hundred men , - armed with shovels and pickaxes ; set to breaking up the ground , scooping it out intone place , raising it in another now thirty feet high , now twenty feet deep ; made wooden aqueducts high in air ; and at different points constructed eight hundred bridges of stone , bricks , and timber . One fine morning the river entered London , which was short of water . Ursus transformed all these vulgar details into , fine Eclogue between the Thames and the New River , in which the former invited the latter to come to him , and offered her his bed , saying , " I am too old to please women , but I am rich enough to pay them , " an ingenious and gallant conceit to indicate how Sir Hugh Middleton had completed the work at his own expense . Ursus was great in soliloquy . Of a disposition at once unsociable and talkative , desiring to see no one , yet wishing to converse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to himself . Any one who has lived a solitary life knows how deeply seated monologue is in one 's nature . Speech imprisoned frets to find a yent . To harangue /q/ space is an outlet . To speak out aloud when alone is as it were to have a dialogue with the divinity which is within . It was , as is well known , a custom of Socrates ; he declaimed to himself . Luther did the same . Ursus took after those great men . He had the hermaphrodite faculty of being his own audience . He questioned himself , answered himself , praised himself , blamed himself . You heard him in the street soliloquizing in his van . The passers-by , who have their own way of appreciating clever people , used to say : He is an idiot . As we have just observed , he abused himself at times ; but there were times also when he rendered himself justice . One day , in one of these allocutions addressed to himself , he was heard to cry out , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the bud , in the sepal , in the stamen , in the carpel , in the ovule , in the spore , in the theca , and in the apothecium . I have thoroughly sifted chromatics , osmosy , and chymosy ; that is to say , the formation of colors , of smell , and of taste . " There was something fatuous , doubtless , in this certificate which Ursus gave to Ursus ; but let those who have not thoroughly sifted chromatics , osmosy , and chymosy cast the first stone at him . Fortunately Ursus had never gone into the Low Countries ; there they would certainly have weighed him , to ascertain whether he was of the- normal weight , above or below which a man is a sorcerer . In Holland this weight was sagely fixed by law . Nothing was simpler or more ingenious . It was a clear test . They put you in a scale , and the evidence was conclusive if you broke the equilibrium . Too heavy , you were hanged ; too light , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were weighed may be seen at Oudewater , but they are now used for weighing cheeses ; how religion has degenerated ! Ursus vould certainly have had a crow to pluck with those scales . In his travels he kept away from Holland , and he did well . Indeed , we believed that he used never to leave the United Kingdom . However this may have been , he was very poor and morose , and having made the acquaintance of Homo in a wood , a taste Tor a wandering life had come over him . He had taken the wolt into partnership , and with him had gone forth on the highways , living in the open air the /z/ great life of chance . He had . a great deal of industry and of reserve , and great skill in everything connected with healing operations , restoring the sick to health , and in working wonders peculiar to himself . He was considered a clever mountebank and a good doctor . As may be imagined , he passed for a wizard as well , not much indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days to be considered a friend of the devil . To tell the truth , Ursus , by his passion for pharmacy and his love of plants , laid himself open to suspicion , seeing that he often went to gather herbs in rough thickets where grew Lucifer 's salads , and where , as has been proved by the Counsellor De FAncre , there is a risk of meeting in the evening mist a man who comes out of the earth , " blind of the right eye , bare-footed , without a cloak , and a sword by his side . " But for the matter of that , Ursus , although eccentric in manner and disposition , was too good a fellow to invoke or disperse hail , to make faces appear , to kill a man with the torment of excessive dancing , to suggest dreams fair or foul and full of terror , and to cause the birth of cocks with four wings . He had no such mischievous tricks . He was incapable of certain abominations , such as , for instance , speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , which is a sign of unpardonable wickedness , or of a natural infirmity proceeding from a morbid humor . If Ursus spoke Latin , it was because he knew it . He would never have allowed himself to speak Syriac , which he did not know . Besides , it is asserted that Syriac is the language spoken in the midnight meetings at which uncanny people worship the devil . In medicine he justly preferred Galen to Cardan ; Cardan , although a learned man , being but an earthworm to Galen . To sum up , Ursus was not one of those persons who live in fear of the police . His van was long enough and wide enough to allow of his lying down in it on a box containing his not very sumptuous apparel . He owned a lantern , several wigs , and some utensils suspended from nails , among which were musical instruments . He possessed , besides , a bearskin with which he covered himself on his days of grand performance . He calle 'd this putting on full dress . He used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the real one , " pointing to the bearskin , ST ORDER OF ThJS AltfQ . The little house on wheels belonged to himself and to the wolf . Besides this house , his retort , and his wolf , h had a flute and a violoncello on which he played prettily . He concocted his own elixirs . His wits yielded him enough to sup on sometimes . In the top of his van ff-as a hole , through which passed the pipe of a cast-iron stove ; so close to his bed as to scorch the wood of it . Tht stove had two compartments ; in one of them Ursua cooked his chemicals , and in the other his potatoes . At night the wolf slept under the van , amicably secured bj a chain . Homo 's hair was black , that of Ursus , gray ; Ursus was fifty , unless , indeed , he was sixty . He accepted his destiny , to such an extent that , as we have just seen , he ate potatoes , the trash on which at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignant , but resigned . He was not tall he was long . He was bent and melancholy . The bowed frame of an old man is the settlement in the architecture of life . Nature had formed him for sadness . He found it difficult to smile , and he had never been able to weep , so that he was deprived of the consolation of tears , as well as of the palliative of joy . An old man is a thinking ruin ; and such a ruin was IJrsus . He had the loquacity of a charlatan , the leanness of a prophet , the irascibility of a charged mine : such was Ursus . In his youth he had been a philosopher in the house of a lord . This was 180 years ago , when men were more like wolves than they are now . Not so very much though . /z/ HOMO was no ordinary wolf . From his appetite for medlars and potatoes he might have been taken for a Erairie wolf ; from his dark hide , for a lycaon ; and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chili . But no one has as yet observed the eyeball of a dog of Chili sufficiently to enable us to determine whether he be not a fox , and Homo was a real wolf . He was five feet long , which is a fine length for a wolf , even in Lithuania ; he was very itrong ; he looked at you askance , which was not his fault ; he had a soft tongue , with which he occasionally licked Ursus ; he had a narrow brush of short bristles on his back /z/ bone , and he was lean with the wholesome leanness of a forest life . Before he knew Ursus and had a carriage to draw , he thought nothing of doing his fifty miles a night . Ursus meeting him in a thicket near a stream of running water , had conceived a high opinion of him from seeing the skill and sagacity with which he fished out crayfish , and welcomed him us an honest and genuine Koupara wolf of the kind called crab-eater . As a beast of burthen , Ursus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repugnance to having his hut drawn by an ass ; he thought too highly of the ass for that . Moreover he had observed that the ass , a four-legged thinker little understood by men , has a habit of cocking his ears uneasily when philosophers talk nonsense . In life the ass is a third person between our thoughts and ourselves , and acts as a restraint . As a friend , Ursus preferred Homo to a dog , considering that the love of a wolf is more rare . Hence it was that Homo sufficed for Urstis . Homo was for Ursus more than a companion , he was an analogue . Ursus used to pat the wolfs empty ribs , saying : " I have found the second volume of myself ! " Again he said , " When I am dead , any one wishing to know me need only study Homo . I shall leave a true copy behind me . " The English law , not very lenient to beasts of the forest , might have picked a quarrel with the wolf , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the towns : but Homo took advantage of the immunity granted by a statute of Edward IY. to servants : " Every servant in attendance on his master is free to come and go . " Besides , a certain relaxation of the law had resulted with regard to wolves , in consequence of its being the fashion of the ladies of the Court , under the later Stuarts , to have , instead of dogs , little wolves , called adives , about the size of cats , which were brought from Asia at great cost . Ursus had communicated to Homo a portion of his talents : such as to stand upright , to restrain his rage into sulkiness , to growl instead of howling , etc. ; and on MR part , the wolf had taught the man what he knew , to do without a roof , without bread and fire , to prefer hunger in the woods to slavery in a palace . The van , hut , and vehicle in one , which traversed so many different roads , without , however , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wolf and a splinter-bar for the man . The splinter-bar came into use when the roads were bud . The van was strong , although it was built of light boards like a dove-cot . In front there was a glass door with a little balcony used for orations , which had something of the character of the platform tempered by an air of the pulpit . At the back there was a door with a practicable panel . By lowering the three steps which turned on a hinge below the door , access was gained to the hut , which at night was securely fastened with bolt and lock . Rain and snow had fallen plentifully on it ; it had been painted , but of what color it was difficult to say , change of season being to vans what changes of reign are to courtiers . In front , outside , was a board , a kind of frontispiece , on which the following inscription might once have been deciphered ; it was in black letters on a white ground , but by degrees the characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses every year a fourteen hundredth part of its bulk . This is what is called the Wear . Hence it follows that on fourteen hundred millions of gold in circulation throughout the world , one million is lost annually . This million dissolves into dust , flies away , floats about , is reduced to atoms , charges , drugs , weighs down consciences , amalgamates with the souls of the rich whom it renders proud , and with those of the poor whom it renders brutish . " The inscription , rubbed and blotted by the rain and by kindness of nature , was fortunately illegible , for it is possible that its philosophy concerning the inhalation of gold , at the same time both enigmatical and lucid , might not have been to the taste of the sheriffs , the provost-marshals and other big-wigs of the law . English legislation did not trifle in those days . It did not take much to make a man a fellow . The magistrates were ferocious by tradition , and cruelty was a matter of routine . The judges of assize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . IN the interior of the van there were two other inscriptions . Above the box , on a , white- washed plank , a had written in ink as follows : /z/ The Baron , peer of England , wears a cap with six pearls . The coronet begins with the rank of Viscount . The Viscount wears a coronet of which the pearls are without number .

I hope , however , that I may be excused for having ventured to correct some manifest slips which M. Hugo has made in preparing for Ursus the description of the rights and privileges of the English peerage . I have not , indeed , corrected all mistakes . Thus , for example , in the very first sentences of this passage about the peerage , it is stated that the baron wears only a cap , and that the viscount is the lowest rank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end of Charles the Second 's reign . It is not true now , and it was not true at the time when Ursus wrote . Yet it was a statement which he might reasonably have supposed to be true , and therefore I have let it remain . I have even ventured to pass anachronisms of the opposite kind where Ursus speaks of that as existing which had not yet come to pass . Thus there will be found among his list of great peers , at the period of the Revolution , some titles , as those of Lords Granthain , Lonsdale , Scarborough , Kent , and ConIngsby , which were not created till afterwards when the century wa at its close , or even when the next century had commenced . These are errors of detail which do not interfere with the general truth of the picture . With other statements which never were at any time true , 1 have been less tender . Thus I have struck out the statement that , on the top of Devonshire House , there was a lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , where the writer states that daily in the king 's palace there were eighty-six tables spread , each with 500 dishes , I have ventured to give the true statement that there were 500 dishes in all . And so with some other details . With a few passages I have had a little difficulty in deciding how to deal . Thus Victor Hugo makes his hero write " Toute fille de lord est lady . Les autres filles anglaises sont miss . " With regard to the first of these statements it is well known that every daughter of a peer does not bear the title of lady ; it is only the daughters of a duke , a marquis , or an earl , who are so honored . Still , in the general obfuscation of intellect which titular niceties are apt to produce , Ursus. might be supposed likely to designate as lady every peer 's daughter whomsoever . On the other hand , the daughters of commoners were not called miss in those days , and I have made bold to give the title which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the details as to THE ONLY THINGS NECESSARY TO KNOW are borrowed from Chamberlayne 's well-known work . The Present State of England , and that I am a little surprised at the omission by M. Victor Hugo and his hero Ursus of one curious touch which will be found in Chamberlayne 's chapter on the peerage " No viscount is to wash with a marquis , but at his pleasure .

Lords who are not peers are lords by courtesy : there are LIO real lords , excepting such as are peers .

The Commons send up their bills by forty members , who present the bill with thre low bows . The Lords send their bills to the Commons by a mere clerk . In case of disagreement , the two Houses confer in the Painted Chamber , the Peers seated and covered , the Commons standing and bareheaded . " Peers go to parliament in their coaches in file ; the Commons do not . Some peers go to Westminster in open four-wheeled chariots .

It is tcell. /z/ URSUS admired Homo . One admires one 's like . It is a law . To be always raging inwardly and grumbling outwardly was the normal condition of Ursus . He was the malcontent of creation . By nature he was a man ever in oppoaition. /q/ He took the world unkindly ; he gave his satisfecit to no one and to nothing . The bee did not atone , by its honey-making , for its sting ; a full-blown rose did not absolve the sun for yellow fever and black vomit . It is probable that in secret Ursus criticised Providence a good deal . " Evidently , " he would say , " the devil works by a spring , and the wrong that God does is having let go the trigger . " He approved of none but Erinces , and he had his own peculiar way of expressing is approbation . One day , when James II . made a gift to the Virgin in a Catholic chapel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way with Homo , who was more indifferent to such things , broke out in admiration before the crowd , and exclaimed , " It is certain that the blessed Virgin wants a lamp much more than those barefooted children there require shoes . " Such proofs of his loyalty , and such evidences of his respect for established powers , probably contributed in no small degree to make the magistrates tolerate his vagabond life and his low alliance with a wolf . Sometimes of an evening , through the weakness of friendship , he allowed Homo to stretch his limbs and wander at liberty about the caravan . The wolf was incapable of an abuse of confidence , and behaved in society , that is to say among men , with the discretion of a poodle . All the same , if bad-tempered officials had to be dealt with , difficulties might have arisen ; so Ursus kept the honest wolf chained up as much as possible . From a political point of view his writing about gold , not very intelligible in itself , and now become undecipherable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the enemy . Even after the time of James II. , and under the " respectable " reign of William and Mary , his caravan might have been seen peacefully going its rounds of the little English country towns . He travelled freely from one end of Great Britain to the other , selling his philtres and phials , and sustaining , with the assistance of his wolf , his quack mummeries ; and he passed with ease through the meshes of the nets which the police at that period had spread all over England in order to sift wandering gangs , and especially to stop the progress of the Comprachicos . This was right enough . Ursus belonged to no gang . Ursua lived with Ursus , a t3te-d-t$te , into which the wolf /z/ gently thrust his nose . If TJrsus could have had his way , lie would have been a Caribee ; that being impossible , he preferred to be alone . The solitary man is a modified savage , accepted by civilization . He who wanders most is most alone ; hence his continual change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sense of being tamed . He passed his life in passing on his way . The sight of towns increased his taste for brambles , thickets , thorns , and holes in the rock . His home was the forest . He did not feel himself much out of his element in the murmur of crowded streets , which is like enough to the bluster of trees . The crowd to some extent satisfies our taste for the desert . What he disliked in his van was its having a door and windows , and thus resembling a house . lie would have realized his ideal , had he been able to put a cave on four wheels and travel in a den . He did not smile , as we have already said , but he used to laugh ; sometimes , indeed frequently , a bitter laugh . There is consent in a smile , while a laugh is often a refusal . His great business was to hate the human race . He was implacable in that hate . Having made it clear that human life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils , kings on the people , war on kings , the plague on war , famine on the plague , folly on everything , having proved a certain measure of chastisement in the mere fact of existence , having recognized that death is a deliverance , when they brought him a sick man he cured him ; he had cordials and beverages to prolong the lives of the old . He put lame cripples on their legs again , and hurled this sarcasm at them , " There , you are on your paws once more may you walk long in this valley of tears ! " When he saw a poor man dying of hunger , he gave him all the pence he had about him , growling out , " Live on , you wretch ! eat ! last a long time ! It is not I who would shorten your penal servitude . " After which , he would **ub his hands and say , " I do men all the harm I can .

The Comprachicos or Coraprapequenos , were a hideous and nondescript association of wanderers , famous in the 17th century , forgotten in the 18th , unheard of in the 19th . The Comprachicos are like the " succession powder , " an ancient social characteristic detail . They are part of old human ugliness . To the great eye of history , which sees everything collectively , the Comprachicos belong to the colossal fact gf slavery . Joseph sold by his brethren is a chapter in their story . The Comprachicos have left their traces in the penal laws of Spain and England . You find here and there in the dark confusion of English laws the impress of this horrible truth , like the foot-print of a savage in a forest . Comprachicos , the same as Comprapequenos , is a compound Spanish word signifying Child-buyers . The Comprachicos traded in children . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The kidnapping of children is another branch of industry . And what did they make of these children ? Monsters . Why monsters ? To laugh at . The populace must needs laugh ; and kings too . The mountebank is wanted in the streets ; the jester at the Louvre . The one is called a Clown , the other a Fool . The efforts of man to procure himself pleasure are at times worthy of the attention of the philosopher . What are we sketching in these few preliminary pages ? A chapter in the most terrible of books ; a book which might be entitled The Farming of the unhappy by the BY OR***m vf THE KING . /z/ A CHILD destined to be a plaything for men such a thing has existed ; such &; thing exists even now . In gimpie and savage times such a thing constituted an sptcial trade . The 17th century , called the great century , wai of those times . It was a century very Byzantine in ton* . It combined corrupt simplicity with delicate ferocity ; a curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame de Sevigne minces on the subject of the fagot and the wheel . That century traded a good deal in children . Flattering historians have concealed the sore , biat have divulged the remedy. , Vincent de Paul . In order that a human toy should succeed , he must be taken early . The dwarf must be fashioned when young . We play with childhood . But a well-formed child is not very amusing ; a hunchback is better fun . Hence grew an art . There were trainers who took a man and made him an abortion ; they took a face and made a muzzle ; they stunted growth ; ' they kneaded the features . The artificial production of teratological cases had its rules . It was quite a science ; what one can imagine as the antithesis of orthopedy . Where God had put a look , their art put a squint ; where God had made harmony , they made discord ; where God had made the perfect picture , they re-established the sketch ; and , in the eyes of connoisseurs , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well ; they invented piebald horses . Turenne rod a piebald horse . In our own days do they not dye dogs blue and green ? Nature is our canvas . Men has always wished to add something to God 's work . Man retouches creation , sometimes for better some* times for worse . The Court buffoon was nothing but an attempt to lead back man to the monkey . It was a progress the wrong way . A masterpiece in retrogression . At the same time they tried to make a man of the monkey . Barbara , Duchess of Cleveland and Countess of Southampton had a marmoset for a page . Frances Sutton , Baroness of Dudley , eighth peeress in the bench of barons , had tea served by a baboon clad in gold brocade , which her ladyship called My Black . Catherine Sedley , Countess of Dorchester , used to go and take her seat /q/ in Parliament in a coach with armorial bearings , behind which stood , their muzzles stuck up in the air , three Cape monkeys in grand ) ivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed , had her stockings put on by an orang-outang . These monkeys raised in the scale were a counterpoise to men brutalized and bestialized . This proiniscuousness of man and beast , desired by the great , was especially prominent in the case of the dwarf and the dog . The dwarf never quitted the dog , which was always bigger than himself . The dog was the pair of the dwarf ; it was as if they were coupled with a collar . This juxtaposition is authenticated by a mass of domestic records ; notably by the portrait of Jeffrey Hudson , dwarf of Henrietta of France , daughter of Henri IV. , and wife of Charles I. To degrade man tends to deform him . The suppression of his state was completed by disfigurement . Certain yivisectors of that period succeeded marvellously well in effacing from the human face the divine effigy . Doctor Conquest , member of the Amen-street College , and judicial visitor of the chemists ' shops of London , wrote a book in Latin on this pseudo-surgery , the processes of which he describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inventor of this branch of surgery was a monk named Avonmore ; an Irish word signifying Great River . The dwarf of the Elector Palatine , Perkeo , whose effigy or ghost springs from a magical box in the cave of Heidelberg , was a remarkable specimen of this science , rery varied in its applications . It fashioned btings the law of whose existence was hideously simple : it permitted them to suffer , and commanded them to amuse. in . Ts manufacture of monsters was practised on a large cale , and comprised various branches . The Sultan required them , so did the Pope ; the one to guard his women , the other to say his prayers . These were of a peculiar kind , incapable of reproduction . Scarcely human beings , they were useful to voluptuousness and to religion . The seraglio and the Sistine Chapel /z/ utilized the same species of monsters ; fierce in the former case , mild in the latter . They knew how to produce things in those days which are not produced now ; they had talents which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good folk cry out that the decline has come . We no longer know how to sculpture living human flesh ; this is consequent on the loss of the art of torture . Men were once virtuosi in that respect , but are so no longer ; the art has become so simplified that it will soon disappear altogether . In cutting the limbs of living men , in opening their bellies and in dragging out their entrails , phenomena were grasped on the moment and discoveries made . We are obliged to renounce these experiments now , and are thus deprived of the progress which surgery made by aid of the executioner . The vivisection of former days was not limited to the manufacture of phenomena for the market-place , of buffoons for the palace ( a species of augmentative of the courtier ) , and eunuchs for sultans and popes . It abounded in varieties . One of its triumphs was the manufacture of cocks for the king of England . It was the custom , in the palace of the kings of England , to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This watcher , awake while all others slept , ranged the palace , and raised from hour to hour the cry of the farmyard , repeating it as often as was necessary , and thus supplying a clock . This man , promoted to be cock , had in childhood undergone the operation of the pharynx which was part of the art described by Dr. Conquest . Under Charles II . the salivation inseparable to the operation having disgusted the Duchess of Portsmouth , the appointment was indeed preserved , so that the splendor of the crown should not be tarnished , but they got an unmutilated man to represent the cock . A retired officer was generally selected for this honorable employment . Under James II . the functionary was named William Sampson , Cock , and received for his crow 9 2d. 6s. annually. * * M.

These fashions have passed away ; but not so much , perhaps , as one might imagine . Now a days , courtiers slightly modify their intonation in clucking to please their masters . More than one picks up from the ground we will not say from the mud what he eats . It is very fortunate that kings can not err . Hence their contradictions never perplex us .

" /z/ what his displeasure was when Madame Henrietta forgot herself so far as to see a hen in a dream which was , indeed , a grave breach of good manners in a lady of th Court . When one is of the court , one should not dream of the courtyard . Bossuet , it may be remembertd , was nearly as scandalized as Louis XIV . /z/ THE commerce in children in the 17th century , as we have explained , was connected with a trade . The Comprachicos engaged in the commerce , and carried on th trade . They bought children , worked a littte on the raw material , and re-sold them afterwards . The vendors were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his family , to the master , utilizing his stud of slaves . The sale of men was a simple matter . In our own time we have had fighting to maintain this right . Remember that it is less than a century ago since the Elector of Hesse sold his subjects to the King of England , who required men to be killed in America . Kings went to the Elector of Hesse as we go to the butcher to buy meat . The Elector had food for powder in stock , and hung up his subjects in his shop . Come buy , it is for sale . In England , under Jeffreys , after the tragical episode of Monmouth , there were many lords and gentlemen beheaded and quartered . Those who were executed left wives and daughters , widows - and orphans , whom James II . gave to the queen , his wife . The queen sold these ladies to William Penn . Very likely the king had so much per cent , on the transaction . The extraordinary thing is not that James II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have bought them . the Penn 's purchase is excused , or explained , by the fact that having a desert to sow with men , he needed women as farming implements . Her Gracious Majesty made a good business out of thesw ladies . The young sold dear . We may imagine , with th uneasy feeling which a complicated scandal arouses , thai ; probably some old duchesses were thrown in cheap . The Comprachicos were also called the Cheylas , a Hindoo word , which conveys the image of harrying a nest . For a long time the Comprachicos only partially con. /q/ ocaled themselves . There is sometimes in the social order a favoring shadow thrown over iniquitous trades , in which they thrive . In our own day we have seen an association of the kind in Spain , under the direction of the ruffian Ramon Selles , last from 1834 to 1866 , and hold three provinces under terror for thirty years Valencia , Alicante , and Murcia . Under the Stuarts , the Comprachicos were by no means in bad odor at court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For James II . they were almost an instrumentum regni . It was a time when families , which were refractory or in the way , were dismembered ; when a descent was cut short ; when heirs were suddenly suppressed . At times one branch was defrauded to the profit of another . The Comprachicos had a genius for disfiguration which recommended them to state-policy . To disfigure is better than to kill . There was , indeed , the Iron Mask , but that was a mighty measure . Europe could not be peopled with iron masks , while deformed tumblers ran about the streets without creating any surprise . Besides , the iron mask is removable ; not so the mask of flesh . You are masked forever by your own flesh what can be more ingenious ? The Comprachicos worked on man as the Chinese work on trees . They had their secrets , as we have said ; they had tricks which are now lost arts . A sort of fantastic stunted thing left their hands ; it was ridiculous and wonderful . They would touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have known it . Et que meconnaitrait Vcieil meme de sonpdre , as Racine says in bad French . Sometimes they left the spine straight and remade the face . They unmarked a child as one might unmark a pocket-handkerchief . Products , doslined for tumblers , had their joints dislocated in a masterly manner you would have said they had been boned . Thus gymnasts were made . Not only did the Comprachicos takeaway his face from the child , they also took away his memory . At least they took away all they could of it ; the child had no consciousness of the mutilation to which he had been subjected . This frightful surgery left its traces on his countenance , but not on his mind . The most he could recall was that one day he had been seized by men , that next he had fallen asleep , and then that he had been /z/ cured . Cured of whac ? he did not*know . Of burnings by sulphur and incisions by the iron he remembered nothing . The Comprachicos deadened the little patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be magical , and suppressed all pain . This powder has been known from time immemorial in China , and is still employed there in the present day . The Chinese have been beforehand with us in all our inventions printing- , artillery , aerostation , chloroform . Only the discovery which in Europe at once takes life and birth , and becomes a prodigy and a wonder , remains a chrysalis in China , and is preserved in a deathlike state . China is a museum of embryos . Since we are in China , let us remain there a moment to note a peculiarity . In China , from time immemorial , they have possessed a certain refinement of industry and art . It is the art of moulding a living man . They take a child , two or three years old , put him in a porcelain vase , more or less grotesque , which is made without top or bottom , to allow egress for the head and feet . During the day the vase is set upright , and at night is laid down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without growing taller , filling up with his compressed flesh and distorted bones the reliefs in the vase . This development in a bottle continues many years . After a certain time it becomes irreparable . When they consider that this is accomplished , and the monster made , they break the vase . The child comes out and , behold , there is a man in the shape of a mug ! This is convenient ; by ordering your dwarf betimes you are able to have it of any shape you wish . v. JAMES II . tolerated the Comprachicos for the good reason that he made use of them ; at least it happened that he did so more than once . We do not always disdain to ust what we despise . This low trade , an excellent expedient sometimes for the higher one which is called state policy , was willingly left in a miserable state , but was not persecuted . There was no surveillance , but a certain amount of attention . Thus much might be useful the law closed one eve , the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as to avow his complicity . These are audacities of monarchical terrorism . The disfigured one was marked with the fleur-de-lys ; they took from him the mark of God , they put on him the mark of the king . Jacob Astley , knight and baronet , lord of Melton Constable , in the county of Norfolk , had in his family a child who had been sold , and upon whose forehead the dealer had imprinted a fleur-de-lys with a hot iron . In certain cases in which it was held desirable to register for some reason the royal origin of the new position made for the child , they used such means . England has always done us the honor to utilize , for her personal service , the fleur-de-lys . The Comprachicos , allowing for the shade which divides a trade from a fanaticism , were analogous to the Stranglers of India . They lived among themselves in gangs , and to facilitate their progress , effected somewhat of the Merry- Andrew . They encamped here and there , but they were grave and religous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft . The people for a long time wrongly confounded them with the Moors of Spain and the Moors of China . The Moors of Spain were coiners , the Moors of China were thieves . There was nothing of the sort about the Comprachicos ; they were honest folk . Whatever you may think of them , they were sometimes sincerely scrupulous . They pushed open a door , entered , bargained for a child , paid , and departed . All was done with propriety . They were of air countries . Under the name of Comprachicos fraternized English , French , Castilians , Germans , Italians . A unity of idea , a unity of superstition , ' the pursuit of the same calling , make such fusions . In this fraternity of vagabonds , those of the Mediterranean seaboard represented the East , those of the Atlantic seaboard the West . Many Basques conversed with many Irishmen . The Basque and the Irishman understand each other , they speak the old Punic jargon ; add to this the intimate relations of Catholic Ireland with Catholic Spain relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London one almost King of Ireland , the Celtic Lord de Brany ; from which resulted the conquest of the county of Leitrim . The Comprachicos were rather a fellowship than a /z/ tribe ; rather a residuum than a fellowship . It was all the riff-raff of the universe , having for their trade a crime . It was a sort of harlequin people , till composed of rags . To recruit a man was to sew on a tatter . To wander was the Comprachicos ' law of existence to appear and disappear . What is barely tolerated can not take root . Even in the kingdom o where their business supplied the courts , and , on occasions , served as an auxiliary to the royal power , they were nowand then suddenly ill-treated . Kings made use of their art , and sent the artists to the galleys . These inconsistencies belong to the ebb and flow of royal caprice . " For such is our pleasure . " A rolling stone and a roving trade gather no moss . The Comprachicos were poor . They might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she saw them setting fire to the stake , " Le jeu n'en vaut pas la chandelle . " It is possible , nay probable , ( their chiefs remaining unknown , ) that the wholesale contractors in the trade were rich . After the lapse of two centuries , it would be difficult to throw any light on this point . It was , as we have said , a fellowship . It had its laws , its oaths , its formulae it had . almost its cabala . Any one nowadays wishing to know all about the Comprachicos , need only go into Biscaya or Galicia ; there were mau.y Basques among them , and it is in those mountains that one hears their history . To this day the Comprachicos are spoken of at Oyarzun , ai Urbistoudo , at Leso , at Astigarraga . Aguardate nino , que voy a llamar al Comprachios , Take care , child , or I 'll call the Comprachicos , is the cry with which mothers frighten their children in that country . The Comprachicos , like the Zigeuner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From time to time their leaders conferred together . In the seventeenth century they had four principal points of rendezvous . One in Spain , the pass of Pancorbo ; one in Germany , the glade called the Wicked Woman , near Diekirsch , where there are two enigmatic bas-reliefs , representing a woman with a head and a man without one ; one in France , the hill where was the colossal statue of Massue-la- Promt , in the old sacred wood of Borvo Tomona , near Bourbonne les Bains one in England , behind the garden wall of /q/ William Challoner , Squire of Gisborough in Cleveland , Yorkshire , behind the square tower and the great wing which is entered by an arched door . /z/ THE laws against vagabonds have always been very rigorous in England . England , IP her Gothic legislation , seemed to be inspired with this ? dnciple , Homo errans f era err ante pej or . One of the sy ; cial statutes classifies the man without a home as " mow dangerous than the asp , dragon , lynx , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lynce , et basilico ) . For a long time Er ' land troubled herself as much concerning the gipsies , o whom she wished to be rid , as about the wolves of whih she had been cleared . In that the Englishman differed from the Irishman , who prayed to the saints for the health of the wolf , and called him my godfather . English law , nevertheless , in the same way as ( we have just seen ) it tolerated the wolf , tamed , domesticated , and become in some sort a dog , tolerated the regular vagabond , become in some sort a subject . It did not trouble itself about either the mountebank or the travelling barber , or the quack doctor , or the pedler , or the open-air scholar , as long as they had a trade to live by . Further than this , and with these exceptions , the description of freedom which exists in the wanderer terrified the law . A tramp was a possible public enemy . That modern thing , the lounger , was then unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . A suspicious appearance , that indescribable something which all understand and none can define , was sufficient reason that society should take a man by the collar . " Where do you live ? How do you get your living ? " And if he could not answer , harsh penalties awaited him . Iron and fire were in the code : the law practised the cauterization of vagrancy . Hence , throughout English territory , a veritable " loi des suspects " was applicable to vagrants ( who it must be ned , readily became malefactors ) , and particularly to gipsies whose expulsion has erroneously been compared to the expulsion of the Jews and the Moors from Spain , Btf BY ORDER OF THE KING . and the Protestants from France . As for us , we do not confound a battue with a persecution . The Comprachicos , we insist , had nothing in common with the gipsies . The gipsies were a nation ; the Comprachicos were a compound of all nations the lees of ft horrible vessel full of filthy waters . The Comprachicoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own ; their jargon was ft promiscuous collection of idioms : all languages were mixed together in their language ; . they spoke a medley . Like the gipsies , they had come to be a people winding through the peoples ; but their common tie was association , not race . At all epochs in history one finds in the vast liquid mass which constitutes humanity some of these streams of venomous men exuding poison around them . The gipsies were a tribe ; the Comprachicos a freemasonry a masonry having not a noble aim , but a hideous handicraft . Finally , their religions differ the gipsies were Pagans , the Comprachicos were Christians , and more than that , good Christians , as became an association which , although a mixture of all nations , owed its birth to Spain , a devout land . They were more than Christians , they were Catholics ; they were more than Catholics , they were Romans , and so touchy in their faith , and so pure , that they refused to associate with the Hungarian nomads of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , having for sceptre a wand with a silver ball , surmounted by the double-headed Austrian eagle . It is true that these Hungarians were schismatics , to the extent of celebrating the Assumption on the 29th August , which is an abomination . In England , so long as the Stuarts reigned , the confederation of the Comprachicos was ( for motives of which we have already given you a glimpse ) to a certain extent protected . James II. , a devout man , who persecuted the Jews and trampled out the gipsies , was a good prince to the Comprachicos . We have seen why . The Comprachicos were buyers of the human wares in which he wa dealer . They excelled in disappearances . Disappearance* are occasionally necessary for the good of the State . An inconvenient heir of tender age whom they took and handled lost his shape . This facilitated confiscation ; the transfer of titles to favorites was simplified . The /q/ Comprachicos were , moreover , very discreet , and very taciturn . They bound themselves to silence and kept their word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was scarcely an example of their having betrayed the *crets of the king . This was , it is true , for their interest ; and if the king had lost confidence in them , they would have been in great danger . They were thus of use in a political point of view . Moreover these artists furnished singers for the Holy Father . The Comprachicos were useful for the Miserere of Allegri . They were particularly devoted to Mary . All this pleased the papistry of the Stuarts . James IT . could not be hostile to holy men who pushed their devotion to the Virgin to the extent of manufacturing eunuchs . In 1688 there was a change of dynasty T in England . Orange supplanted Stuart . William III . replaced James II . James II . went away to die in exile , miracles were performed on his tomb , and his relics cured the Bishop of Autun of fistula a worthy recompense of the Christian virtues of the prince . William , having neither the same ideas nor the same practices as James , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crush out the vermin . A statute of the early part of Willinln and Mary 's reign hit the association of child-buyers hard . It was as the blow of a club to the Comprachicos , who were from that time pulverized . By the terms of this statute those of the fellowship taken and duly convicted , were to be branded with a red-hot iron , imprinting R , on the shoulder , signifying rogue ; on the left hand T , signifying thief ; and on the right hand M , signifying man-slayer . The chiefs , " supposed to be rich , although beggars in appearance , " were to be punished in the coUisfrigiiim that is , the pillory , and branded on the forehead with a P , besides having their goods confiscated , and the trees in their woods rooted up . Those who did not inform against the Comprachicos were to be punished by confiscation and imprisonment for life , as for the crime of misprision . As for the women found among these men , they were to uffer the cucking-stool this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French word coquine , and the German stuhl . English law being endowed with a strange Longevity , this punishment still exists in English legisla- /z/ tion for quarrelsome women . The cucking-stool is suspended over a river or a pond , the woman seated on it . The chair is allowed to drop into the water , and then pulled out . This dipping of the woman is repeated three , times , " to cool her anger , " says the commentator , Chan* Werlayne. /z/ At* obstinate north - wind blew without ceasing over the mainland of Europe , and yet more roughly over England , during all the month of December , 1689 , and all the month of January , 1690 . Hence the disastrous cold weather , which caused that winter to be noted as " memorable to the poor , " on the margin of the old Bible in the Presbyterian chapel of the Non-jurors in London . Thanks to the lasting qualities of the old monarchical parchment employed in official registers , long lists of poor persons , found dead of famine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in the archives of the Liberty of the Clink , in the borough of Southwark , of Pie Powder Court ( which signifies Dusty Feet Court ) , and in those of Whitechapel Court , held in the village of Stepney by the bailiff of the Lord of the Manor . The Thames was frozen over a thing which does not happen once in a century , as the ice forms on it with difficulty owing to the action of the sea . Coaches rolled over the frozen river , and a failwas held with booths , bear-baiting and bull-baiting . An ox was roasted whole on the ice . This thick ice lasted two months . The hard year 1690 surpassed in severity even the famous winters at the beginning of the seventeenth century , so minutely observed by Dr. Gideon Delane , the same who was , in his quality of apothecary to King James , honored by the city of London with a bust and a pedestal . One evening , towards the close of one of the most bitter days of the month of January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numerous inhospitable bights of the bay of Portland , which caused the sea-gulls and wild geese to scream and circle round its mouth , not daring to re-enter. // Tn this creek , the most dangerous of all which line the bay , during the continuance of certain winds , and consequently the most lonely , convenient by reason of its very danger , for ships in hiding , a little vessel , almost touching the cliff , so deep was the water , was moored to a point of rock . We are wrong in saying , The night falls ; we should say the night rises , for it is from the earth that obscurity comes . It was already night at the bottom of the cliff ; it was still day at top . Any one approaching the vessel 's moorings would have recognized a Biscayan hooker . The sun , concealed all day by the mist , had just set . There was beginning to be felt that deep and sombrous melancholy which might be called anxiety for the absent sun . With no wind from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was , especially in winter , a lucky exception . Almost all the Portland creeks have sand-bars ; and in heavy weather the sea becomes very rough , and , to pass in safety , much skill and practice are necessary . These little ports ( ports more in appearance than fact ) are of small advantage . They are hazardous to enter , fearful to leave . On this evening , for a wonder , there was no danger . The Biscay hooker is of an ancient model , now fallen into disuse . This kind of hooker , which has done service even in the navy , was stoutly built in its hull ; a boat in size , a ship in strength . It figured in the Armada . Sometimes the war-hooker attained to a high tonnage ; thus the Great Griffin , bearing a captain 's flag , and commanded by Lopez de Medina , measured six hundred and fifty good tons , and carried forty guns . But the mer chant and contraband hookers were very feeble specimens . Sea-folk held them at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The rigging of the hooker was made of hemp , sometimes with wire inside , which was probably intended as a means , however unscientific , of obtaining indications , in the case of magnetic tension . The lightness of this rigging did not exclude the use of heavy tackle , the cabrias of the Spanish galleon , and th cameli of the Roman triremes . The helm was very long , which gives the advantage of a long arm of leverage , but ths disadvantage of a small arc of effort . Two wheel* in /q/ two pulleys at the end of the rudder corrected this defect , and compensated , to some extent , for the loss of strength . The compass was well housed in a case perfectly square , and well-balanced by its two copper frames placed horizontally , one in the other , on little bolts , as in Cardan 's lamps . There was science and cunning in the construction of the hooker , but it was ignorant science and barbarous cunning . The hooker was primitive , just like the praam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the canoe in swiftness , and , like all vessels born of ths instinct of the pirate and fisherman , it had remarkable sea qualities ; it was equally well suited to land-locked and to open waters . Its system of sails , complicated in stays , and very peculiar , allowed of its navigating trimly in the close bays of Asturias ( which are little more than enclosed basins , as Pasages for instance ) , and also freely out at sea . It could sail round a lake , and sail round the world a strange craft with two objects , good for a pond and good for a storm . The hooker is among vessels what the wagtail is among birds , one of the smallest and one of the boldest . The wagtail perching on a reed , scarcely bends it , and , flying away , crosses the ocean . These Biscay hookers , even to the poorest , were gilt and painted . Tattooing is part of the genius of those charming people , savages to some degree . The sublime coloring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them the rugged spell which ornament possesses in itself . They are poverty-stricken and magnificent ; they put coats-of-arms on their cottages ; they have huge asses , which they bedizen with bells , and huge oxen , on which they put head-dresses of feathers . Their coaches , which you can hear grinding the wheels two leagues off , are illuminated , carved , and hung with ribbons . A cobbler has a bas-relief on his door ; it is only St. Crispin , and an old shoe ; but it is in stone . They trim their leathern jackets with lace . They do not mend their rags , but they embroider them . Vivacity profound and superb ! The Basques are like the Greeks , children of the sun ; while the V alencian drapes himself , bare and sad , in his russet woollen rug , with a hole to pass his head through , the natives of Galicia and Biscay have the delight of fine linen shirts , bleached in the dew . Their thresholds and their windows teem with faces fair and /z/ fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud serenity shines out in their ingenious arts , in their trades , in their customs , in the dress of their maidens , in their songs . The mountain , that colossal ruin , is all aglow in Biscay : the sun 's rays go in and out of every break . The wild JaXzquivel is full of Idylls . Biscay is Pyrenean grace as Savoy is Alpine grace . The dangerous bays , the neighbors of St. Sebastian , Leso , and Fontarabia , with storms , with clouds , with spray flying over the capes , with the rages of the waves and the winds , with terror , with uproar , mingle boat-women crowned with roses . He who has seen the Basque country wishes to see it again . It is the blessed land . Two harvests a year ; villages resonant and gay ; a stately poverty ; all Sunday the sound of guitars , dancing , castanets , lovemaking ; houses clean and bright ; storks in the belfries . Let us return to Portland that rugged mountain in the sea . The peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bird 's head , of which the bill is turned towards the ocean , the back of the head towards Weymouth ; the isthmus is its neck . Portland , greatly to the sacrifice of its wildness , exists now but for trade . The coasts of Portland were discovered by quarry men and plasterers towards the middle of the seventeenth century . Since that period what is called Roman cement has been made of the Portland stone a useful industry , enriching the district , and disfiguring the bay . Two hundred years ago these coasts were eaten away as a cliff ; to-day , as a quarry . The pick bites meanly , the wave grandly ; hence a diminution of beauty . To the magnificent ravages of the ocean have succeeded the measured strokes of men . These measured strokes have worked away the creek where the Biscay hooker was moored . To find any vestige of the little anchorage , now destroyed , the eastern side of the peninsula should be searched , towards the point beyond Folly Pier and Dirdle Pier , beyond Wakeham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place called South well . The creek , walled in on all sides by precipices higher than its width , was minute by minute becoming more overshadowed by evening . The misty gloom , usual at twilight ? became thicker ; it was like a growth of darkness /q/ at the bottom of a well . The opening of the creek seaward , a narrow passage , traced on the almost nightblack interior a pallid rift where the waves were moving . You must have been quite close to perceive the hooker moored to the rocks , and , as it were , hidden by the great teloaks of shadow . A plank thrown from on board on to a low and level projection of the cliff , the only point on which a landing could be made , placed the vessel in communication with the land . Dark figures were crossing and recrossing each other on this tottering gangway , and in the shadow some people were embarking . It was less cold in the creek than out at sea , thanks to the screen of rock rising over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prevent the people from shivering . They were hurrying . The effect of the twilight defined the forms as though they had been punched out with a tool . Certain indentations in their clothes were visible , and showed that they belonged to the class called in England , The ragged . The twisting of the pathway could be distinguished vaguely in the relief of the cliff , A girl who lets her stay-lace hang down trailing over the back of an armchair , describes , without being conscious of it , most of the paths of cliffs and mountains . The pathway of this creek , full of knots and angles , almost perpendicular , and better adapted for goats than men , terminated on the platform where the plank was placed . The pathways of cliffs ordinarily imply a not very inviting declivity ; they offer themselves less as a road than as a fall ; they sink rather than incline . This one , probably some ramification of a road on the plain above , was disagreeable to look at , so vertical was it . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cliff where it passed out through deep passages on to the high plateau by a cutting in the rock ; and the passengers for whom the vessel was waiting in the creek must have come by this path . Excepting the movement of embarkation which was being made in the creek , a movement visibly scared and uneasy , all around was solitude ; no step , no noise , no breath was heard . At the other side of the roads , at the entrance of Ringstead Bay , you could just perceive a flotilla of shark-fishing boats , which were evidently out of /z/ their reckoning . These polar boats had been driven from Danish into English waters by the whims of the sea . Northerly winds play these tricks on fishermen . They had just taken refuge in the anchorage of Portland a sign of bad weather expected and danger out at sea . They were engaged in casting anchor . The chief boat , placed in front after the old manner of Norwegian flotillas , all her rigging standing out in black , above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perceived the hook-iron , loaded with all kinds of hooks and harpoons , destined for the Greenland shark , the dogfish , and the spinous shark , as well as the nets to pick up the sun-fish . Except a few other craft , all swept into the same corner , the eye met nothing living on the vast horizon of Portland . Not a house , not a ship . The coast in those days was not inhabited , and the roads , at that season , were not safe . Whatever may have been the appearance of the weather , the beings who were going to sail away in the Biscayan urea , pressed on the hour of departure all the same . They formed a busy and confused group , in rapid movement on the shore . To distinguish one from another was difficult ; impossible to tell whether they were old or young . The indistinctness of evening intermixed and blurred them ; the mask of shadow was over their faces . They were sketches in the night . There were eight of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to recognize under the rags and tatters in which the group was attired clothes which were no longer man 's or woman 's . Rags have no sex . A smaller shadow , flitting to and fro among the largei ones , indicated either a dwarf or a child . It was a child . /z/ THIS la what an observer close at hand might have noted . All wore long cloaks , torn and patched , but covering them , and at need concealing them up to the eyes ; useful alike against the north wind and curiosity . They moved /q/ with ease under these cloaks . The greater number wort a handkerchief rolled round the head , a sort of rudiment which marks the commencement of the turban in Spain . This headdress was nothing unusual in England . At that time the South was in fashion in the North ; perhaps this was connected with the fact that the North was beating the South . It conquered and admired . After the defeat of the Armada , Castilian was considered in the halls of Elizabeth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace of the Queen of England was held almost an impropriety . Partially to adopt the manners of those upon whom we impose our laws is the habit of the conquering barbarian towards conquered civilization . The Tartar contemplates and imitates the Chinese . It was thus Castilian fashions penetrated into England ; in return , English interests crept into Spain . One of the men in the group embarking appeared to be a chief . He had sandals on his feet , and was bedizened with gold lace tatters and a tinsel waistcoat , shining under his cloak like the belly of a fish . Another pulled down over his face a huge piece of felt , cut like a sombrero ; this felt had no hole for a pipe , thus indicating the wearer to be a man of letters . On the principle that a man 's vest is a child 's cloak , the child was wrapped over his rags in a sailor 's jacket , which descended to his knees . By his height you would have guessed him to be a boy of ten or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hooker was composed of a captain and two sailors . The hooker had apparently come from Spain , and was about to return thither . She was beyond a doubt engaged in a stealthy service from one coast to the other . The persons embarking in her whispered among them - selves . The whispering interchanged by these creatures was of composite sound now a word of Spanish , then of German , then of French , then of Gaelic , at times of Basque . It was either a patois or a slang . They appeared to be of all nations , and yet of the same band . The motley group appeared to be a company of comrades , perhaps a gang of accomplices . /z/ The crew was probably of their brotherhood . Com . community of object was visible in the embarkation . Had there been a little more light , and if you could have looked at them attentively , you might have perceived on these people rosaries and scapulars half-hidden under their rags ; one of the semi- women mingling in the group had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of a dervish , and easy to recognize for an Irish one made at Llanymthefry , which is also called Llanandriffy . You might also have observed , had it not been so dark , a figure of Our Lady and Child carved and gilt on the bow of the hooker . It was probably that of the Basque Notre Dame , a sort of Panagia of the old Cantabri . Under this image , which occupied the position of a figure-head , was a lantern , which at this moment was not lighted an excess of caution which implied an extreme desire of concealment . This lantern was evidently for two purposes . When a-light , it burned before the Virgin , and at the same time illumined the sea , a beacon doing duty as a taper . Under the bowsprit the cut- water , long , curved , and sharp , came out in front like the horn of a crescent . At the top of the cut- water , and at the feet of the Virgin , a kneeling angel , with folded wings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spyglass at the horizon . The angel was gilded like Our Lady . In the cut- water were holes and openings to let the waves pass through , which afforded an opportunity for gilding and arabesques . Under the figure of the Virgin was written , in gilt capitals , the word Matutina the name of the vessel , not to be read just now on account of the darkness . Amid the confusion of departure there were thrown down in disorder , at the foot of the cliff , the goods which the voyagers were to take with them , and which , by means of a plank serving as a bridge across , were being passed rapidly from the shore to the boat . Bags of biscuit , a cask of stock-fish , a case of portable soup , three barrels one of fresh water , one of malt , one of tar four or five bottles of ale , an old portmanteau buckled up by straps , trunks , boxes , a ball of tow for torches and signals . Such was the lading . These raggedpeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wandering rascals are obliged to own something ; at times they would prefer to iiy ava , v /z/ like birds , but they can not do so without abandoning the means of earning a livelihood . They of necessity possess boxes of tools and instruments of labour , whatever their errant trade my be . Those of whom we speak were dragging their baggage with them , often an encumbrance . It could not have been easy to bring these movables to the bottom of the cliff . This , however , revealed the intention of a definite departure . No time was lost ; there was one continued passing to and fro from the shore to the vessel , and from the vessel to the shore ; each one took his share the work ; one carried a bag , another a chest . Those amidst the promiscuous company who were possibly or probably women , worked like the rest . They overloaded the child . It was doubtful if the child 's father or mother were in the group ; no sign of life was vouchsafed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared not a child in a family , but a slave in a tribe . He waited on every one , and no one spoke to him . However , he made haste , and , like the others of this mysterious troop , he seemed to have but one thought to embark as quickly as possible . Did he know why ? probably not , he hurried mechanically because he saw the others hurry . The hooker was decked . The stowing of the lading in the hold was quickly finished , and the moment to put off arrived . The last case had been carried over the gangway , and nothing was left to embark but the men . The two objects among the group who seemed women were already on board ; six , the child among them , were still on the low platform of the cliff . A movement of departure was made in the vessel , the captain seized the helm , a sailor took up an axe to cut the hawser ; to cut is an evidence of haste ; when there is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low voice , he who appeared chief of tfie six , and who had the spangles on his tatters . The child rushed towards the plank in order to be the first to pass . As he placed his foot on it , two of the men hurried by , at the risk of throwing him into the water , got in before him and passed on ; the fourth drove him back with his fist and followed the third ; the fifth , who was the chief bounded into rather than entered the vessel , and , as he jumped in , kicked back the plank , which fell into the /z/ sea , a stroke of the hatchet cut the moorings the helm wa but up , the vessel left the shore , and the child remained no land . /z/ ALONi . THE child remained motionless on the rock , with hit eyes fixed ; no calling out ; no appeal . Though this was unexpected by him , he spoke not a word . The same silence reigned in the vessel . No cry from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the child . There was on both sides a mute acceptance of the widening distance between them . It was like a separation of ghosts on the banks of the Styx . The child , as if nailed to the rock , which the high tide was beginning to bathe , watched the departing bark . It seemed as if he realized his position . What did he realize ? Darkness . A moment later , the hooker gained the neck of the creek and entered it . Against the clear sky the masthead was visible , rising above the split blocks between which the strait wound as between two walls . The truck wandered to the summit of the rocks and appeared to run into them . Then it was seen no more all was over the bark had gained the sea . The child watched its disappearance he was astounded but dreamy . His stupefaction was complicated by a sense of the dark reality of existence . It seemed as if there were experience in this dawning being . Did he , perchance , already exercise judgment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure depths of a child 's mind , some dangerous balance we know not what in which the poor little souls weighs God . Feeling himself innocent , he yielded . There was no complaint the irreproachable does not reproach . His rough expulsion drew from him no sign he suffered a sort of internal stiffening . The child did not bow under this , sudden blow of fate , which seemed to put an end to his existence ere it had well begun ; he received the thunderstroke standing . It would have been evident to any one who could have /q/ een his astonishment unmixed with dejection , that , in the group which abandoned him , there was nothing which loved him , nothing which he loved . Brooding , he forgot the cold . Suddenly the ware wetted his feet the tide was flowing ; a gust passed through his hair the north wind was rising . Ho shivered . There came over him , from head to foot , th shudder of awakening . He cast his eyes about him . He was alone . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men than those who were now in the hooker . Those men had just stolen away . Let us add what seems a strange thing to state . Those men , the only ones he knew , were unknown to him . He could not have said who they were . His childhood had been passed among them , without his having the consciousness of being of them . He was in juxtaposition to them , nothing more . He had just been forgotten by them . He had no money about him , no shoes to his feet , scarcely a garment to his body , not even a piece of bread in his pocket . It was winter it was night . It would be necessary to walk several leagues before a human habitation could be reached . He did not know where he was . He knew nothing , unless it was that those who had come with him to the brink of the sea had gone away without him . He felt himself put outside the pale of life . He felt that man failed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a desert , between depths where he aw the night rising , and depths where he heard th' waves murmur . He stretched his little thin arms and yawned . Then , suddenly , as one who makes up his mind , bold , and throwing off his numbness with the agility of a quirrel or perhaps of an acrobat he turned his back on the creek , and . st himself to climb up the cliff . He tscaladed the path , left it , returned to it , quick and vent- /z/ urous . He was hurrying landward , just as though he had a destination marked out ; nevertheless he was going nowhere . He hastened without an object a fugitive before Fate . To climb is the function of a man ; to clamber is that of an animal he did both . As the slopes of Portland face southward , there was scarcely any snow on the path ; the intensity of cold had , however , frozen that snow into dust very troublesome to the walker . The child freed himself of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , complicated matters , and got in his way . Now and then on an overhanging crag or in a declivity he came upon a little ice , which caused him to slip down . Then , after hanging some moments over the precipice , he would catch hold of a dry branch or projecting stone . Once he came on a vein of slate , which suddenly gave way under him , letting him down with it . Crumbling slate is treacherous . For some seconds the child slid like a tile on a roof ; he rolled to the extreme edge of the decline ; a tuft of grass which he clutched at the right moment saved him . He was as mute in sight of the abyss as he had been in sight of the men ; he gathered himself up and re-ascended sflently . The slope was steep ; so he had to tack in ascending . The precipice grew in the darkness ; the vertical rock had no ending . It receded before the child in the distance of its height . As the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he clambered he looked up at the dark entablature placed like a barrier between heaven and him . At last he reached the top . He jumped on the level ground , or rather landed , for he rose from the precipice . Scarcely was he on the cliff when he began to shiver . He felt in his face that bite of the night , the north wind . The bitter north-wester was blowing ; he tightened his rough sailor 's jacket about his chest . . It was a good coat , called in ship language a sou ' - wester , because that sort of stuff allows little of the south-westerly rain to penetrate . The child , having gained the table-land , stopped , placed his feet firmly on the frozen ground and looked about him . Behind him was the sea j in front the laud j above , the /q/ but a sky without stars ; an opaque mist masked the zenith . On reaching the summit of the rocky wall he found himself turned towards the land , and looked at it attentively . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frozen , and covered with snow . Some tufts of heather shivered in the wind . No roads were visible . Nothing , not even a shepherd 's cot . Here and there , pale , spiral vortices might be seen , which were whirls of fine snow , snatched from the ground by the wind and blown away . Successive undulations of ground become suddenly misty , rolled themselves into the horizon . The great dull plains were lost under the white fog . Deep silence . It spread like infinit ' , and was hush as the tomb . The child turned again towards the sea . The sea , like the land , was white , the one with snow , the other with foam . There is nothing so melancholy as the light produced by this double whiteness . Certain lights of night are very clearly cut in their hardness ; the sea was like steel , the cliff like ebony . From the height where the child was , the bay of Portland appeared almost like a geographical map , pale , in a semicircle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape a wan disk belted by a dark crescent . The moon sometimes has a similar appearance . From cape to cape , along the whole coast , not a single spark indicating a hearth with a fire , not a lighted window , not an inhabited house , was to be seen . As in heaven so on earth , no light . Not a lamp below , not a star above . Here and there came sudden risings in the great expanse of waters in the gulf , as the wind disarranged and wrinkled the vast sheet . The hooker was still visible in the bay as she fled . It was a black triangle gliding over the livid waters . Far away the waste of waters stirred confusedly in the ominous clear-obscure of immensity . The Matutina was making quick way . She seemed to grow smaller every minute . Nothing appears so rapid as the flight of a vessel melting into the distance of ocean . Suddenly she lit the lantern at her provv . Probably the darkness falling round her made those on board uneasy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves . This luminous point- , a spark seen from afar , clung like a corpse light to the high and long black form . /z/ You would have said it was a shroud raised up and moying in the middle of the sea , under which some one wandered with a star in his hand . A storm threatened in the air : the child took no account of it , but a sailor would have trembled . It was that moment of preliminary anxiety , when it seems as though the elements are changing into persons , and one is about to witness the mysterious transfiguration of the wind into the wind-god . The sea becomes Ocean : its power reveals itself as Will : that which one takes for a thing , is a soul . It will become visible . Hence the terror . The soul of man fears to be thus confronted with the soul of nature . Chaos was about to appear . The wind rolling back the fog , and making a stage of the clouds behind , set the scene for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Snow-storm . Vessels putting back hove in sight . For some minutes past the roads had no longer been deserted . Every instant troubled barks hastening towards an anchorage appeared from behind the capes ; some were doubling Portland Bill , the others St. Albans head . From afar ships were running in . It was a race for refuge . Southwards the darkness thickened , and clouds , full of night , bordered on the sea . The weight of the tempest hanging overhead made a dreary lull on the waves . It certainly was no time to sail . Yet the hooker had sailed . She had made the south of the cape . She was already out of the gulf , and in the open sea . Suddenly there came a gust of wind . The Hatuttna , which was still clearly in sight , made all sail , as if resolved to profit by the hurricane . It was the nor ' - wester , a wind sullen and angry . Its weight was felt instantly . The hooker , caught broadside on , staggered , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight rather than a voyage , less fear of sea than of land , and greater heed of pursuit from man than from wind . The hooker , passing through every degree of diminution , sank into the horizon . The little star which she carried into shadow paled . More and more the hooker became amalgamated with the night , then disappeared . This time for good and all . At least the child seemed to understand it so ; he ceased %o look at the sea . His eyes turned back upon the plains. /q/ the wastes , the hills , towards the space where it might act be impossible to meet something living . Into this unknown he set out . /z/ WHAT kind of band was it which had left the child behind in its flight ? Were those fugitives Comprachicos ? We have already seen the account of the measures taken by William III. , and passed by Parliament against the malefactors , male and female , called Comprachicos , otherwise Comprapequenos , otherwise Cheylas . There are laws which disperse . The law acting against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vagabonds of all sorts , on a general flight . It was the devil take the hindmost . The greater number of the Comprachicos returned to Spain ; many of them , as we have said , being Basques . The law for the protection of children had at first this strange result : it caused many children to be abandoned . The immediate effect of the penal statute was to produce a crowd of children , found or rather lost . Nothing is easier to understand . Every wandering gang containing a child was liable to suspicion . The mere fact of the child 's presence was in itself a denunciation . " They are very likely Comprachicos . " Such was the first idea of the sheriff , of the bailiff , of the constable , Hence arrest and inquiry . People simply unfortunate , reduced to wander and to beg , were seized with a terror of being taken for Comprachicos although they were nothing of the kind . But the weak have grave misgivings of possible errors in justice . Besides , these vagabond families are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they traded in other people 's children . But the promiscuousness caused by poverty and indigence is such that at times it might have been difficult for a father and mother to prove a child their own . /z/ How came you by this child ? how were they to prove that they held it from God ? The child became a peril they got rid of it . To fly unencumbered was easier ; the parents resolved to lose it now in a wood , now on a strand , now down a well . Children were found drowned in cisterns . Let us add that , in imitation of England , all Europe henceforth hunted down the Comprachicos . The impulse of pursuit was given . There is nothing like belling the cat . From this time forward the desire to seize them made rivalry and emulation among the police of all countries , and the alguazil was not less keenly watchful than the constable . One could still read , twenty-three years ago , on a stone of the gate of Otero , an untranslatable inscription the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the shade of difference which existed between the buyers and the stealers of children is very strongly marked . Here is part of the inscription in somewhat rough Castilian , Aqui quedan las orejas de los Comprachicos y las bolsas de los robaninos , mientras que se van ellos al trabajo de mar . You see the confiscation of ears , etc. , did not prevent the owners going to the galleys . Whence followed a general rout among all vagabonds . They started frightened ; they arrived trembling . On every shore in Europe their furtive advent was watched . Impossible for such a band to embark with a child , since to disembark with one was dangerous . To lose the child was much simpler of accomplishment . And this child , of whom we have caught a glimpse in the shadow of the solitudes of Portland , by whom had he bsen cast away ? To all appearance by Comprachicos. /q/ /z/ IT might be about seven o'clock in the evening . Th wind was now diminishing , a sign , however , of a violent recurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme south point of Portland . Portland is a peninsula ; but the child did not know what a peninsula is , and was ignorant even of the name of Portland . He knew but one thing , which is , that one can walk until one drops down . An idea is a guide ; he had no idea . They had brought him there , and left him there . They and there . These two enigmas represented his doom . They , were humankind . There , was the universe . For him in all creation there was absolutely no other basis to rest on but the little piece of ground where he placed his heel , ground hard and cold to his naked feet . In the great twilight world , open on all sides , what was there for the child ? Nothing . He walked towards this Nothing . Around him was the vastness of human desertion . He crossed the first plateau diagonally , then a second , then a third . At the extremity of each plateau the child came upon a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but always short ; the high , bare plains of Portland resemble great flagstones overlapping each other . The south side seems to enter under the protruding slab , the north side rises over the next one ; these made ascents , which the child stepped over nimbly . From time to time he stopped , and seemed to hold counsel with himself . The night was becoming very dark . His radius of sight was contracting . Ho now only saw a few steps before him . All of a sudden he stopped , listened for as instant , and with an almost imperceptible nod of satisfaction , turned quickly and directed his steps towards an eminence of moderate height , which he dimly perceived on his right , ut . the point of the plain nearest the cliff . There was on /z/ fche eminent LI shape which in the mist looked like a tree . The child had just heard a noise in this direction , which was the noise neither of the wind nor of the sea , nor was it the cry of animals . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few strides he was at the foot of the hillock . In truth , some one was there . That which had been indistinct on the top of the eminence was now visible . It was something like a great arm thrust straight out of the ground ; at the upper extremity of the arm a sort of forefinger , supported from beneath by the thumb , pointed out horizontally ; the arm , the thumb , and the forefinger drew a square against the sky . At the point of juncture of this peculiar finger and this peculiar thumb , there was a line , from which hung something black and shapeless . The line moving in the wind sounded like a chain . This was the noise the child had heard . Seen closely , the line was that which the noise indicated , a chain a single chain cable . By that mysterious law of amalgamation which throughout nature causes appearances to exaggerate realities , the place , the hour , the mist , the mournful sea , the cloudy turmoils on the distant horizon , added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous . The mass linked to the chain presented the appearance of a scabbard . It was swaddled like a child , and long like a man . There was a round thing at its summit , about which the end of the chain was rolled . The scabbard was riven asunder at the lower end , and shreds of flesh hung out between the rents . A feeble breeze stirred the chain , and that which hung to it swayed gently . The passive mass obeyed the vague motions of space . It was an object to inspire indescribable dread . Horror , which disproportions everything , blurred its dimensions while retaining its shape . It was a condensation of darkness , which had a defined form . Night was above and within the spectre ; it was a prey of ghastly exaggeration . Twilight and moon-rise , stars setting behind the cliff , floating 1 things in space , the clouds , winds from all quarters , had ended by penetrating into the composition of this visible nothing . The species of log hanging in the wind partook of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the darkness completed this phase of the thing which had once been a man . /q/ It was that which is no longer . To be nought but a remainder ! Such a thing is beyond the power of language to express . To exist no more , yet to persist ; to be in the abyss , yet out of it ; to reappear above death as if indissoluble . There is a certain 1 amount of impossibility mixed with such reality . Thence comes the inexpressible . This being was it a being ? This black witness was a remainder , and an awful remainder a remainder of what ? Of nature first , and then of society . Nought , and yet total . The lawless inclemency of the weather held it at its will ; the deep oblivion of solitude environed it ; it was given up to unknown chances ; it was without defence against the darkness , which did with it what it willed . It was forever the patient ; it submitted ; the hurricane ( that ghastly conflict of winds ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It underwent the horrible outrage of rotting in the open air ; it was an outlaw of the tomb . There was no peace for it even in annihilation : in the summer it fell away into dust , in the winter into mud . Death should be veiled , the grave should have its reserve . Here was neither veil nor reserve : but cynically avowed putrefaction . It is effrontery in death to display its work , it offends all the calmness of shadow when it does its task outside its laboratory , the grave . This dead being had been stripped . To strip one already stripped relentless act ! His marrow was no longer in his bones ; his entrails were no longer in his body ; his voice was no longer in his throat . A corpse is a pocket which death turns inside out and empties . If he ever had a Me , where was the Me ? There still , perchance , and this was fearful to think of . Something wandering about something in chains , can one imagine a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which serve as issues to the unknown , which seem to facilitate the egress of speculation , and at which hypothesis snatches . Conjecture has its compelle intrare . In passing by certain places and before certain objects one can not help stopping a prey to dreams into the realms of which the mind enters . In the invisible there are dark pprtals ajar . No one could have met this dead man without meditating. /z/ In the vastness of dispersion he was wearing silently away . He had had blood which had been drunk , skin which had been eaten , flesh which had been stolen . Nothing- had passed him by without taking somewhat ( from him . December had borrowed cold of him ; midnight , horror ; the iron , rust ; the plague , miasma ; the flowers , perfume . His slow disintegration was a toll paid to all a toll of the corpse to the storm , to the rain , to the dew , to the reptiles , to the birds . All the dark hands of night had rifled the dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tenant of the darkness . He was on a plain and on a hill , and he was not . He was palpable , yet vanished . He was a shadow accruing to the night . After the disappearance of day into the vast of silent obscurity , he became in lugubrious accord with all around him . By his mere presence he increased the gloom of the tempest , and the calm of stars . The unutterable which is in the desert was condensed in him . Waif of an unknown fate , he commingled with all the wild secrets of the night . There was in his mystery a vague reverberation of all enigmas . About him life seemed sinking to its lowest depths . Certainty and confidence appeared to diminish in his environs . The shiver of the brushwood and the grass , a desolate melancholy , an anxiety in which a conscience seemed to lurk , appropriated with tragic force the whole landscape to that black figure suspended by the chain . The presence of a spectre in the horizon is an aggravation of solitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was implacable . Perpetual shuddering made him terrible . Fearful to say , he seemed to be a centre in space , with something immense leaning on him . Who can tell ? Perhaps that equity , half seen and set at defiance , which transcends human justice . There was in his unburied continuance the vengeance of men and his own vengeance . He was a testimony in the twilight and the waste . He was in himself a disquieting substance , since we tremble before the substance which is the ruined habitation of the soul . For dead matter to trouble us , it must once have been tenanted by spirit . He denounced the law of earth to the law of Heaven . Placed there by mau he there awaited God . Above him floated , blended /z/ with all the vague distortions of the cloud and the ware , boundless dreams of shadow . Who could tell what sinister mysteries lurked behind this phantom ? The illimitable circumscribed by nought , nor tree , nor roof , nor passer-by , was around the dead man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the abyss , the life , grave , and eternity appear patent , then it is we feel that all is inaccessible , all is forbidden , all is sealed . When infinity opens to us , terrible indeed is the closing of the gate behind . /z/ THE child was before this thing , dumb , wondering , and with eyes iixed . To a man it would have been a gibbet ; to the child it was an apparition . Where a man would have seen a corpse the child saw a spectre . Besides , he did not understand . The attractions of the obscure are manifold . There was one on the summit of that hill . The child took a step , then another ; he ascended , wishing all the while to descend ; and approached , wishing all the while to retreat . Bold , yet trembling , he went close up to survey the spectre . When he got close under the gibbet , he looked up and examined it . The spectre was tarred ; here and there it shone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pitch ; and this mask , which appeared viscous and sticky , varied its aspect with the night shadows . The child saw the mouth , which was a hole ; the nose , which was a hole , the eyes which were holes . The body was wrapped , and apparently corded up , in coarse canvas , soaked in naphtha . The canvas was mouldy and torn . A knee protruded through it . A rent disclosed the ribs ; partly corpse , partly skeleton . The face was the polor of earth j /z/ slugs , wandering over it , had traced across it , vague ribbons of silver . The canvas , glued to the bones , showed in relief like the robe of a statue . The skull , cracked and fractured , gaped like a rotten fruit . The teeth were still human , for they retained a laugh . The remains of a cry seemed to murmur in the open mouth . There were a few hairs of beard on the cheek . The inclined head had an air of attention . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarred afresh , as well a the ribs and the knee which protruded from the canvas . The feet hung out below . Just underneath , in the grass , were two shoes , which snow and rain had rendered shapeless . These shoes had fallen from the dead man The barefooted child looked atlhe shoes . The wind which had become more and more restless , was now and then interrupted by those pauses which foretell the approach of a storm . For the last few minutes it had altogether ceased to blow . The corpse no longer stirred ; the chain was as motionless as a plumb line . Like all new-comers into life , and taking into account the peculiar influences of his fate , the child no doubt felt within him that awakening of ideas characteristic of early years , which endeavors to open the brain and which resembles the pecking of the young bird in the egg . But all there was in his little consciousness just then was resolved into stupor . Excess of sensation has the effect of too much oil , and ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself questions ; the child put himself none ; he only looked . The tar gave the face a wet appearance ; drops of pitch , congealed in what had once been the eyes , produced the effect of tears . However , thanks to the pitch , the ravage of death , if not annulled , was visibly slackened and reduced to the least possible decay . That which was before the child was a thing of which care was taken ; the man was evidently precious . They had not cared to keep him alive , but they cared to keep him dead . The gibbet was old , worm-eaten , although strong , and had been in use many years . It was an immemorial custom in England to tar smugglers . /q/ They were hanged on the sea-board , coated over with pitch and left swinging . Examples must be made in public , and tarred examples last longest . The tar was mercy ; by renewing it they were spared making too many fresh examples . They placed gibbets from point to point along the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did duty as a lantern . After his fashion , he guided his comrades , the smugglers . The smugglers from far out at sea perceived the gibbets . There is one , first warning ; another , second warning . It did not stop smuggling ; but public order is made up of such things . The fashion lasted in England up to the beginning of this century . In 1822 three men were still to be seen hanging in front of Dover Castle . But , for that matter , the preserving process was employed not only with smugglers . England turned robbers , incendiaries and murderers to the same account . Jack Painter , who set fire to the government storehouses at Portsmouth , was hanged and tarred in 1776 . UAbbe Coyer , who describes him as Jean le Peintre , saw him again in 1777 ; Jack Painter was hanging above the ruin he had made , and was re-tarred from time to time . His corpse lasted I had almost said lived nearly fourteen years . It was still doing good service in 1788 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by another . The Egyptians used to value the mummy of the king ; a plebeian mummy can also , it appears , be of service . The wind , having great power on the hill , had swept it of all its snow . Herbage reappeared on it , interspersed here and there with a few thistles ; tle hill was covered by that close short grass which grows by the sea , and causes the tops of cliffs to resemble green cloth . Under the gibbet , on the very spot over which hung the feet of the executed criminal , was a long and thick tuft , uncommon on such poor soil . Corpses , crumbling there for centuries past , accounted for the beauty of the grass . Earth feeds on man . A dreary fascination held the child ; he remained there open-mouthed . He only dropped his head a moment when a nettle , which felt like an insect , stung his leg ; then he looked up again he looked above him at the face which looked down on him . It appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . It was a comprehen- glrmce , having an indescribable fixedness in which /z/ there was both light and darkness , and which emanated from the skull and teeth , as well as the empty arches ot the brow . The whole head of a dead man seems to have vision , and this is awful . No eyeball , yet we feel that we are looked at . A horror of worms . Little by little the child himself was becoming an . object of terror . He no longer moved . Torpor was coming over him . He did not perceive that he was losing consciousness he was becoming benumbed and lifeless . Winter was silently delivering him over to night . There is something of the traitor in winter . The child was all but a statue . The coldness of stone was penetrating his bones ; darkness , that reptile , was crawling over him . The drowsiness resulting from snow creeps over man like a dim tide . The child was being slowly invaded by a stagnation resembling that of the corpse . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger of death . The child felt himself seized by that hand . He was on the point of falling under the gibbet . He no longer knew whether he was standing upright . The end always impending , no transition between to be and not to be , the return into the crucible , the slip possible every minute . Such is the precipice which is Creation . Another instant , the child and the dead , life in sketch and life in ruin , would be confounded in the same obliteration . The spectre appeared to understand , and not to wish it . Of a sudden it stirred . One would have said it was warning the child . It was the wind beginning to blow again . Nothing stranger than this dead man in movement . The corpse at the end of the chain , pushed by the invisible gust , took an oblique attitude ; rose to the left , then fell back , reascended to the right , and fell and rose with slow and mournful precision . A weird game of seesaw . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the clock of Eternity . This continued for some time . The child felt himself waking up at the sight of the dead ; through his increasing numbness he experienced a distinct sense of fear . The chain at every oscillation made a grinding sound , with hideous regularity . It appeared to take breath . and /q/ then to resume . This grinding was like the cry of a grasshopper . An approaching squall is heralded by sudden gusts of wind . All at once the breeze increased into a gale . The corpse emphasized its dismal oscillations . It no longer swung , it tossed ; the chain , which had been grinding , now shrieked . It appeared that its shriek was heard . If it was an appeal , it was obeyed . From the depths of the horizon came the sound of a rushing noise . It was the noise of wings . An incident occurred , a stormy incident , peculiar to graveyards and solitudes . It was the arrival of a flight of ravens . Black flying specks pricked the clouds , pierced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amalgamated , thickened , hastening towards the hill , uttering cries . It was like the approach of a Legion . The winged vermin of the darkness alighted on the gibbet ; the child , scared , drew back . Swarms obey words of command ; the birds crowded on the gibbet , not one was on the corpse . They were talking among themselves . The croaking was frightful , The howl , the whistle and the roar , are signs of life ; the croak is a satisfied acceptance of putrefaction . In it you c ; m fancy you hear the tomb breaking silence . The croak is night-like in itself . The child was frozen even more by terror than by cold . Then the ravens held silence . One of them perched on the skeleton . This was a signal : they all precipitated themselves upon it . There was a cloud of wings , then all their feathers closed up , and the hanged man disappeared underi swarm of black blisters struggling in the obscurity . Just then the corpse moved . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frightful bound . The hurricane , which was increasing , came to its aid . The phantom fell into convulsions . The squall already blowing with full lungs , laid hold of it , and moved it about in all directions . It became horrible ; it began to struggle . An awful puppet , with a gibbet chain for a string . Some humorist of night must have seized the string , and been playing with the mummy . It turned and leapt as if it would fain dislocate itself ; the birds frightened , flew off . It /z/ was like an explosion of all those unclean ereaturt* . Then they returned ; and a struggle began . The dead man seemed possessed with hideous vitality , The winds raised him as though they meant to carry him away . He seemed struggling and making efforts to escape , but his iron collar held him back . The birds adapted themselves to all his movements , retreating , then striking again , scared but desperate . On one side a strange flight was attempted , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impelled by every spasm of the wind , had shocks , starts , fits of rage : it went , it came , it rose , it fell , driving back the scattered swarm . The dead man was a club , the swarms were dust . The fierce , assailing flock would not leave their hold , and grew stubborn ; the man , as if maddened by the cluster of beaks , redoubled his blind chastisement of space . It was like the blows of a stone held in a sling . At times the corpse was covered by talons and wings ; then it was free . There were disappearances of the horde ; then sudden furious returns . A frightful torment continuing after life was past . The birds seemed frenzied . The air-holes of hell must surely give passage to such swarms . Thrusting of claws , thrusting of beaks , croakings , rendings of shreds no longer flesh , creakings of the gibbet , shudderings of the skeleton , jingling of the chain , the voices of the storm and tumult . What conflict more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a spectre ! At times the storm redoubling its violence , the hanged man revolved on his own pivot , turning every way at once towards the swarm , as if he wished to run after th birds ; his teeth seemed to try and bite them . The wind was for him , the chain against him . It was as if black deities were mixing themselves up in the fray . Tho hurricane was in the battle . As the dead man turned himself about , the flock of birds wound round hir* spirally . It was a whirl in a whirlwind . A great roai was heard from below . It was the sea . The child saw this nightmare . Suddenly he trembled in all his limbs ; a shiver thrilled his frame ; he staggered , tottered , nearly fell , recovered himself , pressed both hands to his forehead , as if he felt his forehead a support ; then , haggard , his hair streaming in the wind , descending /q/ the hill with long strides , his eyes closed , himself almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &fc; torment in the night . /z/ HE ran until he was breathless , at random , desperate , over the plain into the snow , into space . His flight warmed him . He needed it . AYithout the run and the fright he had died . When his breath failed him , he stopped , but he dared not look back . He fancied that the birds would pursue him , that the dead man had undone his chain and was perhaps hurrying behind him , and no doubt the gibbet itself was descending the hill , running after the dead man ; he feared to see these things if he turned his head . When he had somewhat recovered his breath , he resumed his flight . To account for facts does not belong to childhood . He received impressions which were magnified by terror , but he did not link them together in his mind , nor form any conclusion on them . He was going on , no matter how or where ; he ran in agony and difficulty as one in a dream . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his onward progress , still vague , had changed its purpose . At first it was a search , now it was a flight . He no longer felt hungry nor cold he felt fear . One instinct had given place to another . To escape was now his whole thought to escape from what ? From everything . On all sides life seemed to enclose him like a horrible wall . If he could have fled from all things , he would have done so . But children know nothing of that breaking iroin prison which is called suicide . He was running . He ran on for an indefinite time ; but fear dies with lack of breath . All at once , as if seized by a sudden accession of energy and intelligence , he stopped . One would have said he was ashamed of running away . He drew himself up , stamped his foot , and , with head erect , looked vouncL /z/ There was no longer hill , nor gibbet , nor flights of crows . The fog had resumed possession of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer ran but walked . To say that meeting with a corpse had made a man of him would be to limit the manifold and confused impression which possessed him . There was in his impression much more and much less . The gibbet , a mighty trouble in the rudiment of comprehension , nascent in his mind , still seemed to him an apparition ; but a trouble overcome is strength gained , and he felt himself stronger . Had he been of an age to probe self , he would have detected within him a thousand other germs of meditation ; but the reflection of children is shapeless , and the utmost they feel is the bitter aftertaste of that which , obscure to them , the man later on calls indignation . Let us add that a child has the faculty of quickly accepting the conclusion of a sensation ; the distant fading boundaries which amplify painful subjects , escape him . A child is protected by the limit of feebleness against emotions which are too complex . He sees the fact , and little else beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist for him . It is not until later that experience comes , with its brief , to conduct the lawsuit of life . Then he confronts groups of facts which have crossed his path the understanding cultivated and enlarged , draws comparisons the memories of youth reappear under the passions , like the traces of a palimpsest under the erasure ; these memories form the bases of logic , and that which was a vision in the child 's brain , becomes a syllogism in the man/s . Experience is , however , various , and turns to good or evil according to natural disposition . With the good it ripens , with the bad rots . The child had run quite a quarter of a league , and walked another quarter , when suddenly he felt the craving of hunger . A thought which altogether eclipsed the hideous apparition on the hill occurred to him forcibly. , that he must eat . Happily there is in man a brute which serves to lead him back to reality . But what to eat , where to eat , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that , they were empty . Then he quickened his steps , without ; knowing whither he was going . He hastened towards a possible shelter . This faith in an inn is one of the coavictions /q/ enrooted by God in man . To believe in a shelter is to believe in God . However , in that plain of snow there was nothing like a roof . The child went on , and the waste continued bare as far as eye could see . There had never been a human habitation on the tableland . It was at the foot of the cliff , in holes in the rocks , that , lacking wood to build themselves huts , had dwelt long ago the aboriginal inhabitants , who had slings for arms , dried cow-dung for firing , for a god the idol Heil standing in a glade at Dorchester , and for trade the fishing of that false gray coral which the Gauls called plin and the Greeks isidisplocamos . The child found his way as best he could . Destiny is made up of cross-roads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an early choice of doubtful chances . He continued to advance , but although the muscles of his thighs seemed to be of steel , he began to tire . There were no tracks in the plain , or if there were any , the snow had obliterated tnem . Instinctively he inclined eastwards . Sharp stones had wounded his heels . Had it been daylight pink stains made by his blood might have been seen in the footprints he left in the snow . He recognized nothing . He was crossing the plain of Portland from south to north , and it is probable that the band with which he had come , to avoid meeting any one , had crossed it from east to west ; they had most likely sailed in some fisherman 's er smuggler 's boat , from a point on the coast of Uggescombe , such as St. Catherine 's Cape , or Swancry , to Portland to find the hooker which awaited them , and they must have landed in one of the creeks of Weston , and re-embarked in one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child was now following . It was impossible for him to recognize the road . On the plain of Portland there are , here and there , raised strips of land , abruptly - ended by the shore and cut perpendicular to the sea . The wandering child reached one of these culminating points and stopped on it , hoping that a larger space might reveal further indications . He tried to see around him . Before him in place of an horizon , was a vast livid opacity . He looked at this attentively , and under the fixedness of his glance it became less indistinct . At the base of a distant fold of land towardi /z/ the east , in the depths of that opaque lividity , ( a moving and a wan sort of precipice , which resembled a cliff of the night , ) crept and floated some vague black rents , some dim shreds of vapor . The pale opacity was fog , the black shreds were smoke . Where there is smoke there are men . The child turned his steps in that direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the foot of the descent , among shapeless conformation of rock , blurred by the mist , what seemed to be either a sandbank or a tongue of land , joining probably to the plains of the horizon the tableland he had just crossed . It was evident he must pass that way . He had , in fact , arrived at the Isthmus of Portland , a diluvian alluvium which is called Chess Hill . He began to descend the side of the plateau . The descent was difficult and rough . It was ( with less of ruggedness , however ) , the reverse of the ascent he had made on leaving the creek . Every ascent is balanced by a decline . After having clambered up , he crawled down . He leapt from one rock to another at the risk of a sprain , at the risk of falling into the vague depths below . To save himself when he slipped on the rock or on the ice , he caught hold of handf uls of weeds and furze , thick with thorns , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an easier declivity , taking breath as he descended ; then came on the precipice again , and each step necessitated an expedient . In descending precipices , every movement solves a problem . One must be skilful under pain of death . These problems the child solved with an instinct which would have made him the admiration of apes and mountebanks . The descent was steep and long . Nevertheless he was coming to the end of it . Little by little it was drawing nearer the moment when he should land on the Isthmus , of which from time to time he caught a glimpse . At intervals , while he bounded or dropped from rock to rock , he pricked up his ears , his head erect , like a listening deer . He was hearkening to a diffused and faint uproar , far away to the left , like the deep note of a clarion . It was a commotion of winds , preceding that fearful north blast which is heard rushing from the pole , like an inroad of trumpets . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his eyes , QU his cheeks , something which was like the palms of /q/ old hands being placed on his face . These were large frozen flakes , sown at first softly in space , then eddying , and heralding a snow-storm . The child was covered with them . The snow-storm , which for the last hour had been on the sea , was beginning to gain the land . It was slowly invading the plains . It was entering obliquely , by Hie north-west , the tableland of . Portland . /z/ THE snow-storm is one of the mysteries of the ocean . It is the most obscure of things meteorological ; obscure in every sense of the word . It is a mixture of fog and storm ; and even in our days we can not well account for the phenomenon . Hence many disasters . We try to explain all things by the action of wind and wave ; yet in the air there is a force which is not the wind , and in the waters a force which is not the wave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , is effluvium . Air and water are two nearly identical liquid masses , entering into the composition of each other by condensation , and dilatation , so that to breathe is to drink . Effluvium alone is fluid . The wind and the wave are only impulses ; effluvium is a current . The wind is visible in clouds , the wave is visible in foam ; effluvium is invisible . From time to time , however , it says , " I am here . " Its " I am here " is a clap of thunder . The snow-storm offers a problem analogous to the dry fog If the solution of the callina of the Spaniards , and the quobar of the Ethiopians be possible , assuredly that solution will be achieved by attentive observation of magnetic effluvium . Without effluvium a crowd of circumstances would remain enigmatic . Strictly speaking , the changes in the velocity of the wind , varying from 3 feet per second to 220 feet , would supply a reason for the variations of the waves rising from 3 inches in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strictly speaking , the horizontal direction /z/ /q/ of the winds , even in a squall , enables us to understand how it is that a wave 30 feet high can be 1,500 feet long . But why are the waves of the Pacific four times higher Dear America than near Asia ; that is to say , higher in the East than in the West ? Why is the contrary true of the Atlantic ? Why , under the Equator , are they highest in the middle of the sea ? W nere ore these deviations in the swell of the ocean ? This is what magnetic effluvium , combined with terrestrial rotation and sidereal attraction , can alone explain . Is not this mysterious complication needed to explain an oscillation of the wind veering , for instance , by the west from S. E. to N. E. , then suddenly returning in the same great curve from N. E. to S. E. , so as to make in thirty-six hours a prodigious circuit of 560 degrees ? Such was the preface to the snow-storm of March 17 , 1867 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 feet ; this fact is connected with the vicinity of the Pole . Storms in those latitudes result less from disorder of the winds than from submarine electrical discharges . In the year 1866 the transatlantic cable was disturbed at regular intervals in its working for two hours in the twenty-four , from noon to two o'clock , by a sort of intermittent fever . Certain compositions and decompositions of forces produce phenomena , and impose themselves on the calculations of the seaman under pain of shipwreck . The day that navigation , now a routine , shall become a mathematic , the day we shall , for instance , seek to know why it is that in our regions hot winds come sometimes from the north , and cold winds from the south ; the day we shall understand that diminutions of temperature are proportionate to oceanic depths ; the day we realize that the globe is a vast loadstone polarized in immensity , with two axes an axis of rotation , and an axis of effluvium , intersecting each other at the centre of the earth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when those who risk life will choose to risk it scientifically ; when men shall navigate assured from studied uncertainty ; when the captain shall be a meteorologist ; whin the pilot shall be a chemist ; then will many catastrophes be avoided . The sea is magnetic as much as aquatic : an ocean of unknown forces floats in the ocean of the waves , or , one might say , on the surface . Only to /z/ hold in the sea a mass of water is not to see it at all : the sea is an ebb and flow of fluid , as much as a flux and reflux of liquid . It is , perhaps , complicated by attractions even more than by hurricanes ; molecular adhesion manifested among other phenomena by capillary attraction , although microscopic , takes in ocean , its place in the grandeur of immensity ; and the wave of effluvium sometimes aids , sometimes counteracts , the wave of the air and the wave of the waters . He who is ignorant of eleciric law is ignorant of hydraulic law ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no study more difficult nor more obscure ; it verges on empiricism , just as astronomy verges on astrology ; and yet without this study there is no navigation . Having said this much we will pass on . One of the most dangerous components of the sea is the snow-storm . The snow-storm is above all things magnetic . The pole produces it as it produces the aurora borealis . It is in the fog of the one as in the light of the other ; and in the flake of snow as in the streak of flame , effluvium is visible . Storms are the nervous attacks and delirious frenzies of the sea . The sea has its ailments . Tempests may be compared to maladies . Some are mortal , others not ; some may be escaped , others not . The snow-storm is supposed to . be generally mortal . Jarabija one of the pilots of Magellan , termed it ' * " a cloud issuing from the devil 's sore side . " The old Spanish navigators called this kind of squall la nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came with hail . According to them , bats fell from the sky , with the snow . Snow-storms are characteristic of polar latitudes ; nevertheless , at times they glide one might almost say tumbleinto our climates ; so much ruin is mingled with the chances of the air . The Matutina , as we have seen , plunged resolutely into the great hazard of the night , a hazard increased by the impending storm . She had encountered its menace with a sort of tragic audacity ; nevertheless , it must be remembered that she had received due warning . /z/ OtTR FIRST KOTJGH SKETCHES FILLED IN . WHILE the hooker was in the gulf of Portland , there was but little sea on ; the ocean , if gloomy , was almost still , and the sky was yet clear . The wind took little effect on the vessel ; the hooker hugged the cliff as closely as possible ; it served as a screen to her . There were ten on board the little Biscayan felucca , three men in crew , and seven passengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open sea ( which broadens twilight into day ) all the figures on board were clearly visible . Besides they were not hiding now , they were all at ease , each one reassumed his freedom of manner , spoke in his own note , showed his face : departure was to them a deliverance . The motley nature of the group shone out . The women were of no age . A wandering life produces premature old age , and indigence is made up of wrinkles . One of them was a Basque of the Dry-ports . The other , with a large rosary , was an Irishwoman . They wore that air of indifference common to the wretched . They had squatted down close to each other when they got on board , on chests at the foot of the mast . They talked to each other . Irish and Basque are , as we have said , kindred languages . The Basque woman 's hair was scented with onions and basil . The skipper of the hooker was a Basque of Guipuzcoa . One sailor was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other was of the southern slope , that is to say , they were of the same nation , although the first was French and the latter Spanish . The Basques recognize no official country . Mi madre se llama Montana my mother is called the mountain , as Zalareus , the muleteer , used to say . Of the five men who were with the two women , one was a Frenchman of Languedoc , one a Frenchman of Provence , one a Genoese ; one an old man , he who wore the sombrero with- /z/ out a hole for a pipe , appeared to be a German . Ths fifth , the chief , was a Basque of the Landes from Biscarrosse . It was he who just as the child was going on board the hooker , had , with a kick of his heel , cast the plank into the sea . This man , robust , agile , sudden in movement , covered , as may be remembered , with trimmings , slashings , and glistening tinsel , could not keep in his place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and fro from one end of the vessel to the other , as if debating uneasily on what had been done and what was going to happen . This chief of the band , the captain and the two men of the crew , all four Basques , spoke sometimes Basque , sometimes Spanish , sometimes French these three languages being common on both slopes of the Pyrenees . But generally speaking , excepting the women , all talked something like French , which was the foundation of their slang . The French language about this period began to be chosen by the peoples as something intermediate between the excess of consonants in the north , and the excess of vowels in the south . In Europe , French was the language of commerce , and also of felony . It will be remembered that Gibby , a London thief , understood Cartouche . The hooker , a fine sailor , was making quick way ; still , ten persons , besides their baggage , were a heavy cargo for one of such light draught . The fact of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily imply that the crew were accomplices . It was sufficient that the captain of the vessel was a Vascongado , and that the chief of the band was another . Among that race mutual assistance is a duty which admits of no exception . A Basque , as we have said , is neither Spanish nor French ; he is Basque , and always and everywhere he must succor a Basque . Such is Pyrenean fraternity . All the time the hooker was in the gulf , the sky , although threatening , did not frown enough to cause tha fugitives any uneasiness . They were flying , they wera escaping , they were brutally gay . One laughed , another ang ; the laugh was dry but free , the song was low but careless . The Languedocian cried , " Caoucapnof " " Cocagn* " /q/ expresses the highest pitch of satisfaction in Narbonne . He was a longshore sailor , a native of the waterside accustomed to work the reaches of the inlet of Bages , and to draw the dragnet full of fish over the salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wear a red cap , make complicated signs of the cross after the Spanish fashion , drink wine out of goat-skins , eat scraped ham , kneel down to blaspheme , and implore their patron saint with threats : " Great saint , grant me what I ask , or I 'll throw a stone at thy head , ou tefey um pic " He might be , at need , a useful addition to the crew . The Proveii9al in the caboose was blowing up a turf fire under an iron pot , and making broth . The broth was a kind of puchero , in which fish took the place of meat , and into which the Provenyal threw chick peas , little bits of bacon cut in squares , the pods of red pimento ; concessions made by the eaters of bouillabaisse to the eaters of olla podrida . One of the bags of provisions was beside him unpacked . He had lighted over his head an iron lantern , glazed with talc , which swung on a hook from the ceiling . By its side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a popular belief in those days that a dead halcyon , hung by the beak , always turned its breast to the quarter whence the wind was blowing . While he made the broth , the Proven9al put the neck of a gourd into his mouth , and now and then swallowed a draught of aguardiente . It was one of those gourds covered with wicker , broad and flat , with handles , which used to be hung to the side by a strap , and which were then called hip-gourds . Between each gulp he mumbled one of those country songs of which the subject is nothing at all : a hollow road , a hedge ; you see in the meadow , through a gap in the bushes , the shadow 01 a horse and cart , elongated in the unset , and from time to time , above the hedge , the end of a fork loaded with hay appears and disappears you want no more to make a song . A departure , according to the bent of one 's mind , is a relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man of the band , the man with the hat that had no pipe . /z/ This old man , who looked more German than anything else , although he had one of those unfathomable faces in which nationality is lost , was bald , and so grave that his " baldness might have been a tonsure . Every time he passed before the Virgin on the prow , he raised his felt hat , so that you could see the swollen and senile veins of his skull . A sort of full gown , torn and threadbare , of brown Dorchester serge , but half hid his closely fitting coat , tight , compact , and hooked up to the neck like a cassock . His hands inclined to cross each other , and had the mechanical junction of habitual prayer . He had what might be called a wan countenance ; for the countenance is above all things a reflection , and it is an error to believe that idea is colorless . That countenance was evidently the surface of a strange inner state , the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in good , others in evil , and to an observer it was the revelation of one who was less and more than human capable of falling below the scale of the tiger , or of rising above that of man . Such chaotic souls exist . There was something inscrutable in that face . Its secret reached the abstract . You felt that the man had known the foretaste of evil which is the calculation , and the after-taste which is the zero . In his impassibility , which was perhaps only on the surface , were imprinted two petrifactions : the petrifaction of the heart proper to the hangman , and the petrifaction of the mind proper to the mandarin . One might have said ( for the monstrous has its mode of being complete ) , that all things were possible to him , even emotion . In every savant there is something of the corpse , and this man was a savant . Only to see him you caught science imprinted in the gestures of his . body and in the folds of his dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was counteracted by that wrinkled mobility of the polyglot which verges on grimace . But a severe man withal ; nothing of the hypocrite , nothing of the cynic . A tragic dreamer . He was one of those/whom crime leaves pensive ; he had the brow of an incendiary tempered by the eyes of an archbishop . His sparse gray locks turned to white over his temples . The Christian was evident in him , complicated with the fatalism of the Turk . Chalkstones deformed his fingers , dissected by leanness . The stiffness of his tall frame was grotesque . He had his sealegs , /q/ he walked slowly about the deck , not looking at any one , with an air decided and sinister . His eyeballs were vaguely filled with the fixed light of a soul studious of the darkness and afflicted by reapparitions of conscience . From time to time the chief of the band , abrupt and alert , and making sudden turns about the vessel , came to him and whispered in his ear . The old man answered by &; nod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ Two men on board the craft were absorbed in thought the old man , and the skipper of the hooker , who must not be mistaken for the chief of the band . The captain was occupied by the sea , the old man by the sky . The former did not lift his eyes from the waters ; the latter kept watch on the firmament . The skipper 's anxiety was the state of the sea ; the old man seemed to suspect the heavens . He scanned the stars through every break in the clouds . It was the time when day still lingers , but some few stars begin faintly to pierce the twilight . The horizon was singular . The mist upon it varied . Haze predominated on land , clouds at sea . The skipper , noting the rising billows , hauled all taut before he got outside Portland Bay . He would not delay so doing , until he should pass the headland . He examined the rigging closely , and satisfied himself that the lower shrouds were well set up , and supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who means to carry on with a press of sail , at all risks . The hooker was not trimmed , being two foot by the head . This was her weak point . The captain passed every minute from the binnacle to the standard compass , taking the bearings of objects on shore . The Matutina had at first a soldier 's wind which was not unfavorable , though she could not lie within five points of her course . The cnptaintook the helm as often as possible , trusting* no one but himself to prevent her /z/ from dropping to leeward , the effect of the rudder being influenced by the steerage- way . The difference between the true and apparent course , being relative to the way on the vessel , the hooker seemed to lie closer to the wind than she did in reality . The breeze was not a-beam , nor was the hooker close-hauled ; but one can not ascertain the true course made , except when the wind is abaft . When you perceive long streaks of clouds meeting in a point on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in that quarter ; but this evening the wind was variable ; the needle fluctuated ; the captain distrusted the erratic movements of the vessel . He steered carefully but resolutely , luffed her up , watched her coming to , prevented her from yawing , and from running into the wind 's eye : noted the leeway , the little jerks of the helm : was observant of every roll and pitch of the vessel , of the difference in her speed , and of the variable gusts of wind . For fear of accidents , he was constantly on the look-out for squalls from off the land he was hugging , and above all he was cautious to keep her full ; the direction of the breeze indicated by the compass being uncertain from the small size of the instrument . The captain 's eyes , frequently lowered , remarked every change in the waves . Once nevertheless he raised them towards the sky , and tried to make out the three stars of Orion 's belt . These stars are called the three magi , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He who sees the three magi is not far from the Saviour . " This glance of the captain 's tallied with an aside growled out , at the other end of the vessel , by the old man . " We do n't even see the pointers , nor the star Antares , red as he is . Not one is distinct . " No care troubled the other fugitives . Still , when the first hilarity they felt in their escape had passed away , they could not help remembering that they were at sea in the month of January , and that the wind was frozen . It was impossible to establish themselves in the cabin . It was much too narrow and too much encumbered by bales and baggage . The baggage belonged to the passengers , the bales to the crew , for the hooker was no pleasure boat , and was engaged in smuggling . The passengers were obliged to settle themselves on /q/ deck , a condition to which these wanderers easily resigned themselves . Open-air habits make it simple for vagabonds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la telleetoile ) is their friend , and the cold helps them to sleep ' sometimes to die . This night , as we have seen , there was no belle etoile . The Languedocian and the Genoese , while waiting for supper , rolled themselves up near the women , at the foot of the mast , in some tarpaulin which the sailors had thrown them . The old man remained at the bow motionless , and apparently insensible to the cold . The captain of the hooker , from the helm where he was standing , uttered a sort of guttural call somewhat like the cry of the American bird called the exclaimer ; at his call the chief of the band drew near , arid the captain addressed him thus : " Etcheco Jailna . " These two words , which mean " tiller of the mountain , " form with the old Cantabri a solemn preface to any subject which should command attention . Then the captain pointed the old man out to the chief , and the dialogue continued in Spanish ; it was not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains . Her are the questions and answers . " Etcheco jatina , que es este hombre ? " " Un hombre . " " Que lenguas habla ? " " Todas . " " Que cosas sabe ? " Todas . " " Qualpate ? " " Ningun , y todos . " Qual dios ? " " Dios . " " Como ie llamas ? " " El tonto . " " Como dices que le llamas ? " " Elsabio . " " En vuestre tropa que csta ? " " Esta lo que esta . " " Elgefe ? " /z/ " Pues que esta ? " " La alma. " * The chief and the captain parted , each reverting to his own meditation , and a little while afterwards the Matutina , left the gulf . Now came the great rolling of the open sea . The ocean in the spaces between the foam was slimy in appearance . The waves seen through the twilight in indistinct outline , somewhat resembled plashes of gall . Here and there a wave floating flat showed cracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones ; in the centre of these stars , in a revolving orifice , trembled a phosphorescence , like that feline reflection of vanished light which shines in the eyeballs of owls . Proudly , like a bold swimmer , the Matutina rnacori the dangerous Shambles shoal . This bank , a his ruction at the entrance of Portland roads , is n ; . r lais er , it is an amphitheatre a of sand under the ( in , its benches cut out by the v ... ng of the waves an ' , j-ena , round and symmetrical , as high as a Jungfrau only drowned a coliseum of the ocean , seen by the diver *B the vision-like transparency which engulfs him , such sn the Shambles shoal . There hydras fight , leviathans . iieet .

But eternity obeys man more than man imagines . /z/ THE old man whom the chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sage , now never left the forecastle . Since they crossed the Shambles shoal , his attention had been divided between the heavens and the waters . He looked down , he looked upwards , and above all watched the North East . The skipper gave the helm to a sailor , stopped over the after hatchway , crossed the gangway , and went on to the forecastle . He approached the old man , but not in front . He stood a little behind , with elbows resting on his hips , with outstretched hands , the head on one side , with open eyes and arched eyebrows , and a smile in the corners of his mouth , an attitude of curiosity hesitating between mockery and respect . The old man , either that it was his habit to talk to himself , or that hearing some one behind incited him to speech , began to soliloquize while he looked into space . " The Meridian from which the right ascension is calculated , is marked in this century by four stars , the Polar , Cassiopeia 's Chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is in Pegasus . But there is not one visible . ' ' These words followed each other mechanically , confused , and scarcely articulated , as if he did not care to pronounce them . They floated out of his mouth and dispersed . Soliloquy is the smoke exhaled by the inmost fires of the soul . The skipper broke in , " My lord ! " The old man , perhaps rather deaf as well as very thoughtful , went on , " Too few stars , and too much wind . The breeze continually changes its direction and blows inshore ; thence it rises perpendicularly . This results from tho land fl /z/ being warmer than the water . Its atmosphere is lighter . The cold and dense wind of the sea rushes in to replace it . From this cause , in the upper regions the wind blows towards the land from every quarter . It would be - ad visable to make long tacks between the true and apparent parallel . When the latitude by observation differs from the latitude by dead reckoning , by not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four minutes in sixty miles , you are in the true course . " * The skipper bowed , but the old man saw him not . The latter , who wore what resembled an Oxford or Got* tingen university gown , did not relax his haughty and rigid attitude . He observed the waters as a critic of waves and of men . He studied the billows , but almost as if he was about to demand his turn to speak amidst ; their turmoil , and teach them something . There was in him both pedagogue and soothsayer . He seemed an oracle of the deep . He continued his soliloquy , which was perhaps intended to be heard . " We might strive if we had a wheel instead of a helm . With a speed of twelve miles an hour , a force of twenty pounds exerted on the wheel produces three hundred thousand pounds ' effect on the course . And more too . For in some cases , with a double block and runner , they can get two more revolutions . " The skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord ! " The old man 's eye rested on him , he had turned hi* head without moving his body . Call me Doctor . " " Master Doctor , I am the skipper . " " Just so , " said the doctor . The doctor , as henceforward we shall call him , appeared willing to converse . " Skipper , have you an English sextant ? " " No . " " Without an English sextant you can not take an altitude at all . " " The Basques , " replied the captain , " took altitudes before there were any English . " " Be careful you are not taken aback . " * I keep her away when necessary . " /q/ " Have you tried how many knots she is running ? " Yes . " " When ? " " Just now . " " How ? " " By the log . " " Did you take the trouble to look at the triangle ? " " Yes . " " Did the sand run through the glass in exactly thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the sand has not worn the hole between the globes ? " " Yes . " ' Have you proved the sand-glass by the oscillations of a bullet ? " - " Suspended by a rope yarn drawn out from the top of a coil of soaked hemp ? Undoubtedly . " " Have you waxed the yarn lest it should stretch ? " " Yes . " " Have you tested the log ? " " I tested the sand-glass by the bullet , and checked the log by a round shot . " " Of what size was the shot ? " " One foot in diameter ? " " Heavy enough ? " " It is an old round shot of our war hooker , La Casse de Par-Grand . " " Which was in the Armada ? " " Yes . " " And which carried six hundred soldiers , fifty sailors , and twenty-five guns ? " " Shipwreck knows it . " " How did you compute the resistance of the water to the shot ?

" The doctor 's eyes were fixed on the north-east . The skipper continued , " Let us once reach the Gulf of Gascony , and I answer for our safety . Ah ! I should say I am at home there . I know it well , my Gulf of Gascony . It is a little basin , often very boisterous ; but there , I know every sounding in it and the nature of the bottom ; mud opposite San Cipriano , shells opposite Cizarque , and off Cape Penas , little pebbles off Boncaut de Mimizan , and I know the color of every pebble . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening . The doctor gazed at the north-east . Over that icy face passed an extraordinary expression . All the agony of terror possible to a mask of stone was depicted there . From his mouth escaped this word , " Good ! " His eyeballs , which had all at once become quite round like an owl 's , were dilated with stupor on discovering a speck on the horizon . He added , " It is well . As for me , I am resigned . " The skipper looked at him . The doctor went on talking to himself , or to some one in the deep : " I say , Yes . " Then he was silent , opened his eyes wider and wider with renewed attention on that which he was watching , and said , " It is coming from afar , but not the less surely will it come . " The arc of the horizon which occupied the visual rays and thoughts of the doctor , being opposite to the west , was illuminated by the transcendent reflection of twilight , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , and surrounded by streaks of grayish vapor , was uniformly blue , but of a leaden rather than cerulean blue . The doctor , having completely returned to the contemplation of the sea , pointed to this atmospheric arc , and said , " Skipper , do you see ? " " What ? " " That , " /z/ " What ? " " Out there . " A blue spot ? Yes . ' * " What is it ? " " A niche in heaven . " " For those who go to heaven ; for those who go elsewhere it is another affair . " And lie emphasized these enigmatical words with an appalling expression which was unseen in the darkness . A silence ensued . The skipper , remembering the two names given by the chief to this man , asked himself the question , " Is he a madman , or is he a sage ? " The stiff and bony finger of the doctor remained immovably pointing , like a sign-post , to the misty blue spot in the sky . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he growled out , " it is not sky but clouds . " " A blue cloud is worse then a black cloud , " said the doctor ; " and , " he added , " it 's a snow-cloud . " " La nube de la nieve , " said the skipper , as if trying to understand the word better by translating it . " Do you know what a snow-cloud is ? " asked the doctor . " No . " " You 'll know by and by . " The skipper again turned his attention to the . horizon . Continuing to observe the cloud , he muttered between his teeth , " One month of squalls , another of wet ; January with its gales , February with its rains , that 's all the winter we Asturians get . Our rain even is warm . We 've no snow but on the mountains . Ay , ay , look out for the avalanche . The avalanche is no respecter of persons . The avalanche is a brute . ' " And the waterspout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a pause , " Here it comes . " He continued , " Several winds sire getting up together . A strong wind from the west , and a gentle wind from the east . " " That last is a deceitful one , " said the skipper . The blue cloud was growing larger . M If the enow , " said the doctor , " is appalling when it /z/ idips down the mountain , think what it is when it lallg from the Pole ! " His eye was glassy . The cloud seemed to spread over his face and simultaneously over the horizon . He contiuued , in musing tones , " Every minute the fatal hour draws nearer . The will of heaven is about to be manifested . " The skipper asked himself again this question , " Is he a madman ? " " Skipper , " began the doctor , without taking his eyes off the cloud , " have you often crossed the Channel ? 5 ' " This is the first time . " The doctor , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponge can take up but a definite quantity of water , had but a definite measure of anxiety , displayed no more emotion at this answer of the skipper than was expressed by a slight shrug of his shoulders . " How is that ? " " Master Doctor , my usual cruise is to Ireland . I sail from Fontarabia to Black Harbor , or to the A chill Islands . I go sometimes to Braich-y-Pwll , a point on the Welsh coast . But I always steer outside the Scilly Islands . I do not know this sea at all . " " That 's serious . Woe to him who is inexperienced on the ocean ! One ought to be familiar with the Channel : the Channel is the Sphinx . Look out for shoals . " " We are in twenty-five fathoms here . " We ought to get into fifty-five fathoms to the west , and avoid even twenty fathoms to the east . " " We 'll sound as we get on . " " The Channel is not an ordinary sea .

" SS Jtr OHDEh OF THE KING " Take care what you say . Pronounce not lightly the awful name . " " I will sound , I tell you . " " Be sensible ; you will have a gale of wind presently . " " T say that I will try for soundings . " " The resistance of the water will prevent the lead from sinking , and the line will break . Ah ! so this is your first time in these waters ? " " The first time . " " Very well ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word Listen was so commanding , that the skipper made an obeisance . " Master Doctor , I am all attention . " " Port your helm , and haul up on the starboard tack . " " What do you mean ? " " Steer your course to the west . " " Caramba ! " " Steer your course to the west . " " Impossible . " " As you will . What I tell you is for the others flfi , As for myself , I am indifferent . " " But , Master Doctor , steer west ? " " Yes , skipper . " " The wind will be dead ahead . " " Yes , skipper . " " She 'll pitch like the devil . " " Moderate your language . Yes , skipper . " " The vessel would be in irons . " " Yes , skipper .

" " Skipper , do , - you know what is for us the word of death ? " " No . " " Death is the east . " " I 'll steer west . " This time the doctor , having turned right round , looked the skipper full in the face , and with his eyes resting on him , as though to implant the idea in his head , pronounced slowly , syllable by syllable , these words , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bell , the ship is lost . " The skipper pondered in amaze . " What do you mean ? " The doctor did not answer . His countenance , expressive for a moment , was now reserved . His eyes became vacuous . He did not appear to hear the skipper 's wondering question . He was now attending to his own monologue . His lips let fall , as if mechanically , in a low murmuring tone , these words , " The time has come for sullied souls to purify themselves . " The skipper made that expressive grimace , which raises the chin towards the nose . " He is more madman than sage , " he growled , and moved off . Nevertheless he steered west . But the wind and the sea were rising . /z/ THE mist was deformed by all sorts of inequalities , bulging out at once on every point of the horizon , as if invisible mouths were busy puffing out the bags of wind . The formation of the clouds was becoming ominous . In the west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now invaded /z/ by the blue cloud : it advanced in the teeth of the wind . These contradictions are part of the wind 's vagaries . The sea , which a moment before wore scales , now wore a skin such is the nature of that dragon . It was no longer a crocodile , it was a boa . The skin , lead-colored and dirty , looked thick , and was crossed by heavy wrinkles . Here and there , on its surface , bubbles of surge , like pustules , gathered and then burst . The foam was like a leprosy . It was at this moment that the hooker , still seen from afar by the child , lighted her signal . A quarter of an hour elapsed . The skipper looked for the doctor : he was no longer on deck . Directly the skipper had left him , the doctor had stooped his somewhat ungainly form under the hood , and had entered the cabin : there he had sat down near the stove , on a block . He had taken a shagreen ink-bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had extracted from his pocket-book a parchment folded four times , old , stained , and yellow ; he had opened the sheet , taken a pen out of his ink-case , placed the pocket-book flat on his knee , and the parchment on the pocket-book ; and by the rays of the lantern , which was lighting the cook , he set to writing on the back of the parchment . The roll of the waves inconvenienced him . He wrote thus for some time . As he wrote , the doctor remarked the gourd of aguardiente , which the Provenal tasted every time he added a grain of pimento to the puchero , as if he were consulting it in reference to the seasoning . The doctor noticed the gourd , not because it was a bottle of brandy , but because of the name which was plaited in the wicker-work with red rushes on a background of white . There was light enough in the cabin to permit of his reading the name . The doctor paused , and spelled it in a low voice , " Hardquanonne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not observed that gourd before ; did it belong to Hardquanonne ? " " Yes , " the cook answered ; " to our poor comrade , Hardquanonne . " The doctor went on . " To Hardquanonne , the Fleming of Flanders ? ** " Yes . " " Who is in prison ? " /q/ " In the dungeon at Chatham ? " i " It is his gourd , " replied the cook ; " and he was my Iriend . I keep it in remembrance of him . When shall we see him again ? It is the bottle he used to wear slung over his hip . " The doctor took up his pen again , and continued laboriously tracing somewhat straggling lines on the parchment . He was evidently anxious that his handwriting should be very legible ; and , at length , notwithstanding the tremulousness of the vessel and the tremulousness of age , he finished what he wanted to write . It was time , for , suddenly , a sea struck the craft , a mighty rush of waters besieged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance in which ships lead off with the tempest . The doctor arose and approached the stove , meeting the ship 's motion with his knees dexterously bent , dried as best he could , at the stove where the pot was boiling , the lines he had written , refolded the parchment in the pocket-book , and replaced the pocket-book and the inkLorn in his pocket . The stove was not the least ingenious piece of interior economy in the hooker . It was judiciously isolated . Meanwhile , the pot heaved the Provencal was watching it . " Fish broth , " said he . " For the fishes , " replied the doctor . Then he went on deck again . /z/ THROUGH his growing preoccupation , the doctor in some ort reviewed the situation ; and any one near to him might have heard these words drop from his lips , " Too much rolling , and not enough pitching . " Then recalled to himself by the dark workings of his mind , he sank again into thought , as a miner into his Nhaf t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . The contemplation of the sea is in itself a reverie . /z/ The dark punishment of the waters , eternally tortured , was commencing . A lamentation arose from the whole main . Preparations , confused and melancholy , were forming in space . The doctor observed all before him , and lost no detail . There was , however , no sign of scrutiny in his face . One does not scrutinize hell . A vast commotion , yet half latent , but visible through the turmoils in space , increased and irritated , more and more , the winds , the vapors , the waves . Nothing is so logical and nothing appears so absurd as the ocean . Selfdispersion is the essence of its sovereignty , and is one of the elements of its redundance . The sea is ever for and against . It knots , that it may unravel , itself ; one of its slopes attacks , the other relieves . No apparition is so wonderful as the waves . Who can paint the alternating hollows and promontories , the valleys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickets of foam , blendings of mountains and dreams ? The indescribable is everywhere there , in the rending , in the frowning , in the anxiety , in the perpetual contradiction , in the chiaroscuro , in the pendants of the cloud , in the keys of the everopen vault , in the disaggregation without rupture , in the funereal tumult caused by all that madness ! The wind had just set due north . Its violence was so favorable and so useful in driving them away from England that the captain of the Matutina had made up his mind to set all sail . The hooker slipped through the- foam as at a gallop , the wind right aft , bounding from wave to wave in a gay frenzy . The fugitives were delighted , and laughed ; they clapped their hands , applauded the surf , the sea , the wind , the sails , the swift progress , the flight , all unmindful of the future . The doctor appeared not to see them , and dreamt on . Every vestige of day had faded away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distant cliff , lost sight of the hooker . Up to then , his glance had remained fixed , and , as it were , leaning on the vessel . What part had that look in fate ? When the hooker was lost to sight in the distance , and when the child could no longer see aught , the child went north and the ship want south . All were plunged in darkness . /z/ ON their part it was with wild jubilee and delight that those on board the hooker saw the hostile land recede and lessen behind them . By degrees the dark ring of ocean rose higher , dwarfing in twilight Portland , Purbeck , Tineham , Kimmeridge , the Matravers , the long streaks of dim cliffs , and the coast dotted with lighthouses . England disappeared . The fugitives had now nothing round them but the sea . All at once night grew awful . There was no longer extent nor space ; the sky became blackness , and closed in round the vessel . The snow began to fall slowly ; a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else was visible in the course of the wind . They felt as if yielded up . A snare lurked in every possibility . It is in this cavernous darkness that in our climate the Polar waterspout makes its appearance . A great muddy cloud , like to the belly of a hydra , hung over ocean , and in places its lividity adhered to the waves . Some of these adherences resembled pouches with holes , pumping the sea , disgorging vapor , and refilling themselves with water . Here and there these suctions drew up cones of foam on the sea . The boreal storm hurled itself on the hooker . The hooker rushed to meet it . The squall and the vessel met as though to insult each other . In the first mad shock not a sail was clewed up . not a jib lowered , not a reef taken in , so much is flight a delirium . The mast creaked and bent back as if in fear . Cyclones , in our northern hemisphere , circle from left to right , in the same direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is sometimes as much as 60 miles /z/ an hour . Although she was entirely at the mercy of that whirling power , the hooker behaved as if she were out in moderate weather , without any further precaution than keeping her head on to the rollers , with the wind broad on the bow so as to avoid being pooped or caught broadside on . This semi-prudence would have availed her nothing in case of the wind 's shifting and taking her aback . A deep rumbling was brewing up in the distance . Th roar of the abyss , nothing can be compared to it . It is the great brutish howl of the universe . What we call matter , that unsearchable organism , that amalgamation of incommensurable energies , in which can occasionally be detected an almost imperceptible degree of intention which makes us shudder , that blind , benighted cosmos , that enigmatical Pan , has a cry , a strange cry , prolonged , obstinate , and continuous , which is less than speech and more than thunder . That cry is the hurricane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones , proceed from nests , from broods , from pairings , from nuptials , from homes . This one , a trumpet , comes out of the Naught , which is All . Other voices express the soul of the universe , this one expresses the monster . It is the howl of the formless . It is the inarticulate , finding utterance in the indefinite . A thing it is full of pathos and terror . Those clamors converse above and beyond man . They rise , fall , undulate , determine waves of sound , form all sorts of wild surprises for the mind , now burst close to the ear with the importunity of a peal of trumpets , now assail us with the rumbling hoarseness of distance . Giddy uproar which resembles a language , and which , in fact , is a language . It is the effort which the world makes to speak . It is the lisping of the wonderful . In this wail ' is manifested vaguely all that the vast dark palpitation endures , suffers , accepts , rejects . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an access of chronic sickness , and rather an epilepsy diffused than a force employed ; we fancy that we are witnessing the descent of supremo evil into the infinite . At moments we seem to discern ft reclamation of the elements , some vain effort of chaos to reassert itself over creation . At times it is a complaint . The void bewails and justifies itself . It is as the pleading of the world 's cause . We can fancy that the universe in /q/ ngaged in a lawsuit ; we listen , we try to grasp the reasons given , the redoubtable for and against . iSuch a moaning of the shadows has the tenacity of a syllogism . Here is a vast trouble for thought . Here is the raison d'etre of mythologies and polytheisms . To the terror of those great murmurs are added superhuman outlines melting away as they appear , Eumenides which ar almost distinct , throats of furies shaped in the clouds , Plutonian chimeras almost defined . No horrors equal those sobs , those laughs , those tricks of tumult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid . Man knows not what to become in the presence of that awful incantation . He bows under the enigma of those Draconian intonations . What latent meaning have they ? What do they signify ? What do they threaten ? What do they implore ? It would seem as though all bonds were loosened . Vociferations from precipice to precipice , from air to water , from the wind to the wave , from the rain to the rock , from the zenith to the nadir , from the stars to the foam , the abyss unmuzzled such is that tumult , complicated by some mysterious strife with evil consciences . The loquacity of night is not less lugubrious than its silence . One feels in it the anger of the unknown . Night is a presence . Presence of what ? For that matter we must distinguish between night and the shadows . In the night there is the absolute ; in the darkness the multiple . Grammar , logic as it is , admits of no singular for the shadows . The night is one , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scattered , the nigitive , the crumbling , the fatal ; one feels earth no longer , one feels the other reality . In the shadow , infinite and indefinite , lives something or some one ; but that which lives there forms part of our death . After our earthly passage , when that shadow shall be light for us , the life which is beyond our life shall seize us . Meanwhile it appears to touch and try us . Obscurity is a pressure . Night is , as it were , a hand placed on our soul . At certain hideous and solemn hours The above is a very inefficient and rather absurd translation of the French . It turns upon the fact that in the French languge , tha word for darkness is plural-Tenberes. - TiiANSL.ATOB. /z/ we feel that which is beyond the wall of the tomb encroaching on us . Never does this proximity of the unknown seem more imminent than in storms at sea . The horrible combined with the fantastic . The possible interrupter of human actions , the old Cloud compeller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape he chooses , the inconsisten t element , the limitless incoherence , the force diffused and undecided of aim . That mystery the tempest , every instant accepts and executes some unknown changes of will , apparent or real . Poets have , in all ages , called this the caprice of the waves . But there is no such thing as caprice . The disconcerting enigmas which in nature we call caprice , and in human life chance , are splinters of a law revealed to us in glimpses . /z/ THE characteristic of the snow-storm is its blackness . Nature 's habitual aspect during a storm , the earth or sea black and the sky pale , is reversed ; the sky is black , the ocean white , foam below , darkness above ; an horizon walled in with smoke ; a zenith roofed with crape . The tempest resembles a cathedral hung with mourning , but no light in that cathedral : no phantom lights on the crests of the waves , no spark , no phosphorescence , naught but a huge shadow . The Polar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sets fire to every light , and the other extinguishes them all . The world is suddenly converted into the arched vault of a cave . Out of the night falls a dust of pale spots , which hesitate between sky and sea . These spots , which are flakes of snow , slip , wander , and float . It is like the tears of a winding-sheet putting themselves into life-like motion . A mad wind mingles with this dissemination . Blackness crumbling into whiteness , the furious into the obscure , all the tumult of which the sepulchre is capable , a whirlwind under a catafalque such is the snowstorm . Under* /q/ neath trembles the ocean , forming and reforming over portentous unknown depths . In the Polar wind , which is electrical , the flakes turn suddenly into hailstones , and the air becomes filled with projectiles ; the water crackles , shot with grape . No thunderstrokes : the lightning of boreal storms is silent . What is sometimes said of the cat , " it swears , " may be applied to this lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and strangely inexorable . The snow-storm is a storm blind and dumb ; when it has passed , the ships also are often blind and the sailors dumb . To escape from such an abyss is difficult . It would be wrong , however , to believe shipwreck to be absolutely inevitable . The Danish fishermen of Disco and the Balesin ; the seekers of black whales ; Hearn , steering towards Behring Strait , to discover the mouth of Coppermine River ; Hudson , Mackenzie , Vancouver , Ross , Dumont D'Urville , all underwent at the Pole itself the wildest hurricanes , and escaped out of them . It was into this description of tempest that the hooker had entered , triumphant and in full sail . Frenzy against frenzy . When Montgomery , escaping from Rouen , threw his galley , with all the force of its oars , against the chain barring the Seine at La Bouille , he showed similar effrontery . The Matutina sailed on fast ; she bent so much under her sails , that at moments she made a fearful angle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keel adhered to the water as if glued to it . The keel resisted the grasp of the hurricane . The lantern at the prow cast its light ahead . The cloud , full of winds , dragging its tumor over the deep , cramped and eat more and more into the sea round the hooker . Not a gull , not a sea-mew , nothing but snow . The expanse of the field of waves was becoming contracted and terrible ; only three or four gigantic ones were visible . Now and then a tremendous flash of lightning of a red copper color broke out behind the obscure super-position of the horizon and the zenith ; that sudden release of ver milion flame revealed the horror of the clouds ; that abrupt conflagration of the depths , to which for an instant /z/ the first tiers of clouds and the distant boundaries of the celestial chaos seemed to adhere , placed the abyss in perspective . On this ground of fire the snow-flakes showed black ; they might have been compared to dark butterflies flying about in a furnace then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squall , still pursuing the hooker , began to roar in thorough bass . This phase of grumbling is a perilous diminution of uproar . Nothing is so terrifying as this monologue of the storm . This gloomy recitative appears to serve as a moment of rest to the mysterious combating forces , and indicates a species of patrol kept in the unknown . The hooker held wildly on her course . Her two mainsails especially were doing fearful work . The sky and eea were as of ink with jets of foam running higher than the mast . Every instant masses of water swept the deck like a deluge , and at each roll of the vessel , the hawseholes , now to starboard now to larboard , became as so many open mouths vomiting back the foam into the sea . The women had taken refuge in the cabin , but the men remained on deck ; the blinding snow eddied round , the spitting surge mingled with it . All was fury . At that moment the chief of the band , standing abaft on the stern-frames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other taking off the kerchief he wore round his head and waving it in the light of the lantern , gay and arrogant , with pride in his face , and his hair in wild disorder , intoxicated by all the darkness , cried out , " We are free ! ' ' " Free , free , free , " echoed the fugitives , arid the band , Seizing hold of the rigging , rose up on deck . " Hurrah ! " shouted the chief . And the band shouted in the storm , " Hurrah ! " Just as this clamor was dying away in the tempest , a loud solemn voice rose from the other end of the vessel , Baying , Silence ! " All turned their heads . The darkness was thick , and the doctor was leaning against the mast so that he seemed part of it , and they could not see him . The voice spoke again , /q/ " Listen ! " All were silent . Then did they distinctly hear through the darkness the toll of a bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out laughing , " A bell , that 's good . We are on the larboard tack What does the bell prove ? Why , that we have land to gtarboard . " The firm and measured voice of the doctor replied , " You have not land to starboard . " " But we have , " shouted the skipper . " No ! " " But that bell tolls from the land . " " That bell , " said the doctor , " tolls from the sea . " A shudder passed over these daring men , the haggard faces of the two women appeared above the companion like two hobgoblins conjured up : the doctor took a step forward , separating , his tall form from the mast . From the depth of the night 's darkness came the toll of the bell . The doctor resumed , " There is in the midst of the sea , half way between Portland and the Channel Islands , a buoy , placed there as a caution ; that buoy is moored by chains to the shoal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buoy is fixed an iron trestle , and across the trestle a bell is hung . In bad weather heavy seas toss the buoy , and the bell rings . That is the bell you hear . " The doctor paused to allow an extra-violent gust of wind to pass over , waited until the sound of the bell reasserted itself , and then went on , " To hear that bell in a storm , when the nor ' - wester is blowing , is to be lost Wherefore ? For this reason : if you hear the bell , it is because the wind brings it to you . But the wind is nor ' - westerly , and the breakers of Aurigny lie east . You hear the bell only because you are between the buoy and the breakers . It is on those breakers the wind is driving you . You are on the wrong /z/ side of the buoy . If you were on the right side , you would be out at sea on a safe course , and you would not hear the bell . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pass close to the buoy wjthout knowing it . W e are ou t our COUI se . That bell is shipwreck sounding the tocsin . Now , look out ! " As the doctor spoke the bell , soothed by a lull of the storm , rang slowly stroke by stroke ; and its intermitting toll seemed to testify to the truth of the old man 's words . It was as the knell of the abyss . All listened breathless . Now to the voice . Now to the bell . /z/ IN the meantime the skipper had caught up his speaking-trumpet . " Strike every sail , my lads ; let go the sheets , man the down-hauls , lower ties and brails . Let us steer to the west , let us regain the high sea ; head for the buoy , steer for the bell , there 's an offing down there . We 've yet a chance . " " Try , " said the doctor . Let us remark here , by the way , that this ringing buoy , a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are yet alive very old mariners who remember hearing it . It forewarned , but rather too late . The orders of the skipper were obeyed . The Languedocian made a third sailor . All bore a hand . Not satisfied with brailing up , they furled the sails ; lashed the earrings , secured the clew-lines , bunt-lines , and leech-lines ; and clapped preventor-shrouds on the block straps , which thus might serve as back-stays . They fished the mast . They battened down the ports and bulls ' eyes , which is a method of walling up a ship . These evolutions , though executed in a lubberly fashion , were , nevertheless , thoroughly effective . The hooker was stripped to bare poles . But , in proportion as the vessel , stowing every stitch of canvas , became more helpless , the havoc of both winds and waves increased . The seas ran mountains high . Th /q/ hurricane , like an executioner hastening to his victim , began to dismember the craft . There came , in the twinkling of an eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bolt-ropes , the chess-trees were hewn asunder , the deck was swept clear , the shrouds were carried away , the mast went by the board , all the lumber of the wreck was flying in shivers . The main shrouds gave out although they were turned in , and stoppered to four fathoms . The magnetic currents common to snow-storms hastened the destruction of the rigging . It broke as much from the effect of effluvium as the violence of the wind . Most of the chain gear , fouled in the blocks , ceased to work . Forward the bows , aft the quarters , quivered under the terrific shocks . One wave washed overboard the compass and its binnacle . A second carried away the boat , which , like a box slung under a carriage , had been , in accordance with the quaint Asturian custom , lashed to the bow-sprit . A third breaker wrenched off the spritsail yard . A fourth swept away the figure-head and signal light . The rudder only was left . To replace the ship 's bow lantern they set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large block of wood covered with oakum and tar . The mast , broken in two , all bristling with quivering splinters , ropes , blocks , and yards cumbered the deck . In falling it had stove in a plank of the starboard gunwale . The skipper , still firm at the helm , shouted , " While we can steer , we have yet a chance . The lower planks hold good . Axes , axes ! Overboard with the mast ! Clear the decks I " Both crew and passengers worked with the excitement of despair . A few strokes of the hatchets , and it was done . They pushed the mast over the side . The deck was cleared . " Now , " continued the skipper , " take a rope 's end and lash me to the helm . " To the tiller they bound him . While they were fastening him he laughed , and shouted , " Blow , old hurdy-gurdy , bellow . I 've seen your equal off Cape Machichaco . " And when secured , he clutched the helm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes well , my lads . Long live our Lady of Buglose ; let us steer west* " /z/ An enormous wave caine down abeam , and fell on the vessel 's quarter . There is always in storms a tiger-likt wave , a billow fierce and decisive , which , attaining a certain height , creeps horizontally over the surface of th waters for a time , then rises , roars , rages , and falling on the distressed vessel , tears it limb from limb . A cloud of foam covered the entire poop of the Matu- There was heard above the confusion of darkness and waters , a crash . When the spray cleared off , when the stern again rose In view , the skipper and the helm had disappeared . Both had been swept away . The helm and the man they had but just secured to it , had passed with the wave into the hissing turmoil of the hurricane . The chief of the band , gazing intently into the darkness , shouted , " Te btirlas de nosotros f " To this defiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor . Save the skipper . " They rushed to the capstan and let go the anchor . Hookers carry but one . In this case the anchor reached the bottom , but only to be lost . The bottom was of the hardest rock . The billows were raging with resistless force . The cable snapped like a thread . The unchor lay at the bottom of the sea . At the cutwater there remained but the cable end protruding from the hawse-hole . From this moment the hooker became a wreck . The Matutina was irrevocably disabled . The vessel , just before in fall sail , and almost formidable in her speed , was now helpless . All her evolutions were uncertain and executed at random . She yielded passively and like a log to the capricious fury of the waves . That in a few minutes there should be in place of an eagle a useless cripple , such a transformation is to be witnessed only at sea . The howling of the wind became more and more frightful . A hurricane has terrible lungs ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be intensified . The bell on the sea rang despairingly , as if tolled by a weird hand . The Matutina drifted like a cork at the mercy of the ST ORDER OF THE KING . iOS f raves . She sailed no longer she merely floated . Every naornent she seemed about to turn over on her back , like a. dead fish . The good condition and perfectly watertight state of the hull , alone saved her from this disaster . Below the water-line not a plank had started . There was not a cranny , chink , nor crack ; and she had not made a single drop of water in the hold . This was lucky , as the pump , being out of order , was useless . The hooker pitched and rolled frightfully in the seething billows . The vessel had throes as of sickness , and seemed to be trying to belch forth the unhappy crew . Helpless they clung to the standing rigging , to the transoms , to the shank painters , to the gaskets , to the broken planks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warped riders , and to all the rugged projections of the stumps of the masts . From time to time they listened . The toll of the bell came over the waters fainter and fainter ; one would have thought that it also was in distress . Its ringing was no more than an intermittent rattle . Then this rattle died away . Where were they ? At what distance from the buoy ? The sound of the bell had frightened them its silence terrified them . The north-wester drove them forward in , perhaps , a fatal course . They felt themselves wafted on by maddened and ever-recurring gusts of wind . The wreck sped forward in the darkness . There is nothing more fearful than being hurried forward blindfold . They felt the abyss before them , over them , under them . It was no longer a run , it was a rush . Suddenly , through the appalling density of the snowstorm , there loomed a red light . " A lighthouse ! " cried the crew . /z/ IT was indeed , the Caskets light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of masonry , surmounted by scientifically constructed aoachinery for throwing light . The Casket lighthouse in /z/ particular is a triple white tower , beanng three lightrooms . These three chambers revolve on clock-work wheels , with such precision that the man on watch who sees them from sea , can invariably take ten steps during their irradiation , and twenty-five during their eclipse . Everything is based on the focal plan , and on the rotation of the octagon drum , formed of eight wide simple lenses , in range , having above and below it two series of dioptric rings ; an algebraic gear , Secured from the effects of the beating of winds and waves by glass a millimetre thick , yet sometimes broken by the sea-eagles , which dash themselves like great moths against these gigantic lanterns . The building which encloses and sustains this mechanism , and in which it is set , is also mathematically constructed . Everything about it is plain , exact , bare , precise , correct . A lighthouse is a mathematical figure . In the seventeenth century a lighthouse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The architecture of a lighthouse tower was magnificent and extravagant . It was covered with balconies , balusters , lodges , alcoves , weathercocks . Kothing but masks , statues , foliage , volutes , reliefs , figures large and small , medallions with inscriptions . Pax in bello , said the Eddystone lighthouse . We may as well observe , by the way , that this declaration of peace did not always disarm the ocean . Winstanley repeated it on a lighthouse which he constructed at his own expense , on a wild spot near Plymouth . The tower being finished , he shut himself up in it to have it tried by the tempest . The storm came and carried off the lighthouse , and Winstanley in it . Such excessive adornment gave too great a hold to the hurricane ; as generals too brilliantly equipped in battle , draw the enemy 's fire . Besides whimsical designs in stone , they were loaded with whimsical designs in iron , copper , and wood . The ironwork was in relief , the wood- work stood out . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the walls among the arabesques , engines of every description , useful and useless , windlasses , tackles , pulleys , counterpoises , ladders , cranes , grapnels . On the pinnacle around the light , delicately-wrought ironwork held great iron chandeliers , in which were placed pieces of rope steeped in resin ; wicks which burned doggedly , and which no wind extinguished j and from top to bottom the tower was BF ORDER OF THE KING . 10ft covered by a complication of sea standards , banderoles , banners , flags , pennons , colors which rose from stage to stage , from story to story , a medley of all hues , all shapes , all heraldic devices , all signals , all confusion , up to the light chamber , making , in the storm , a gay riot of tatters about the blaze . That insolent light on the brink of the abyss showed like a defiance , and inspired shipwrecked men with a spirit of daring . But the Casket , light was not after this fashion . It was , at that period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. had built it after the loss of the White Ship a flaming pile of wood under an iron trellis , a brasier behind a railing , a head of hair flaming in the wind . The only improvement made in this lighthouse since the twelfth century was a pair of forge-bellows worked by an indented pendulum and a stone weight , which had been added to the light chamber in 1610 . The fate of the sea-birds who chanced to fly against these old lighthouses was more tragic than those of our days . The birds dashed against them , attracted by the light , and fell into the brasier , where they could be seen struggling like black spirits in a hell , and at times they would fall back again between the railings upon the rock , red hot , smoking , lame , blind , like half-burnt flies out of a lamp . To a full-rigged ship in good trim , answering readily to the pilot 's handling the Caskets light is useful ; it cries Look out ; it warns her of the shoal . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paralyzed and inert , without resistance , without defence against the impulse of the storm , or the mad heaving of the waves , a fish without fins , a bird without wings , can but go where the wind wills . The lighthouse shows the end points out the spot where it is doomed to disappear throws light upon the burial . It is the torch of the sepulchre . To light up the inexorable chasm to warn against the inevitable what more tragic mockery ! /z/ THE wretched people in distress onboard the Matutina understood at once the mysterious derision which mocked ) their shipwreck . The appearance of the lighthouse raised their spirits at first , then overwhelmed them . Nothing could be done , nothing attempted . What has been said of kings , we may say of the waves we are their people , we are their prey . All that they rave must be borne . The nor ' - wester was driving the hooker on the Caskets . They were nearing them ; no evasion was possible . They drifted rapidly towards the reef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the lead , if they could have thrown it to any purpose , would not have shown more than three or four fathoms . The shipwrecked people heard the dull sound of the waves being sucked within the submarine caves of the steep rock . They made out , under the lighthouse , like a dark cutting between two Elates of granite , the narrow passage of the ugly wildoking little harbor , supposed to be full of the skeletons of men and carcasses of ships . It looked like the mouth of a cavern , rather than the entrance of a port . They could hear the crackling of the pile on high within the iron grating . A ghastly purple illuminated the storm , the collision of the rain and hail disturbed the mist . The black cloud and the red flame fought , serpent against serpent ; live ashes , reft by the wind , flew from the fire , and the sudden assaults of the sparks seemed to drive the snow-flakes before them . The breakers , blurred at first in outline , now stood out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crests , and vertebrae . The angles were formed by strongly-marked red lines , and the inclined planes in blood-like streams of light . As they neared it , the outline of the reefs increased and rose sinister . One of the women , the Irishwoman , told her bead* wildly . In place of the skipper , who was the pilot , remained the chief , who was the captain . The Basques all kno* BY ORDER OF THE Kim 107 the mountain and the sea . They are bold on the precipice , *nd inventive in catastrophes . They neared the cliff . They were about to strike . Suddenly they were so close to the great north rock of the Caskets , that it shut out the lighthouse from them . They saw nothing but the rock and the red light behind it . The huge rock looming in the mist , was like a gigantic black woman with a hood of fire . That ill-famed rock is called the Biblet . It faces the north side the reef , which on the south is faced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biblet , and shouted , " A man with a will to take a rope to the rock . Who san swim ? " No answer . No one on board knew how to swim , not even the sailors . An ignorance not uncommon among sea-faring people . A beam nearly free of its lashings was swinging loose . The chief clasped it with both hands , crying , " Help me . " They unlashed the beam . They had now at their disposal the very thing they wanted . From the defensive , Chey assumed the offensive . It was a longish beam of heart of oak , sound and strong , useful either as a support or as an engine of attack , a lever for a burden , a ram against a tower . " Ready ! " shouted the chief . All six getting foothold on the stump of the mast , threw their weight on the spar projecting over the side , straight as a lance towards a projection of the cliff . It was a dangerous manoeuvre . To strike at a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thrown into the water by the shock . There is variety in struggles with storms . After the hurricane , the shoal , after the wind , the rock . First the intangible , then the immovable , to be encountered . Some minutes passed , such minutes as whiten men 's hair . The rock and the vessel were about to come in collision . The rock , like a culprit , awaited the blow . A resistless wave rushed in ; it ended the respite . It caught the vessel underneath , raised it , and swayed it for an instant as the sling swings its projectile . /z/ " Steady ! " cried the chief , " it is only a rock , and we are men . " The beam was couched , the six men were one with it , its sharp bolts tore their arm-pits , but they did not feel them . The wave dashed the hooker against the rock . Then came the shock . It came under the shapeless cloud of foam which always hides such catastrophes . When this cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the rock , the six men were tossing about the deck , but the Matutina was floating alongside the rock , clear of it . The beam had stood and turned the vessel ; the sea was running so fast , that in a few seconds she had left the Caskets behind . Such things sometimes occur . It was a straight stroke of the bowsprit that saved Wood of Largo at the mouth of the Tay . In the wild neighborhood of Cape Winterton , and under the command of Captain Hamilton , it was the appliance of such a lever against the dangerous rock , Branodu-um that saved the Royal Mary from shipwreck , although she was but a Scotch-built frigate . The force of the waves can be so abruptly discomposed , that changes of direction can be easily managed , or at least are possible even in the most violent collisions . There is a brute in the tempest . The hurricane is a bull , and can be turned . The whole secret of avoiding shipwreck , is to try and pass from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the beam to the vessel . It had done the work of an oar , had taken the place of a rudder . But the manoeuvre once performed could not be repeated . The beam was overboard ; the shock of the collision had wrenched it out of the men 's hands , and it was lost in the waveSc To loosen another beam would have been to dislocate the hull . The hurricane carried off the Matutina . Presently the Caskets showed as a harmless encumbrance on the horizon . Nothing looks more out of countenance than a reef of rocks under such circumstances . There are in nature , in its obscure aspects , in which the visible blends with the invisible , certain motionless , surly profiles , which seem to express that a prey has escaped . /q/ Thus glowered the Caskets while the Matutina fled . The lighthouse paled in distance , faded , and disappeared . There was something mournful in its extinction . Layers of mist sank down upon the now uncertain light . Its rays died in the waste of waters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its form . It might have been a drowning creature . The brasier dwindled to the snuff of a candle ; then nothing more but a weak , uncertain flutter . Around it spread a circle of extravasated glimmer ; it was like the quenching of light in the pit of night . The bell which had threatened was dumb . The lighthouse which had threatened had melted away . And yet it was more awful now that they had ceased to threaten . One was a voice , the other a torch . There was something human about them . They were gone , and nought remained but the abyaa. /z/ AGAIN was the hooker running with the shadow into immeasurable darkness . The Matutina , escaped from the Caskets , sank and rose from billow to billow . A respite , but in chaos . Spun round by the wind , tossed by all the thousand motions of the wave , she reflected every mad oscillation of the sea . She scarcely pitched at all , a terrible symptom of a ship 's distress . Wrecks merely roll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone can turn a vessel to the wind . In storms , and more especially in the meteors of snow , sea and night end by melting into amalgamation , resolving into nothing but a smoke . Mists , whirlwinds , gales motion in all directions , no basis , no shelter , no stop . Constant recommencement , one gulf succeeding another . No horizon visible ; intense blackness for background , Th rough all these the hooker drifted . To have got free of the Caskets , to have eluded thff rock , was a victory for the shipwrecked men ; but it was a vi.otiory which left them in stupor . They had raised no /z/ cheer ; at sea such an imprudence is not repeated twicei To throw down a challenge where they could not cast the lead , would have been too serious a jest . The repulse of the rock was an impossibility achieved . They were petrified by it . By degrees , however , they began to hope again . Such are the insubmergable mirages of the soul ! There is no distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inexplicable sunrise of hope is seen in its depths . These poor wretches were ready to acknowledge to themselves that they were saved . It was on their lips . But suddenly something terrible appeared to them in the darkness . On the port bow arose , standing stark , cut out on the background of mist , a tall , opaque mass , vertical , rightangled , a tower of the abyss . They watched it openmouthed . The storm was driving them towards it . They lr new not what it was . It was the Ortach rock . /z/ THE reef reappeared . After the Caskets comes Ortach . The storm is no artist ; brutal and all-powerful , it never varies its appliances . The darkness is inexhaustible . Its snares and perfidies never come to an end . As for man , he soon comes to the bottom of his resources . Man expends his strength , the abyss never . The shipwrecked men turned towards the chief , their hope . He could only shrug his shoulders . Dismal contempt of helplessness . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ortach rock . The Ortach , all of a piece , rises up in a straight line to eighty feet above the angry beating* of the waves . Waves and ships break against it . An immovable cube , it plunges its rectilinear planes apeak into the numberless serpentine curves of the sea . At night it stands an enormous block resting on thy BY ORDER OF THE KING . Ill folds of a huge back sheet . In time of storm it awaits the stroke of the axe , which is the thunder-clap . But there is never a thunder-clap during the snowstorm . True , the ship has the bandage round her eyes ; darkness is knotted about her ; she is like one prepared to be led to the scaffold . As for the thunderbolt , which makes quick ending , it is not to be hoped for . The Matutina , nothing better than a log upon the waters , drifted towards this rock , as she had drifted towards the other . The poor wretches on board , who had for a moment believed themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left behind faced them again . The reef reappeared from the bottom of the sea . Nothing had been gained . The Caskets are a figuring iron * with a thousand compartments . The Ortach is a wall . To be wrecked on the Caskets is to be cut into ribbons ; to strike on the Ortach is to be crushed into powder . Nevertheless , there was one chance . On a straight frontage such as that of the- Ortach , neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet . The operation is simple ; first the flux , then the reflux ; a wave advances , a billow returns . In such cases the question of life and death is balanced thus ; if the wave carries the vessel on the rock , she breaks on it and is lost ; if the billow retires before the ship has touched , she is carried back , she is saved . It was a moment of great anxiety ; those on board saw through the gloom the great decisive wave bearing down on them . How far was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the ship , they were carried on the rock and dashed to pieces . If it passed under the ship . . . . The wave did pass under . They breathed again . But what of the recoil ? What would the surf do with them ? The surf carried them back . A few minute later the Matutina was free of the breakers . The Ortach faded from their view , as the Caskets had done . It was their second victory . For the second time the hooker had verged on destruction , and had drawn back in time . /z/ MEANWHILE a thickening mist had descended on th drifting wretches . They were ignorant of their whereabouts , they could scarcely see a cable 's length ar*und . Despite a furious storm , of hail which forced them to bend down their heads , the women had obstinately refused to go below again . No one , however hopeless , but wishes , if shipwreck be inevitable , to meet it in the open air . When so near death , a ceiling above one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were now in a short and chopping sea . A turgid sea indicates its constraint . Even in a fog the entrance into a strait may be known by the boiling-like appearance of the waves . And thus it was , for they were unconsciously coasting Aurigny . Between the west of Ortach and the Caskets and the east of Aurigny the sea is hemmed in and cramped , and the uneasy position determines locally the condition of storms . The sea suffers like others , and when it suffers it is irritable . That channel is a thing to fear . The Matutina was in it . Imagine under the sea a tortoise shell as big as Hyde Park or the Champs Elysees , of which every striature is a shallow , and every embossment a reef . Such is the western approach of Aurigny . The sea covers and conceals this shipwrecking apparatus . On this conglomeration of submarine breakers the cloven waves leap and foam in calm weather , a chopping sea ; in storms a chaos . The shipwrecked men observed this new complication without endeavoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A pale vista broadened in the zenith ; a wan tinge overspread the sea ; the livid light revealed on the port side a long shoal stretching eastward , towards which the power of the rushing wind was driving the vessel . The shoal was Aurigny . What was that shoal ? They shuddered . They would /q/ have shuddered even more hada voice answered them Aurigny . No isle so well defended against man 's approach as Aurigny . Below and above water it is protected by a savage guard , of which Ortach is the outpost . To the west , Burhou , Sauteriaux , Anfroque , Niangle , Fond du Croc , Les Jumelles , La Grosse , La Clanque , Les Eguillons , Le Vrac , La Fosse- Maliere ; to the east , Sauquet , Hommeau Floreau , La Brinebetais , La Queslingue , Croquelihou , La Fourche , Le Saut , Noire Pute , Coupie , Orbue . These are hydramonsters of the species reef . One of these reefs is called Le But , the goal , as if to imply that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by night and sea , appeared to the shipwrecked men in the shape of a single dark band , a sort of black blot on the horizon . Shipwreck is the ideal of helplessness ; to be near land , and unable to reach it ; to float , yet not to be able to do so in any desired direction ; to rest the foot on what seems firm and is fragile ; to be full of life , when o'ershadowed by death ; to be the prisoner of space ; to be walled in between sky and ocean ; to have the infinite overhead like a dungeon ; to be encompassed by the eluding elements of wind and waves ; and to be seized , bound , paralyzed ; such a load of misfortune stupefies and crushes us . We imagine that in it we catch a glimpse of the sneer of the opponent who is beyond our reach . That which holds you fast is that which releases the birds and sets the fishes free . It appears nothing , and is everything . We are dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dependent on the water which we catch in the hollow of our hands . Draw a glassful from the storm , and it is but a cup of bitterness a mouthful is nausea , a waveful is extermination . The grain of sand in the desert , the foam-flake on the sea , are fearful symptoms . Omnipotence takes no care to hide its atom , it changes weakness into strength , fills naught with all ; and it is with the infinitely little that the infinitely great crushes you . It is with its drops the ocean dissolves you . You feel you are a plaything . A plaything : ghastly epithet ! The Matutina was a little above Aurigny , which was not an unfavorable position ; but she was drifting toward // its northern point , which was fatal . As a bent bow discharges its arr w , the nor ' - wester was shooting 1 the vessel towards the northern cape . Off that point , a little beyond the harbor of Corbelets , is that which the seamen of the Norman archipelago call a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a furious kind of current . A wreath of funnels in the shallows produces in the waves a wreath of whirlpools . You escape one to fall into another . A ship caught hold of by the race , winds round and round until some sharp rock cleaves her hull ; then the shattered vessel stops , her stern rises from the waves , the stem completes the revolution in the abyss , the stern sinks in , and all is sucked down . A circle of foam broadens and floats , and nothing more is seen on the surface of the waves but a few bubbles here and there rising from the smothered breathings below . The three most dangerous races in the whole Channel are , one close to the well-known Girdler Sands , one at Jersey between the Pignonnet and the Point of Noirmont , and the race of Aurigny . Had a local pilot been on board the Matutina he could have warned them of their fresh peril . In place of a pilot , they had their instinct . In situations of extreme danger men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying along the coast in the frenzied rain of the wind . It was the spitting of the race . Many a bark has been swamped in that snare . Without knowing what awaited them , they approached the spot with horror . How to double that cape ? There were no means of doing it . Just as they had seen , first the Caskets , then Ortach , rise before them , they now saw the point of Aurigny , all of steep rock . It was like a number of giants , rising up one after another a series of frightful duels . Charybdis and Scylla are but two ; the Caskets , Ortach , and Aurigny are three . The phenomenon of the horizon being invaded by the rocks , was thus repeated with the grand monotony of the abyss . The battles of the ocean have the same sublime tautology as the combats of Homer . Each wave , as they neared it , added twenty cubits to the cape , awfully magnified by the mist ; the fast decreasing distance seemed more inevitable they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold which seized them would drag them in another wave surmounted , and all would be over . Suddenly the hooker was driven back , as by the blow of a Titan 's fist . The wave reared up under the vessel and fell back , throwing the waif back in its mane of foam . The Matutina , thus impelled , drifted away from Aurigny . She was again on the open sea . Whence had come the succor ? From the wind . The breath of the storm had changed its direction . The wave had played with them , now it was the wind 's turn . They had saved themselves from the Caskets . Off Ortach it was the wave which had been their friend . Now it was the wind . The wind had suddenly veered from north to south . The sou ' - wester had succeeded the nor ' - wester . The current is the wind in the waters ; the wind is the current in the air . These two forces had just counteracted each other , and it had been the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sudden fantasies of ocean are uncertain . They lire , perhaps , an embodiment of the perpetual ; when at f ; heir mercy man must neither hope nor despair . They do , and they undo . The ocean amuses itself . Every shade of wild , untamed ferocity is phased in the vastness of that cunning sea , which Jean Bart used to call the " great brute . " To its claws and their gashings succeed soft intervals of velvet paws . Sometimes the storm hurries on a wreck , at others it works out the problem with care ; it might almost be said that it caresses it . The sea can afford to take its time , as men in their agonies find out . We must own that occasionally these lulls of the torture announce deliverance . Such cases are rare . However this may be , men in extreme peril are quick to believe in rescue ; the slightest pause in the storm 's threats is sufficient ; they tell themselves that they are out of danger . After believing themselves buried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not yet possess ; it is clear that the bad luck has turned ; they declare themselves satisfied ; they are saved ; they cry quits with God . They should not be in so great a hurry : to give receipts to the Unknown . /z/ The sou ' - wester set in with a whirlwind . Shipwrecked men have never any but rough helpers . The Matutina was dragged rapidly out to sea by the remnant of her rigging like a dead woman trailed by the hair . It was like the enfranchisement granted by Tiberius , at the price of violation . The wind treated with brutality those whom it saved ; it rendered service with fury ; it was help without pity . The wreck was breaking up under the severity of its deliveries . Hailstones , big and hard enough to charge a blunderbuss , smote the vessel ; at every rotation of the waves these hailstones rolled about the deck like marbles . The hooker , whose deck was almost flush with the water , was being beaten out of shape by the rolling masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it each man was for himself . They clung on as best they could . As each sea swept over them , it was with a sense of surprise they saw that all were still there . Several had their faces torn by splinters . Happily despair has stout hands . In terror a child 's hand has the grasp of a giant . Agony makes a vice of a woman 's fingers . A girl in a fright can almost bury her rose-colored fingers in a piece of iron . With hooked fingers they hung on somehow , as the waves dashed on and passed off them ; but every wave brought them the fear of being swept away . Suddenly they were relieved . /z/ THE hurricane had just stopped short . There was no longer in the air sou ' - wester or nor ' - wester . The fierce clarions of space were mute . The whole of the waterspout had poured from the sky without any warning of diminution , as if it had slided perpendicularly into a gulf beneath . None knew what had become of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall slowly . No more swell : the sea flattened down . /z/ Such sudden cessations are peculiar to snow-storms . The electric effluvium exhausted , all becomes still , even the wave , which in ordinary storms often remains agitated for a long time . In snow-storms it is not so . No prolonged anger in the deep . Like a tired-out worker it becomes drowsy directly , thus almost giving the lie tff the laws of statics , but not astonishing old seamen , who know that the sea is full of unforeseen surprises . The same phenomenon takes place , although very rarely , in ordinary storms . Thus , in our time , on the occasion of the memorable hurricane of July 27th , 1867 , at Jersey the wind , after fourteen hours ' fury , suddenly relapsed into a dead calm . In a few minutes the hooker was floating in sleeping waters . At the same time ( for the last phase of these storms resembles the first ) they could distinguish nothing ; all that had been made visible in the convulsions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fused in vague mist , and the gloom of infinite space closed about the vessel . The wall of night that circular occlusion , that interior of a cylinder the diameter of which was lessening minute by minute enveloped the Matutina , and , with the sinister deliberation of an encroaching iceberg , was drawing in dangerously . In the zenith nothing a lid of fog closing down . It was as if the hooker were at the bottom of the well of the abyss . In that well the sea was a puddle of liquid lead . No stir in the waters ominous immobility ! The ocean is never less tamed than when it is still as a pool . All was silence , stillness , blindness . Perchance the silence of inanimate objects is taciturnity . The last ripples glided along the hull . The deck was horizontal , with an insensible slope to the sides . Some broken planks were shifting about irresolutely . The block on which they had lighted the tow steeped in tar , in place of the signal light which had been swept away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer let fall burning drops into the sea . What little breeze remained in the clouds was noiseless . The snow fell thickly , softly , with scarce a slant . No foam of breakers could be heard . The peace of shadows was over all . This repose succeeding all the past exasperations and . i8 BY ORDER OF THE KING . paroxysms was , for the poor creatures so long tossed about , an unspeakable comfort . It was as though the punishment of the rack had ceased . They caught a glimpse about them and above them of something which seemed like a consent that they should be saved . They regained confidence . All that had been fury was now tranquillity . It appeared to them a pledge of peace . Their wretched hearts dilated . They were able to let go the end of rope or beam to which they had clung , to rise , hold themselves up , stand , walk , move about . They felt inexpressibly calmed . There are in the depths of darkness such phases of paradise , preparations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of tho storm , out of the foam , out of the wind , out of the uproar . Henceforth all the chances were in their favor In three or four hours it would be sunrise . They would be seen by some passing ship ; they would be rescued , The worst was over , they were re-entering life . The im portant feat was to have been able to keep afloat until the cessation of the tempest . They said to themselves , " It is all over this time . " Suddenly they found that all was indeed over . One of the sailors , the northern Basque , Galdeazun by name , went down into the hold to look for a rope , then came above again and said , " The hold is full . " " Of what ? " asked the chief . " Of water , " answered the sailor . The chief cried out , " What does that mean ? " " It means , " replied Galdeazun , " that in half an hour we shall founder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leak had been sprung . When it happened no one could have said . Was it when they touched the Caskets ? Was it off Ortach ? Was it when they were whirled about the shallows /q/ west of Aurigny ? It was most probable that they had touched some rock there . They had struck against some hidden buttress which they had not felt in the midst of the convulsive fury of the wind which was tossing them . In tetanus who would feel a prick ? The other sailor , the southern Basque , whose namt was Ave Maria , went down into the hold , too , came on deck again , and said , " There are two varas of water in the hold . " About six feet . Ave Maria added , " In less than forty minutes we shall sink . " Where was the leak ? They could n't find it . It was hidden by the water which was filling up the hold . The vessel had a hole in her hull somewhere under the waterline , quite forward in the keel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had a wound which they could not staunch . The water , however , was not rising very fast . The chief called out , " We must work the pump . " Galdeazun replied , " We have no pump left . " " Then , " said the chief , " we must make for land . " " Where is the land ? " " I do n't know . " " Nor I. " " But it must be somewhere . ' * " True enough . " " Let some one steer for it . " " We have no pilot . " " Stand to the tiller yourself . " " We have lost the tiller . " " Let 's rig one out of the first beam we can lay hand on . Nails a hammer quick some tools . " " The carpenter 's box is overboard ; we have no tools. * " We 'll steer all the same ; no matter where . " The rudder is lost . " " Where is the boat ? We 'll get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 'll row the wreck . " " We have lost the oars . " We 'll sail . " w We have lost the Rails , and the mast . " /z/ " We 'll rig one up with a pole and a tarpaulin for sail Let 's get clear of this and trust in the wind . " " There is no wind . " The wind , indeed , had left them , the storm had fled , and its departure , which they had believed to mean safety , meant , in fact , destruction . Had the sou ' - wester continued it might have driven them wildly on some shore , might have beaten the leak in speed might , perhaps , have carried them to some propitious sandbank and cast them on it before the hooker foundered . The swiftness of the storm , bearing them away , might have enabled them to reach land ; but no more wind , no more hope . They were going to die because the hurricane was over . The end was near ! Wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combatants that may be overcome ; the storm can be taken in the weak point of its armor ; there are resources against the violence which continually lays itself open , is off its guard , and often hits wide . But nothing is to be done against a calm ; it offers nothing to the grasp , of which you can lay hold . The winds are a charge of Cossacks ; stand your ground and they disperse . Calms are the pincers of the executioner . The water , deliberate and sure , irrepressible and heavy , rose in the hold , and as it rose , the vessel sank it was happening slowly . Those on board the wreck of the Matutina felt that most hopeless of catastrophes an inert catastrophe undermining them= The still and sinister certainty of their fate petrified them . Ko stir in the air , no movement on the sea . The motionless is the inexorable Absorption was sucking them down silently . Through the depths of the dumb waters- without anger , without passion , not willing , not knowing , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downwards . Horror in repose amalgamating them with itslt . It was no longer the wide open mouth of the sea , the double juw of the wind and the wave , vicious in its threat , the grin of the waterspout , the fouming appetite of the breakers it was as if the wretched beings had under them the black yawn of . the infinite . /q/ They felt themselves sinking into Death 's peaceful depths . The height between the vessel and the water was lessening that was all . They could calculate her disappearance to the moment . It was the exact reverse of submersion by the rising tide . The water was not rising towards them , they were sinking towards it . They were digging their own grave . Their own weight was their sexton . They were being executed , not by the law of man , but by the law of things . The snow was falling , and as the wreck was now motionless , this white lint made a cloth over the deck and covered the vessel as with a winding-sheet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting at the leak . They struck a light and fixed three or tour torches in holes as best they could . Galdeazun brought some old leathern buckets , and they tried to bale the hold out , standing in a row to pass them from hand to hand , but the buckets were past use , the leather of some was unstitched , there were holes in the bottoms of the others , and the buckets emptied themselves on the way . The difference in quantity between the water which was making its way in and that which they returned to the sea was ludicrous for a ton that entered a glassful was baled out ; they did not improve their condition . It was like the expenditure of a miser , trying to exhaust a million , half - penny by half-penny . The chief said , " Let us lighten the wreck . " During the storm , they had lashed together the few chests which were on deck . These remained tied to the stump of the mast . They undid the lashings and rolled , ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these trunks belonged to the Basque woman , who could not repress a sigh . " Oh , my new cloak lined with scarlet I Oh , my poor stockings of birchen-bark lace ! Oh , my silver ear-rings to wear at mass on May - day ! " The deck cleared , there remained the cabin to be seen to . It was greatly encumbered ; in it were , as maybe remembered , the luggage belonging to the passengers , and the bales belonging to the sailors . They took the luggage , and threw it over the gunwale . They carried up the bales aud cast them into the sea . /z/ Thus they emptied the cabin . The lanthorn , the cap , the barrels , the sacks , the bales , and the water-butts , the pot of soup , all went over into the waves . They unscrewed the nuts of the iron stove , long since extinguished : they pulled it out , hoisted it on deck , dragged it to the side , and threw it out of the vessel . They cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shrouds , and torn rigging . From time to time the chief took a torch , and throwing its light on the figures painted on the prow to show the draft of water , looked to see how deep the wreck had settled down . /z/ THE wreck being lightened , was sinking more slowly , but none the less surely . The hopelessness of their situation was without resource without mitigation ; they had exhausted their last expedient . " Is there anything else we can throw overboard ? " The doctor , whom every one had forgotten , rose from the companion , and said , " Yes . " " What ? " asked the chief . The doctor answered , " Our Crime . " They shuddered , and all cried out , " Amen . " The doctor standing up , pale , raised his hand to heaven , saying , " Kneel down . " They wavered to waver is the preface to kneeling down . The doctor went on , " Let us throw our crimes into the sea , they weigh ua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us think no more of safety let us think of salvation . Our last crime , above all , the crime which we committed , or rather completed , just now ; oh , wretched beings who are listening to me , it is that which is overwhelming us . For thoga /q/ who leave intended murder behind them , it is an impious insolence to tempt the abyss . He who sins against a child , sins against God . True , we were obliged to put to sea , but it was certain perdition . The storm , warned by the shadow of our crime , came on . It is well . Regret nothing , however . There , not far off in the darkness , are the sands of Vauville and Cape La Hogue . It is France . There was but one possible shelter for us , which was Spain . France is no less dangerous to us than England . Our deliverance from the sea would have led but to the gibbet . Hanged or drowned we had no alternative . God has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has vouchsafed us the grave which cleanses . Brethren , the inevitable hand is in it . Remember that it was we who just now did our best to send on high that child , and that at this very moment , now as I speak , there is perhaps , above our heads , a soul accusing us before a Judge whose eye is on us . Let us make the best use of this last respite ; let us make an effort , if we still may , to repair , as far as we are able , the evil that we have wrought . If the child survives us , let us come to his aid ; if he is dead , let us seek his forgiveness . Let us cast our crime from us . Let us ease our consciences of its weight . Let us strive that our souls be not swallowed up before God , for that is the awful shipwreck . Bodies go to the fishes , souls to the devils . Have pity on yourselves . Kneel down , I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nave lost your compass ! You are wrong ! You still have prayer . " The wolves became lambs such transformations occur In last agonies ; tigers lick the crucifix ; when the dark portal opens ajar , belief is difficult , unbelief impossible . However imperfect may be the different sketches of religion essayed by man , even when his belief is shapeless , even when the outline of the dogma is not in harmony with the lineaments of the eternity he foresees , there comes in his last hour a trembling of the soul . There is something which will begin when life is over ; this thought impresses the last pang . A man 's dying agony is the expiration of a term . In that fatal second he feels weighing on him a diffused , responsibility . That which has been complicates that which is to be . The past returns and enters into the /z/ future . What is known becomes as much an abyss as the unknown . And the two chasms , the one which is full by his faults , the other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion of the two gulfs which terrifies the dying man . They had spent their last grain of hope on the direction of life ; hence they turned in the other . Their only remaining chance was in its dark shadow . They understood it . It came on them as a lugubrious flash , followed by a relapse of horror . That which is intelligible to the dying man is as what is perceived in the lightning . Everything , then nothing ; you see , then all is blindness . After death the eye will re-open , and that which was a flash will become a sun . They cried out to the doctor , " Thou , thou , there is no one but thee . We will obey thee , what must we do ? speak . " The doctor answered , " The question is how to pass over the unknown precipice , and reach the other bank of life , which is beyond the tomb . Being the one who knows the most , my danger is greater than yours . You do well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the heaviest . " He added , " Knowledge is a weight added to conscience . " He continued , " How much time have we still ? " Galdeazun looked at the water-mark , and answered , " A little more than a quarter of an hour . " " Good , " said the doctor . The low hood of the companion on which he leant his elbows made a sort of table ; the doctor took from his pocket his inkhorn and pen , and his pocket-book out of which he drew a parchment , the same one on the back of which he had written , a few hours before , some twenty cramped and crooked lines . " A light , " he said . The snow , falling like the spray of a cataract , had extinguished the torches one after another ; there was but one left . Ave Maria took it out of the place where it had been stuck , and holding it in his hand , came and stood by the doctor 's side . The doctor replaced his pocket-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1*26 down pen and inkhorn on the hood of the companion , unfolded the parchment , and said , " Listen . " Then in the midst of the sea , on the failing bridge ( a sort of shuddering flooring of the tomb ) , the doctor began a solemn reading , to which all the shadows seemed to listen . The doomed men bowed their heads around him . The flaming of the torch intensified their pallor . What the doctor read was written in English . Now and then , when one of those woe-begone looks seemed to ask an explanation , the doctor would stop , to repeat whether in French , or Spanish , Basque , or Italian the passage he had just read . Stifled sobs and hollow beatings of the breast were heard . The wreck was sinking more and more . The reading over , the doctor placed the parchment flat on the companion , seized his pen , and on a clear margin which he had carefully left at the bottom of what he had written , he signed himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , he said , " Come , and sign . " The Basque woman approached , took the pen , and signed herself , ASUNCION . She handed the pen to the Irish woman , who , not knowing how to write , made a cross . The doctor , by the side of this cross , wrote , BARBARA FEKMOY , of Tyrrif Island , in the Hebrides . Then he handed the pen to the chief of the band . The chief signed GAIZDORRA : Captal . The Genoese signed himself under the chiefs name , GlANGJRATE . The Languedocian signed , JACQUES QUARTOURZE : alias , the Narbonnais . The Proveii9al signed , Luc- PIERRE CAPGAROUPE , of the Galleys of Mahon . Under these signatures the doctor added a note : " Of the crew of three men , the skipper having been washed overboard by a sea , but two remain , and they have signed . " The two sailors affixed their names underneath the note . The northern Basque signed himself , GALDEAZUN . The southern Basque signed , AVE MABIA : Robber. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here , " said the Provenyal . " Have you Hardquanonne 's flask ? " 44 Yes . " " Give it me . " Capgaroupe drank off the last mouthful of brandy , and handed the flask to the doctor . The water was rising in the hold ; the wreck was sinking deeper and deeper into the sea . The sloping edges of the ship were covered by a thin gnawing wave , which was rising . All were crowded on the centre of the deck . The doctor dried the ink on the signatures by the heat of the torch , and folding the parchment into a narrower compass than the diameter of the neck , put it into the flask . He called for the cork . " I do n't know where it is , " said Capgaroupe . " Here is a piece of rope , " said Jacques Quartourze . The doctor corked the flask with a bit of rope , and asked for some tar . Galdeazun went forward , extinguished the signal light with a piece of tow , took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought it , half full of burnir g tar , to the doctor . The flask holding the parchment which they had all signed , was corked and tarred over . " It is done , " said the doctor . And from out all their mouths , vaguely stammered in every language , came the dismal utterances of the catacombs . " Ainsisoit-il ! " " Meaculpa ! " " Asisea ! " " Arorai ! " " Amen ! " It was as though the sombre voices of Babel were scattered through the shadows as Heaven uttered its awful refusal to hear them . The doctor turned away from his companions in crime and distress , and took a few steps towards the gun wait . Reaching the side , he looked into space , and said , in a deep voice , " Bifltdubeimir ? " * * Art tbou near me f /q/ Perchance he was addressing some phantom . The wreck was sinking . Behind the doctor all the others were in a dream . Frayer mastered them by main force . They did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their 3ontrition ; they wavered as a sail flaps when the breeze fails . And the haggard group took by degrees , with clasping of hands and prostration of foreheads , attitudes various , yet of humiliation . Some strange reflection of the deep seemed to soften their villainous features . The doctor returned towards them . Whatever had been his past , the old man was great in the presence of the catastrophe . The deep reserve of nature which enveloped him preoccupied without disconcerting him . He was not one to be taken unawares . Over him was the calm of a silent horror : on his countenance the majesty of God ' s will comprehended . This old and thoughtful outlaw unconsciously assumed ( he air of a pontiff . He said , " Attend to me . " He contemplated for a moment the waste of water , and added , " Now we are going to die . " Then he took the torch from the hands of Ave Maria , and waved it . A spark broke from it and flew into the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The torch was extinguished : all light disappeared . Nothing left but the huge , unfathomable shadow . It was ike the filling up of the grave , In the darkness , the doctor was heard saying , " Let us pray . " All knelt down . It was no longer on the snow , but in the water , that they knelt . They had but a few minutes more . The doctor alone remained standing . The flakes of snow falling on him had sprinkled him with white tears , and made him visible on the background of darkness . He might have been the speaking fttatue of the shadow . /z/ The doctor made the sign of the cross and raised his voice , while beneath his feet he felt that almost imperceptible oscillation which prefaces the moment in which a wreck is about to founder . He said , " Pater noster qui es in ccelis . " The Proven pal repeated in French , " Notre Pere 6qui tes aux cieux . " The Irishwoman repeated in Gaelic , understood by the Basque woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor continued , " Sanctificetur nomen tuum . " " Que votre nom soit sanctifie " , " said the Proven9al . " Naomhthar hainm , " said the Irishwoman . " Adveniat regnum tuum , " continued the doctor . " Que votre regne arrive , " said the Provenyal . " Tigeadh do rioghachd , " said the Irishwoman . As they knelt , the waters had risen to their shoulders , The doctor went on , " Fiat voluntas tua . " " Que votre volonte soit faite , " stammered the Proven yal . And the Irishwoman and Basque woman cried , " Deuntar do thoil ar an Hhalamb . " " Sicut in ccelo , sicut in terra , " said the doctor . No voice answered him . He looked down . All their heads were under water . They had let themselves be drowned on their knees . The doctor took in his right hand the flask which he had placed on the companion , and raised it above his head . The wreck was going down . As he sank , the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders were above water , then his head , then nothing remained but his arm holding up the flask , as if he were showing it to the Infinite . His arm disappeared ; there was no greater fold on the deep sea than there would have been on a tun of oil . The snow continued falling . One thing floated , and was carried by the waves into the darkness . It was tha tarred flask , kept afloat by ita osier cover . /q/ /z/ THB storm was no less severe on land than on sea , The same wild enfranchisement of the elements had taken place around the abandoned child . The weak and innocent become their sport in the expenditure of the unreasoning rage of their blind forces . Shadows discern not , and things inanimate have not the clemency they are supposed to possess . On the land there was but little wind . There was an inexplicable dumbness in the cold . There was no hail . The thickness of the falling snow was fearful . Hailstones strike , harass , bruise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexorable , the snow-flake does its work in silence , touch it , and it melts . It is pure , even even as the hypocrite is candid . It is by white particles slowly heaped upon each other that the flake becomes an avalanche and the knave a criminal . The child continued to advance into the mist . The fog presents but a soft obstacle ; hence its danger . It yields , and yet persists . Mist , like snow , is full of treachery . The child , strange wrestler at war with all these risks , had succeeded in reaching the bottom of the descent , and had gained Chesil . Without knowing it he was on an isthmus , with the ocean on each side ; so that he could not lose his way in the fog , in the snow , or in the darkness , without falling into the deep waters of the gulf on the right hand , or into the raging billows of the high sea on the left . He was travelling on , in ignorance , between these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singularly sharp and rugged . Nothing remains at this date of its past configuration . Since the idea of manufacturing Portland stone into Roman cement was first seized , the whole rock has been subjected to an alteration which has completely changed its original appearance . Calcareous lias , slate , and trap , are still to be found there , rising from layers of conglomerate , like teeth from a gum ; but the pickaxe has broken up and levelled those bristling , rugged peaks which were once the fearful perches of the ossif rage . The summits exist no longer where the labbes and the skua gulls used to flock together , soaring , like the envious , to sully high places . In vain might you seek the tall monolitl i called Godolphin , an old British word , signifying " whito* eagle . " In summer you may still gather on those surfaces , pierced and perforated like a sponge , rosemary , pennyroyal , wild hyssop , and sea-fennel which when infused makes a good cordial , and that herb full of knots , which grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you no longer find gray amber , or black tin , or that triple species of slate one sort green , one blue , and the third the color of sage-leaves . The foxes , the badgers , the otters , and the martens have taken themselves off ; on the cliffs of Portland , as well as at the extremity of Cornwall , where there were at one time chamois , none remain . They still fish in some inlets for plaice and pilchards ; but the scared salmon no longer ascend the Wey , between Michaelmas and Christmas , to spawn . No more are seen there , as during the reign of Elizabeth , those old unknown birds as large as hawks , who could cut an apple in two , but ate only the pips . You never meet those crows with yellow beaks , called Cornish choughs in English , pyrrocorax in Latin , who , in their mischief , would drop burning twigs on thatched roofs. - Nor that magic bird , the fulmar , a wanderer from th' Scottish archipelago , dropping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their lamps . Nor do you ever find in the evening , in the plash of the ebbing tide , , that ancient , legendary neitse , with the feet of a hog and the bleat of a calf . The tide no longer throws up th ' whiskered seal , with its curled ears and sharp jaws , dragging itself along on its nailless paws . On that Portland nowadays so changed as scarcely to ty /q/ recognized the absence of forests precluded nightingales ; but now the falcon , the swan , and the wild goose have fled . The sheep of Portland , nowadays , are fat and have fine wool ; the few scattered ewes which nfbbled the salt grass there two centuries ago , were small and tough and coarse in the fleece , as became Celtic flocks brought there by garlic-eating shepherds , who lived to a hundred , and who , at the distance of half a mile , could pierce a cuirass with their yard-long arrows . Uncultivated land makes coarse wool . The Chesil of to-day resembles in no particular the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed by man and by those furious winds which gnaw the very stones . At present this tongue of land bears a railway , terrainating in a pretty square of houses , called Chesilton , and there is a Portland station . Railway carriages roll where seals used to crawl . The Isthmus of Portland two hundred years ago was a back of sand , with a vertebral spine of rock . The child 's danger changed its form . What he had had to fear in the descent was falling to the bottom of the precipice ; in the isthmus , it was falling into the holes . After dealing with the precipice , he must deal with the pitfalls . Everything on the sea-shore is a trap the rock is slippery , the strand is quicksand . Resting-places are but snares . It is walking on ice which may suddenly crack and yawn with a fissure , through which you disappear . The ocean has false stages below , like a wellarranged theatre . The long backbone of granite , from which fall away both slopes of the isthmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find there what , in scene- shifters ' language , are termed practicables . Man has no hospitality to hope for from the ocean ; from the rock no more than from the wave . The sea is provident for the bird and the fish alone . Isthmuses are especially naked and rugged ; the wave , which wears and mines them on either side , reduces them to the simplest form . Everywhere there were sharp relief ridges , cuttings , frightful fragments of torn stone , yawning with many points , like the jaws of a shark ; breaknecks of wet moss , rapid slopes of rock ending in bhe sea . Whosoever undertakes to pass over an isthmus ; . ; ; it every step misshapen blocks , as large as houses , /z/ in the forms of shin-bones , shoulder-blades , and thighbones , the hideous anatomy of dismembered rocks . It is not without reason that these striae of the sea-shore are called cotes* The wayfarer must get out as he best can from the confusion of these ruins . It is like journeying over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this labor of Hercules . Broad daylight might have aided him . It was night A guide was necessary . He wau alone . All the vigor of manhood would not have been too much . He had but the feeble strength of a child . In default of a guide , a footpath might have aided him ; there was none . By instinct he avoided the sharp ridge of the rocks , and kept to the strand as much as possible . It was there that he met with the pitfalls . They were multiplied before him under three forms : the pitfall of water , the pitfall of snow , and the pitfall of sand . This last is the most dangerous of all , because the most illusory . To know the peril we face is alarming ; to be ignorant of it , is terrible . The child was fighting against unknown dangers . He was groping his way through something which might , perhaps , be the grave . ' He did not hesitate . He went round the rocks , avoided the crevices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by such obstacles ; yet he went on . Though unable to advance in a straight line , he walked with a firm step . When necessary , he drew back with energy . He knew how to tear himself in time from the horrid bird-lime of the quicksands . He shook the snow from about him . He entered the water more than once up to the knees . Directly that he left it , his wet knees were frozen by the intense cold of the night . He walked rapidly in his stiffened garments ; yet he took care to keep his sailor 's coat dry and warm on his chest . He was still tormented by hunger . The chances of the abyss are illimitable . Every thing is possible in it , even salvation . The issue may be found , though it be invisible . How the child , wrapped in a smotnering winding-sheet of snow , lost on a narrow elevation between two jaws of an abyss , managed to cross * Cdtes , coasts , costa , ribs . /q/ the isthmus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped , climbed , rolled , searched , walked , persevered , that is all . Such is the secret of all triumphs . At the end of somewhat less than half-an-hour he felt that the ground was rising . He had reached the other shore . Leaving Chesil , he had gained terra flrma . , The bridge which now unites Sandford Castle with Smallmouth Sands did not then exist . It is probable that in his intelligent groping he had re-ascended as far as Wyke Regis , where there was then a tongue of sand , a natural road crossing East Fleet . He was saved from the isthmus ; but he found himself again face to face with the tempest , with the cold , with the night . Before him unce more lay the plain , shapeless in the density of impenetrable shadow . He examined the ground , seeking a footpath . Suddenly he bent down . He had discovered , in the snow , something which seemed to him a track . It was indeed a track the print of a foot . The print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which rendered it distinctly visible . He examined it . It was a naked foot ; too small for that of a man , too large for that of a child . It was probably the foot of a woman . Beyond that mark was another , then another , then another . The footprints followed each other at the distance of a step , and struck across the plain to the right . They were still fresh , and slightly covered with little snow . A woman had just passed that way . This woman was walking in the direction in which the child had seen the smoke . With his eyes fixed on the footprints , he set himself to follow them . /z/ HE journeyed some time along this course . Unfortunately the footprints were becoming less and less distinct . Dense and fearful was the falling of the snow . It was the /z/ time when the hooker was so distressed by the snowstorm at sea . The child , in distress like the vessel , but after another fashion , had , in the inextricable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource but the footstept in the snow , an.d he held to it as the thread of the labyrinth . Suddenly , whether the snow had filled them up or for some other reason , the footsteps ceased . All became even , level , smooth , without a stain , without a detail . There was now nothing but a white cloth drawn over the earth and a black one over the sky . It seemed as if the footpassenger had flown away . The child , in despair , bent down and searched ; but in vain . As he arose he had a sensation of hearing some indistinct sound , but he could not be sure of it . It resembled a voice , a breath , a shadow . It was more human thaw animal ; more sepulchral than living . It was a souncl but the sound of a dream . He looked , but saw nothing . Solitude , wide , naked and livid , was before him . Hfi listened . That which he had thought he heard had fade* 1 away . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silent . There was illusion in the mist . He went on his way again . He walked forward at random , with nothing thenceforth to guide him . . As he moved away the noise began again . This time he could doubt it no longer . It was a groan , almost a sob . He turned . He searched the darkness of space with his eyes . He saw nothing . The sound arose once more . K limbo could cry out , it would cry in such a tone . Nothing so penetrating , so piercing , so feeble as the voice for it was a voice . It arose from a soul . There was palpitation in the murmur . Nevertheless , it seemed uttered almost unconsciously . It was an appeal of suffering , not knowing that it suffered or that it appealed . The cry , perhaps a first breath , perhaps a last sigh , was equally distant from the rattle which closes life and the wail with which it commences . It breathed , it was stifled , it wept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child fixed his attention every . /q/ where , far , near , on high , below . There was no one . There was nothing . He listened . The voice arose again . He perceived it distinctly . The sound somewhat resembled the bleating of a lamb . Then he was frightened , and thought of flight . The groan again . This was the fourth time . It was Mtrangely miserable and plaintive . One felt that after t hat last effort , more mechanical than voluntary , the cry would probably be extinguished . It was an expiring ex ( daination , instinctively appealing to the amount of aid held in suspense in space . It was some muttering of agony , addressed to a possible Providence . The child approached in the direction from whence the iiound came . Still he saw nothing . He advanced again , watchfully . The complaint continued . Inarticulate and confused KS it was , it had become clear almost vibrating . The child was near the voice ; but where was it ? He was close to a complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into space . A human moan floated away into the darkness . This was what he had met . Such at least was his impression , dim as the dense mist ; in which he was lost . Whilst he hesitated between an instinct which urged him to fly , and an instinct which commanded him to remain , he perceived in the snow at his feet , a few steps before him , a sort of undulation of the dimensions of a human body a little eminence , low , long , and narrow , like the mould over a grave a sepulchre in a white churchyard . At the same time the voice cried out . It was from beneath the undulation that it proceeded . The child bent down , crouching before the undulation , and with , both his hands began to clear it away . Beneath the snow which he removed a form grew under his hands ; and suddenly in the hollow he had made , there appeared a pale face . The cry had not proceeded from that face . Its eyes wtre shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It remained motionless ; it stirred not under the hands of the child . The child , whose fingers were numbed with frost , shuddered when he touched its coldness . It /z/ was that of a woman . Her dishevelled hair was mingled with the snow . The woman was dead . Again the child set himself to sweep away the snow . The neck of the dead woman appeared ; then her shoulders , clothed in rags . Suddenly he felt something move feebly under his touch . It was something small that was buried , and which stirred . The child swiftly cleared away the snow , discovering a wretched little body thin , wan with cold , still alive , lying naked on the dead woman 's naked breast . It was a little girl . It had been swaddled up , but in rags so scanty that in its struggles it had freed itself from its tatters . Under it , its attenuated limbs , and above it , its breath , had somewhat melted the snow . A nurse would have said that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a year , for growth , in poverty , suffers heart-breaking reductions which sometimes even produce rachitis . When its face was exposed to the air , it gave a cry , the continuation of its sobs of distress . For the mother not to have heard that sob , proved her irrevocably dead . The child took the infant in his arms . The stiffened body of the mother was a fearful sight ; a spectral light proceeded from her face . The mouth , apart and without breath , seemed to form in the indistinct language of shadows her answer to the questions put to the dead by the Invisible . The ghastly reflection of the icy plains was on that countenance . There was the youthful forehead under the brown hair , the almost indignant knitting of the eyebrows , the pinched nostrils , the closed eyelids , the lashes glued together by the rime , and from the corners of the eyes to the corners of the mouth , a deep channel of tears . The snow lighted up the corpse . Winter and the tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . The nakedness of her breasts was pathetic . They had fulfilled their purpose . On them was a sublime blight of the life infused into one being by another from whom life has fled , and maternal majesty , was there instead of virginal purity . At the point of one of the nipples was a white pearl . It was a drop of milk frozen . Let us explain at once . On the plains over which the ( ' " ' ' sorted boy was passing in his turn , a beggar woman , i : -. : ; : ; i ! her infant and searching for a refuge , had lost /q/ her way a few hours before . Benumbed with cold sho had sunk under the tempest , and could not rise again . The falling snow had covered her . So long as she was able she had clasped her little girl to her bosom , and thus died . The infant had tried to suck the marble breast . Blind trust , inspired by nature , for it seems that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her last sigh . ' But the lips of the infant had been unable to find the oreast , where the drop of milk , stolen by death , had frozen , whilst under the snow the child , more accustomed to the cradle than the tomb , had wailed . The deserted child had heard the cry of the dying child . He disinterred it . He took it in his arms . , When she felt herself in his arms she ceased crying . The faces of the two children touched each other , and the purple lips of the infant sought the cheek of the boy , as it had been a breast . The little girl had nearly reached the moment when the congealed blood stops the action of the heart . Her mother had touched her with the chill of her own death a corpse communicates death ; its numbness is infectious . Her feet , hands , arms , knees , seemed paralyzed by cold . The boy felt the terrible chill . He had on him a garment dry and warm his pilot jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpse , took off his jacket , wrapped the infant in it , took it up again in his arms , and now , almost naked , under the blast of the north wind which covered him with eddies of snowflakes , carrying the infant , he pursued his journey . The little one having succeeded in finding the boy 's cheek , again applied her lips to it , and , soothed by the warmth , she slept . First kiss of those two souls in the darkness . The mother lay there , her back to the snow , her face to the night ; but perhaps at the moment when the little boy stripped himself to clothe the little girl , the mother saw him from the depths of infinity . /z/ IT was little more than four hours since the hooker had ailed from the creek of Portland , leaving the boy on the shore . During the long hours since he had been deserted , and had been journeying onwards , he had met but three persons of that human society into which he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hill a woman the woman in the snow and the little girl whom he was carrying in his arms . He was exhausted by fatigue and hunger , yet advanced more resolutely than ever , with less strength and an added burden . He was now almost naked . The few ragfi which remained to him , hardened by the frost , were sharp as glass , and cut his skin . He became colder , but the in fant was warmer . That which he lost was not thrown away , but was gained by her . He found out that thn poor infant enjoyed the comfort which was to her tho renewal of life . He continued to advance . From time to time , still holding her securely , he benfc down , and taking a handful of snow he rubbed his feet with it , to prevent their being frost-bitten . At otheir times , his throat feeling as if it were on fire , he put a little snow in his mouth and sucked it ; this for a moment assuaged his thirst , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggravation . The storm had become shapeless from its violence . Deluges of snow are possible . This was one . The paroxysm scourged the shore at the same time that it uptore the depths of ocean . This was , perhaps , the moment when the distracted hooker was going to pieces in th battle of the breakers . He travelled under this north wind , still towards thi east , over wide surfaces of snow . He knew not how the hours had passed . For a long time he had ceased to s9 the smoke . Such indications are soon effaced in th night ; besides , it was past the hour when fires are put /q/ out . Or he had , perhaps , made a mistake , and it was possible that neither town nor village existed in the direction in which he was travelling . Doubting , he yet persevered . Two or three times the little infant cried . Then he adopted in his gait a rocking movement , and the child was soothed and silenced . She ended by falling into a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He frequently tightened the folds of the jacket round the babe 's neck , so that the frost should not get in through any opening , and that no melted snow should drop between the garment and the child . The plain was . unequal . In the declivities into which It sloped , the snow , driven by the wind into the dips of t he ground , was so deep , hi comparison with a child so jfmall , that it almost engulfed him , and he had to struggle through it , half buried . He walked on , working away the snow with his knees . Having cleared the ravine , he reached the high lands iwept by the winds , where the snow lay thin . Then he Ifound the surface a sheet of ice . The little g .. /1 's lukewarm breath , playing on his face , warmed it for a moment , then lingered , and froze in his hair , stiffening it into icicles . He felt the approach of another danger . He could not afford to fall . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise again . He was overcome by fatigue , and the weight of the darkness would , as with the dead woman , have held him to the ground , and the ice glued him alive to the earth . He had tripped upon the slopes of precipices , and had recovered himself : he had stumbled into holes , and had got out again . Thenceforward the slightest fall would be death ; a false step opened for him a tomb . He must uot slip . He had not strength to rise even to his knees . Now everything was slippery ; everywhere there was rime and frozen snow . The little creature whom he carried made his progress fearfully difficult . She was not only a burthen , which his weariness and exhaustion made excessive , but was also an embarrassment . She occupied both his arms : arid , to him who walks over ice , both arms are a natural and necessary balancing power . /z/ He was obliged to do without this balance . He did without it and advanced , bending under his burthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little infant was the drop causing the cup of distress to overflow . He advanced , reeling at every step , as if on a spring board , and accomplishing , without spectators , miracles of equilibrium . Let us repeat that he was , perhaps , followed on this path of pain by eyes unsleeping in the distances of the shadows the eyes of the mother and the eyes of God . He staggered , slipped , recovered himself , took care of the infant , and , gathering the jacket about her , he covered up her head ; staggered again , advanced slipped then drew himself up . The cowardly wind drove against him . Apparently , he made much more way than was necessary . He was , to all appearance , on the plains where Bincleaves Farm was afterwards established , between what are now called Spring Gardens and the Parsonage House . Homesteads and cottages occupy the place of waste lands . Sometimes les ? than a century separates a steppe from a city . Suddenly , a lull having occurred in the icy blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short distance in front of him , a cluster of gables and of chimneys shown in relief by the snow . The reverse of a silhouette a city painted in white on a black horizon , something like what we call nowadays a negative proof . Roofs dwellings shelter ! He had arrived somewhere at last . He felt the ineffable encouragement of hope . The watch of a ship which has wandered from her course , feels some such emotion when he cries , " Land ho ! " He hurried his steps . At length , then , he was near mankind . He would soon be amidst living creatures . There was no longer anything to fear . There glowed within him that sudden warmth security ; that out of which he was emerging was over ; thenceforward there would no longer be night , nor winter , nor tempest . It seemed to him that he had left all evil chances behind him . The infant was no longer a burthen . He almost ran . His eyes were fixed on the roofs . There was life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dead man might gaze thus on what might appear through the half-open lid of /q/ his sepulchre . There were the chimneys of which he had geen the smoke . No smoke arose from them now . He was not long before he reached the houses . He came to the outskirts of a town an open street . At that period bars to streets were falling into disuse . The street began by two houses . In those two houses neither candle nor lamp was to be seen ; nor in the whole street ; nor in the whole town , so far as eye could reach . The house to the right was a roof rather than a house nothing could be more mean . The walls were of mud , the roof was of straw , and there was more thatch than wall . A large nettle , springing from the bottom of the wall , reached the roof . The hovel had but one door , which was like that of a dog-kennel ; and a window , which was but a hole . All was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the house was also inhabited . The house on the left was large , high , built entirely of stone , with a slated roof . It was also closed . It was the rich man 's home , opposite to that of the pauper . The boy did riot hesitate . He approached the great mansion . The double folding-door of massive oak , studded with large nails , was of the kind that leads one to expect that behind it there is a stout armory of bolts and locks . An iron knocker was attached to it . He raised the knocker with some difficulty , for his benumbed hands were stumps rather than hands . He knocked once . No answer . He struck again ; and two knocks . No movement was heard in the house . He knocked a third time . There was no sound . He saw that they were all asleep , and did not care to get up . Then he turned to the hovel . He picked up a pebble from the snow , and knocked against the low door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiptoe , and knocked with his pebble against the pane too softly to break the glass , bnfc loud enough to be heard . No voice was hdard ; no step moved ; no candle WLS lighted . He saw that there , as well , they did not care to awake . /z/ The house of stone and the thatched hovel were equally deaf to the wretched . The boy decided on pushing on further , and penetrating the strait of houses which stretched away in front of him , so dark that it seemed more like a gulf between two cliff I than the entrance to a town . /z/ IT was Wey mouth which he had just entered . Wey. mouth then was not the respectable and fine WeymoutJ* of to-day . Ancient Weymouth did not present , like the piesenlone , an irreproachable rectangular quay , with an inn and a statue in honor of George III . This resulted from the fact that George III . had not yet been born . For ttoii same reason , they had not yet designed on the slope oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soift by cutting away the turf and leaving the bare chalk to the view , the white horse , an acre long , bearing the kin/ ; ' upon his back , and always turning , in honor of Georgia III. , his tail to the city . These honors , however , were deserved . George III. , having lost in his old age th' intellect he had never possessed in his youth , was no I responsible for the calamities of his reign . He was ail innocent . Why not erect statues to him ? Wey mouth , a hundred and eighty years ago , was aboui as symmetrical as a game of spillikins in confusion . In legends it is said that Astaroth travelled over thffe world , carrying on her back a wallet which contained everything , even good women in their houses . A pellmell of sheds thrown from her devil 's bag would give an idea of that irregular Weymouth the good women in this sheds included . The Music Hall remains as a specimen of those buildings ; a confusion of wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carve in another fashion ) - shapeless , overhanging buildings , some with pillars , leaning one against the other for support against the sea wind and leaving between them awkward spaces of narrow and winding channels , lanes , and passages , often flooded by /q/ the equinoctial tides . A heap of old grandmother houses , crowded round a grandfather church , such was Weymouth ; a sort of old Norman village thrown up on th coast of England . The traveller , who entered the tavern , now replaced by the hotel , instead of paying royally his twenty-five francs for a fried sole and a bottle of wine , had to suffer the humiliation of eating a pennyworth of soup made of fish , which soup , by the bye , was very good . Wretched fare ! The deserted child , carrying the foundling , passed through the first street , then the second , then the third . He raised his eyes , seeking in the higher stories and in the roofs a lighted window-pane , but all were closed and dark . At intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing makes the heart so like a stone as being warm between sheets . The noise and the shaking had at length awakened the infant . He knew this because lie felt her suck his cheek . She did not cry , believing him her mother . He was about to turn and wander long , perhaps , in the intersections of the Scrambridge lanes , where there were then more cultivated plots than dwellings , more thorn . hedges than houses ; but fortunately he struck into a passage which exists to this day near Trinity schools . This passage led him to a water-brink , where there was a roughly built quay with a parapet , and to the right he made out a bridge . It was the bridge over the Wey , connecting Weymouth with Melcombe Regis , and under the wches of which the Backwater joins the harbor . Weymouth , a hamlet , was then the suburb of Melcombe Regis , a city and port . Now Melcombe Regis is a parish of Weymouth . The village has absorbed the city . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suction , which inhale the population , and sometime** swell one river-bank at the expense of its opposite neighbor . The boy went to the bridge , which at that period was a covered timber structure . He crossed it . Thanks to its roofing , there was no snow 011 the planks . His bare feet had a moment 's com fort as they crossed them . Having passed over the bridge , he was in Melcombe Regis . There were fewer wooden houses than stone ones , there . JJe was no longer iu the village , he was in the city . /z/ The bridge opened on a rather fine street called St Thomas 's Street . He entered it . Here and there were high carved gables and shop-fronts . He set to knocking at the doors again : he had no strength left to call or shout . At Melcombe Regis , as at Weymouth , no one was stirring . The doors were all carefully double-locked . The windows were covered by their shutters , as the eyes by their lids . Every precaution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little wanderer was suffering the indefinable depression made by a sleeping town . Its silence , as of a paralyzed ants ' nest , makes the head swim . All its lethargies mingle their nightmares , its slumbers are a crowd , and from its human bodies lying prone , there arises a vapor of dreams . Sleep has gloomy associates beyond this life : the decomposed thoughts of the sleepers float above them in a mist which is both of death and of life , and combine with the Pos* sible , which has also , perhaps , the power of thought , as it floats in space . Hence arise entanglements . Dreams , those clouds , interpose their folds and their transparencies over that star , the mind . Above those closed eyelids , where vision has taken the place of sight , a sepulchral disintegration of outlines and appearances dilates itself into impalpability . Mysterious , diffused existences amalgamate themselves with life on that border of death , which sleep is . Those larvae and souls mingle in the air . Even he who sleeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister life . The surrounding chimera , in which he suspects a reality , impedes him . The waking man , wending his way amidst the sleep phantoms of others , unconsciously pushes back passing shadows , has , or imagines that he has , a vague fear of adverse contact with the invisible , and feels at every moment the obscure pressure of a hostile encounter which immediately dissolves . There is something of the effect of a forest in the nocturnal diffusion of dreams . This is what is called being afraid without reason . What a man feels , a child feels still more . The uneasiness of nocturnal fear , increased by the spectral houses , increased the weight of the sad burthen under which he was struggling . He entered Couycar Lane , and perceived at the end of /q/ that passage the Backwater , which he took for the ocean . He no longer knew in what direction the sea lay . He retraced his steps , struck to the left by Maiden Street , and returned as far as St. Alban 's Row . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! violently at any house that he happened to pass . His blows , on which he was expending his last energies , were jerky and without aim ; now ceasing altogether for a time , now renewed as if in irritation . It was the violence of his fever striking against the doors . One voice answered . That of Time . Three o'clock tolled slowly behind him from the old belfry of St. Nicholas . Then all sank into silence again . That no inhabitant should have opened the lattice may appear surprising . Nevertheless that silence is in a great measure to be explained . We must remember that in January , 1790 , they were just over a somewhat severe outbreak of the plague in London , and that the fear of receiving sick vagabonds caused a diminution of hospitality everywhere . People would not even open their windows for fear of inhaling the poison . The child felt the coldness of men more terribly than the coldness of night . The coldness of men is intentional . He felt a tightening on his sinking heart which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had entered into the midst of life , and remained alone . This was the summit of misery . The pitiless desert he had understood ; the unrelenting town was too much to bear . The hour , the strokes of which he had just counted , had been another blow . Nothing is so freezing in certain situations as the voice of the hour . It is a declaration of indifference . It is Eternity saying , " What does it matter to me ? " He stopped , and it is not certain that , in that miserable minute , he did not ask himself whether it would not be oasier to lie down there and die . However , the little infant leaned her head against his shoulder , and fell asleep again . This blind confidence set him onwards again . He whom ' ill supports were failing felt that he was himself a basia vt support . Irresistible summons of duty ! /z/ Neither such ideas nor such a situation belonged to his age . It is probable that he did not understand them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he chanced to do . He set out again in the direction of Johnstone Row . jBut now he no longer walked ; he dragged himself along , ' lie left St. Mary 's Street to the left , made zigzags through lanes , and at the end of a winding passage found himself in a rather wide , open space . It v as a piece of waste land not built upon ; probably the spot where Chesterfield Place now stands . The houses ended there . He perceived the sea to the right , and scarcely anything more of the town to his left . What was to become of him ? Here was the country again . To the east great inclined plains of snow marked out the wide slopes of Radipole . Should he continue this journey ? Should he advance and re-enter the solitudes ? Should he return and re-enter the streets ? What was he to do between those two silences the mute plain and the deaf city ? Which of the two refusal should he choose ? There is the anchor of mercy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that look which the poor little despairing wanderer threw around him . All at once he heard a menace . /z/ A STRANGE and alarming grinding of teeth reached him through the darkness . It was enough to drive one back : he advanced . To those to whom silence has become dreadful , a howl is comforting . That fierce growl reassured him that threat was &; promise . There was there a being alive and awake , though it might be a wild beast . He advanced in the direction whence came the snarl . He turned the corner of a wall , and , behind in a vast sepulchral light made by the reflection of snow and sea , to saw a thing placed as if for shelter . It was a cart . /q/ unless it was a hovel . It had wheels , it was a carriage . It had a roof , it was a dwelling . From the roof arose a funnel , and out of the funnel smoke . This smoke was red , and seemed to imply a good fire in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the centre of the door a square opening showed a light inside the caravan . He approached . Whatever had growled perceived his approach , and became furious . It was no longer a growl which he had to meet , it was a roar . He heard a sharp sound , as of a chain violently pulled to its full length , and suddenly , under the door , between the hind wheels , two rows of sharp white teeth appeared . At the same time as the mouth between the wheels , a head was put through the window . " Peace there ! " said the head . The mouth was silent . The head began again , " Is any one there ? " The child answered , " Yes . " " Who ? " /z/ " You ? Who are you ? whence do you corns f * " I am weary , " said the child . " What o'clock is it ? " " I am cold . " " What are you doing there ? ' * " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be as happy as a lord . Go away . " The head was withdrawn and the window closed . The child bowed his forehead , drew the sleeping infant closer in his arms , and collected his strength to resume his journey ; he had taken a few steps , and was hurrying away . However , at the same time that the window closed the door had opened ; a step had been let down , the voice which had spoken to the child cried out angrily from the inside of the van . " Well ! why do you not enter ? " The child turned back . " Come in , " resumed the voice . " Who has sent me a /z/ fellow like this , who is hungry and cold , and who doei not come in ? " The child , at once repulsed and invited , remained mo tionless . The voice continued , " You are told to come in , you young rascal . " He made up his mind , and placed one foot on the lowest step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He drew back . The gaping jaws appeared . " Peace ! " cried the voice of the man . The jaws retreated , the growling ceased . " Come up ! " continued the man . The child with difficulty climbed up the three steps . He was impeded by the infant so benumbed , rolled up and enveloped in the jacket that nothing could be distinguished of her , and that she was but a little shapeless mass . He passed over the three steps ; and having reached the threshold , stopped . No candle was burning in the caravan , probably from the economy of want . The hut was lighted only by a red tinge , arising from the opening at the top of the stove , in which sparkled a peat fire . On the stove was smoking a porringer and a saucepan , containing to all appearance something to eat . The savory odor was perceptible . The hut was furnished with a chest , a stool , and an unlighted lantern which hung from the ceiling . Besides , to the partition were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which hung a variety of things . On the boards , and nails , were rows of glasses , coppers , an alembic , a vessel rather like those used for graining wax , which are called granulators , and a confusion of strange object of which the child understood nothing , and which were utensils for cooking and chemistry . The caravan was oblong in shape , the stove being in front . It was not even a little room ; it was scarcely a big box . There was more light outside from the snow than inside from the stove . Everything in the caravan was indistinct and misty . Nevertheless , a reflection of the fire on the ceiling enabled the spectator to read in large letter* , - /z/ /q/ The child , in fact , was entering the house of Homo and Ursus . The one he had just heard growling , the other speaking . The child having reached the threshold , perceived near the stove a man , tall , smooth , thin and old , dressed in gary , whose head , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have raised himself on tiptoe . The caravan was just his size . " Come in ! " said the man , who was Ursus . The child entered . " Put down your bundle . " The child placed his burden carefully on the top of the chest , for fear of awakening and terrifying it . The man continued , " Plow gently you put it down ! You could not be more careful were it a case of relics . Is it that you are afraid of tearing a hole in your rags ? Worthless vagabond ! in the streets at this hour ! Who are you ? Answer ! But no . I forbid you to answer . There ! You are cold . Warm yourself as quick as you can , " and he shoved him by the shoulders in front of the fire . " How wet you are ! You 're frozen through ! A nice state to come into a house ! Come , take off those rags , you villain ! " and as with one hand , and with feverish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tore into shreds , with the other he took down from a nail a man 's shirt , and one of those knitted jackets which are up to this day called kiss-me-quicks . " Here are clothes . " He chose out of a heap a woollen rag , and chafed before the fire the limbs of the exhausted and bewildered child , who at that moment , warm and naked , felt as if he were seeing and touching heaven . The limbs having been rubbed , he next wiped the boy 's feet . " Come , you limb ! " you have nothing frost-bitten ! I was a fool to fancy yon had something frozen , hind- legs or fore-paws* You will not lose the use of them this time . Dress yourself ! " The child put on the shirt , and the man slipped the knitted jacket over it . " Now " The man kicked the stool forward and made the little /z/ boy sit down , again shoving him by the shoulders ; then he pointed with his finger to the porringer which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tht porringer was again heaven to him namely , a potato and a bit of bacon . * 4 You are hungry eat ! " The man took from the shelf a crust of hard bread and an iron fork , and handed them to the child . The boy hesitated . " Perhaps you expect me to lay the cloth , " said the man , ? nd he placed the porringer on the c hild 's lap . " Gobble that up . " Hunger overcame astonishment . The child began to lat . The poor boy devoured rather than ate . The glad sound of the crunching of bread filled the hut . The man g Tumbled , " Not so quick , you horrid glutton ! Is n't he a greedy scoundrel ? When such scum are hungry , they eat in a levolting fashion . You should see a lord sup . In my time , I have seen dukes eat . They do n't eat ; that 's noble . They drink , however . Come , you pig ! stuff yourself ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry stomach , caused the child to take little heed of these violent epithets , tempered as they were by charity of action involving a contradiction resulting in his benefit . For the moment he was absorbed by two exigencies and by two ecstasies food and warmth . Ursus continued his imprecations , muttering to him-self , " I have seen King James , supping in proprid persond , in the Banqueting House , where are to be admired the paintings of the famous Rubens . His Majesty touched nothing . This beggar here , browses browses , a word derived from brute . What put it into rny head to come to this Weymouth seven times devoted to the infernal deities ? I have sold nothing since morning . I have nave harangued the snow . I have played the flute to the hurricane . I have not pocketed a farthing ; and now , tonight , beggars drop in . Horrid place ! There is battle , struggle , competition between the fools in the street and myself . They try to give me nothing but farthings . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day I 've /q/ Wade nothing . Not an idiot on the highway . Not a I'vienny in the till . Eat away ! Hell-born boy ! Tear and crunch ! We have fallen on times when nothing can *jqual the cynicism of spungers . Fatten at my expense , parasite ! This wretched boy is more than hungry ; he 13 mad . It is not appetite , it is ferocity . He is carried away by a rapid virus . Perhaps he has the plague . Have you the plague , you thief ? Suppose he were to give it to Homo ! No , never ! Let the populace die , but not my wolf . But by-the-bye I am hungry myself . I declare that this is all very disagreeable . I have worked far into the night . There are seasons in a man 's life when he is hard pressed . I was to-night , by hunger . 1 was alone . I made a fire . I had but one potato , one crust of bread , a mouthful of bacon , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said to myself , ' good . ' I thinfc I am going to eat , and bang ! this crocodile falls upon me at the very moment . He installs himself clean be tween my food and myself . Behold ! how my larder it i devastated ! Eat ! pike , eat ! You shark ! how manr teeth have you in your jaws ? Guzzle , wolf-cub ; no , I withdraw that word . I respect wolves . Swallow up mj food , boa . I have worked all day , and far into the night ; on an empty stomach ; my throat is sore ; my pancreart in distress ; my entrails torn ; and my reward is to sen another eat . ' T is all one , though ! We will divide . Hd shall have the bread , the potato and the bacon , but K will have the milk . " Just then a wail , touching and prolonged , arose in that hut . The man listened . " You cry ! sycophant ! Why do you cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that it wa* not he who cried . He had his mouth full . The cry continued . The man went to the chest . " So it is your bundle that wails ! Yale of Jehoshaphat ! Behold a vociferating parcel ! What the devil has your bundle got to croak about ? " He unrolled the jacket , an infant 's head appeared , the mouth open and crying . " Well ! Who goes there ! " said the man , " Here is another of them . When is this to end ? Who is there ? To arms ! corporal ! call out the guard ; another bang 1 /z/ What have you brought me , thief ? Do n't you see it in thirsty ? " Come ! the little one must have a drink . So now I shall not have even the milk ! " He took down from the things lying in disorder on the shelf a bandage of linen , a sponge , and a phial , muttering savagely , " What an infernal place ! " Then he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! one can tell that by her scream , and she is drenched as well . " He dragged away , as he had done from the boy , the tatters in which she was knotted up rather than dressed , ' and swathed her in a rag , which , though of coarse linen , was clean and dry . This rough and sudden dressing made the infant angry . " She mews relentlessly , " said he . He bit off a long piece of sponge , tore from the roll a square piece of linen , drew* from it a bit of thread , took the saucepan containing the milk from the stove , filled the phial with milk , drove down the sponge halfway into its neck , covered the sponge with linen , tied this cork in with the thread , applied his cheeks to the phial to be sure that it was not too hot , and seized under his left arm the bewildered bundle which was still crying . " Come ! take your supper , creature ! Let me suckle you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . The little infant drank greedily . He held the phial at the necessary incline , grumbling , " They are all the same , the cowards ! When they have all they want they are silent . " The child had drank so ravenously , and had seized so eagerly this breast offered by a cross-grained Providence , that she was taken with a fit of coughing . " You are going to choke ! " growled Ursus . " A fine gobbler this one , too ! " He drew away the sponge which she was sucking , allowed the cough to subside , and then replaced the phial to her lips , saying , " Suck ! you little wretch ! " In the meantime the boy had laid down his fork . Seeing the infant drink had made him forget to eat . The moment before , while lie ate , the expression in his face was satisfaction now it was gratitude . He watched the infant 's renewal of life ; the completion of the resurrection begun by himself filled his eyes with an ineffable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth . The little boy now and then lifted towards Ursus his eyes rnoist with the unspeakable emotion which the poor little being felt but was unable to express . Ursus addressed him furiously . " Well , will you eat ? " " And you ? " said the child , trembling all over , and with tears in his eyes . " You will have nothing ! " " Will you be kind enough to eat it all up , you cub ! There is not too much for you , since there was not enough for me . " The child took up his fork , but did not eat . " Eat , " shouted Ursus . " What has it got to do with me ? Who speaks of me ? Wretched little barefooted clerk of Penniless Parish , I tell you , eat it all up . You are here to eat , drink , and sleep eat , or I will kick you out , both of you . " The boy , under this menace , began to eat again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porringer . Ursus muttered , " This building is badly joined . The cold comes in by the window pane . " A pane had indeed been broken in front , either by a jolt of the caravan or by a stone thrown by some mischievous boy . Ursus had placed a star of paper over the fracture , which had become unpasted . The blast entered there . He was half seated on the chest . The infant in his arms , and at the same time on his lap , was sucking rapturously at the bottle , in the happy somnolency of cherubim before their Creator , and infants at their mothers ' breast . " She is drunk , " said Ursus ; and he continued , " After ' this , preach sermons on temperance ! " The wind tore from the pane the plaster of paper , which flew across the hut ; but this was nothing to the children who were entering life anew ; whilst the little girl drank , and the little boy ate , Ursus grumbled , " Drunkenness begins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tillotson gives himself , thundering against excessive drinking .

It will be a worm gnawing at the vitals of my industry .

Then he laid her down on the fur , on the side next the fire . Haying done so , he placed the phial on the stove , and exclaimed , I 'm thirsty , if you like 1 " /z/ He looked into the pot .

" All the same , I 'm hungry and thirsty , " he observed . And he added , " When one can not eat bread , one must drink water . " Behind the stove there was a jug with the spout off . He took it and handed it to the boy . " Will you drink ? " The child drank , and then went on eating . Ursus seized the pitcher again , and conveyed it to his mouth . The temperature of the water which it contained had been unequally modified by the proximity of the stove . He swallowed some mouthfuls and made a grimace . " Water ! pretending to be pure , thou resemblest false friends . Thou art warm at the top and cold at bottom . " In the meantime the boy had finished his supper . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He picked up and ate pensively a few crumbs caught in the folds of the knitted jacket on his lap . Ursus turned towards him . " That is not all . Now , a word with you . The mouth is not made only for eating , it is made for speaking . Now that you are warmed and stuffed , you beast , take care of yourself . You are going to answer my questions . Whence do you come ? " The child replied , " I do not know . " " How do you mean , you do n't know ? " " I was abandoned this evening on the sea-shore . " " You little scamp ! what 's your name ? He is so good for nothing that his relations desert him . " " I have no relations . " " Give in a little to my tastes , and observe that I do not like those who sing to a tune of fibs . Thou must have relatives since you have a sister . " " It is not my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " /z/ " Who is it then ? " " It is a baby that I found . " " Found ? " " Yes . " " What ! did you pick hr up ? " " Yes . " " Where ? If you lie I will exterminate you . " " On the breast of a woman who was dead in tht now . " " When ? " " An hour ago . " " Where ? " " A league from here . " The arched brow of Ursus knitted and took that pointed tfaape which characterizes emotion on the brow of a philosopher . " Dead ! Lucky for her ! We must leave her in the anow . She is well off there . In which direction ? " " In the direction of the sea . " " Did you cross the bridge ? " Yes . " Ursus opened the window at the back and examined the view . The weather had not improved . The snow was falling thickly and mournfully . He shut the window . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rag ; he heaped the stove with peat ; he spread out as far as he could the bear-skin on the chest ; took a large book which he had in a corner , placed it under the skin for a pillow , and laid the head of the sleeping infant on it . Then he turned to the boy . " Lie down there . " The boy obeyed , and stretched himself at full length by the side of the infant . Ursus rolled the bear-skin over the two children , and tucked it under their feet . He took down from a shelf , and tied round his waist , r Unen belt with a large pocket containing , no doubt , a ca i - ( f instruments and bottles of restoratives . Then he took the lantern from where it hung to t eiling and lighted it . It was a dark lantern . AV ' Righted it still left the children in shadow . HY ORDER OF THE KING . lf Ursus half opened the door , and said , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . GO to sleep . " Then letting down the steps , he called Homo . Hit was answered by a loving growl . Ursus , holding the lantern in his hand , descended . The steps were replaced , the door was reclosed . Th children remained alone . From without , a voice , the voice of Ursus , said , " You , boy , who have just eaten up my supper , are you already asleep ? " " No , " replied the child . " Well , if she cries , give her the rest of the milk . " The clinking of a chain being undone was heard , and the sound of a man 's footsteps , mingled with that of tho pads of an animal , died off in the distance* A few minuteti after , both children slept profoundly . The little boy and girl , lying naked side by side , were joined through the silent hours , in the seraphic promis* cuousness of the shadows ; such dreams as were possible to their age floated from one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , a starlight ; if tins word marriage were not inappropriate to the situation , they were husband and wife after the fashion of tin 3 angels . Such innocence in such darkness , such purity in such an embrace , such foretastes of heaven are possible only to childhood , and no immensity approaches tho greatness of little children . Of all gulfs this is the deepest . The fearful perpetuity of the dead chained beyond life , the mighty animosity of the ocean to a wreck , the whiteness of the snow over buried bodies , do not equal in pathos two children 's mouths meeting divinely in sleep , * and the meeting of which is not even a kiss . A betrothal perchance , perchance a castastrophe . The unknown weighs down upon their juxtaposition . It charms , it terrifies ; who knows which ? It stays the pulse . Innocence is higher than virtue . Innocence is holy ignorance . They slept . They were in peace . They were warm . The nakedness of their bodies , embraced each in each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as in the nest of the abyss . * u Their lips were four red roses on a stein . Which , in their summer beauty , kissed each other . " Shakespeare . /z/ THE beginning of day is sinister . A sad pale light penetrated the hut . It was the frozen dawn . That wan light which throws into relief the mournful reality of objects which are blurred into spectral forms by the night , did not awake the children , so soundly were they sleeping . The caravan was warm . Their breathings alternated like two peaceful waves . There was no longer a hurricane without . The light of dawn was slowly taking possession of the horizon . The constellations were being extinguished , like candles blown out one after the other . Only a few large stars resisted . The deep-toned song of the Infinite was coming from the sea . The fire in the stove was not quite out . The twilight broke , little by little , into daylight . The boy slept less heavily than the girl . At length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he opened - his eyes . The sleep of childhood ends in forgetfulness . He lay in a state of semi-stupor , without knowing where he was or what was near him , without making an effort to remember , gazing at the ceiling , and setting himself an aimless task as he gazed dreamily at the letters of the inscription Ursus , Philosopher which , being unable to read , he examined without the power of deciphering . The sound of a key turning in the lock caused him to turn his head . The door turned on its hinges , the steps were let down . Ursus was returning . He ascended the steps , his extinguished lantern in his hand . At the same time the pattering of four paws fell upon the steps . It was Homo , following Ursus , who had also returned to his home . The boy awoke with somewhat of a start . The wolf , having probably an appetite , gave him a morning yawn , showing two rows of very white teeth . He stopped when he had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /q/ within the caravan , leaning on the threshold , like a preacher with his elbows on the edge of the pulpit . He sniffed the chest from afar , not being in the habit of finding it occupied as it then was . His wolfine form , framed by the doorway , was designed in black against the light of morning . He made up his mind , and entered . The boy , seeing the wolf in the caravan , got out of the bearskin , and , standing up , placed himself in front of the little infant , who was sleeping more soundly than ever . Ursus had just hung the lantern up on a nail in the ceiling . Silently , and with mechanical deliberation , he unbuckled the belt in which was his case , and replaced it on the shelf . He looked at nothing , and seemed to see nothing . His eyes were glassy . Something was moving him deeply in his mind . His thoughts at length found breath , as usual , in a rapid outflow of words . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ! " He bent down , and put a shovelful of turf mould into the stove ; and as he poked the peat , he growled out , " I had a deal of trouble to find her . The mischief of - the unknown had buried her under two feet of snow . Had it not been for Homo , who sees as clearly with his nose as Christopher Columbus did with his mind , I should be still there , scratching at the avalanche , and playing hide and seek with Death . Diogenes took his lantern and sought for a man ; I took my lantern and sought for a woman . He found a sarcasm , and I found mourning . How cold she was . I touched her hand a stone ! What silence in her eyes . How can any one be such a fool as to die and leave a child behind ! It will not be convenient to pack three into this box . A pretty family I have now ! A boy and a girl ! " Whilst Ursus was speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of the sleeping infant was hanging down between the stove and the chest . The wolf set to licking it . He licked it so softly that he did not awake the little infant . Ursus turned round . " Well done , Homo . I shall be father , and you shall be uncle . " Then he betook himself again to arranging the fire with philosophical care , without interrupting his aside . /z/ " Adoption ! It is settled ; Homo is willing . " He drew himself up . " I should like to know who is responsible for that woman 's death ? Is it man ? or " He raised his eyes , but looked beyond the ceiling , and his lips murmured , " Is it Thou ? " Then his brow dropped , as if under a burthen , and he fontinued , " The night took the trouble to kill the woman . " Raising his eyes , they met those of the boy , just awakened , who was listening . Ursus addressed him abruptly , " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not laughing . " Ursus felt a kind of shock , looked at him fixedly for a Ifew minutes and said , " Then you are frightful . " The interior of the caravan , on the previous night , had Ibeen so dark that Ursus had not yet seen the boy 's face . The broad daylight revealed it . He placed the palms of his hands on the two shoulders of the boy , and , examining his countenance more and more piercingly , ex-claimed , " Do not laugh any more ! " " I am not laughing , " said the child . Ursus was seized with a shudder from head to foot . " Y ou do laugh , I tell you . " Then seizing the child with a grasp which would have been one of fury had it not been one of pity , he asked him , roughly , " Who did that to you ? " The child replied , " I do n't know what you mean . " " How long have you had that laugh ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ursus turned towards the chest , saying in a low voice , " I thought that work was out of date . " He took from the top of it , very softly , so as not to awaken the infant , the book which he had placed there for a pillow . " Let us see Conquest , " he murmured . It was a bundle of paper in folio , bound in soft parchment. /q/ He turned the pages with his thumb* stopped at a certain one , opened the book wide on the stove , and read , " l De DenasatisJ it is here . " And he continued , " Bucca fissa usque ad aures genezivis denudatis , na toque murdridato , masca eris , et ridebis semper " " There it is for certain . " Then he replaced the book on one of the shelves , growling . " It might not be wholesome to inquire too deeply into a case of the kind . We will remain on the surface ; laugh away , my boy ! " Just then the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , nurse , give her the breast , " said Ursus . The infant sat up . Ursus taking the phial from the stove , gave it to her to suck . Then the sun arose . He was level with the horizon . His red rays gleamed through the glass , and struck against the face of the infant , which was turned towards him . Her eyeballs , fixed on the sun , reflected his purple orbit like two mirrors . The eyeballs were immovable , the eyelids also . " See I " said Uraua . " She u blind , " /z/ THERE was , in those days , an old tradition . That tradition was Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie . Linnaeus Baron Clancharlie , a contemporary of Cromwell , was one of the peers of England , few in number be it said , who accepted the republic . The reason of his acceptance of it might , indeed , for want of a , better , be found in the fact that for the time being , the republic was triumphant . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic , as long as the republic had the upper hand ; but after the close of the revolution and the fall of the parliamentary government , Lord Clancharlie had persisted in his fidelity to it . It would have been easy for the noble patrician to re-enter the reconstituted upper house , repentance being ever well received on restorations , and Charles II . being a kind prince enough to those who returned to their allegiance to him ; but Lord Clancharlie had failed to understand what was due to events . While the nation overwhelmed with acclamation the king , come to re-take possession of England ; while unanimity was recording its verdict , while the people were bowing their salutation to the monarchy , while the dynasty was rising anew amidst a glorious and triumphant recantation , at the moment when /q/ the past was becoming the future , and the future becoming the past , that nobleman remained refractory . He turned his head away from all that joy , and voluntarily exiled himself . While he could have been a peer , he preferred being an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown old in his fidelity to the dead republic , and was therefore crowned with the ridicule which is the natural reward of such folly . He had retired into Switzerland , and dwelt in a sort of lofty ruin on the banks of the Lake of Geneva . He had Chosen his dwelling in the most rugged nook of the lake , between Chillon , where is 1 the dungeon of Bonnivard , and Vevay , where is Ludlow 's tomb . The rugged Alps , filled with twilight , winds , and clouds , were around him : and he lived there , hidden in the great shadows that fall from the mountains . He was rarely met by any passer-by . The man was out of his country , almost out of his century . At that time , to those who understood and were posted in the affairs of the period , no resistance to established things was justifiable . England was happy ; a restoration is as the reconciliation of husband and wife , prince and nation return to each other , no state can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy ; to have a king at all was a good deal but furthermore , the king was a charming one . Charles II . was amiable , a man of pleasure , yet able to govern , and great , if not after the fashion of Louis XIY . He was essentially a gentleman . Charles II . was admired by his subjects . He had made war in Hanover for reasons best known to himself ; at least , no one else knew them . He had sold Dunkirk to France , a manoeuvre of state policy . The Whig peers , concerning whom Chamberlain says , " Thu cursed republic infected with its stinking breath sevenil of the high nobility , " had had the good sense to bow to the inevitable , to conform to the times , and to resume their seats in the House of Lords . To do so it sufficed that they should take the oath of allegiance to the king . When these facts were considered , the glorious reign , the excellent king , august princes given back by divine mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that persons of such consideration as Monk , and , later on , Jeffreys , had rallied round the throne ; that they had been properly rewarded for their loyalty and zeal by the most /z/ splendid appointments and the most lucrative offices ; that Lord Clancharlie could not be ignorant of this , and that it only depended on himself to be seated by their side , glorious in his honors ; that England had , thanks to her king , risen again to the summit of prosperity ; that London was all banquets and ' carousals ; that everybody was rich and enthusiastic , that the court was gallant , gay , and magnificent ; if by chance , far from these splendors , in some melancholy , indescribable half-light , like nightfall , that old man , clad in the same garb as the common people , was observed pale , absent-minded , bent towards the grave , standing on the shore of the lake , scarce heeding the storm and the winter , walking as though at random , his eye fixed , his white hair tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , solitary , who could forbear to smile ? It was the sketch of a madman . Thinking of Lord Clancharlie , of what he might have been and what he was , a smile was indulgent ; some laughed out aloud , others could not restrain their anger , It is e:iF ; y to understand that men of sense were much shocked by the insolence implied by his isolation . One extenuating circumstance : Lord Clancharlie had never had nny brains . Every one agreed on that point . n . IT is disagreeable a see one 's fellows practise obstinacy . Im iuit inns of Regains are not popular , and public opinion holds Uieui In some derision . Stubborn people are like reproaches , and we have a right to laugh at them . Besides , to sum up , are these perversities , these ruggei notches , virtues ? Is there not in these excessive advertisements of Keif-abnegation and of honor , a good deal of ostentation ? ft is all parade more than anything else . Why sncli exaggeration of solitude and exile ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be in opposition if you choose , blame if you will , but decently , and crying out all the while " Long live the King . " The true virtue is common sense what falls ought to fall , what succeeds ought to succeed . Providence acts advisedly , it crowns him who deserves the crown ; do you pretend to know better than Providence ? When matters are settled when one rule has replaced another when /q/ imccess is the scale in which truth and falsehood are weighed , in one side the catastrophe , in the other the triumph ; then doubt is no longer possible , the honest man rallies to the winning side , and although it may happen to serve his fortune and his family , he does not allow himself to be influenced by that consideration , but thinking only of the public weal , holds out his hand heartily to the conqueror . What would become of the state if no one consented to serve it ? Would not everything come to a standstill ? To keep his place is the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferences . Appointments must be filled , and some one must necessarily sacrifice himself . To be faithful to public functions is true fidelity . The retirement of public officials would paralyze the state . What ! banish yourself ! how weak ! As an example ? what vanity ! As a defiance ? what audacity ! What do you set yourself up to be , I wonder ? Learn that we are just as good as you . If we chose we too could be intractable and untameable , and do worse things than you ; but we prefer to be sensible people . Because I am a Trimalcion , you think that I could not be a O to ! What nonsense . in . NEVER was a situation more clearly defined or more de . cisive than that of 1.660 . Never had a course of conduct been more plainly indicated to a well-ordered mind . England was out of Cromwell 's grasp . Under the republic many irregularities had been committed . British preponderance had been created . With the aid of the Thirty- Years ' war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fronde , France had been humiliated ; with the aid of the Duke of Braganza , the power of Spain had been lessened . Cromwell had tamed Mazarin ; in signing treaties the Protector of England wrote his name above that of the King of France . The United-Provinces had been put under a fine of eight millions ; Algiers and Tunis had been attacked ; Jamaica conquered ; Lisbon humbled ; French rivalry encouraged in Barcelona , and Masaniello in Naples ; Portugal had been made fast to England ; the seas had been swept of Barbary pirates from Gibraltar to Crete j maritime domination had been /z/ founded under two forms , Victory and Commerce . On the 10th of August , 1653 , the man of thirty- three victories , the old Admiral who called himself the sailors ' grandfather , Martin Happertz van Tromp , who had beaten the Spanish , had been destroyed by the English fleet . The Atlantic had been cleared of the Spanish navy , the Pacific of the Dutch , the Mediterranean of the Venetian , and by the patent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . By the ocean she commanded the world ; at sea the Dutch flag humbly saluted the British flag . France , in the person of the Ambassador Mancini , bent the knee to Oliver Cromwell ; and Cromwell played with Calais and Dunkirk as with two shuttlecocks on a battledore . The continent had been taught to tremble , peace had been dictated , war declared , the British Ensign raised on every pinnacle . By itself the Protector 's regiment of Ironsides weighed in the fears of Europe against an army . Cromwell used to say , " 1 wish the Republic of England to be respected , as was respected the Republic of Rome " No longer were delusions held sacred : speech was free , the press was free . In the public street men said what they listed ; they printed what they pleased without control or censorship . The equilibrium of thrones had been destroyed . The whole order of European monarchy , in which the Stuarts formed a link , had been overturned . But at last - England had emerged from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The indulgent Charles II . had granted the declaration of Breda . He had conceded to England oblivion of the period in which the son of the Huntingdon brewer placed his foot on the neck of Louis XIV . England said its mea culpa , and breathed again . The cup of joy was , as we have just said , full ; gibbets for the regicides adding to the universal delight . A restoration is a smile ; but a few gibbets are not out of place , and satisfaction is due to the conscience of the public . To be good subjects was thenceforth the people 's sole ambition . The spirit of lawlessness had been expelled . Royalty was reconstituted . Men had recovered from the follies of politics . ' They mocked at revolution , they jeered at the republic , and as to those times when such strange words as Right , Liberty , Progress , had been in the mouth , why , they /q/ laughed at such bombast ! Admirable was the return to common sense . England had been in a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was ever anything so mad ? Where should we be if every one had his rights ? Fancy every one 's having a hand in the government ? Can you imagine a city ruled by its citizens ? Why , the citizens are the team , and the team can not be driver . To put to the vote is to throw to the winds . Would you jhave states driven like clouds ? Disorder can not , build up order . With chaos for an architect , the edifice would be a Babel . And , besides , what tyranny is this pretended liberty ! As for me , I wish to enjoy myself ; not to govern . It is a bore to have to vote ; I want to dance . A prince is a providence , and takes care of us all . Truly the king is generous to take so much trouble for our sakes . Besides , he is to the manner born . He knows what it is . It 's his business . Peace , War , Legislation , Finance , what have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people have to pay ; of course the people have to serve ; but that should suffice them . They have a place in policy ; from them come two essential things , the army and the budget . To be liable to contribute , and to be liable to serve ; is not that enough ? What more should they want ? They are the military and the financial arm . A magnificent role . The king reigns for them , and they must reward him accordingly . Taxation and the civil list are the salaries paid by the peoples and earned by the prince . The people give their blood and their money , in return for which they are led . To wish to lead themselves ! what an absurd idea f They require a guide ; being ignorant , they are blind . Has not the blind man his dog ? Only the people have a lion , the king , who consents to act the dog . How kind of him ! But why are the people ignorant ? because it is good for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no perspective there is no ambition . The ignorant man is in useful darkness , which , suppressing sight , suppresses covetousness : whence innocence . He who reads , thinks ; who thinks , reasons . But not to reason ig duty ; and happiness as well . These truths are incontestable ; society is based on them . Thus had sound social doctrines been re-established in England ; thus had the nation been reinstated . At the /z/ same time a correct taste in literature was reviving ' , Shakspeare was despised , Dryden admired . " Dryden is the greatest poet of England , and of the century " said Atterbury , the translator of " Achitophel . " It was about the time when M. Huet , Bishop of Avranches , wrote to Saumaise , who had done the author of " Paradise Lost " the honor to refute and abuse him , " How can you trouble yourself about so mean a thing as that Milton ? ' ' Everything was falling into its proper place : Dryden above , Shakspeare below ; Charles II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England was raising herself out of the shame and the excesses of the past . It is a great happiness for nations to be led back by monarchy to good order in the state and good taste in letters . That such benefits should be misunderstood , is difficult to believe . To turn the cold shoulder to Charles II. , to reward with ingratitude the magnanimity which he displayed in ascending the throne was not such conduct abominable ? Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie had inflicted this vexation upon honest men . To sulk at his country 's happiness , alack , what aberration ! We know that in 1650 Parliament ha &.; drawn up this form of declaration : " 2 promise to remain faithful to the republic , without Iking , sovereign , or lord " Under pretext of haying taken this monstrous oath , Lord Clancharlie was living out of the kingdom , and , in the face of the general joy , thought that he had the right to be sad . He had a morose esteem for that which was no more , and was absurdly attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . The kindest-hearted abandoned him ; his friends had long done him the honor to believe that he had entered the republican ranks only to observe the more closely the flaws in the republican armor , and to smite it the more surely when the day should come , for the sacred cause of the king . These ; lurkings in ambush for the convenient hour to strike the enemy a death-blow in the back , are attributes of loyalty Such a line of conduct had been expected of Lord Clancharlie , so strong was the wish to judge him favorably ; but , in the face of his strange persistence in republicanism ; people were obliged to lower their estimate . Evident ! Lord Clancharlie was confirmed in his convictions that il to say , an idiot ! /q/ The explanation given by the indulgent , wavered beweeii puerile stubbornness and senile obstinacy . The severe and the just went further ; they blighted the name of the renegade . Folly has its rights , but it has also its limits . A man may be a brute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , after all , what was this Lord Clancharlie ? A deserter . He had fled his camp , the aristocracy , for that of the enemy , the people . This faithful man was a traitor . Ijb is true that he was a traitor to the stronger , and faithful to the weaker ; it is true that the camp repudiated by him was the conquering camp , and the camp adopted by him , the conquered ; it is true that by his treason he lost everything his political privileges and his domestic hearth , his title and his country . He gained nothing but ridicule , he attained no benefit but exile . But what does all this prove ? that he was a fool . Granted Plainly a dupe and traitor hi one . Let a man be as great a fool as he likes , so that he does not set a bad example . Fools need only be civil , and in consideration thereof they may aim at being the basis of monarchies . The narrowness of Clancharlie 's mind was incomprehensible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution . He had allowed himself to be taken in by the republic yes ; and cast out . He was an affront to his country . The attitude he assumed was downright felony . Absence was an insult . He held aloof from the public joy as from the plague . In his voluntary banishment he found some indescribable refuge from the national rejoicing . He treated loyalty as a contagion : over the widespread gladness at the revival of the monarchy , denounced by him as a lazaretto , he was the blade flag . What ! could he look thus askance at order reconstituted , a nation exalted , arid a religion restored ? Over such serenity why cast his shadow ? Take umbrage at England 's contentment ! Must he be the one blot in the clear blue sky ! Be as a threat ! Protest against a nation 's will ! refuse his Yes to the universal consent ! It would be disgusting , if it were not the part of a fool . Clancharlie could not have taken into account the fact that it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cromwell , as long as one found one 's way back into the right path with Monk . /z/ Take Monk 's case . He commands the republican army . Charles II. , having been informed of his honesty , writes to him . Monk , who combines virtue with tact , dissimulates at first , then suddenly at the head of his troops dissolves the rebel parliament , and re-establishes the king on the throne . Monk is created Duke of Albemarle , has the honor of having saved society , becomes very rich , sheds a glory over his own time , is created Knight of the Garter , and has the prospect of being buried in Westminster Abbey . Such glory is the reward of British fidelity ! Lord Clancharlie could never rise to a sense of duty thus carried out . He had the infatuation and obstinacy of an exile . He contented himself with hollow phrases . He was tongue-tied by pride . The words conscience and dignity are but words , after all . One must penetrate to the depths . These depths Lord Clancharlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and before committing an act , he wished to observe it so closely as to be able to judge it by more senses than one . Hence arose absurd disgust to the facts examined . No , man can be a statesman who gives way to such overstrained delicacy . Excess of conscientiousness degenerates into infirmity . Scruple is one-handed when a sceptre is to be seized , and an eunuch when fortune is to be wedded . Distrust scruples ; . they drag you too far , Unreasonable fidelity is like a ladder leading into a cavern one step down , another , then another , and there you are in the dark . The clever re-ascend ; fools remain in it . Conscience must not be allowed to practise such austerity . If it be , it will fall until , from transition to transition , it at length reaches the deep gloom of political prudery . Then one is lost . Thus it was with Lord Clancharlie . Principles terminate in a precipice . He was walking , his hands behind him , along the shores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ! In London they sometimes spoke of the exile . He was accused before the tribunal of public opinion . They pleaded for and against him . The cause having been heard , he was acquitted on the ground of stupidity . Many zealous friends of the former republic had given their adherence to the Stuarts . For this they deserve praise . They naturally calumniated him a little . The /q/ obstinate are repulsive to the compliant . Men of sense , in favor and good places at Court , weary of his disagreeable attitude , took pleasure in saying , " If he has not ral* lied to the throne , it is because he has not been sufficiently paid " etc . " He wanted the chancellorship which the king has given to Hyde " One of his old friends went so far as to whisper , " He told me so himself " Remote as was the solitude of Linnaeus Clancharlie , something of this talk would reach him through the outlaws he met , such as old regicides like Andrew Broughton , who lived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , a sign of profound deterioration . On one occasion he added to the shrug these few words , murmured in a low voice , " I pity those who believe such things . " /z/ CHARLES II. , good man ! despised him . The happiness of England under Charles II . was more than happiness , it was enchantment . A restoration is like an old oil painting , blackened by time , and re- varnished . All the past re-appeared , good old manners returned , beautiful women reigned and governed . Evelyn notices it . We read in his journal , " Luxury , profaneness , contempt of God . I saw the king on Sunday evening with his courtesans , Portsmouth , Cleveland , Mazarin , and two or three others , all nearly naked , in the gaming-room . " We feel that there is ill-nature in this description , for Evelyn was a grumbling puritan , tainted with republican reveries . He did not appreciate the profitable example given by kings in those grand Babylonian gaieties , which , after all , maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is a maxim : Do not extirpate vice , if you want to have charming women ; if you do you are like idiots who destroy the chrysalis whilst they delight in the butterfly . Charles II. , as we have said , scarcely remembered that a rebel called Clancharlie existed ; but James II . was more heedful . Charles II . governed gently , it was his way ; we may add , that he did not govern the worse on that account . A sailor sometimes makes on a rope intended to baffle the wind , a slack knot which he leaves to /z/ the wind to tighten . Such is the stupidity of the storm and of the people . The slack knot very soon becomes a tight one . So did the government of Charles II . Under James II . the throttling began ; a necessary throttling of what remained of the revolution . James II . had a laudable ambition to be an efficient king . The reign of Charles II . was , in his opinion , but a sketch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order . He had , in 1660 , deplored that they had confined themselves to the hanging of ten regicides . He was a more genuine reconstructor of authority . He in fused vigor into serious principles . He installed truo justice , which is superior to sentimental declamations and attends , above all things to the interests of society In his protecting severities we recognize the father of the state . He entrusted the hand of justice to Jeffreys , and its sword to Kirke . That useful Colonel , one day , hung and rehung the same man , a republican , asking him each time , " Will you renounce the republic ? " The villain , having each time said " No , " was despatched " I hanged him four times " said Kirke , with satisfaction . The renewal of executions is a great sign of power in the executive authority , Lady Lisle , who , though she had sent her son to fight against Monmouth , had concealed two rebels in her house , was executed ; another rebel , having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him shelter , was pardoned , and the woman was burned alive . Kirke , on another occasion , gave a town to understand that he knew its principles to be republican , by hanging nineteen burgesses . These reprisals were certainly legitimate , for it must be remembered that , under Cromwell , they cut off the noses and ears of the stone saints in the churches . James II. , whc ? had had the sense to choose Jeffreys and Kirke , was a prince imbued with true religion ; he practised mortification in the ugliness of his mistresses ; be listened to le Pere la Colombtere , a preacher almost as unctuous us 1 ; P &re; Cheminais , but with more fire , who had the glory of being , during the first part of his life , the counsellor of James II. , and , during the latter , the inspirer of M : . ' -y Alcock . It was , thanks to this strong religions noun ' merit , that later on , James II . was enabled to bear /q/ with dignity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the spectacle of a king rising superior to adversity , calmly touching for king 's evil , and conversing with Jesuits . It will be readily understood that such a king would trouble himself to a certain extent about such a rebel as Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie . Hereditary peerages have a certain hold on the future , and it was evident that if any precautions were necessary with regard to that lord , James II . was not the man to hesitate . /z/ LORD DAVID DIRRY-MOrR . LORD LINXEFS CLANCHARLIE had not always been old and proscribed ; he had had his phase of youth and passion . We know from Harrison and Pride that Cromwell , when young , Icved women and pleasure , a taste which , at times ( another reading of the text " Woman , " ) , betrays a seditious man . Distrust the loosely-clasped girdle . Male prcecinctan* juvenem cavete . Lord Clancharlie , like Cromwell , had had his wild hours and his irregularities . He was known to have had a natural child , a son . This son was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as his father was going into exile . Hence he had never seen his father . This bastard of Lord Chancharlie had grown up as page at the court of Charles II . He was styled Lord David Dirry-Moir : lie was a lord by courtesy his mother being a woman of quality . The mother , while Lord Clancharlie was becoming an owl in Switzerland , made up her mind , being a beauty , to give over sulking , and was forgiven that Goth , her first lover , by one undeniably polished and at iho same time a royalist , for it was the king himself . She had been but a short time tho mistress of Charles II. , sufficiently long however to have made his majesty who was delighted to have won so pretty a woman from the republic bestow on the little Lord David , the son of his Conquest , the office of keeper of the stick , which made that bastard officer , boarded at the king 's expense , /z/ by a natural revulsion of feeling , an ardent adherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the hundred and seventy wearing the great sword , while afterwards , entering the corps of pensioners , he became one of the forty who bear the gilded halberd . He had , besides being one of the noble company instituted by Henry VIII . as a body-guard , the privilege of laying the dishes on the king 's table . Thus it was that whilst his father was growing gray in exile , Lord David prospered under Charles II . After which he prospered under James II . The king is dead . Long live the king ! It is the non deficit alter , aureus . It was on the accession of the Duke of York , that he obtained permission to call himself David Lord DirryMoir , from an estate which his mother , who had just died , had left him , in that great forest of Scotland , where is found the krag , a bird which scoops out a nest with its beak in the trunk of the oak . /z/ JAMES II . was a king , and affected to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He showed himself frequently in public on horseback , in a helmet and cuirass , with a huge projecting wig hanging below the helmet and over the cuirass , a sort of ' equestrian statue of imbecile war . He took a fancy to the graceful mien of the young Lord David . He liked the royalist for being the son of a republican . The repudiation of a father does not damage the foundation of a court fortune . The king made Lord David gentleman of the . bedchamber , at a salary of a thousand a year . It was a fine promotion . A gentleman of the bedchamber sleeps near the king every night , on a bed which is made up for him . There are twelve gentlemen , who relieve each other . Lord David , whilst he held that post , was also head of the king 's granary , giving out corn for the horses and receiving a salary of 260 . Under him were the five coachmen of the king , the five postilions of the king , the five grooms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the four chair-bearers of the king . He had the management of the race-horses which the king kept at /q/ Newmarket , and which cost his majesty 600 ? . a year . He worked his will on the king 's wardrobe , from which the knights of the garter are furnished with their robes of ceremony . He was saluted to the ground by the usher of the black rod , who belongs to the king . . That usher , under James II. , was the knight of Duppa . Mr. Baker , who was clerk of the crown , and Mr. Brown , who was clerk of the Parliament , kowtowed to Lord David . The court of England , which is magnificent , is a model of hospitality . Lord David presided , as one of the twelve , at banquets and receptions . He had the glory of standing behind the king on offertory days , when the king gives to the church the golden byzantium ; on collar-days , when the king wears the collar of his order ; on communion days , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princes . It was he who , on Holy Thursday , introduced into his majesty 's presence the twelve poor men to whom the king gives as many silver pence as the years of his age , and as many shillings as the years of his reign . The duty devolved on him when the king was ill , to call to the assistance of his majesty the two grooms of the almonry , who are priests , and to prevent the approach of doctors without permission from the council of state . Besides , he was lieutenant-colonel of the Scotch regiment of Guards , the one which plays the Scottish march . As such , he made several campaigns , and with glory , for he was a gallant soldier . He was a brave lord , well-made , handsome , generous , and majestic in look and in manner . His person was like his quality . He was tall in stature , as well as high in birth . At one time he stood a chance of being made groom of the stole , which would have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his majesty : but to hold that office it was necessary to be either prince or peer . Now , to create a peer is a serious thing ; it is to create a peer* age , and that makes many people jealous . It is a favor : a favor which gives the king one friend and a hundred enemies , without taking into account that the one friend becomes ungrateful . James II. , from policy , was indisposed to create peerages , but he transferred them freely . The transfer of a peerage produces no sensation . It is simply the continuation of a name , The order is little affected by it . /z/ The good- will of royalty had no objection to raise Lord David Dirry-Moir to the upper house so long as it could do so by means oi a substituted peerage . Nothing would have pleased his majesty better than to transform Lord David Dirry-Moir , lord by courtesy , into a lord by rigbt. iii . THE opportunity occurred . One day it was announced that several things hau : happened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was that he was dead . Death does just this much good to folks : it causes a little talk about them . People related what they knew , or what they thought they knew , of the last years of Lord Linngeus . What they said was probably legend and conjecture . If these random tales were to be credited , Lord Clancharlie must have had his republicanism intensified towards the end of his life , to the extent of marrying ( strange obst ) nacy of the exile ! ) Ann Bradshaw , the daughter of a regi cide ; they were precise about the name . She had also died , it was said , but in giving birth to a boy . If these details should prove to be correct , his child would of course be the legitimate and rightful heir of Lord Clancharlie . These reports , however , were extremely vague in form and were rumors rather than facts . Circumstances which happened in Switzerland , in those days , were as remote from the England of that period as those which take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Clancharlie must have been fifty-nine at the time of his marriage , they said , and sixty at the birth of his son , and must have died shortly after , leaving his infant or phaned both of father and mother . This was possible , perhaps , but improbable . They added that the child was beautiful as the day , just as we read in all the fairy tales . King James put an end to these rumors , evidently without foundation , by declaring , one fine morning , Lord David Dirry-Moir sole and positive heir in default of legitimate issue , and by his royal pleasure , of Lord Linnaeus Clancharlie , his natural father , the absence of all other issue and descent being established patents of which grant were registered in the House of Lords . By these patents the king instituted Lord David Dirry-Moir , in the titles , rights , and prerogatives of the late Lord /q/ Linnaeus Clancharlie , on the sole condition that Lord David should wed , when she attained a marriageable age , a girl who was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , and whom the king had , in her cradle , created a duchess , no one knew exactly why ; or , rather , every one knew why . This little infant was called the Duchess Josiana . The English fashion then ran on Spanish names . One of Charles II . ' s bastards was called Carlos , Earl of Plymouth . It is likely that Josiana was a contraction for Josefa-y-Ana . Josiana , however , may have been a name the feminine of Josias . One of Henry YTII. ' s gentlemen was called Josias du Passage . It was to this little duchess that the king granted the peerage of Clancharlie . She was a peeress till there should be a peer ; the peer should be her husband . The peerage was founded on a double castleward , the barony of Clancharlie and the barony of Hunkerville ; besides , the barons of Clancharlie were , in recompense of an ancient feat of arms , and by royal license , Marquises of Corleone , in Sicily . Peers of England camiCw Ltr foreign titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arundel , Baron Arundel of Wardour , was , as well as Lord Clifford , a Count of the Holy Roman Empire , of which Lord Cowper is a prince . The Duke of Hamilton is Duke of Chatelherault , in France ; Basil Fielding , Earl of Denbigh is Count of Hapsburg , of Lauffenberg , and of Rheinf elden , in Germany . The Duke of Marlborough was Prince of Mindelheim , in Suabia , just as the Duke of Wellington was Prince of Waterloo , in Belgium . The same Lord Wellington was a Spanish Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo , and Portuguese Count of Yimiera . There were in England , and there are still , lands both noble and common . The lands of the Lords of Clancharlie were all noble . These lands , burghs , bailiwicks , fiefs , rents , freeholds , and domains , adherent to the peerage of Clan charlie- Hunkerville ; belonged provisionally to Lady Josiana , and the king declared that , once married to Josiana , Lord David Dirry-Moir should be Baron Clancharlie . Besides the Clancharlie inheritance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , much of which was derived from the gifts of Madame sans queue /z/ to the Duke of York . Madame sans queue is short foi Madame . Henrietta of England , Duchess of Orleans , the lady of highest rank in France after the queen , was thus called . /z/ HAVING prospered under Charles and James , Lord David prospered under William . His Jacobite feeling did not reach to the extent of following James into exile . While he continued to love his legitimate king , he had the good sense to serve the usurper ; he was , moreover , although sometimes disposed to rebel against discipline , an excellent officer . He passed from the land to the sea forces , and distinguished himself in the White Squadron . He rose in it to be what was then called captain of a light frigate . Altogether he made a very fine fellow , carrying to a great extent the elegancies of vice : a bit of a poet , like every one else ; a good servant of the state , a good servant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ladies ' receptions , at ceremonies , and in battle ; servile in a gentlemanlike way ; very haughty ; with eyesight dull or keen , according to the object examined ; inclined to integrity ; obsequious or arrogant , as occasion required ; frank and sincere on first acquaintance , with the power of assuming the mask afterwards ; very observant of the smiles and frowns of the royal humor ; careless before a sword ' s point ; always ready to risk his life on a sign from his majesty with heroism and complacency capable of any insult but of no impoliteness ; a man of courtesy and etiquette , proud of kneeling at great regal ceremonies ; of a gay valor ; a courtier on the surface , a paladin below ; quite young at forty-five . Lord David sang French songs , an elegant gaiety which had delighted Charles II . He loved eloquence and fine language . He greatly admired those celebrated discourses which are called the funeral orations of Bossuet . From his mother he had inherited almost enough to live on , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by running into debt . In magnificence , extravagance , and novelty he was without a rival . Directly he was copied he changed his fashion . On horseback he . wore loose boots of cow-hide , which turned over , with spurs . He had hats like nobody else 's ; unheard-of lace and bands of which he alone had the pattern . /q/ /z/ THE DUCHESS JOSIAtfA . TOWARDS 1705 , although Lady Josiana was twenty-three and Lord David forty-four , the wedding had not yet taken place , and that for the best reasons in the world . Did they hate each other ? Far from it ; but what can not escape from you inspires you with no haste to obtain it . Josiana wanted to remain free , David to remain young . To have no tie until as late as possible appeared to him to be a prolongation of youth . Middle-aged young men abounded in those rakish times . They grew gray as young fops . The wig was an accomplice : later on , powder became the auxiliary . At fifty-five Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bromley , filled London with his successes . The young and pretty Duchess of Buckingham , Countess of Coventry , made a fool of herself for love of the handsome Thomas Bellasys , Viscount Fauconberg , who was sixty-seven . People quoted the famous verses of Corneille , the septuagenarian , to a girl of twenty " Marquise , si mon visage " Women , too , had their successes in the autumn of life . Witness Ninon and Marion . Such were the models of the day . Josiana and David carried on a flirtation of a particular shade . They did not love , they pleased , each other . To be at each other 's side sufficed them . Why hasten the conclusion ? The novels of those days carried lovers and engaged couples to that kind of stage which was the most becoming . Besides , Josiana , while she knew herself to be a bastard , felt herself a princess , and carried her authority over him with a high tone in all their arrangements . She had a fancy for Lord David . Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bargain . She considered him to be fashionable . To be fashionable is everything . Caliban , fashionable and magnificent , would distance Ariel , poor . Lord David was handsome ; so much the better . The danger in be ing handsome is being insipid ; and that he was not . Tie /z/ bettea , o-ed , ran into debt . Josiana thought great things of his horses , his dogs , his losses at play , his mistresses . Lord David , on his side , bowed down before the fascinations of the Duchess Josiana a maiden without spot or scruple , haughty , inaccessible and audacious . He addressed sonnets to her , which Josiana sometimes read . In these sonnets he declared that to possess Josiana would be to rise to the stars , which did not prevent his always putting the ascent off to the following year . He waited in the antechamber outside Josiana 's heart ; and this suited the convenience of both . At court all admired the good taste of this delay . Lady Josiana said , " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David ; I , who would desire nothing better than to be in love with him ! " Josiana was " the flesh . " Nothing could be more resplendent . She was very tall too tall . Her hair was of that tinge which might be called red gold . She was plump , fresh , strong , and rosy , with immense boldness and wit . She had eyes which were too intelligible . She had neither lovers nor chastity . She walled herself round with pride . Men ! oh , fie ! a god only would be worthy of her , or a monster . If virtue consists in the protection of an inaccessible position , Josiana possessed all possible virtue , but without any innocence . She disdained intrigues ; but she would not have been displeased had she been supposed to have engaged in some , provided that the objects were uncommon , and proportioned to the merits of one so highly placed . She thought little of her reputation , but much of her glory . To appear yielding , and to be unapproachable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hers was a cumbrous beauty . She usurped rather than charmed . She trod upon hearts . She was earthly . She would have been as much astonished at being proved to have a soul in her bosom as wings on her back . She discoursed on Locke ; she was polite ; sho was suspected of knowing Arabic . To be the " flesh " and to be womau are two different things . Where a woman is vulnerable , on the side f pity , for instance , which so readily turns to love , Josiuuji was not . Xot that she was unfeeling . The ancient comparison of flesh to marble is absolutely false . The beauty of flesh consists in not being marble : its brant y is to palpitate , to tremble , to blush , to bleed , to have /q/ firmness without hardness ; to be white without being cold ; to have its sensations and its infirmities ; its beauty is to be life , and marble is death . Flesh , when it attains a certain degree of beauty , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceals itself in its own dazzling charms as in a veil . He who might have looked upon Josiana nude , would have perceived her outlines only through a surrounding glory . She would have shown herself without hesitation to a satyr or a eunuch . She had the self-possession of a goddess . To have made her nudity a torment , ever eluding a pursuing Tantalus , would have been an amuse meut to her . The king had made her a duchess , and Jupiter a Nereid a double irradiation of which the strange brightness of this creature was composed . In admiring her you felt yourself becoming a pagan and a lacquey . Her origin had been bastardy and the ocean . She appeared to have emerged from the foam . From the stream had risen the first jet of her destiny ; but the spring was royal . In her there was something of the wave , of chance , of the patrician , and of the tempest . She was well read and accomplished . Never had a passion approached her , yet she had sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the same time a taste for them . If she had stabbed herself , it would , like Lucretia , not have been until afterwards . She was a virgin stained with every defilement in its visionary stage . She was a possible Astarte in a real Diana . She was , in the insolence of high birth , tempting and inaccessible . Nevertheless , she might find it amusing to plan a fall for herself . She dwelt in a halo of glory , half wishing to descend from it , and perhaps feeling curious to know what a fall was like . She was a little too . heavy for her cloud . To err is a diversion . Princely unconstraint has the privilege of experiment ; and what is frailty in a plebeian , is only frolic in a duchess . Josiana was in everything in birth , in beauty , in irony , in brilliancy almost a queen . She had felt a moment 's enthusiasm for Louis de BoufHes , who used to break horse-shoes between his fingers . She regretted that Hercules was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voluptuous and snpivn.it* ideal . Morally , Josiana brought tu one 's mind t , ho iiue /z/ " Un beau torse de f emme en hydre se termine . " Hers was a noble neck , a splendid bosom , heaving harmoniously over a royal heart , a glance full of life and light , a countenance pure and haughty , and who knows ? below the surf ace was there not , in a semi-transparent and misty depth , an undulating , supernatural prolongation , perchance deformed and dragon-like , a proud virtue ending in vice in the depths of dreams . /z/ WITH all that she was a prude . It was the fashion . Remember Elizabeth . Elizabeth was of a type that prevailed in England for three centuries : the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth . Elizabeth was more than English , she was Anglican . Hence the deep respect of the Episcopalian Church for that queen , a respect resented by the Church of Rome , which counterbalanced it with a dash of excommunication . In the mouth of Sixtus V. , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gran cervello di principessa " he says . Mary Stuart , less concerned with the church and more with the woman part of the question , had little respect for . her sister Elizabeth ; and wrote to her as queen to queen and coquette to prude : c Your disinclination to marriage arises from your not wishing to lose the liberty of being made love to . " Mary Stuart played with the fan , Elizabeth with the axe . An uneven match . They were rivals , besides , in literature . Mary Stuart composed French verses ; Elizabeth translated Horace . The ugly Elizabeth decreed herself beautiful ; liked quatrains and acrostics ; had the keys of towns presented to her by cupids ; bit her lips , after the Italian fashion , rolled her eyes after the Spanish ; had in her wardrobe three thousand dresses , and costumes , of which several were for the character of Minerva and Amphitrite ; esteemed the Irish for the width of their shoulders ; covered her farthingale with braids and spangles ; loved roses ; cursed , swore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenched fists ? ; used to send Dudley to the devil ; beat Burleigh , the Chancellor , who would cry poor old fool ' spafc on Matthew t /q/ collared Hatton ; boxed the ears of Essex ; showed her ) egs to Bassompierre ; and was a virgin . What she did for Bassompierre , the Queen of Sheba had done for Solomon , * consequently she was right , HolyWrit having created the precedent . That which is biblical may well be Anglican . Biblical precedent goes so far as to speak of a child , who was called Ebnehaquem or Melilechet , that is to say , the Wise Man 's son . Why object to such manners ? Cynicism is at least as good as hypocrisy . Nowadays England , whose Loyola is named Wesley , casts down her eyes a little at the remembrance of that past age . She is vexed at the memory , yet proud of it . Amidst such manners as these , a taste for deformity existed , especially amongst women , and singularly amongst beautiful women . Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baboon ? Where is the charm of being a queen if one can not bandy words with a dwarf ? Mary Stuart had " been kind " to the bandy-legged Rizzio . Maria Theresa , of Spain , had been " somewhat familiar " with a negro . Whence the black abbess . In the alcoves of the great century , a hump was the fashion ; witness the Marshal of Luxembourg , and before Luxembourg , Conde , " such a pretty little man ! " Beauties themselves might be ill-made without detriment ; it was admitted . Anne Boleyn had one breast bigger than the other , six fingers to one hand , and a projecting tooth ; Lavalliere was bandy-legged ; which did not hinder Henry VIII . from going mad for the one , and Louis XIV . for the other . Morals were equally awry . There was not a woman of high rank who was not teratological . Agnes possessed the principles of Messalina . They were women by day , ghouls by night . They sought the scaffold to kiss the heads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valois , a predecessor of the prudes , wore , fastened to her belt , the hearts of her lovers in tin boxes , padlocked . Henry IV . had hidden himself under her farthingale . In the 18th century the Duchess de Berry , daughter of /z/ the Regent , was in herself an abstract , of obscene and royal type , of all these creatures . These fine ladies , moreover , knew Latin . From tho 16th century this had been accounted a feminine accomplishment . Lady Jane Grey had carried fashion to the point of knowing Hebrew . The Duchess Josiana latin ized . Then ( another fine thing ) she was secretly a Catholic ; after the manner of her uncle , Charles II. , rather than her father , James II . James II . had lost his crown for his Catholicism , and Josiana did not care to risk her peerage . Thus it was that while a Catholic amongst her intimate friends and the refined of both sexes , she was outwardly a Protestant for the benefit of the riff-raff . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the good things belonging to the official Episcopalian church , and later on you die , like Grotius , in the odor of Catholicity , having the glory of a mass being said for you by le Pere Petau . Although plump and healthy , Josiana was , we repeat , a perfect prude . At times , her sleepy and voluptuous way of dragging out the end of her phrases , was like the creeping of a tiger 's paws in the jungle . The advantage of prudes is that they disorganize the human race . They deprive it of the honor of their adherence . Beyond all , keep the human species at a distance . This is a point of the greatest importance . When one has not got Olympus , one must take the Hotel de Rambouillet . Juno resolves herself into Araminta . A pretension to divinity not admitted , creates affectation . In default of thunder-claps there is impertinence . The temple shrivels into the boudoir . Not having the power to be a goddess , she is an idol . There is besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to women . The coquette and the pedant are neighbors . Their kinship is visible in the fop . The subtile is derived from the sensual . Gluttony affects delicacy , a grimace of disgust conceals cupidity . And then woman feels her weak point guarded by all that casuistry of gallantry which takes the place of scruples in prudes . It is a line of circumvallation with a ditch . Every prude puts on an air of repugnance . It is a protection . She will consent* but she disdains for the present /q/ Josiana had an uneasy conscience . She felt such a leaning towards immodesty that she was a prude . The recoils of pride in the direction opposed to our vices lead us to those of a contrary nature . It was the excessive effort to be chaste which made her a prude . To be too much on the defensive points to a secret desire for attack ; the shy woman is not strait-laced . She shut herself up in the arrogance of the exceptional circumstances of her rank , meditating , perhaps , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dawn of the 18th century . England was a sketch of what France was during the regency . Walpole and Dubois are not unlike . Maiiborough was fighting against his former king , James II. , to whom it was said he had sold his sister , Miss Churchill . Bolingbroke was in his meridian , and Richelieu in his dawn . Gallantry found its convenience in a certain medley of ranks . Men were equalized by the same vices as they were later on , perhaps , by the same ideas . Degradation of rank , an aristocratic prelude , began what the revolution was to complete . It was not very far off the time when Jelyotte was seen publicly sitting , in broad daylight , on the bed of the Marquis d'Epinay . It is true ( for manners re-echo each other ) that in the 16th century Sine ton 's nightcap had been found under Anne Boleyn 's pillow . If the word woman signifies fault , as I forget what Council decided , never was woman so womanlike as then . Never , covering her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omnipotence , has she claimed absolution more imperiously . In making the forbidden the permitted fruit , Eve fell ; in making the permitted the forbidden fruit , she triumphs . That is the climax . In the 18th century the wife bolts out her husband . She shuts herself up in Eden with Satan . Adam is left outside . in . ALL Josiana 's instincts impelled her to yield herself gallantly , rather than to give herself legally . To surrender on the score of gallantry implies learning , recall* Menalcas and Amaryllis , and is almost a literary act . Mademoiselle de Scude'ry , putting aside the attraction of ugliness for ugliness ' sake , had no other motive for yield* Ing to /z/ The maiden a sovereign , the wife a subject , such was the old English notion . Josiana was deferring the hour of this subjection as long as she could . She must eventually marry Lord David , since such was the royal pleasure . It was a necessity , doubtless ; but what a pity ! Josiana appreciated Lord David , and showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither to conclude nor to break off the engagement . They eluded each other . This method of making love , one step in advance , and two back , is expressed in the dances of the period , the minuet and the gavotte . It is unbecoming to be married fades one 's ribbons , and makes one look old . An espousal is a dreary absorption of brilliancy . A woman handed over to you by a notary , how commonplace ! The brutality of marriage creates definite situations ; suppresses the will ; kills choice ; has a syntax , like grammar ; replaces inspiration by orthography ; makes a dictation of love ; disperses all Life 's mysteries ; diminishes the rights both of sovereign and subject ; by a turn of the scale destroys the charming equilibrium of the sexes , the one robust in bodily strength , - the other all-powerful in feminine weakness : strength on one side , beauty on the other ; makes one a master and the other a servant , while without marriage one is a slave , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how gross ! to deprive it of all impropriety , how dull ! Lord David was ripening . Forty ; ' t is a marked period . He did not perceive this , and in truth he looked no more than thirty . He considered it more amusing to desire Josiana than to possess her . He possessed others . He had mistresses . On the other hand , Josiana had dreams . The Duchess Josiana had a peculiarity , less rare than it is supposed . One of her eyes was blue and the other black . Her pupils were made for love and hate , for happiness and misery . Kight and day were mingled in her look . Her ambition was this ; to show herself capable of inu possibilities . One day she said to Swift , " You people fancy that you know what scorn is . " " You people , " meant the human race . She was a skin-deep Papist . Her Catholicism did not exceed the amount necessary for fashion . She would /q/ have been a Puseyite in the present day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or moire , some com posed of fifteen or sixteen yards of material , with embroideries of gold and silver ; and round her waist many knots of pearls , alternating with other precious stones . She was extravagant in gold lace . Sometimes she wore an embroidered cloth jacket like a bachelor . She rode on a man 's saddle , notwithstanding the invention of side-saddles , introduced into England in the 14th century by Anne , wife of Richard II . She washed her face , arms , shoulders , and neck , in sugar-candy , diluted in white of egg , after the fashion of Castile . There came over her face , after any one had spoken wittily in her presence , a reflective smile of singular grace . She was free from malice , and rather good-natured than otherwise . /z/ JOSIANA was bored . The fact is so natural as to be tcarcely worth mentioning . Lord David held the position of judge in the gay life of London . He was looked up to by the nobility and gentry . Let us register a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear his own hair . The reaction against the wig was beginning . Just as in 1824 Eugene Deveriawas the first to allow his beard to grow , so in 1702 Prince Devereux was the first to risk wearing his own hair in public disguised by artful curling . For to risk one 's hair was almost to risk one 's head . The indignation was universal . Nevertheless Prince Devereux was Viscount Hereford , and a peer of England . He was insulted , and the deed was well worth the insult . In the hottest part of the row Lord David suddenly appeared without his wig and in his own hair . Such conduct shakes the foundations of society . Lord David was insulted even more than Viscount Hereford . He held his ground . Prince Devereux was the first , Lord David Dirry-Moir the second . It is sometimes more difficult to be second than first . It requires less genius , but more courage . The first , intoxi- /z/ cated by the novelty , may ignore the danger ; the second sees the abyss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abyss of no longer wearing a wig . Later on these lords found imitators . Following these two revolutionists , men found sufficient audacity to wear their own hair , and powder was introduced as an extenuating circumstance .
