txt Lady Rachel Wriothesley was the second daughter of Thomas Wriothesley , Earl of Southampton , by his first wife , Rachel de Ruvigny , of an ancient Hugonot family in France . She was born in 1636 ; her mother died in her infancy ; and her father afterward married Elizabeth , daughter of Sir Francis Leigh , created Earl of Chichester . Lord Clarendon informs us that the Earl of Southampton was " a very great man in all respects , and brought much reputation to the cause of Charles I. He owed no obligations to the court ; on the contrary he had undergone some hardships from it ; and as he kept aloof from all intercourse with it , he was considered one of the peers most attached to the cause of the people , and was much courted by the popular party . He had a great dislike of the high courses , which had been taken by the government , and a particular prejudice to the Earl of /z/ Strafford for some exorbitant proceedings . But when he saw the popular tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , even the course of justice , Lord Southampton reluctantly allowed himself to be attached to the courtparty : he was first made privy-counsellor , and soon after gentleman of the bed-chamber to the king . He had previously refused to sign the protestation of both houses of Parliament ; and as they had voted that no man who refused his signature should be capable of any preferment in church or state , he was believed to have accepted these offices merely to show how little he regarded the advisers of such measures . He went with the king to York and to Nottingham , was with him at Edge-hill , and came and staid with him at Oxford to the end of the war , taking all opportunities to advance all motions towards peace . Although a person naturally loving his ease , and , allowing himself never less than ten hours ' repose , yet during the conferences at Uxbridge , which lasted twenty days , he was never more than four hours in bed ; " so earnest was he to effect a union between king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his distracted country . " Violence on one side and obstinacy on the other rendered his efforts of no avail ; yet still the Earl of Southampton faithfully attended the daily diminishing court of the misguided Charles . After the the king left Hampton Court , he remained sometime at Tichfield , in the Earl of Southampton 's /q/ house , and under the protection of his m . ier , the old Countess of Southampton . " When Charles became a prisoner , in the power of his own provoked subjects , the Earl made every possible attempt to save him . He was one of the four faithful adherents who offered their own lives for the safety of the monarch , on the plea that they had been his counsellors , and therefore were alone worthy of punishment ; and when at last the king 's life was sacrificed to the liberty of the nation , he was one of those who asked and obtained permission to pay the last sad duty to his remains . After the execution of Charles I. he retired to his seat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Charles II . All Cromwell 's advances to friendship were promptly rejected ; and " when the protector was near his house , upon the occasion of Richard Cromwell 's marriage , and had intent to visit him , the Earl , upon private notice thereof , immediately hastened to remove to another house at a greater distance . " Burnet tells us that he made large remittances to Charles II . during his exile ; he styles him " A fast friend to the public  --  the wise and virtuous Southampton , who deserved everything the King could give him . " Such were the obligations , which the Stuarts owed to the family of Southampton ! But princes are apt to think the honor of serving them a sufficient recompense for all sacrifices ; and none so shamefully forgot claims upon their gratitude as the profligate and selfish sons of Charles I. /z/ The tyranny and extravagance of Charles II . could not , of course , be pleasing to the firm but conscientious friend of his unfortunate father . Oldmixon says , " That right noble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not more exemplary than his love to his country , said to Chancellor Hyde , ' It is to you we owe all we either feel or fear ; for if you had not possessed us in all your letters with such an opinion of Charles II . we would have taken care to have put it out of his power , either to do himself or us any mischief , which is likely to result from our trusting him so entirely . ' " At the restoration , the Earl of Southampton was made Lord High Treasurer ; an office which he is said to have filled with great integrity and address . He died in 1667 . The thoughtless and unfeeling kino- had been for some time desirous to snatch the treasurer 's staff from his dying hand ; for he was angry at one , who uniformly refused to pay court to his unprincipled mistress , the Duchess of Cleveland ; and he felt ashamed to let such a man know the secrets of his political corruption . " Of Lord Southampton 's second marriage , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was first married to Joceline Percy , the last Earl of Northumberland , and afterward to the Duke of Montague . As this daughter inherited her mother 's estates , the whole of Lord Southampton 's princely fortune was divided between the two surviving children of his first marriage , Elizabeth and /q/ Rachel . The Lady Elizabeth married Edward Noel , son of Viscount Campden , afterward created Earl of Gainsborough . The Lady Rachel was first married to Francis Lord Vaughan , eldest son of the Earl of Carberry ; and afterward to Lord William Russell , son of the Earl of Bedford . " Her first marriage took place in 1653 , when she was about seventeen years of age . According to the fashion of the day , this match was arranged by the parents ; and perhaps Lady Russell 's remark concerning such early unions was founded on her own experience : she says , " It is acceptance , rather than choosing , on either side . " We have no means of knowing how far Lady Vaughan 's affections were concerned ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blameless conduct , amiable temper , and cheerful disposition , gained the lasting attachment of all her husband 's family . There is extant the copy of a letter written to her in 1655 , when she was residing with Lord Vaughan , at his father 's house in Wales , * which shows in what estimation she was held , even at that early period of her life : " Dear Madam ,  --  There is not in the world so great a charm as goodness ; and your ladyship * Golden Grove , in Carmarthenshire . At a fire which happened there in 1729 many family papers were destroyed , among which we have probably to regret the means of becoming acquainted with many details of Lady Russell 's early life . /z/ is the greatest argument to prove it . All that know you are thereby forced to honor you , neither arc you to thank them , because they can not do otherwise . Madam , I am among that number , gladly and heartily I declare it , and I shall die in that number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . I beseech you , madam , to pardon this scribbling , and present your noble husband with my most affectionate service ; and I shall in my prayers present you both to God , begging of him daily to increase your piety to Him , and your love to each other . " Little is known of Lord Vaughan 's character and habits . The following letter to his lady from the same correspondent , evidently written in raillery , implies that he was of a dilatory disposition : " I beseech you not hereafter to hinder my Lord Vaughan from writing to me ; I am confident whatsoever excuse you make for him , he had a most eager desire to write this week . I know his lordship so well , that he can not delay to make returns of civility . If it had been his custom to defer and put off to the last hour , I might believe your ladyship ; but in this particular , I must beg your ladyship 's pardon . I was at Abscourt the last week , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses with great satisfaction and content . I think , madam , under favor , you were not so kind to my Lord Vaughan . " In the year 1665 , she became a mother ; but her /q/ babe lived only to be baptised , and she had no other children by Lord Vaughan . In the autumn of that year , while the plague was raging in London , she again resided with the Earl of Carberry 's family in Wales . A letter from her half-sister , Lady Percy , at this period , after expressing how much her company was desired by herself and the whole family , says , " I am glad for nobody 's sake , but Lady Frances Vaughan 's , that you are there ; til Wales for I am sure she is sensible of her happiness in enjoying you . " In 1667 , Lady Vaughan was a widow , living with her beloved and only sister , Lady Elizabeth Noel , at Tichfield in Hampshire ; which estate Lady Elizabeth , as the eldest daughter of Lord Southampton , inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Vaughan . It is not known precisely when her acquaintance with Mr Russell commenced . A letter from Lady Percy to Lady Vaughan , in 1667 , leaves no doubt that he had then manifested an attachment for her half-sister . She says , " For his concern , I can say nothing more than that he professes a great desire , which I do not at all doubt , he , and everybody else , has , to gain one who is so desirable in all respects . 3 ' Mr Russell was then only a younger brother , and Lady Vaughan was an heiress , without children by her first marriage . In a worldly point of view , the advantages of such a connexion were almost entirely on his side ; and this idea , accompanied by the diffidence which characterizes gen- /z/ uine love , made him slow to interpret the lady 's sentiments in his favor . But Lady Vaughan was her own mistress ; and matters of interest could not long keep two such hearts as theirs strangers to each other . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed herself Lady Vaughan , till Mr Russell , by the death of his elder brother , succeeded to a title , when she assumed that of Lady Russell . The birth of her eldest daughter , in 1674 , was followed by that of another daughter in 1676 ; and her domestic happiness seems to have been completed by the birth of a son , in November , 1G80 . In 1679 , she experienced a severe affliction in the loss of her beloved sister , Lady Elizabeth Noel . Devoted as Lady Russell was to her husband and children , her warm heart was not exclusive , even in these purest and happiest of human affections ; and in her letters , many years after , we find her recurring to the memory of this sister with peculiar fondness . " Her letters to her husband , from 1672 to a twelvemonth before his death , are written at distant intervals . During the fourteen happy years of their union they were little apart . Their only moments of separation seem to have been some visits of duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or during his elections for two successive parliaments ; some short absences in London , on private or political business ; and his attendance at Oxford during the only session of the parliament , so suddenly dismissed by Charles . /z/ u These letters are written with such a neglect of style , and often of grammar , as may disgust the admirers of well-turned periods , and they contain such frequent repetitions of homely tenderness , as may shock the sentimental readers of the present day . But they evince the enjoyment of a happiness , built on such rational foundations , and so truly appreciated by its possessors , as too seldom occurs in the history of the human heart . They are impressed too with the marks of a cheerful mind , a social spirit and every indication of a character prepared to enjoy the sunshine , or meet the storms of life . " Thus gifted , and thus situated , her tender and prophetic exhortations both to her lord and herself , to merit the continuance of such happiness , and to secure its perfect enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking than his entire and absolute confidence in her character , and attachment to her society . It was thus , surely , that intellectual beings of different sexes were intended by their great Creator to go through the world together ;  --  thus united , not only in hand and heart , but in principles , in intellect , in views , and in dispositions ;  --  each pursuing one common and noble end , their own improvement , and the happiness of those around them , by the different means appropriate to their sex and situation ;  - -  mutually correcting , sustaining , and strengthening each other ; undegraded by all practices of tyranny on the one part , and of deceit on the other ;  - -  each finding a candid but severe judge in the un- /z/ derstanding , and a warm and partial advocate in the heart of their companion ;  --  secure of a refuge from the vexations , the follies , the misunderstandings , and the evils of the world , in the arms of each other , and in the inestimable enjoyments of unlimited confidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the health , progress and amusements of the children , proves how much everything that concerned them occupied as well as interested their parents . Such details might be tedious to the reader , were it not consoling to trace the minute features of tenderness in characters , which afterward proved capable of the sternest exertion of human fortitude . " /z/ Sept. 23 , 1G72 . " If I w r ere more fortunate in my expression , I could do myself more right when I would own to my dearest Mr Russell what real and perfect happiness I enjoy , from that kindness he allows me every day to receive new marks of , such as , in spite of the knowledge I have of my own wants , deficiencies will not suffer me to mistrust I want his love , though I do merit to so desirable a blessing ; but , my best life , you that know so well how to love and to oblige , make my felicity entire , by believing my heart possessed with all the gratitude , honor , and passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or can be obliged to ; and this granted what have I to ask but a continuance ( if God see fit ) of these present enjoyments 1 if not , a submission , /q/ without murmur , to his most wise dispensations and unerring providence ; having a thankful heart for the years I have been so perfectly contented in : He knows best when we have had enough here ; what I most earnestly beg from his mercy is , that we both live so as , whichever goes first , the other may not sorrow as for one of whom they have no hope . Then let us cheerfully expect to be together to a good old age ; if not , let us not doubt but he will support us under what trial he will inflict upon them . These are necessary meditations sometimes , that we may not be surprised above our strength by a sudden accident , being unprepared . Excuse me if I dwell too long upon it ; it is from my opinion , that if we can be prepared for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present ; which I hope will be long ; though when we change , it will be for the better , I trust , through the merits of Christ . Let us daily pray it may be so , and then admit of no fears ; death is the extremest evil against nature , it is true ; let us overcome the immoderate fear of it , either to our friend or self , and then what light hearts may we live with ? But I am immoderate in the length of my discourse , and consider this is to be a letter . To take myself off , and alter the subject , I will tell you that the news came on Sunday night to the Duke of York , that he was a married man ; he was talking in the drawing room , when the French ambassador brought the letters in and told the news ; the Duke turned about and said , Then I am a married man .

" /z/ Feb. 10 , 1G75. 11 What reputation writing this may give me , the chamber being full of ladies , I know not , but I am sure to be ill in that heart ( to whose person I send this ) I dare not hazard ; and since he expects a letter from me , by neglect I shall make no omission , and without doubt the performance of it is a pleasanter thing than I have had sense of from the time w r e parted ; and all acts of obedience must be so to my dearest man , who , I trust in God , is well ; but ill entertained , I fear at Stratton , but what the good company repairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high that I desire to hope you do not lie in our old chamber , being afraid when I think you do .

My cousin Spencer has just come . The inclosed papers I copied from one Lord Allington gave me last night ; it is the King 's message to the House yesterday . This day the debate held till four o'clock ; and the result of it is , you have ordered a second address to thank his Majesty for taking into consideration your first , * and to desire he would , if he please , pursue what in that they desired ; and that they might not be wanting , they have added a clause ( if the King accepts of it ) to the money-bill , that gives him credit to use two hundred thousand of that money toward new alliances ; promising , if he do see cause to lay it out , to replace it him again . This , as Sir Hugh Cholmondelay says , is not pleasing at court : expectations were much higher . The Lords have not agreed with the Commons . The House was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alliance with Holland against France for the preservation of the Netherlands . The second was to the same purpose ; when it was presented , the 25th of May following , it produced a sharp reprimand from the French- loving monarch , for prescribing what alliances he was to make , and produced an adjournment of the House . /q/ way of agreeing , and the Speaker pressed it ; till , after three hours debate , he told them suddenly he had mistook the thing , that he knew the House nice upon money-matters , and the Lords had only a negative in money-concerns ; and this seemed an affirmative , so put it to the question ; but would not divide the House , though if they had , the ayes would have carried it , it is believed .

" On the 1 4th of March , 1678 , the House of Commons had resolved itself into a committee of the whole , to consider the state of the nation . Charles the Second had no legitimate children , and his brother James , Duke of York , the next heir to the crown , was a bigoted Catholic ; hence a large party wished to exclude him from the succession . The motion for the above-mentioned Committee was made by Lord Russell , in the following words : " I move that we may go into a committee of the whole * The house-steward . I- LADY ROB SB Lit . House , to consider of the sad ; iii1 deplorable condition wc arc in , and the apprehensions we are under of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider of some way to sac ourselves from ruin . " The Court made great exertions to resist these proceedings . The following letter from Lady Russell may have been to dissuade her Lord from making a motion so very offensive to the King and the Duke ; or perhaps it was some step of a still more decided nature , concerning which he took her advice . The note was preserved by him , and indorsed as being received while the House of Commons was sitting ; which seems to prove that it made some impression upon him : " My sister Allington being here tells me she overheard you tell her Lord last night that you would take notice of the business ( you know what I mean ) in the House : this alarms me , and I do earnestly beg of you to tell me truly if you have or mean to do it . If you do , I am most assured you will repent it . I beg once more to know the truth .

" I staid till I came from church , that I mio-ht , as late as I could , tell you all your concerns here are just as you left them . The young man as mad , winking at me , and striking with his drumstick whatever comes to his reach . If I had written before church , while my morning draught ! was in my head , this might have entertained you better ; but now those fumes are laid , I find my spirits more dull than usual , as I have more cause ; the much dearer and pleasanter part of my life being absent from me : I leave my Lord Russell to guess who that is. * * * * * " * * * I know nothing new since you went ; but I know , as certainly as I live , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover as ever woman was , and hope to be so one twelve years more ; happy still , and entirely yours , R. Russell . " Alas ! this hope was never to be realized ! Lord Russell was a friend to liberty , and made no secret of his opposition to the unrestrained prerogative of the King . He thought the people were right in being jealous of French influence , and of the ever restless intrigues of the Roman Catholics at that period . Charles the Second and his brother James were warmly attached to the French Court , from * Her infant son . /q/ which they had received much kindness during the administration of Cromwell ; and perhaps , in their inmost hearts they could never forgive the English nation for having ; beheaded their father . It was natural that the licentious Charles , so far as he cared for any religion , should prefer that , which by half an hour 's ceremony on his death-bed , offered to absolve all the errors of a most sinful life ; he was , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sentiments so distasteful to his subjects . The Duke of York , on the contrary , made no concealment of his bigoted attachment to the Church of Rome ; and when we reflect how hard that church struggled to regain its former despotic power , by means of its able and most effective instruments , the Jesuits , we can not be surprised at the universal alarm , which prevailed among the English Protestants . It has already been mentioned that Lord Russell zealously favored the bill to exclude James from succession to the throne . But Charles was obstinately bent upon supporting his brother 's claims ; and , what was still worse , the indolent monarch allowed him to possess great influence , which was generally exerted in favor of the most unjust and tyrannical measures . Waller remarked that " Charles , in spite to the parliament , who had determined the Duke should not succeed him , was resolved that he should reign even in his lifetime . " In this state of things , discontent was universal : and there seemed to be no redress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by strong and determined resistance . A council of six was formed to consult upon what measures were necessary to be taken to check the despotic proceedings of Charles and his brother . " This council consisted of the Duke of Monmouth ( the King 's natural son ) Lord Russell  - -  Lord Essex  --  Lord Howard  --  Algernon Sidney , son of the Earl of Leicester  --  and John Hambden , grandson of the great parliamentary leader . The members of this council differed extremely in their views . Sidney was passionate for a republic . Essex had embraced the same project . Monmouth entertained hopes of obtaining the crown for himself . Russell and Hambden were much attached to the ancient constitution , and intended only the exclusion of the Duke of York , and the redress of grievances . " But it unfortunately happened that while these gentlemen were concerting schemes to restrain the abuse of kingly power , an inferior , and more violent order of malcontents , among whom were some of the old officers of Cromwell 's army , were holding meetings , in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the familiar appellation of lopping . Lord Shaftesbury , a rash man , whom the disaffected were in the habi of regarding as their leader , employed these men a ; his tools , unknown to Russell and his friends ; it seems , indeed , that Lord Shaftesbury formed the only link between two plots totally dissimilar ir their characters , and in the motives which originat - /q/ ed them . Lord Russell accompanied the Duke of Monmouth and Lord Grey one evening to the house of a wine-merchant , in whom they confided ; they expected to meet Lord Shaftesbury and some of their friends ; but finding no one , except two of the desperate characters above-mentioned , they were displeased with the company , and entered into no conversation ; Lord Russell merely stopped to taste some wines he wished to purchase , and they departed . The designs of these violent men were betrayed by the treachery of one of their confidants . Lord Shaftesbury , the only one who had countenanced them , went into Holland , where he died . The virtuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes of blood ; but the brief interview with Lord Shaftesbury 's creatures , at the wine-merchant 's , proved of fatal consequence to him . These men became witnesses against him ; but for that circumstance , he might have escaped the utmost malice of the crown , as did his friend Hambden . Being in the company of these conspirators was construed into a proof of knowing and sharing all their designs . Lord Russell was arrested ; and the seizure of his associates soon followed . The dastardly and unprincipled Lord Howard confessed all he knew , in order to save his own miserable life . It was proved that Lord Russell , Essex , Hambden , &,c,; intended resistance to the government , in some form or other , at some indefinite time . All , who from fear , or the love of reward , were friends to the Duke of York , were /z/ anxious to represent the two plots as one and the same ; hence Lord Russell and his friends were charged with projected insurrection and intent to take the king 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father came very near ensnaring him by that insidious policy , which always characterized his dealings with mankind. * Sidney was beheaded ; rejoicing to the last that he died in " the good old cause of republicanism . " Lord Howard was the only evidence against Hambden , and the statute required two witnesses : the crown-lawyers were therefore unable to make out a case of high-treason ; but they managed to obtain a sentence against him for misdemeanor , and fined him the enormous sum of forty thousand pounds . Lord Essex was at his house in the country , when he heard that his friend Lord Russell was arrested . He made no attempt to escape ; and when it was urged upon him , he replied that he would not do it , lest his flight should be construed into an evidence of guilt , and thus do an injury to Lord Russell 's cause ; " My own life is not worth saving , " said he , " if by so doing , I bring his into danger . " * The king had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to conceal her hushand in her own apartment , which he sacredly promised should not be searched . The Duke being informed of this , said , " I will not trust him . " The event proved that his suspicions were right ; for the apartment of the Duchess first place searched . /z/ He was committed to the Tower ; and on the very morning of Lord Russell 's trial he was found with his throat cut , said to be done by his own hand ; a circumstance of which the court made great use to the prejudice of Lord Russell . Even Hume , whose feelings are always on the tory side , acknowledges that a most unjustifiable use was made of this incident . Considering the tenderness Lord Essex had expressed toward Lord Russell 's cause , suspicions very naturally arose that he did not die by his own hand . The King and the Duke of York had made a visit to the Tower that morning , under pretence of inspecting the ordnance . Two children , a boy and girl , from ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his window , and affirmed , that they saw a hand throw out a bloody razor . The boy afterward contradicted his statement , in open court ; but his father had an office in the custom-house , of which the King could deprive him . The girl always stood firmly to her story . On the other hand , it was said that Lord Essex was subject to very deep fits of melancholy ; that he had been heard to vindicate suicide ; that among other things , which he had ordered to be sent from his house , he had called for a penknife and a razor J and the surgeons declared that his throat was cut in such a manner that he must have done it himself . The real truth can never be known in this world ; and historians and readers will judge of the transaction according to their opinions of the Duke of York . From the manner in which Lord Russell was /z/ taken up , it seemed as if the Court , always crooked and cowardly in its proceedings , were willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before Lord Russell was arrested , a messenger was observed many hours waiting near his door  --  " A measure that was taken in so open and careless a manner ( the back door of his house not being watched ) as led to the suspicion that it was intended to frighten him away . " Had Lord Russell fallen into this snare , it would have saved them from the odium of his death , and would have given them a fine opportunity to blacken his character . But he , conscious of no other political opinions than those which he had long and openly avowed in parliament  --  refused to avail himself of this insidious measure ; and his " faithful , obedient , and most affectionate wife " was tempted by no unworthy weakness to advise him to a course of conduct inconsistent with his innocence and honor . Lord Russell would not attempt to leave the house while the messenger from the council was pacing before his door , although he was ignorant of what , and by whom , he was accused . His lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what anxiety the task was performed , we can well imagine . Lord Russell was so well aware of the virulence of his enemies , that from the moment of his arrest , he began to prepare his mind for death . But this conviction occasioned no despondency in him , nor did it prevent her from using every honorable endeavor to save his precious /q/ life . During the fortnight that elapsed between his commitment to the tower , and his trial , she was diligently employed in procuring information as to what was likely to be urged against him , and in adopting every measure of precaution . She accompanied him to Court on the day of his trial ; on which occasion , the crowd was so great , that the counsel complained of not having room to stand . When Lord Russell requested to have a person to take notes of the trial for him , the Chief Justice said , " Any of your servants shall assist you in writing anything you please . " To which Lord Russell replied . " My wife is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excellent daughter of the virtuous Southampton rose up and stood by his side . At this sight , a thrill of anguish ran through the crowded audience . Her father 's services , her husband 's unsuspected patriotism , the excellence of his private life , and their known domestic happiness , all combined to give her a peculiar claim upon public sympathy . It is much to be regretted that history does not inform us how she supported herself through that fatal dav , nor how she received the tidings f the death of Lord Essex , which was suddenly brought into court , and which she was aware would have a material influence on her husband 's destiny . We only know that she so commanded her feelings , as neither to disturb the court , nor distract the attention of her husband . Lord Russell was not mistaken in what he had to expect from the violence of his unprincipled en- /z/ emics . The lawyers , desirous of paying court to the royal brothers , resorted to subtle evasions . The prisoner 's strict adherence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted in plans of resistance to the king 's despotic measures ; false charges were artfully mixed up with true ones , and he was not allowed to point out the difference between them . At one time , he intended to make a full confession of all he had done and all he had thought ; but his counsel suggested that use might be made of his disclosures to endanger his friends ; and Lord Russell was not a man to save himself by sacrificing others . He therefore simply pleaded not guilty to any designs upon the king 's person , and threw himself upon the laws of his country , which no doubt would have saved him , if justice had been allowed to have its course . But even Lord Russell 's virtues were turned against him ; it being said that the great estimation in which he was held made him dangerous . The jury was picked out with great care , and consisted entirely of men strongly prejudiced in favor of the king and his brother . Some objections were made to this jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pemberton did not state the matter with sufficient eagerness against the noble prisoner , and he was soon after turned out of his office . Sergeant Jeffries , afterward the detestable Judge Jeffries , made an insolent speech full of fury and indecent invectives ; and in his address to the jury he turned the untimely fate of Essex into a proof of /q/ his consciousness of the conspiracy . This brutal wretch was soon after appointed Chief Justice , and afterward Lord Chancellor . His life was divided between drunken riots and judicial murders . His name ought to be handed down to the everlasting execration of posterity , in common with all other judges , English or American , who allow personal enmity , or political prejudice , to influence their decisions . There is but one crime equal to thus poisoning the fountain of justice ; and that was committed by the priest , who administered death to his enemy in the form of the holy sacrament . Lord Russell 's behavior during his trial was calm and dignified . He expected to die , and was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following extract from the London Gem for 1831 , is historicallv true in facts , though some /z/ of the . details are imagined . The editor maybe blamed , for inserting it in the midst of a well-au- /z/ thenticated biography ; but the heart becomes so painfully interested in the lovely and most excellent Lady Russell , that we are eager to supply the denciences of history , and to imagine just what she said , and how she looked , during those agonizing scenes , which would have broken her heart had not love been stronger than death . " At last , her task Avas finished : quietly she laid down her pen ; her eyes and her hand were weary , and her heart was sick almost unto death : she had heard the /z/ conviction , and the condemnation of her husband ; but not a sob not a sound had escaped her lips : she had come prepared to hear , and , with God 's help , to sustain the worst , without uttering a word that might agitate her beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she rose up to accompany him from court , every eye was turned toward them ; and several of the kind and compassionate wept aloud : but the Lady Russell was enabled to depart with the same sweet and modest self-possession ; still her husband 's nearest , dearest companion . When they reached his prison , she gave way to no wild and passionate bursts of grief ; but , repressing every murmur , she sat down , and began to discuss with him all and every possible means of honorably saving his life . He had a settled conviction that every exertion would be in vain , and secretly gave himself to prepare for inevitable death ; but , to please and satisfy her , he entered into all her plans ; at least consulted with her upon them ; and , at her request particularly , drew up a petition to the Duke of York ; which however proved utterly fruitless : the Duke of York being his determined and relentless enemy . " Still the Lady Russell was unwearied , and resolved that nothing should daunt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to plead at his feet for her husband 's life . " When she reached Whitehall , she could not choose but remember with what different feelings she had before ascended the staircase , and passed along the stately galleries of the beautiful palace . She thought of the first time she entered those walls ; she thought of her light heart , her girlish curiosity , when those around her , and she herself had been loved and weleomed /q/ visiters to the royal presence . Fearful that an audience might be refused her , if her name or errand were told before-hand to the King , she had come with a very private equipage , her servants wearing a plain livery . She had before requested one of the lords in waiting , to whom she was well known , and in whose noble and friendly spirit she could place full confidence , to give her an opportunity of seeing the king , and to announce her merely as a gentlewoman of condition , who had solicited an interview ; and she now besought him so earnestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chamber , where the king was then sitting , that , after some decided refusals , and much hesitation , he at last permitted her to follow him . In a few minutes she was left alone in that ante-chamber ; for it happened that a little page , who had been waiting there , was called away for a short time as she and Lord entered . " She soon distinguished the king 's voice from the room within , for its tones were loud and sonorous ; and the latch of the door , though pulled to , had not caught , so that the d3br stood partly open : ' Who is it would see us , did you say ? ' The Lady Russell drew near , and bent her ear that she might not lose a word .  --  A gentlewoman of condition has demanded a private interview with your majesty . ' " The words were hardly spoken when a light , yet loud laugh rung through the chamber , and a woman 's voice cried out , in tones of raillery , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be peril to the king 's heart in such an interview . ' Pshaw , pshaw , ' interrupted the king , half joining in the laugh , and speaking in a tone of heavy merriment : ' tell me this lady 's age ; is she young or old , for much depends /z/ on thai ? ' ' She is a young and noble matron , ' was tho quiet , grave reply . ' But how does she call herself ? ' was the continued inquiry , in the same jocular voice . ' She bade me say a gentlewoman of condition . ' ' Sir , ' said the king impatiently , ' no trifling , if you please !  --  What is the woman 's name ?  --  Do you know her name ? ' ' I can not tell your majesty an untruth , ' replied the nobleman ; ' I do know her name . ' ' Why then do you not declare it ! ' ' Because , sire , I was forbidden by the lady to do so , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman of honor , you may be bound to your gentlewoman of condition , and may keep silence as far as she is concerned ; but as I am also a party concerned , allow me to decline the favor of this interview with your gentlewoman of condition : I have seen mysterious affairs enough of late , and there may be danger in this interview . ' ' I would stake my life , sire , there is none , ' said the nobleman ; ' and I will go beyond my commission , and disclose a name unsullied and pure , and lovely to the ear , being made so by her who bears it : the blameless , but unhappy Lady Russell , is the gentlewoman that has sought an audience with your majesty . ' ' Oh ! I can not see her , ' cried the king , raising his voice ; ' I forbid you to admit her to my presence . Remember , sir , I am positive . Much as I pity the Lady Russell , I can not see her : why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Tell her this from me . ' ' Alas , sire , I dread to deliver so disheartening a message from your gracious majesty , she is already in so woful a plight . I know not what her hopes may be of urging her suit with success ; but I know she did hope to hear a refusal , if she must have one , given from no other lips than yours : even now she waits anxiously , fondly hoping that your majesty will /q/ see her . ' Here again the female veice was heard ; kind and almost coaxing were its tones :  --  ' Do see her  --  do admit her  --  poor unhappy lady ! my heart bleeds for her  --  you may be stern to men , but you would never let a woman beg in vain . ' ' It is to save a woman 's feelings , ' replied the king , in a softer voice than he had yet spoken : ' Do not urge me  --  you know that his life can not be spared  --  you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord , with the assurance of my regret . You said that she was waiting ,  --  where did you leave her ? ' ' She waits in the ante-room to this very chamber . ' ' So near , sirrah ! ' exclaimed the king ; ' thou hast taken a most unwarrantable liberty . ' ' She begged that I would let her follow me , ' said the nobleman ; ' and her importunity was so great and sudden , that she prevailed against my calmer judgment . ' ' Let there be no mistake continued in , ' cried the king , ' and weary me no longer with your explanations . Dismiss the lady instantly . ' " The Lady Russell had heard all that had been spoken ; had hung breathless on every word ; and her heart had sunk within her , when she found how firmly the king seemed opposed to showing any mercy to her husband . She had blessed the woman , whose voice pleaded so kindly for her , though she guessed , and guessed rightly , that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portsmouth . " She heard the receding steps of the lord in waiting , and felt that in another moment her opportunity would be gone . She did not stop to think or hesitate , but threw open the door , and advanced quietly and meekly to the very centre of the chamber . " The room , which Lady Russell entered , wag of /z/ large dimensions , and furnished rather with splendid luxuriousncss than elegance . The windows opened into a balcony , filled with orange trees in full blossom , and the atmosphere of the chamber was richly scented with the delicious perfume of the flowers : the walis were hung alternately with some of Lely 's beautiful but wanton portraits , and with broad pier-glasses , and the profusion of gilding with which the sculptured frames and cornices , the tables , the couches and seats of various descriptions , were enriched , dazzled and fatigued the gaze . Upon and underneath one table , amid piles of music , lay several kinds of lutes and other musical instruments . On another , an ivory casket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunshine . Before a broad slab of the richest green marble , opposite one of the looking-glasses , sat Louise de Querouaille , on a low ottoman . She had been reading aloud to the idle monarch , and her book ,  --  a loose French romance ,  --  lay upon the table , the place kept open by a bracelet of large pearls . Very near her the king was carelessly reclining upon a sofa covered with cushions of Genoa velvet : his attention had been divided between listening to the French romance , and listlessly looking over a collection of Oliver 's exquisitely painted miniatures , some of which lay on the sofa beside him , others on the marble table . Into this chamber a pure and modest matron had entered , to plead for the life of one of the most noble and upright gentlemen of the land ; had she much chance of success with such a ruler ? ' I am prepared , ' said the Lady Russell , as she kneeled before the king , ' to hear , though not to brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncalled into your presence is an intrusion , an impertinence , which the king may not per- /z/ chance forgive ; but I make my appeal not to the king , but to the genteman before whom I kneel . ' Charles , who had sat astonished rather than angry at the unexpected appearance of the lady , rose up at these words , and , tenderly raising her , led her to a seat with that gallant courteousness in which he was excelled by no one in his day . ' My boldness is very great , ' she continued ; ' but grief makes me forget all difference of station : I am alive only to the power conferred your majesty 's high station by the Almighty and most merciful of kings . Forgive a wife , once a very happy wife , if she implores you to use that power in its most blessed exercise of mercy . Think that on the breath of your lips it depends whether the whole future course of a life , long so supremely happy , shall be gloom and wretchedness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part as to plead only for my own happiness . Do justice to an upright , honest subject ; or if you deem him faulty , ( and who is not ? ) do not visit a fault with that dreadful doom that you would give to wickedness and crime . Nay , for yourself , for your own good interest , do not let them rob you of a servant whose fellow may not easily be found , one who shall serve your majesty with more true faithfulness than many that have been more forward in their words . ' " The king listened with attention , with well-bred and courteous attention : and then expressed , with soft and well-bred excuses , his deep regret that it was impossible , beyond his power , as one bound to consider the welfare of the state , to accede to her entreaties : and as he spoke , the Lady Russell could not help contrasting the artful softness of his voice and # manner with the rough , but far more honest , refusal she had heard when waiting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Russell , who had continued seated all the time she spoke , and who had spoken with modest and reverent dignity of manner , still sat calm , sad , and motionless , perplexed and silenced by his cold , easy self-possession. " * There is then no hope ? ' she at length exclaimed . The monarch met the melancholy gaze of her soft eyes , as she asked the hopeless question , and the few words in which he replied were intended to destroy all hope ; yet they were spoken in the same smooth , courteous tone . " She rose up , but she did not go ; still she remained standing where she rose up , calm , bewildered , her lips unclosed , her eyes cast down , as if unwilling to depart , yet too stupefied by grief and disappointment to know what to say ; too abashed , indeed , by his polite indifference to know how to act . At last she roused herself ; and as she lifted up her head , a clearness and brightness came into her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenance . ' I must not , will not go abashed and confounded , ' she thought within herself ; ' I must not lose this last , this very last opportunity , I can ever have of saving him . ' ' Bear with my importunity , ' she said , with a feminine sweetness , which , notwithstanding the deep dejection that hung on every look and every word , was inexpressibly fascinating ; ' bear with me , and do not bid me rise , till I have been heard : ' and she again threw herself at the feet of the king . ' At least let me speak in my own name , let me urge my own claims to your gracious mercy . As the daughter of Thomas Wriothesley , your longtried servant , your royal father 's faithful and favored friend , I humbly ask for pity and for mercy ; forget not your friend and your father 's friend . Alas , sire , you are not one to whom affliction is unknown ; your heait /q/ is not hardened , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine are likely to be very soon . You have known , ' she added , raising her clasped hands , and her meek and innocent face , over which the tears flowed fast ; ' you have known one , whose loved and honored head was cruelly laid low ; you have seen something of what a widow and a mother suffers in such a desolate estate as mine will be , I fear , too soon . No , no ! you do not misunderstand me  --  you know well of whom I speak . Imagine what your royal mother would have felt , had she kneeled , as I do now , to one who could have saved the life of her beloved and noble husband ; and pity  --  pray , pray , pity me ! What not one word  --  one kind , pitying word ! ' She turned her eyes , as one who looks for help on either side ; and her glance fell upon the frail , but kind-hearted Louise de Querouaille , who sat weeping and sobbing with unaffected feeling . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ;  --  ' Madam , ' she said entreatingly , ' they say you have much influence with the king : I am sure you have a kind heart ; come and beg that for pity 's sake he will hear me . ' The Duchess of Portsmouth did not refuse  --  she came forward . Jast then a side-door was gently opened , and the Duke of York entered the apartment . He stopped , and stared at all present with a look of apparent astonishment : for a moment his eye met that of the king ; but he said not a word , walked to the farther end of the room , laid on the table a packet of papers , which he carried in his hand , and seemed to occupy himself busily with them . The Lady Russell felt , that if ever there had been a hope of success for her , there was now none . The king was still as courteous , and as smooth in speech , as before , though a little more commanding in his manner . The /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and kneeling in her tears before the king 1 , she implored for Lord Russell 's pardon ; and she herself , the wretched , heart-stricken wife redoubled her entreaties ; nay , at last she ceased to ask for pardon , ( seeing that her prayer was utterly in vain ) and begged but for a respite of six weeks for her condemned husband . She turned to the Duke of York :  --  coldly and civilly he begged to decline offering any interference . The only words he spoke were those by which he replied to the Lady Russell ; and he would have seemed to her entirely occupied with his papers , had she not once or twice observed his eye fixed with a calm and penetrating glance upon his royal brother . At last , the king grew weary ; his dark brow lowered heavily , and his strongly marked and saturnine features assumed an expression not commonly harsh and unpleasant  --  ' What ! ' said he angrily , and almost brutally , ' shall I grant that man six weeks , who. if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me six hours ! ' " The poor , insulted lady spoke not another word of intreaty . She arose at once , and with a grave , meek sorrow , at once dignified and sweetly humble , she departed . The Lady Russell went forth from the palace , convinced in her own mind that her husband 's life would not be spared ; and more at peace than she had been for many days , she could scarcely understand how with such a settled conviction she could be calm . But she began to see the gracious design of him to whom she prayed so constantly , to prepare her for her heaviest trial by the strong supports and consolations of his grace . She entered her husband 's cell , with a firm step and an untroubled countenance , and told him /q/ herself , and at once , with a voice that faltered only when she began to speak , that according to his expectation , her errand to Whitehall had been utterly useless . " All other possible measures were used to save Lord Russell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duchess of Portsmouth the enormous sum of one hundred thousand pounds , if she would procure his pardon ; but notwithstanding her notorious love of money , she either did not dare to move in the case , or her exertions were rendered unavailing by some influence even stronger than hers . Lord Cavendish , a talented , high-spirited , though dissipated nobleman , was , both personally and politically , a warm friend to Lord Russell . He generously offered to manage his escape , and to stay in prison for him , while he should go away in his clothes ; but Lord Russell would not listen to such a proposition . The Duke of Monmouth likewise sent word , that if it would do him any service , he would come in and run fortunes with him ; Lord Russell replied that it could be no advantage to him to have his friends die with him . Oldmixon informs us that Lord Cavendish likewise proposed that a chosen party of horse should attack the guard as the coach passed , on the way to the place of execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party did the same on /z/ the Old Bailey-side , to lake Lord Russell out , and mounting him on a horse , make off with him ; a design which the people would have most cordially facilitated . But Lord Russell would by no means consent that his friends should risk their lives to save his . He had submitted his case to the decision of the laws , and he was resolved to abide the penalty . Doctors Burnet and Tillotson , in hopes of saving his life , tried to prevail upon him to acknowledge to the king that subjects had , in no case whatever , a right to resist the throne . Lord Russell replied , " Upon such an hypothesis I see no difference between our government and the Turkish . I can have no conceptions of a limited monarchy , which has not a right to defend its own limitations ; and my conscience will not permit me to say otherwise to the king . " His heroic wife approved of this answer . She never wished to save his life by any base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which he was persecuted ; she shared in his steady adherence to his principles , as she shared in his sufferings for them . All the concession she had ever asked him to make , was to write to the Duke of York , promising if his life were spared , to live beyond sea , and never again mingle with English politics ; he took the step to satisfy her , though he himself had no hope . The Marquis de Rouvigny , the maternal uncle of Lady Russell , had a good deal of influence with Louis the Fourteenth , and it is said that he prevailed upon /q/ that monarch to write a letter to Charles the Second , in favor of Lord Russell . When Charles heard that Rouvigny was coming over with this letter , he said , " I can not prevent the Marquis from coming here ; but Lord Russell 's head shall be struck off before he arrives . " Doctor Burnet was with Lord Russell every day in prison , and accompanied him to the scaffold ; and he has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of his life . He says : " All the while he expressed a very Christian temper , without sharpness or resentment , vanity or affectation . His whole behaviour looked like a triumph over death . Upon some occasions , as at table , or when his friends came to see him , he was decently cheerful . I was by him when the sheriffs came to show him the warrant for his execution . He read it with indifference ; and when they were gone , he told me , it was not decent to be merry with such a matter , otherwise he was near tellino- Rich , ( who though he was now of the other side , yet had been a member of the House of Commons , and had voted for the exclusion of the Duke of York ) that they should never sit together in the House any more to vote for the Bill of Exclusion . The day before his death he fell a bleeding at the nose : upon that he said to me pleasantly , ' I shall not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . ' At night it rained hard ; and he said , /z/ the sins of his youth lay heavy upon his mind : but ho hoped God had forgiven them , for he was sure he had forsaken them , and for many years he had walked before God with a sincere heart : if in his public actings he had committed errors , they were only the errors of his understanding ; for he had no private ends nor ill designs of his own in them : he was still of opinion that the King was limited by law , and that , when he broke through those limits , his subjects might defend themselves , and restrain him : he thought a violent death was a very desirable way of ending one 's life : it was only the being exposed to be a little gazed at , and to suffer the pain of one minute , which he was confident , was not equal to the pain of drawing a tooth . He said he felt none of those transports that some good people felt ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no palpitation of heart , nor trembling at the thoughts of death . He was much concerned at the cloud that seemed to be now over his country ; but he hoped his death would do more service than his life could have done . He thought it was necessary for him to leave a paper behind him at his death ; and because he had not been accustomed to draw such papers , he desired me to give him a scheme of the heads fit to be spoken to , and of the order in which they should be laid ; which I did . And he was for three days employed for some time in the morning to write out his speech . He ordered four copies to be made of it , all which he signed ; and gave the original with three of the /q/ copies to his lady , and kept the other to give to the sheriffs on the scaffold . He writ it with great care : and the passages that were tender he writ in papers apart , and showed them to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out fair . He was very easy when this was ended . He also writ a letter to the king , in which he asked pardon for everything he had said and done contrary to his duty , protesting he was innocent as to all designs against his person and government , and that his heart was ever devoted to that , which he thought was his true interest . He added , that though he thought he had met with hard measure , yet he forgave all concerned in it , from the highest to the lowest ; and ended , hoping that his majesty 's displeasure at him would cease with his own life , and that no part of it should fall on his wife and children . " On the Tuesday before Lord Russell 's execution , after dinner , when his lady was gone , he expressed great joy in the magnanimity of spirit he saw in her , and said the parting with her was the hardest thing he had to do , for he said she would hardly be able to bear it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it in some measure supported her ; but when that would be over , he feared the quickness of her spirits would work all within her . On Thursday , while my lady was gone to try to gain a respite till Monday , * he said , he wished she would give over beating every bush , and running so about for his preservation ; but when /z/ he considered that it would be some mitigation of her sorrow , that we left nothing undone that could have given any probable hopes , he acquiesced ; and , indeed , I never saw his heart so near failing him as when he spake of her ; sometimes I saw a tear in his eye , and he would turn about , and presently change the discourse . " The day before his death , he received the sacrament from Tillotson with much devotion . And I preached two short sermons to him , which he heard with great affection . And we were shut up until toward evening . Then Lady Russell brought him his little children that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained his constancy of temper , though he was a very fond father . Some few of his friends likewise came to bid him farewell . He spoke to his children in a way suited to their age , and with a good measure of cheerfulness , and took leave of his friends in a calm manner as surprised them all . Lady Russell returned alone in the evening . At eleven o'clock she left him ; he kissed her four or five times , and she kept her sorrow so within herself , that she gave him no disturbance by their parting . As soon as she was gone , he said to me , ' Now the bitterness of death is past ; ' for he loved and esteemed her beyond expression , as she well deserved it in all respects . He ran out into a long discourse concerning her  - -  how great a blessing she had been to him  --  and said , what a misery it would have been to him if she had not had that magnanimity of spirit , joined /q/ to her tenderness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for the saving of his life . He said there was a signal providence of God in giving him such a wife , where there was birth , fortune , great understanding , great religion , and great kindness to him ; but her carriage in this extremity was beyond all . He was glad she and her children were to lose nothing by his death ; and it was a great comfort to him that he left his children in such a mother 's hands , and that she had promised him to take care of herself for their sakes ; which I heard her do . " He went into his chamber about midnight : and I staid all night in the outer room . He went not to bed till about two in the morning : and was fast asleep till four , when , according to his order , we called him . He was quickly dressed , but would lose no time in shaving : for he said he was not concerned in his good looks that day . He went into his chamber six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and then came out to Tillotson and me : he drunk a little tea and some sherry . He wound up his watch , and said , ' Now I have done with time , and am going to eternity . ' He asked me what he should give the executioner ; I told him ten guineas : he said with a smile , it was a pretty thing to give a fee to have his own head cut off . When the sheriffs called him about ten o'clock , Lord Cavendish was waiting below to take leave of him . They embraced very tenderly . Lord Russell , after he had left him , upon a sudden /z/ thought came back to him , and pressed him earnestly to apply himself more to religion ; and told him what great comfort and support he felt from it now in his extremity . " Tillotson and I went in the coach with him to the place of execution . Some of the crowd that filled the streets wept , while others insulted : he was touched with a tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all provoked by the other . In passing , he looked toward Southampton-House ; the tear started in his eye , but he instantly wiped it away . He was singing psalms a great part of the way ; and said , lie hoped to sing better very soon . Observing the great crowds of people , he said , ' I hope I shall soon see a much better assembly . ' When he came to the scaffold , he walked about it four or five times . Then he turned to the sheriff and delivered his paper . He protested he had always been far from any designs against the king 's life , or government : he prayed God would preserve both , and the protestant religion . He wished all protestants might love one another , and not make way for popery by their animosities . After he had delivered the papers he prayed by himself : then Tillotson prayed with him . After that he prayed again by himself , and then undressed himself , and laid his head on the block , without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at two strokes . " Of Lady Russell we know nothing during this melancholy scene . But who can not imagine her /q/ feelings , till the heart aches with the painfulness of sympathy ? While there was anything to do for him  --  while there was a shadow of hope  --  there was something to support her fortitude ; but when ahe had looked on him for the last time  --  when she returned to her desolate home , where she was never more to welcome him ,  --  there to count the wretched minutes that should elapse before the fatal stroke was given  --  Oh God ! what but thine infinite mercy could have supported her through that mortal agony ! Lord Russell was beheaded on Saturday , July 21st , 1683 . He died as he had lived : the firm friend of truth , of the Protestant religion , and of the liberties of his country . His firmness in refusing to make any retraction of sentiments , which his conscience approved , is the strongest evidence of that integrity and virtue , which gave him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecrated his name to posterity . In private life he was unexceptionable . His benevolence never kept pace with his income ; and the greatest satisfaction he took in the prospect of inheriting large estates was , that they would increase his power of doing good .  --  He was not beheaded on Tower-Hill , ( the common place of execution for men of high rank ) but in Lincoln's-inn-fields , in order that the populace might be humbled by the sight of their favorite leader carried through the city , to the place of execution . This plan , like most others of a similar kind , produced an effect totally different /z/ from what was intended . Perhaps the death of Lord Russell , followed by that of his friend Sidney , tended more than any other single event , to bring about the Revolution , which not Ions after forever freed England from the Insupportable tyranny of the Si iiuiis . Oldmixon informs us that the Duke of York descended so low in his revenge , as to desire that this innocent nobleman might be executed before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not consent to . " The substance of the paper Lord Russell gave the sheriff , was , first a profession of his religion , and of his sincerity in it : that he was of the church of England ; but wished all would unite together against the common enemy : that churchmen would be less severe , and dissenters less scrupulous . He owned he had a great deal against popery , which he looked on as an idolatrous and bloody religion : but that , though he was at all times ready to venture his life for his religion or his country , yet that would never have carried him to a black or wicked design . No man ever had the impudence to move to him anything with relation to the king 's life ; he prayed heartily for him that in his person and government he might be happy both in this world and the next . He owned he had been earnest in the matter of the exclusion , as the best way in his opinion to secure both the king 's life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present sufferings : but he forgave all concerned in them ; and charged /z/ his friends not to think of revenge . He thought his sentence was hard : killing by forms of law was the worst sort of murder . " At the close , he says , " Since my sentence , I have had few thoughts but preparatory ones for death ; yet the importunity of my friends , and particularly the best and dearest wife in the world , prevailed with me to sign petitions for my life , to which I was ever averse ; for ( I thank God ) though in all respects I have lived the happiest and contentedest man in the world ( for now very near fourteen years ) yet I am so willing to leave all , that it was not without difficulty that I did anything for the saving of my life , that was begging ; but I was willing to let my friends see what power they had over me , and that I was not obstinate nor sullen , but would do anything that an honest man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive that swayed or had any weight with me . " And now to sum up all , as I had not any design against the king 's life , or the life of any man whatsoever , so I never was in any contrivance of altering the government . What the heats , passions , and vanities of other men have occasioned , I ought not to be responsible for , nor could I help them , though I now suffer for them . But the will of the Lord be done , into whose hands I commend my spirit ! and trust that Thou , O most merciful Father , hast forgiven all my transgressions , the sins of my youth , and all the errors of my past life , and that Thou wilt not lay my secret sins and ignorances to my charge , but will graciously support me /z/ during that Bmall time of life now before me , and assist me in my last moments , and not leave me then to be disordered by fear , or any oilier temptations , but make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art my sun and my shield , and as thou BUpportest me hy th grace , so I hope thou wilt hereafter crown me with glory , and receive me into the fellowship of iiiil'Hs and saints , in that blessed inheritance purcha sed for me by my most merciful Redeemer , who is , I trust , at thy right hand , preparing a place for me , and is ready to receive me ; into whose hands 1 commend my spirit ! " The speech of Lord Russell to the sheriffs , and the paper he delivered to them at the place of execution are still preserved at Woburn-Abbey , in letters of gold . The speech was so soon printed , that it was selling ; about the streets an hour after Lord Russell 's death . The King and the Duke of York were extremely angry . Doctor Burnet was accused of advising and assisting ; in it , and was called before the kino ; to answer for himself . At the command of the monarch , he read to him a journal containing a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell , which he had written at the request of Lady Russell . The light in which this presented the nobleminded victim was quite as displeasing to the Court as the paper delivered to the sheriffs had been ; and Doctor Burnet was universally considered as a ruined man . Lady Russell , in these first days of her despondency /q/ was aroused to address a letter to the king , to repel the attack made upon her husband 's memory , by thus denying the authenticity of the papers he left . In this letter she does full justice to Doctor Burnet 's conduct and sentiments . /z/ Indorsed by her , " My letter to the King a few days after my dear Lord 's death . " " May it please your Majesty ,  --  I find my husband 's enemies are not appeased with his blood , but still continue to misrepresent him to your Majesty . ' T is a great addition to my sorrows , to hear your Majesty is prevailed upon to believe , that the paper he delivered to the sheriffs at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and am ready in the solemnest manner to attest that I often heard him discourse the chiefest matters contained in that paper , in the same expressions he therein uses , as some of those few relations that were admitted to him , can likewise aver . And sure ' t is an argument of no great force , that there is a phrase or two in it another uses , when nothing is more common than to take up such words as we like , or are accustomed to in our conversation . I beg leave farther to avow to your Majesty , that all that is set down in the paper read to your Majesty on Sunday night , * to be spoken in my presence , is exactly true ; as I doubt not but the rest of the paper is , which was written at my request , and the author of it in all his conversation with my husband , that I was privy to , showed him- /z/ self a loyal subject to your Majesty , a faithful friend to him , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do therefore humbly beg your Majesty would be so charitable to believe , that he who in all his life was observed to act with the greatest clearness and sincerity , would not at the point of death do so disingenuous and false a thing as to deliver for his own , what was not properly and expressly so . And if , after the loss in such a manner of the best husband in the world , I were capable of any consolation , your Majesty only could afford it by having better thoughts of him , which when I was so importunate to speak with your Majesty , J thought I had some reason to believe I should have inclined you to , not from the credit of my word , but upon the evidence of what I had to say . I hope I have written nothing in this that will displease your Majesty .

Who am with all humility , May it please your Majesty , " &c.; Not long after this , Doctor Burnet was discharged from preaching the Thursday lecture at St Clement 's , for a sermon on the words  --  " Save me /q/ from the lion 's mouth , thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns : " This was thought of dangerous construction , because the lion and unicorn supported the king 's escutcheon ; so timid a thing is tyranny ! He was soon after dismissed from being preacher of the Rolls . On the accession of James the Second , he deemed it safe to leave England ; during his reign he resided in Holland , enjoying the friendship and confidence of the Prince and Princess of Orange , who afterward came to the English throne . Violent pamphlets against Lord Russell , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom plenty may be found in every age and country , always ready to bow down and worship the reigning powers . But although Lady Russell 's gentle heart was almost crushed under its weight of misery , she w T as ever a faithful guardian of her husband 's fame ; and we find her using the utmost diligence to have all false charges publicly refuted . The course of public events assisted her affectionate endeavors to transmit his name to posterity in unclouded lustre . During a temporary reconciliation between Charles and his son , Duke of Monmouth , the Duke solemnly averred that all Lord Russell had stated was strictly true , and that in losing him , the king lost the best subject he ever had . Other circumstances tended to prove that pretended plots had been fabricated , and that even what was true had been much exaggerated . In consequence of these things , Charles is said to have expressed some regret at the severe measures that had been taken . /z/ In one point of view it must have been a great consolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully proved , and so universally believed ; but in another point of view , it must have aggravated her " raging sorrow , " to feel that had he but lived a little longer , he might have , avoided the dreadful fate , which cut him off in the strength of his days . Her own pathetic letters will best express the deep and abiding sorrow of this meekly-resigned , and most celestial woman . /z/ Wo burn - Abbey , Sept. 30 , 1633 . Jlbout two months after Lord Russell 's death. c I need not tell you , good doctor , how little capable I have been of such an exercise as this . You will soon find how unfit I am still for it , since my yet disordered thoughts can offer me no other than such words as express the deepest sorrow , and confused as my yet amazed mind is . But such men as you , and particularly one so much my friend , will , I know , bear with my weakness , and compassionate my distress , as you have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I endeavor to make the best use I can of both ; but I am so evil and unworthy a creature , that though I have desires , yet I have no dispositions , or worthiness toward receiving comfort .

I know it is common with others to lose a friend ; but to have lived with such a one , it may be questioned how few can glory in the like happiness , so consequently lament the like loss . Who can but shrink from such a blow , till by the mighty aids of his Holy Spirit , we will let the gift of God , which he hath put into our hearts , interpose ? That reason which sets a measure to our souls in prosperity , will then suggest many things which we have seen and heard , to moderate us in such sad circumstances as mine .

I want him to talk with , to walk with , to eat and sleep with ; all these things are irksome to me now ; the day unwelcome , and the night so too ; all company and meals I would avoid , if it might be ; yet all this is that I enjoy not the world in my own way , and this sure hinders my comfort ; when I see my children before me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this makes my heart shrink .

By the condemnation of Lord Russell for treason , the trust of Lady Elizabeth Noel 's children devolved upon the King . In a letter concerning the resettlement of her sister 's trust , Mr Hoskins says  --  " I can not but very much approve the great care you have of my Lady Elizabeth Noel 's children , answerable to your near relation and great friendship .

" The " obligation " of going to Stratton was delayed by the sickness and death of the heart-stricken mother of Lord Russell , * the Countess of Bedford , who died at Woburn , on the 16th of May , and after the performance of the melancholy duties attendant upon this event it was again postponed on account of the illness of her little son . After the recovery of the child , she indulged herself in visiting the tomb , which contained the remains of her husband , at Chenies in Buckinghamshire . At this period , she thus writes to Doctor Fitzwilliam . Woburn- Abbey , June , 16C4. ***** " God has been pitiful to my small grace , and removed a threatened blow , which must have quickened my sorrows , if not added to them  --  the loss of my poor boy .

When I have done this piece of duty to my best friend and them , how gladly would I lie down by that beloved dust I lately went to visit , ( that is , the case that holds it . ) It is a satisfaction to me you did not disprove of what I did in it , as some do that it seems have heard of it , though I never mentioned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I went not to seek the living among the dead ; I knew I should not see him any more , wherever I went ; and I had made a covenant with myself not to break out in unreasonable , fruitless passion , but quicken my contemplation whither the nobler part was fled , to a country afar off , where no earthly power bears any sway , nor can put an end to a happy society ; there I would willingly be , but we must not limit our time ; I hope to wait without impatiency . As for the information you require , it is not in my power to be punctual .

" ***** /z/ Instead of her intended journey to Stratton , Lady Russell removed from Woburn , the latter part of June , to Totteridge in Hertfordshire , for a change of air for her boy , and to be nearer the London physicians . She carried her elder daughter with her , leaving the younger at Woburn , with her grandfather .

" ****** /z/ A project of going to Stratton in September was again put off by the proposed removal of the Court to Winchester , where Charles occasionally resided in autumn , for the convenience of field-sports . The near neighborhood of Stratton would have made a residence there , at such a time , peculiarly unpleasant to the widowed Lady Russell . In September , she returned to Woburn-Abbey ; and /q/ soon after , she writes to Doctor Fitzwilliam , " I have resolved to try that desolate habitation of mine at London this winter . The doctor agrees it is the best place for my boy ; and I have no argument to balance that ; nor could I take the resolution to see London till that was urged : but , by God 's permission , I will see how I can endure that place , in thought a place of terror to me ; but I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few days . As soon as I had formed , or rather submitted to this advice , I hastened hither upon it , that Lord Bedford might have some weeks ' comfort in the child before I took him from him .

" I have , you find , sir , lingered out mv time ; and I think none will wonder at it , that will reflect the place I am going to remove to , was the scene of so much lasting sorrow to me , and where I acted so unsuccessful a part for the preservation of a life , I could have laid down mine to have continued . ' T was , Doctor , an inestimable treasure I did lose , and with whom I had lived in the highest pitch of this world 's felicity . But having so many months mourned the substance , I think ( by God 's assistance ) the shadow will not sink me . " The death of Charles , the accession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James the Second , the new rebellion of Monmouth , his failure and final execution , were events that must have been painfully interesting to Lady Russell ; whose /z/ susceptible heart had from time to time been wounded by the execution of her husband 's friends , and the fines levied upon all who attempted to justify his memory . She thus writes to Doctor Fitzwilliam . Soutliampton-House . July 17 , 1685. * * * " Never could you have more seasonably fed me with such discourses , than in these my miserable months , and in those this very week in which I have lived over again that fatal day that determined what fell out a week after , and that has given me so long and so bitter a time of sorrow .

But I must follow that which seems to be the will of God , how unacceptable soever it may be to me. " * * * The following reflections , which she makes upon Monmouth 's insurrection , no doubt give a faithful view of her husband 's character , and of the circumstances in which he was involved . " I take this late wild attempt to be a new project , not depending on , or linked in the least to , any former design ; if there was any real one , which I am satisfied was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) talk , and it is possible that talk going so far as to consider if a remedy to supposed evils might * Of her sister , the Lady Elizabeth Noel . // I " sought , how it could bo found .

So that from deceitfulness of the heart , or want of true sight in the directive faculty , what would have followed , God only knows . From the frailty of the will I should have feared but little evil ; for he had so just a soul , so firm , so good , he could not warp from such principles that were so , unless misguided by his understanding , and that his own , not another 's ; for I dare say , as he could discern , he never went into anything considerable upon the mere submission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , he could never have framed to have thought well of the late actings , and therefore most probably must have set loose from them .

On the other hand , having , I trust , a reasonable ground of hope , he has found those mercies , that he died with a cheerful persuasion he should , there is no reason to mourn my loss , when that soul I loved so well , lives in felicities , and shall do so to all eternity . " The rapid strides of James the Second toward the subversion of the religion and constitution of England were not unmarked by Lady Russell . Her letters show that she took a strong interest in the political news of the day , though always with a /q/ reference to him whose memory she faithfully treasured in her heart . Speaking of the depraved times , she says , " The new scenes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper and reason , that I still shed tears of sorrow , and not of joy , that so good a man is safe landed on the happy shore of a blessed eternity . Doubtless he is at rest ; though I find none without him , so true a partner he was in all my joys and griefs . I trust the Almighty will pass by this my infirmity . I speak it in respect to the world , from whose enticing delights I can now be better weaned . I was too rich in possessions while I possessed him . All relish now is gone . * * * * * I endeavor to suppress all wild imaginations a melancholy fancy is apt to let in , and say , with the man in the gospel , ' I believe , help thou mine unbelief /z/ Lady Russell was detained in London much longer than she intended or wished . Her uncle , M. de Rouvigny , had come from Fiance to solicit James the Second for the removal of the attainder of Lord Russell from his children : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the young lady was unfortunately seized with the small-pox and died . Lady Russell at the earnest entreaties of her uncle , immediately conveyed her children to their grandfather 's , at Bedford-House , in the Strand , and afterward saw the little tribe safely lodged in Woburn-Abbey . She writes to Doctor Fitzwilliam , " I returned myself to Bedford-House , to take my /z/ ; lea ? Q ( for so 1 take it to be ) of as kind a rela tion , and as zealous , tender a friend as ever any body had. * To my uncle and aunt their niece was an inexpressible loss , but to herself death was the contrary . She died ( as most do ) as she had lived ; a pattern to all who knew her .

I heard my uncle and aunt say , that in seven years she had been with them , they never could tax her with a failure in her piety , or her prudence . Yet she had been roughly attacked , as the French Gazettes will tell you . " Among the MSS. at Woburn- Abbey are preserved copies , in Lady Russell 's hand-writing , of two letters from the Marquis de Rouvigny to the King , and notes of several conversations with his ministers , Hyde and Godolphin , upon the subject of removing the attainder from Lord Russell 's children . This was promised from time to time with the insincerity that characterized the court . Among these papers is one indorsed by Lady Russell , " Some discourses upon a visit from the Lord Treasurer Hyde to me. /q/ " The Lord Treasurer told me that my uncle had seemed to have set the effecting it much on his heart , and with the greatest kindness to me imaginable . I told my lord I believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lordship knew very well the world imputed his coming to England to some other cause , or at least thought he had been earnestly invited to it ; for the last , I positively affirmed he had not been , but as to the first , it was too deep for me to judge of . * * At the same time , I am sure nothing can be done for me now , that can diminish , or to me , that can augment what I feel . * * I do as- sure your lordship T have much more care to make my children worthy to be great , than to see them so . I will do what I can they may deserve to be so , and then quietly wait what will follow .

" After her uncle 's return to France , she rejoined her children at Woburn-Abbey . The last of November , 1685 , she writes , " I believe it may be near Christmas before my Lord Bedford removes for the winter , but I have not yet discoursed with him about it , nor how long he desires our company ; 94 L ii v i use i .

When I should rejoice with them that do rejoice , I seek a corner to weep in . I find I am capable of no more gladness ; but every new circumstance , the very comparing my night of sorrow after such a day , with theirs of joy , does , from a reflection of one kind or other , rack my uneasy mind .

" /q/ " The revocation of the edict of Nantes , by Louis the Fourteenth , and the cruelties exercised against the Protestants produced a great sensation in England , and tended , to hasten the downfal of James the Second . Lady Russell , speaking of Louis , says , " I can not choose but think myself less miserable than this poor king ; so truly miserable by debasing , as he does , the dignity of human nature . Near two millions of souls made of the same clay as himself , have felt the rigors of that savage man . It is enough to sink the strongest heart to read the relations are sent over . How the children are torn from their mothers , and sent into monasteries ; their mothers to another . The husband to prison , or the galley- These are amazing providences !

Mr Evelyn , in his Diary , mentions that he assisted at a French sermon , in Greenwich church , to a congregation of above a hundred French refugees , of which M. de Rouvigny was the chief , and for whom he had obtained the use of the Parish church , after the English service was over . The mother of Lady Russell was a Hugonot ; 90 T. A l v IUB B I L L . and with other virtuous and noble principles instilled lv her father , she received from him sentiments of great toleration with regard to religion . Clarendon thinks it necessary to make a slight apology for the Earl of Southampton 's liberality in this respect . He says , " He was a man of exemplary virtue and piety , and very regular in his devotions : yet lie was not generally believed by the bishops to have an affection keen enough for the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something more might have been done to gratify the Presbyterians than they thought just . " His daughter evinced the same kind regard for the religious opinions and feelings of others . In writing to Doctor Fitzwilliam to procure a chaplain for her family , she says , " I approve the Church of England  --  the best church and the best offices and services in it upon the face of the earth that we know of . But I covet one so moderate , as not to be impatient and passionate against all that can not think as he does . I would have " him of such a temper as to be able to converse peaceably and without giving offence , to such as have the freedom of my familv , though these are not of our church ; I take it to be the best way of gaining good people to our opinions .

By taking a Frenchman I shall do a charity , and profit the child also . " The doating grandfather objected to the plan , lest the boy 's health should be injured by study ; but Lady Russell , though a very devoted mother , was not a weakly indulgent one ; and she overcame Lord Bedford 's scruples by the assurance that the child should not be urged beyond his strength . Through his whole life she watched over the education and character of her son with the most scrupulous attention ; alike regardless of her own anxieties , and her own indulgence . Acting ; under the influence of the same blessed spirit , which never allowed her to be selfish , in joy or in sorrow , we find her , in case of sickness in Lady Montague's* family , taking charge of her children : she says , " My own sad trials making me know how mean a comforter I can be , I think my best service is to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and I hope God will be pleased to keep them so . " When her advice and assistance was asked concerning making a proposal of marriage to one of her sister 's ( Lady Noel ) daughters , she writes , " I have done it , though I wish choice had been made of any other person than myself , who desiring to know the world no more , am utterly unfit for the management of anything in it ; but must , as I can , engage in such necessary offices to my children , " Formerly Lady Percy . /z/ 98 la d v i . i bg 1 . 1 . 1 .. aa I can not , be dispensed from , nor desire to be , since it is nn eternal obligation apon me , to the memory of a husband , to whom and to his , I have dedicated the few and sad remainder of my days .

In July , 1086 , she thus writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ; I am sorry it happens to be just on that day , since I affect nothing that is particular or singular ; but as yet , I have not seen any body besides my children on that day , being the 13th of July ; nor does it seem decent for me to do it , almost when I remember the sad scene I saw and attended at all that day , and the miserable accidents of it , as the unfortunate end of Lord Essex , to me so fatal , if the Duchess of Portsmouth told me true ; that they said the jury could not have condemned my lord , if my Lord Essex had not died as he did . But I , will do as I can : I hope she will not misconstruct what I shall do .

But we are not always loved most by those we love best .

Those whose age can afford them any remembrance , should , methinks , have some solemn thoughts for so irreparable a loss to themselves and family ; though after that I would cherish a cheerful temper in them , with all the industry 1 can ; for sure we please our Maker best , when we take all his providences with a cheerful spirit .

I do not contend on these days with frail nature , but keep her as innocent as I can . What you stated to me is just ; I had made him my idol , /q/ though I did not know it ; loved man too much , and God too little : yet my constant prayer was not to do so : but not enough fervent I doubt .

It is joy and peace in believing that I covet , having nothing to fear but sin . " In this year , Lord Cavendish ( now Earl of Devonshire ) the generous and active friend of Lord Russell , proposed a union of the families by the marriage of his son with Lady Russell 's eldest daughter . As the parties were very young , and large estates were to be settled on both sides , the arrangements cost the p parents some trouble . Lady Russell writes , " I am in a great and constant hurry , from my careful endeavors to do my duty to my child , and to my friend , sister Margaret Russell , * which , by God 's grace , I intend to do as cordially as to my children . I meet with many difficulties in both ; yet in my girl 's there is no stop but such as the former settlements caused , which will hinder a conclusion till he is sixteen . I trust if I perfect this great work , my careful endeavors will prosper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but sure it is a glimmering of light I did not look for in my dark day . I do often repeat in my thoughts , the children of the just shall be blessed : * Lord Strafford had proposed for her ; the marriage did not take place . i ) 2 LAD V RUSSELL . I run persuaded their father was such ; and if my heart deceive me not , I intend the being so , and humbly bless God for it . " In another letter , speaking of the occupation given her by her daughter 's proposed marriage , she says , " I would fain be delivered from them , conclude my affairs , and so put some period to that inroad methinks I make in my intended manner of living upon earth . But I hope my duty will always prevail over the strongest inclination I have . I believe to assist my yet helpless children is my business , which makes me take many dinners abroad , and do of that nature many things , the performance of which is hard enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless God for it . " The arrangements were at last satisfactorily completed . In 1688 , the " little Fubs , " mentioned in Lady Russell 's charming love-letters , became Lady Cavendish , afterward Duchess of Devonshire . By a melancholy coincidence , the marriage took place on the 21st of June , a circumstance which Lady Russell would gladly have avoided , had she ever in her whole life allowed herself to be selfish ; but the Lord Devonshire , having ; other engagements , was in haste , and she raised no objections . After this wedding she writes , " As early as my mournful heart can , I will pass over those sad days , which at the return of the year , will , let me struggle all I can , set more lively than at other times , sad objects before my sight : but the reviving hope of that immortal life my dear friend is /q/ already possessed of , is my best support . This very solemnity has afforded me , alas ! many a thought I was forced to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though in retirement they are pleasant : and that way I can indulge myself in at present . Sure , if departed souls know what we do , he approves of what I have done , and it is a reward upon his children for his patience , and so entire submission during his sufferings . * There is a sort of secret delight in the privacy of one of those mournful days ; I think , besides a better reason , one is , that I do not tie myself up as I do on other days : for God knows my eyes are ever ready to pour out marks of a sorrowful heart , which I shall carry to the grave , that quiet bed of rest . * * That I have not sunk under the pressure , has been I hope in mercy , that I might be better fitted for my eternal state ; and form the children of a loved husband , before I go hence . With these thoughts I can be hugely content to live ; though God only knows how I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my young creatures ; I mean well toward them , if I know my heart . " In August the young bridegroom went abroad upon his travels , and Lady Cavendish remained with her mother . Doctor Tillotson had at first feared an abatement in Lady Russell 's esteem , on account of the unworthy concessions he had advised her husband to make ; but his first interview after Lord Russell 's death occasioned a perfect renewal of friend- /z/ ship , and he continued to correspond with her durring her life . In a letter on the subject of her daughter 's marriage , he says , " I pray God to preserve my Lord Cavendish in his travels from the hazards of all kinds to which he is likely to be exposed , and to return him to you and to his excellent lady , greatly improved in all true , noble , and virtuous qualities . My mind doth presage much happiness to you in him ; I earnestly wish it . " The " hazards " to which Doctor Tillotson alludes , were , in part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will not long endure any gross violation of their liberties . William , Prince of Orange , was urged to come over to free the kingdom from the bigotry and intolerance of his fatherin-law . James was as cowardly in adversity as he had been insolent in power . Notwithstanding the untiring malice with which he had persecuted Lord Russell , he dared to apply to the Earl of Bedford for assistance . The afflicted monarch is said to have addressed him thus : " My Lord , your are an honest man , have great credit , and can do me signal service . " The aged Earl replied , " Ah , sir , I am old and feeble ; I can do you but little service ; I once had a son , that could have assisted you ; but he is no more . " James was so much struck with this reply , that he could not speak for some minutes . When Dykevelt , Minister Plenipotentiary from the States of Holland , arrived in England , he was sent , by the express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lady Russell , to condole with her on her loss , and assure her of the lively interest they took in it , both as having a great and just regard for the two families to which she belonged , and as considering her lord 's death a great blow to the Protestant religion ; assuring her at the same time , there was nothing in their power , they were not ready to do , either for fierself or her son . The ambassador declared that he did not deliver this message in his private capacity ; but that he was charged with it as a public minister . The Princess of Orange , in a letter to Lady Russell , says , " If you knew the esteem I have for you , you would be persuaded your letters could not be too troublesome ; and since you will make me believe it is some satisfaction to you , I shall desire you to continue , for I assure you I am extreme glad to contribute any way to that . I hope this match of your daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can desire . I do not question but you have made a very good choice ; and since I wish so well to my Lord Devonshire , I can not but be glad it is his son , believing you will have taught your daughter , after your own example , to be so good a wife , that Lord Cavendish can not choose but be very happy with her . I assure you I wish it with all my heart , and if that could contribute anything to your content , you may be sure of as much as it is possible for you to have ; and not only my wishes , but upon all occasions I shall be /z/ glad to BhoW more than by words , tho esteem I have for you . Marie . " Hague , February 13 , 1688 . Two whole months elapsed between the landing of the Prince of Orange and the final departure of King James ; a period of great difficulty and danger to those actively concerned in politics . Lady Russell evidently watched with anxiety for the clearing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their expressions . She removed with Lord Bedford , from Woburn to London , in season to witness the peaceable settlement of the new government . She thus speaks of this important event : " Those who have lived longest , and therefore seen the most change , can scarce believe it more than a dream ; yet it is real , and so amazing a reality of mercy , as ought to melt our hearts into subjection and resignation to Him , who is the dispenser of all providences . " The young Lady Cavendish was present with her mother-in-law , the Countess of Devonshire , at the proclamation of William and Mary , and accompanied her to their first drawing-room in the evening of the same day . The following extracts are taken from a letter in which she describes the scene : " My Lord Halifax made the Prince and Princess a short speech , desiring them in the name of all the lords to accept of the crown . The Prince answered him in a few words , and the Princess made curtsies . They say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked down as if she was troubled . The Speaker of the House of Commons showed the Prince what they had agreed of , but made no speech . After this ceremony was ended , they proclaimed them King and Queen of England . I was at the sight , and , you may imagine , very much pleased to see them proclaimed , in the room of King James , my father 's murderer . There was wonderful acclamations of joy , which , though they were very pleasing to me , yet they frightened me too ; for I could not but think what a dreadful thing it is to fall into the hands of the rabble  --  they are such a strange sort of people . At night I went to Court with my Lady Devonshire , and kissed the Queen 's hand , and the King 's also . There was a world of bonfires and candles almost in every house , which looked extremely pretty . The King applies himself mightily to business , and is wonderfully admired for his great wisdom and prudence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , but looks very homely a , t first sight ; but if one looks long on him , he has something in his face both wise and good . But as for the Queen , she is really altogether very handsome ; her face is very agreeable , and her shape and motions extremely graceful and fine . Her room was mighty full of company , as you may guess . " One of the first acts of William and Mary was the reversal of Lord Russell 's attainder . In the preamble to the bill , his execution is declared a // murder . In 1689 , t lie House of Commons appointed a committee to examine who were the advisers and promoters of Lord Russell 's murder . These proceedings awakened the inconsolable widow to a thousand painful recollections , and no doubt gave rise to bitter regret that he could no longer be benefited by the royal predilections in his favor ; Her half-sister , Lady Montague , thus writes to her : " I am very sorry , my dear sister , to find by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I thought oujrht to have some contrary effect . It is very true what is once taken from us , in that nature , can never be returned ; all that remains of comfort ( according to my temper ) is a bringing to punishment those who were so wickedly and unjustly the cause of it . I confess it w r as a great satisfaction to me to hear that was the public care ; it being so much to the honor , as well as what was in justice due to your dead lord , that I do not doubt , when your sad thoughts will give you leave to recollect , you will find comfort . I heartily pray God you may , and that you may never have the addition of any other loss . " Could worldly distinctions have effaced her sorrow , Lady Russell would have grieved no longer . Honors were showered upon the families of Bedford and Devonshire ; and her own individual character obtained a degree of respect and consideration rarely bestowed upon woman . Doctor Tillotson applied to her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been offered him by King William Doctor Fitzwilliam likewise consulted with her concerning his conscientious resignation of preferment under the new government ; and the following letter , from the Duchess of Marlborough , shows how much deference was paid to her opinion : - " Regard for the public welfare carried me to advise the Princess to acquiesce in giving King William the crown . However , as I was fearful about everything the princess did , while she was thought to be advised by me , I could not satisfy my own mind till I had consulted with several persons of undisputed wisdom and integrity , and particularly with the Lady Russell of Southampton House and Doctor Tillotson , ( afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury ) . I found them all unanimous in the expediency of the settlement proposed . " The high opinion the new sovereigns were known to entertain of Lady Russell , produced numerous applications for her patronage and interest . She made very moderate use of this power , as might have been expected from her delicate mind . Addressing Queen Marv in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " It is a sensible trouble to me when I do importune your Majesty , yet I do sometimes submit , because I would not be quite useless to such as hope for some benefit by my means , and I desire to do what good I can . " For those who had loved the character , or vindicated the memory of her deceased husband , she // exerted herself with the utmost earnestness and perseverance . The following among several letters from the Queen proves how kindly her requests were received . " I am sorry my Lady Russell knows me so little , or judges so wrong of the kindness I have for her , to think she needs make an excuse for writing to me . I shall never think it a trouble to hear from you , and should be very glad to do what you desire ; but as I was wholly unacquainted with the place , and believe there is no great haste in the filling it , so I left all who spoke to me liberty to write for themselves ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can let him know your desire ; I am persuaded he will be as willing to please you in it as I am myself . You are very much in the right to believe I have cause enough to think this life not so fine a thing as many others do ; that I lead at present ( beside the pain I am continually in for the king ) it is so contrary to my own inclination , that it can be neither easy nor pleasant ; but 1 see one is not ever to live for one 's self ! I have had many years of ease and content , and was not so sensible of my own happiness as I ought , till I lost it ; but I must be content with what it pleases God ; and this year I have reason to praise him hitherto for the successes in Ireland , the news of which came so quick upon one another , that made me fear we have some ill to expect from other places . * * * * LADY RUSSELL . Ill The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though I tremble at the thoughts of it , yet I can not but wish a battle well over . " I have heard nothing all this while of your petition , which I am sorry for ; wishing for any occasion to show how really I am , and always shall be , Your very affectionate friend , Marie R.* ' Whitehall , July , 1691 . Lady Russell had now frequent opportunities of retaliating upon those who had persecuted her husband , or turned a deaf ear to her supplications in the days of her great distress . But her character , with all its strong powers of endurance , had the perfect mildness of a dove . Even in the first outpourings of her anguish , we find no mixture of bitterness toward her enemies . We even find her expressing a hope that God would bless King James , because he allowed a contribution to be taken for the French Protestants . And when Lady Sunderland , wife of the principal minister and adviser of Charles the Second , at the time of Lord Russell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices with the reigning powers , she answers in the kindest manner imaginable , saying she " pitied her sorrows arid heartily wished her ease . " An expression in one of her letters must have touched the feelings of Lady Sunderland ; she says , " So unhappy a solicitor as I was once for my poor self and family , my heart 1 19 L A I ) v R B 8 E L L . misgives mc when I aim at anything of that kind any more/ ' She thus writes to Lord Halifax , when he was in affliction , alluding to her own misfortunes , and to his ineffectual rxcrtions to assist her at the most mournful period of her life : " For my part , I think the man a very indifferent reasondr , that , to do well , he must take with indifference whatever happens to him . It is very fine to say , ' Why should we complain that is taken back which was but lent to us , and lent us for a time , we know ; ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no reverence for , as I have not for anything unnatural . It is insincere , and I dare say they did dissemble , and felt what they would not own . I know I can not dispute with almighty power ; but yet , if my delight is gone , I must needs be sorry it is taken awav , according to the measure it made me glad . The Christian religion alone , believe me , my lord , has the power to make the spirit easy under any great calamity . Nothing less than the hope of being again made happy , can satisfy the mind . I am sure I owe it more , than I could have done to the world , if all the glories of it had been offered me , or to be disposed of by me . And I do sincerely desire your lordship may experience the truth of my opinion . If I could form a better wish for your lordship , your willingness to have made me less miserable than I am , if your power had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that alone would have bound me , though my /q/ own unworthiness and ill - fortune had let you have forgot me ever after my sad lot . But since you would not do so , it must forever deserve particular acknowledgment from , " &c.; In the midst of prosperity , we find Lady Russell recurring with mournful tenderness to the treasure she had lost . In a letter to Doctor Fitzwilliam , July 21 , 1689 , she says , " It was an entire affection which was between us ; and no time I believe can waste my sorrow . All I desire is to make it innocent . For the late circumstances in my family , I would have assisted to my power for the procuring thereof , but for any sensible joy at these outward things I feel none : I think I should if I live to see him a worthy man .

But a little time will put me again into my settled state of mourning ; for a mourner I must be all my days /z/ Ill LADY B UBS ELL. earth , and there is no need I Bhould be otln cr . My glass runs low : the world doc- not want mc nor I want thai ; my business is at home , and within a narrow compass . I must not deny , as there was something so glorious in the object of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from being then overwhelmed . So now it affords me , together with the remembrance how many easy years we lived together , thoughts that are joy enough for me , who look no higher than a quiet submission to my lot , and such pleasures in educating the young folks as surmounts the cares that it will afford . " Lady Russell 's health had not sunk under her mental sufferings ; she gratefully acknowledges a freedom from bodily pain , " to a degree I almost never knew ; not so much as a strong fit of headache have I felt since that miserable time , who used to be tormented with it very frequently . " But she now began to feel the approaches of infirmity , particularly in a rapidly increasing weakness of sight . In 1689 she complained a good deal of her difficulty in seeing . It has been reported that she wept herself blind ; but this was not the case ; the disease in her eyes was a cataract , from which she obtained relief by couching , in 1694 . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She seems to have endured the prospect of blindness with the same patient magnanimity , that had ever distinguished her ; expressing thanks to God that he had so long enabled her to enjoy the blessing of /q/ eye-sight . She writes , " While I can see at all , I must do a little more than I can when God sees it best that outward darkness shall fall upon me , which ' will deprive me of all society at a distance , which I esteem exceeding profitable and pleasant . "  --  Her letters to her son-in-law , Lord Cavendish , breathe her usual spirit of kindness , good-sense , and piety . In a letter directed to him at Brussels , she says , " Finding you are going farther from us , I must tell you how concernedly iny prayers and best wishes attend you . Your return would be a time of more sensible content to me , and yet if I were to dispose of your person , what you are doing should be my choice for you ; for to live well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the world well . We are under the same protection in all places where we can be . It is very true the circumstances of our beings do sometimes require our better diligence and watch over ourselves , than at other times ; and it is now going to be so with your lordship : you are launching into the ocean ; if you steer wisely , you secure a calm for your whole life ; you will discern the vanity of all the pomps and glories of this world ; how little intrinsic good there is in the enjoyment ! and how uncertain it is how long we shall enjoy that good there is in them ! And by observation , you will be made sensible how much below the dignity of human nature it is to gain one 's point , let the matter be what it will , by any mean , or insincere way .

Live virtuously , my lord , and you can not die too soon , nor live too long . " The return of Lord Cavendish from abroad , in 1691 , separated her from her elder daughter . During his absence Lady Cavendish resided with her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of the Earl of Devonshire . Lady Russell , ever minutely careful in all that related to her children 's welfare , wrote a letter to the Mistress of the Robes to Queen Mary , recommending the young Lady Cavendish to her particular attention and advice , adding , " She is unex- * Lady Montague , and Lord Gainsborough . /q/ m perienced enough to want it , and never been till now from too fond a mother , I doubt . " In 1692 , the Earl of Rutland proposed a marriage between his eldest son and Lord Russell 's younger daughter . After allowing some time for the family to form an acquaintance with the young man , the marriage was concluded in the summer of the following year . Thus " little Kate , " became Lady Roos , afterward Duchess of Rutland . The wedding festivities , when the bride and bridegroom arrived at their new home , are described by Sir James Forbes , in a letter to Lady Russell , as having been " exceeding magnificent ; " and he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a king and queen through their country , than that of a bride and bridegroom going home to their father 's house . " Lady Russell excused herself from going with all the wedding company to Belvoir , because too much exertion greatly increased the pain in her eyes ; but she soon followed the young couple thither . Doctor Burnet , in allusion to this marriage , says , " Your family is now the greatest in its three branches , that has been in England in our age . " In answer to Doctor Fitzwiiliam 's congratulations , Lady Russell says , " I hope I have done my duty well to my daughters , and that they shall enjoy a lasting happiness ; but above all , my prayer is , that the end of their faith may be the salvation of their souls ; that they may be endued with such graces here , as may fit them for the glories of the state hereafter . " // Tii May , 1694 , the Earls of Bedford and Dev* onshire were advanced to the dignity of Dukes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the preamble to the patent the following arc some of the reasons given for bestowing these high honors . " That this was not the least , that he was the father of Lord Russell , the ornament of his age , whose great merits it was not enough to transmit by history to posterity , but they ( the King and Queen ) were willing to record them in their royal patent , to remain in the family as a monument consecrated to his consummate virtue , whose name would never be forgot so long as men preserved any esteem for sanctity of manners , greatness of mind , and a love of their country , constant even to death . Therefore , to solace his excellent father for so great a loss , to celebrate the memory of so noble a son , and to excite his worthy grandson , the heir of such mighty hopes , more cheerfully to emulate and follow the example of his illustrious father , they entailed this high dignity upon the Earl and his posterity . " The following anecdote illustrates Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ow 7 n days few would have been so calm under such circumstances ; and we must remember that , a century and a half ago , people were abundantly more superstitious . " As I was reading in my closet , the door being bolted , on a sudden the candle and candlestick jumped off the table , a hissing fire ran on the floor , and after a short time left some paper in a flame , /q/ which with my foot I put into the chimney to prevent mischief ; then sat down in the dark to consider whence this event could come . I knew my doors and windows were fast , and there was no way open into the closet but by the chimney ; and that something should come down there , and strike my candle off the table in that strange manner , I believed impossible .

" Her ladyship bid him not to be troubled at the matter , for she had no other concern about it , than that of not finding out the cause . While Lord Tavistock was as yet but thirteen years old , his mother received proposals from Sir Josiah Child , for marrying him to his grand-daughter , the Lady Henrietta Somerset , giving as a reason , " I desire so great a fortune as God 's Providence has cast upon her may fall into the best and most pious noble family I know , for such I esteem my Lord Bedford 's to be . " * We are not informed why these proposals were not accepted .

In a letter to the young lady 's mother , speaking of souk ; masters who had attended her , she writes , " Though I confess fashion , and those other accomplishments that are perhnps over-rated by the world , and that I esteem but as dross , and as a shadow in comparison of religion and virtue , yet the perfections of nature are ornaments to the body , as grace is to the mind , and I wish , and do more than that , for I pray constantly , she may be a perfect creature both in body and mind . " The marriage had not taken place but a few months , and the young Lord Tavistock was still under the care of a private tutor , preparing for Oxford University , when , in October , 1695 , Lady Russell was urged to consent that , he should stand as member for Parliament ; to make the proposal more flattering , permission was asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of election , and present him to the county under the popular and beloved appellation of Lord Russell . The young nobleman was but fifteen years of age ; and his judicious mother at once decided that such a premature entry into public life would be likely to ruin his character and happiness . During Lord Tavistock 's stay at the University , Lady Russell occasionally resided there , for the purpose of maintaining the entire and confidential /q/ friendship , which had ever existed between her and her son . At the age of seventeen , the young heir to so many honors and so much wealth was sent abroad , to perfect his education . His aged grandfather parted from him with extreme reluctance , though he seems to have entirely approved the arrangements made by Lady Russell ; indeed , in the boy 's infancy she had said , " I shall always take my Lord Bedford along with me in everything that concerns the child . " Lord Tavistock 's numerous letters to his mother are said to give a favorable opinion of the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign society ; and above all , of his affection , deference , and unlimited confidence in his mother . Her letters to him , while abroad , are not preserved . Lady Russell seems to have entertained some fears of his love for play , before he left England ; for in a letter from the Hague he assures her she has no grounds , and never shall have , for such anxiety . But a young man so much flattered , and the heir of such a princely income , must have been more than human had he not been guilty of some of the follies incident to his age and situation . We accordingly find that he made expensive presents without the knowledge of his governor , and lost very considerable sums at play . In his difficulties he appeals directly to his mother 's indulgence . He says , " If your ladyship did but know a little part of the grief I suffer , I am sure you would forgive me ; and if I did not think you /z/ would , I could not lcar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groat expense , he tells her ,  --  " But then it is certain that the honors I have received here ( at Rome ) are so very extraordinary , that the expense could not be less . It is undoubtedly much for the honor of the family : as for myself , I think I deserve nothing , since I am capable of afllicting your ladyship . * If you did but know my thoughts , and half the trouble that I am in , I am certain your ladyship would grant what I desire . I will yet come home to be a comfort to your ladyship , and make you easy ; and so follow , in some things , I hope , at least , the steps of my good father . " Lady Russell did not , however , know of the amount of her son 's losses at play till he returned to England in the year 1699 . The sum was so considerable as to oblige her to apply to the Earl of Bedford to assist her as a security in raising the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and speaks of the errors of the young , in her letter on this subject , is a sufficient reason for the affectionate confidence placed in her by both . In the year 1700 the Earl of Bedford died ; and Lord Tavistock succeeded to his title and estates . Her letter to her son a few years after this event , shows how clearly she perceived his true interests , and how much more she cared for his advancement in holiness than for all the fleeting dignities of this transient life . /z/ Stratton , July , 1706 . " When I take my pen to write this , I am , by the goodness and mercy of God , in a moderate and easy state of health  --  a blessing I have thankfully felt through the course of a long life , which , ( with a much greater help , ) the contemplation of a more durable state , has maintained and upheld me through varieties of providences and conditions of life .

With the Psalmist , I believe , ' at his right hand are pleasures forevermore : ' and what is good and of eternal duration , must be joyful above what we can conceive ; as what is evil and of like duration , must be despairingly miserable . And now , my dear child , I pray , I beseech you , I conjure you , my loved son , consider what there is of felicity in this world , that can compensate the hazard of losing an everlasting easv being ; and then deliberately weigh , whether or no the delights and gratifications of a vicious or idle course of life are such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I.

Look up to the firmament and and down to the deep , how can any doubt a divine power ? Then why an infidel in the world 1 And if not such , who then would hazard a future state , for the pleasure of sin a few days ? No wise man , and , indeed , no man that lives and would deserve to see good days ; for the laws of God are grateful . In his Gospel , the terrors of his majesty are laid aside , and he speaks in the still , soft voice of his Son incarnate , the fountain and spring whence flow gladness .

What is man , that thou art mindful of him , or the son of man , that thou shouldst so regard him ? Thou madest him lower than the angels , to crown him with glory . ' Here is matter of praise and gladness . ' The fool , ' as the Psalmist expresses it , ' hath said in his heart there is no God . ' Or let us consider the man , who is content to own an invisible power , yet tries to believe , that when man has done living on this earth , he lives no more ; but I would ask , if any of these unhappy creatures are fully persuaded , or that there does not remain in those men , at times ( as in sickness , or sober thoughtfulness , ) some suspicion or doubt , that it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may , to shun such a thought , or be rid of such a contemplation , run away from it to some unprofitable diversion , or , perhaps , suffer /q/ themselves to be rallied out of such a thought , so destructive to the way they walk in ; yet , to be sure , that man does not feel the peace and tranquillity he does , who believes a future state , and is a good man . For although this good man , when his mind may be clouded with some calamity very grievous to him , or the disorder of vapors to a melancholy temper , I say , if he is tempted to some suspicion , than it is possible it may be other than he believes , ( pray observe ) such a surmise or thought , nay , the belief , can not drive him to any horror ; he fears no evil , because he is a good man , and with his life all sorrow ends too ; therefore , it is not to be denied , he is the wisest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep God 's laws . First , his mind is in peace and tranquillity ; he w T alks sure who keeps innocence , and takes heed to the thing that is right : secondly , he is secure God is his friend , that Infinite Being ; and he has said , ' Come unto me ye that are heavy laden , my yoke is easy : ' but guilt is certainly a heavy load ; it sinks and damps the spirits . * A wounded spirit who can bear ! ' and the evil subtle spirit waits ( I am persuaded ) to drive the sinner to despair ; but godliness makes a cheerful heart . Now , O man ! let not past errors discourage : who lives and sins not ? God will judge the obstinate , profane , unrelenting sinner ; but fall of compassion to the work of his own hand , if they will cease from doing evil and learn to do well , pray for grace to repent , and endeavor , with that measure which /z/ will be given , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinner repents ( but observe , this is no license to sin , because at any time we may repent , ) for that day we may not live to see ; and so like the fool in the parable , our lamps be untrimmed when we are called upon . Remember , that to forsake vice is the beginning of virtue : and virtue certainly is most conducive to content of mind and a cheerful spirit . He ( the virtuous man ) rejoiceth with a friend in the good things he enjoys ; bears not the reproaches of any ; no evil spirit can approach to hurt him here , or accuse him in the great day of the Lord , when every soul shall be judged according as they have done good or evil .

In this good state I wish and pray for all mankind ; but most particularly , and with all the ardor I am capable of , for those I have brought into the world , and those dear to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you may die the death of the righteous , and to this end , that Almighty God would endue you all with spiritual wisdom , to discern what is pleasing in his sight . " Now that Lady Russell saw her beloved son established in all the honors of his family , happy in the wife she had chosen for him , and the father of several children , it seemed as if her sorrows were well nigh over . But she was doomed to suffer yet more in her strongest affections . Neither inoculation nor vaccine were known in those times ; the Duke of Bedford caught the small-pox naturally , /q/ and died May 20 , 1711 , in the 31st year of his age . He left three sons and two daughters . His wife was obliged to fly from him , for the safety of her children ; but his aged mother was at his bed-side , soothing his last moments , and pointing his thoughts to heaven . A short time after this afflicting event , she thus writes to her cousin Rouvigny , Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my thoughts are yet all disorder , confusion , and amazement ; and I think I am very incapable of saying or doing what I should . I did not know the " greatness of my love to his person , till I could see it no more . When nature , who will be mistress , has in some measure , with time , relieved herself , then , and not till then , I trust the goodness , which hath no bounds , and whose power is irresistible , will assist me by his grace , to rest contented with what his unerring Providence has appointed and permitted . And I shall feel ease in this contemplation , that there was nothing uncomfortable in his death , but the losing him . His God was , I verily believe , ever in his thoughts ; towards his last hours he called upon him , and complained that he could not pray his prayers . To what I answered , he said , he wished for more time to make up his accounts with God , Then with remembrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kind his wife had been to him , and that he should have been glad to have expressed himself to her , said something to me , and my /z/ double kindness to his wife , and so died away . there scorned no reluctancy to leave this world , patient and easy the whole time , and I believe knew his danger , but loath to grieve those by him , delayed what he might have said . But why all this ' I The decree is past . I do not ask your prayers ; I know you offer them with sincerity to our Almighty God for your afflicted kinswoman , R. Russell .

I am , beyond all expression , madam , " &c.; Lady Russell was destined to survive nearly all whom she had loved most dearly . In the November following , her younger daughter , the Duchess of Rutland , after having been the mother of nine children , died in child-bed . No letters from her mother , concerning this event , are preserved . But even at this advanced age , and tried as she had been with so many and recent afflictions , Lady Russell gave another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the good of others . Her elder daughter , the Duchess of Devonshire , was at the same time in a situation similar to that which had cost her sister 's life . /z/ When she anxiously inquired concerning the health of the Duchess of Rutland , her strong-hearted mother , anxious to avoid the consequences that might result from her hearing the tidings too suddenly , calmly replied , c I have seen your sister out of her bed today , '  --  when , in fact she was in her coffin . Within a very few months after the death of Lady Russell 's daughter , the Duke of Rutland married again . This circumstance must have been painful to the sensitive mother ; but like all other trials , it only served to bring out new beauties in a character , that seems to have been as nearly perfect as our nature is capable of being . The following letter shews how indulgent she was to the feelings and weaknesses of others . /z/ " My Lord ,  --  I have been for some weeks often resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not engage upon a subject I can not speak to without some emotion , but I can not suffer your being a stranger to any that very near concerns me . Yet before I could dispose myself to do it , concluded the article not a secret to you , such care having by one side been taken , as to let it be a visiting day affair , whether or not the Duke of Rutland had not fixed a second choice ? Perhaps as proper to call it the first ; for when marriages are so very early , it is accepting rather than choosing , on either side . But Lord Rutland , to the end of /q/ my good child 's life , has so well approved of the choice , in all and every respect , and now that she is no more , has , with very deliberate consideration , as soon as he composed his mind to think , first taken care to inquire , and be truly informed what powers he had to do for his children ; and then , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger child 's portion , by adding to what they had before . As it is to me the most solid instance of his respect and love he can now give to her memory , and being , I believe it , done with an honest sincerity , and true value of her , and all her virtues , I conceive it would be wrong in me to take offence at some circumstances the censorious part of the town will be sure to do , and refine upon for the sake of talk . I miss the hearing by seeing few , and not answering questions . " The first notice I had of his intention was by Mr Charlton , and I really believed that was as soon as he had given himself his own consent . He told me he found him under great unquietness , when he acquainted him with his thoughts , who said , he was under all the anxieties a man could feel how to break it to me , though it was then but a thought of his own , yet so much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me , and I did as soon resolve to let it pass , as easy between him and me , as I could , by bidding Mr Charlton let him know I would begin to him . I did so , which put us both in some disorder , but 1 believe he took , as I meant it , kindly . A decency in time was all I expected . " /z/ In 1 7 1 8 , she writes , " My very long acquaintance , Lady Essex , is no longer of this world ; but not to be lamented in relation to herself , being certainly sincerely devout , in those points we ought to make our biggest care . " Lady Russell was now eightytwo years old ; and many of her contemporaries , as well as many a one whose course had begun long after hers , had gone away rapidly , one after another , and left her almost alone in this vale of tears . Yet we find her to the last , keeping up a constant and affectionate intercourse with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . She . was interested in their happiness , sympathized with their sorrows , and her advice was always sought for , when difficulties of any kind arose . Indeed the conscientious Lady Russell seems herself to have been the only one in the world who ever discovered that she had any faults . The following charges against herself were found among her papers . Cl Vanity cleaves to me , I fear , O Lord ! in all I say , in all I do . In all I suffer , proud not enduring to slights and neglects , subject to envy the good parts of others , even as to worldly gifts . Failing in my duty to my superiors ; apt to be soon angry with , and without cause too often ; and by it may have grieved those that desired to please me , or provoked others to sin by my rash anger . Not ready to own any advantage I may have received by good advice or example . Not well satisfied if I have not all the respect I expected , even from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my naught heart , I fear , and also neglect in my performances due to my superiors , children , friends , or servants . I heartily lament my sin . But , alas ! in my most dear husband 's troubles , seeking help from man , but finding none . His life was taken away , and so sorely was my spirit wounded , even without prospect of future comfort and consolation  --  the more faulty in me , having three dear children to perform my duty to , with thankfulness for such a blessing left me , under so heavy a dispensation as I felt the loss of him to be . But , alas ! how feeble did I find myself both then , and also poorly prepared to bear the loss of my dear child and only son , in 1711 . " If I carry my sorrow to the grave , O Lord , in much mercy let it not be imputed as sin in me ! His death was a piercing sorrow to me , yet thou hast supported me , Lord ! even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain and sickness than most feel  --  I desire thankfully to recollect . Alas ! from my childhood I can recollect a backwardness to pray , and coldness when I did , and ready to take or seek cause to be absent at the public ones . Even after a sharp sickness and danger at Chelsea , spending my time childishly , if not idly ; and if I had read a few lines in a pious book , contented I had done well . Yet , at the same time , ready to give ear to reports , and possibly to malicious ones , and telling my mother-in-law to please her . At seventeen years of age was married : continued too /z/ often being absent at the public prayers , taking very slight causes to be so , liking too well the esteemed diversions of the town , as the Park , visiting , plays , and trifling away my precious time .

" Some time after in London , and then with my father 's wife at Tunbridge , and after with her at Bath , gave too much of my time to carelessly indulging in idleness . At Bath too well contented to follow the common way of passing the time in diversion , and thinking but little what was serious . considering more health of body than that of my soul . Forgive my heaviness and sloth in spirituals , for Christ Jesus ' sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sometimes in Wales , and other times in England , my care in good has not suited to my duty , not with the active and devout heart and mind I should in the evening have praised thee , my God , for the /q/ mercies of the past day , and recollected my evil doings , or omissions of doing good in my power . Not in the morning carefully fixing my will and purpose to pass the day pleasing in thy sight , and giving good example to man , particularly such as under my care ; more especially after my second marriage , forgetting by whose blessing I was so happy , consuming too much time with him . " * * The end wanting . Lady Russell , after a few days ' illness , during which she was attended by the Duchess of Devonshire , died September 29th , 1723 , in her 87th year .

Jeanne Bouvier de la Motte Guyon was born at Montargis in France , in April , 1648 . The purity of her life , the peculiarity of her opinions , and the severe trials she was called to encounter , all combine to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daughter of Claude Bouvier , Lord de la Motte Vergonville . She often speaks of the piety of her father ; who she says inherited a high respect for religion from " ancestors , that reckoned almost as many saints as persons in their pedigree . " She was educated in the strict discipline of the Catholic church , in which she remained to the day of her death , although she embraced the doctrines of that famous sect of mystics , called Quietists . Jeanne Bouvier de la Motte remained apparently dead several hours after her birth . She says " Were I to tell how long it was before I gave any /z/ signs of life , it would appear incredible . " Her father was a firm believer in all the tenets of the church of Rome ; and he was in very great distress that his babe should have died before a priest could be summoned to baptize her . She herself considered this external rite of so much importance , that she exclaims , " Oh , my God ! had I died then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this heart , created for thee alone , might have been separated from thee forever . " Mademoiselle Bouvier de la Motte had not the happiness of being beloved by her mother , who lavished all her care and fondness upon a favorite son . The poor little girl was much neglected , and left to the care of servants . The Duchess of Montbason , an intimate friend of her father , was at that time residing at a convent of Benedictine nuns , and being much interested in the forlorn child , she begged that she might be placed under her care . It is impossible to calculate the effect , which the mother 's unnatural conduct had on the future destiny of her child ; the influence of the nuns at this period of her life , unquestionably inspired her with that devout and somewhat wild enthusiasm of character , which she retained to the end of her life . Even then all her conversation was of religion , and she loved to be at church , and dressed like a little nun The following anecdote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impressions she received at this time , and the means taken to strengthen them . " One /q/ day I imagined the frightful notions that had been given me of hell were only designed to intimidate me , because I was active and gay ; but that night I saw in my dreams so vivid a picture of hell that I never afterward forgot it . My place was shown me there , which made me weep bitterly . Soon after this dream , I wanted to go to confession ; and being such a little child , the mistress of the boarders went with me . She was very much surprised to hear me accuse myself to the priest of having entertained thoughts contrary to the faith of the church . The confessor , smiling , asked me what they were . I told him I had doubted of hell ; but I now doubted no longer . After confession , I felt such an inexpressible fervor , that I strongly desired to suffer martyrdom .

I then prayed to God with great ardor ; which being both new and delightful was a proof of his love ; it gave me fresh courage , and made me more eagerly desire death , that I might go to see my God . As soon as I had knelt upon the cloth spread out for me , a great cutlass was raised above my head . On seeing this , I cried out I was not at liberty to die without my father 's consent . They said I was not fitted to be a martyr , and that I only made this excuse to free myself from it . It was indeed true , and it afterward afflicted me much . My consolation forsook me ; something reproached me that I wanted courage to go to Heaven . " /z/ I know not whether it was owing to the secluded life of this singular child , or whether the devout fancies of the nuns had too exciting an effect upon her active imagination ,  --  but her health declined rapidly ; and her frequent indispositions made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Her mother treated her with customary indifference , and she was left almost entirely to the guidance of domestics . Her facile character took its coloring from those about her ; and though she says she is not aware of committing any sins at this time , except saying smart things to amuse people , she was exposed to a multitude of dangers , and contracted many bad habits . Her father , finding her one day engaged in a noisy play with some rude children in the street , was much affected ; without saying a word to any one , he took his neglected daughter by the hand , and led her to the Convent of the Ursulines . In this house she had two half sisters ; ( for her parents had both been married , before they were married to each other ) her half sister , by her father 's side , was a pious , judicious girl , who spared no pains in teaching her everything suited to her age and situation ; and the rapid progress of her intelligent little pupil seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely attached to her , and often sent for her to visit him . One day , she found the Queen of England at his house. * She /q/ says , " I was then near eight years of age . My father told the Queen 's confessor , that if he wanted a little amusement , he might entertain himself with me , and propound some questions to me . He tried me with several very difficult ones , to which I returned such correct answers , that he carried me to the Queen , and said to her , * Your Majesty must have some diversion with this child . ' She also tried me ; and being well pleased with my lively answers , and my manners , she demanded me of my father with no small importunity , assuring him that she would take particular care of me , designing me for maid of honor to the princess . But my father resisted so far as to disoblige her . Doubtless it was God who caused this refusal , and thereby turned off the stroke which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I was , how should I have withstood the temptations and distractions of a court 1 i : I went back to the Ursulines , where my good sister continued her affection . But as she was not the mistress of the boarders , and as I was obliged sometimes to go along with them , I contracted bad habits ; I became addicted to lying , peevishness and indevotion , passing whole days without thinking of God ; though he watched continually over me , as the sequel will manifest . I did not remain long under the power of such vicious habits ; for my sister 's care recovered me . I loved much to hear of God , was not weary at church , loved to pray , had tenderness for the poor , and a natural /z/ dislike for persons whose doctrine was judged unsound , having sucked in with my milk , the purity of the faith ; and God has always continued to me that grace , in the midst of my greatest infidelities . " There was at the end of the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thither I betook myself for devotion ; and , for some time carrying my breakfast there every morning , hid it all behind his image ; for I was so much a child , that I thought I made a considerable sacrifice in depriving myself of it . Being also delicate in the choice of my food , I wished to mortify myself ; but found self-love still too prevalent to submit to such mortification . After this , when they were cleaning out the chapel , they found behind the image what I had left there , and presently guessed that it was I , as they had seen me every day going thither : and God , who lets nothing pass without a recompense , rewarded me for this little infantine devotion . " One day , my companions , who were large girls , to divert themselves , went to dance over a deep pit , which served as a sink to carry off the filth from the kitchen . It was deep , and covered with boards for fear of accident . When they retired , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I fell into the frightful gutter , yet hanging by a little piece of timber , in such a manner , that I was plunged in the filth , without being stifled with it : a figure of the inward state which I had to undergo , when in the horrible pit , which I was unable /q/ of myself to get out of . But God , in his goodness , preserved me in each , and brought me out of them ; denied indeed for a time , but not destroyed ! I was at the gates of death , yet death was not permitted to have any power over me . What support had the little stick been , on which I rested , if the adorable hand of God had not at this critical juncture sustained me ? But for that , undoubtedly it had soon broken . I cried out with all my might . The boarders , who saw me fall , instead of running to my help , went to alarm the sisters of the house . These sisters , concluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , who was then at prayers . She immediately prayed for me , and ( after having invoked the blessed Virgin ) came to me much frightened : but was not a little surprised , when she saw me , in the mire and filth , seated as on an easy chair . She admired that goodness of God , which had supported me in such a miraculous manner . " The idea of being rewarded for her childish but touching devotion to the image of the infant Jesus , seems very strange in one whose religious views were so remarkably interior as Madame Guyon 's at the time she wrote her own memoir ; but who can forget first impressions , or entirely conquer the prejudices instilled in childhood ? We must remember that this singular woman was educated in the bosom of the Catholic church , which , while it maintained many pure and blessed doctrines , had become extremely external in its promises , as well as its ceremonies . /z/ Mademoiselle Bouvier de la Motlc remained some time at the convent of the Ursulines , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This season of tranquil enjoyment was interrupted by the jealousy of the other half-sister , who tried by misplaced and excessive fondness to wean the child 's affections from her more judicious relative ; and finding that she could not destroy an influence , of which she had become extremely envious , she resorted to threats and severity . The child , unable to withstand her tyranny , was afraid to speak to her kind sister , who readily forgave the apparent ingratitude , which originated in fear of punishment . Her father being informed of this unpleasant state of things , again took her home . She was then about ten years old . After this she was placed for nearly a year at a convent of Dominican nuns . Here she had the chicken-pox , and was most of the time in her chamber with no companion but her Bible . When she again returned home , she suffered sadly under the tyranny of her spoiled and selfish brother , who lorded it over her upon all occasions , and was sure to be supported by his blindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head quite as quick as she was ordered . This unnatural state of things led almost unavoidably to habits of deception and peevishness , especially in a disposition so remarkably ductile , and so easily influenced by /q/ surrounding circumstances . She tells us that , at this period each day redoubled her faults . Her father , being frequently out of the house , was not aware how much she suffered ; and too much of fear seems to have mingled with her love for him , to admit of perfect confidence . Her mother was often teasing him with complaints to which he made no other reply , than " There are twelve hours in the day ; she will grow wiser . " When she completed her eleventh year she was sent to the convent of theUrsulines to partake of her first communion . Easily won by the mildness of her good sister , she returned to her quiet habits and religious inclinations . But the other sister again became jealous ; and her influence again had a tendency to wean her from good feelings and pious resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same pliability of character , which , however lovely in its proper place , becomes under some circumstances an absolute fault . As she grew taller , and became unusually beautiful , her mother 's vanity was aroused to take some interest in her . She had particular pride in dressing her , and introducing her into company . Early marriages are very common in France ; and as she appeared older than she really was , she had several suitors before she was twelve years old . During these temptations , she seems to have maintained a powerful struggle between her worldly inclinations and what she conceived to be her religious duty . /z/ A visit from a pious cousin , who was going to Cochin China with the idea of converting the inhabitants to the faith of his church , had a great effect upon her . She happened to be taking a walk at the time , and missed of seeing him ; but when they told her of his sanctity and his zeal , she wept continually . Early in the morning , she went to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , help me in my salvation . Alas ! am I the only person in our family to be lost 1 ' In this trait we detect a renewal of her desire for martyrdom , which had been so early taught her in the convent . She says , " I immediately applied myself to every part of my duty . I made a general confession with great compunction of heart . I frankly confessed all that I knew with torrents of tears . I became so changed , that I was scarce to be known . I would not for ever so much have made the least voluntary slip ; and they found not any matter for absolution when I confessed . I discovered the very smallest faults : and God did me the favor to enable me to conquer myself in many things . There were left only some remains of passion , which gave me some trouble to conquer : but as soon as I had , by means thereof , given any displeasure even to the domestics , I begged their pardon , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for anger is the daughter of pride . A person truly humbled suffers not anything to put him in a rage . As it is pride which dies the last MADAME GUYON. 15i in the soul , so it is passion which is last destroyed in the outward conduct . " " I followed my religious exercises . I shut myself up all the day to read and to pray . I gave all I had to the poor , I taught them the catechism ; and when my parents dined abroad , I made them eat with me , and served them with great respect . I read the works of St Francis de Sales and the life of Madame de Chantal . There I found that she made prayers . I begged of my confessor to teach me to make them ; and as he did not , I tried to make them myself as well as I could ; but without any success , as I then thought ; for I could imagine nothing , and yet persuaded myself , that prayer could not be made without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This difficulty gave me no small trouble , and that for a long time . I was nevertheless very assiduous therein , and prayed earnestly to God to give me the gift of prayer . All that I saw written in the life of Madame de Chantal charmed me ; and I was so much a child , that I thought 1 ought to do everything I saw in it . All the vows she had made , I made also ; as that , of ever aiming at the highest perfection , and of doing the will of God in everything . I was not yet twelve years of age : nevertheless I took the discipline according to my strength . " The discipline to which she alludes , was probably voluntary scourging , and other bodily austeri- /z/ ties not unfrequently practised by enthusiasts in the church of Rome . She had at this time a vehement desire to become a nun . She often stole away from her father 's house to the convent of the Visitation , begging them to receive her . Although the nuns desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as a temporal advantage , they did not dare to encourage it in the absence of her father ; whose love they knew would place an obstacle in the way of her wishes . Having in vain entreated her mother to exert her influence , before her father 's return , Mademoiselle de la Motte resolved to act upon the Jesuitical maxim , that wrong actions may be done for a good purpose ; she wrote a letter in her mother 's hand-writing , beseeching the nuns to receive her , and stated that illness prevented her from accompanying her daughter . As the ladies of the convent knew her mother 's hand-writing , this stratagem did not succeed . Her father , immediately after his return became violently ill ; and her mother was at the same time seriously indisposed . Her assiduous kindness at this time afTected her father 's heart very deeply . She does not tell us whether she urged him to consent to her becoming a nun ; but at all former times it had grieved him to hear the subject mentioned ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been still less pleasant to him . We are led to suspect that her own mind at this time wandered from the holy vocation . A very /q/ accomplished young gentlemen wished to marry her ; and her father made no other objection than his near relationship , which he feared would make it difficult to obtain a dispensation from the church . This young man was in the habit of reading a certain portion of the church-service every day ; and with great simplicity she informs us she left off her habit of prayer for the sake of reading with him ; telling her confessor that she had not time for both , and that of the two , she thought it better to discontinue prayer . Her confessor did not trouble himself about the matter , and gave his consent . She says , " This was to me the first inlet of evils . As soon as I left prayer , I became cold toward God ; my old faults revived , with a prodigious addition of vanity . The love I began to have for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up some share of the spirit of piety by seeking out the little shepherdesses , to instruct them in their religious duties ; but not being nourished by prayer , my interest in this soon decayed . I became more quick-tempered than I had ever been . I was frequently guilty of lying ; I felt my heart corrupt and vain ; the spark of divine grace was almost extinguished in me , and I fell into a state of indifference and indevotion ; though I still kept up the outside appearance with a good deal of care ; and the habit I was in , of being at church with modesty , made me appear better than I was . Vanity , which had been excluded out of my heart , now resumed its seat there . I began to pass a // good deal of my time before a looking-glass . I found so much pleasure in viewing myself in it , that I thought others were in the right who practised the same . Instead of making use of this exterior , which God had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it became to me only the means of a vain complacency . All seemed to me to look beautiful in my person , but I saw not that it covered a polluted soul . This rendered me so vain , that I doubt whether any ever exceeded me therein . " The high esteem I had for myself , made me find faults in every one else of my own sex . I had no eyes but to see my own good qualities , and to discover the defects of others . I hid from myself my own faults , or if I remarked any , yet to me they appeared little , in comparison of others . I excused and even figured them to myself as perfections . Every idea I had of others and of myself was false . I loved reading to excess , particularly romances ; spending great part of the night as well as the day , therein . I was uneasy till I got to the end of them ; and then had an insatiable desire for more of the like kind to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for if they caused no other hurt than the loss of time , is not that too much 1 I was not , however , restrained , but rather encouraged to read them , under the fallacious pretext , that they taught one to speak well . " While she was in these states of mind , her parents went to reside at Paris . Her youth , beauty , /q/ intelligence , and wealth , attracted attention , and she was immediately surrounded with temptations . She received many advantageous offers of marriage , which her parents , for various reasons , did not see fit to accept . She says , " God did not permit them to succeed , because he was unwilling to have me lost ; for had I married any of these persons , my vanity and pride would have had a wider circle to extend in . " Her parents , at last , decided for her , in a manner , that did not at all suit her inclination ; but she looks upon this cross , and all others , as blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which her desire for martyrdom was gratified . In January , 1664 , she married M. Jacques Guyon , whose father had amassed a large fortune by the enterprise of the Canal of Briare . At this time she was not quite sixteen years of age , and he was thirtyeight . He was subject to the gout , tyrannical , peevish , and jealous ; and like most people who have recently acquired wealth , he valued it highly , and expended it with caution . Young ladies in France had at that time so little free agency in matters of this sort , that Mademoiselle Bouvier de la Motte actually signed the marriage articles without being informed what they were . She caused masses to be said all the time , /z/ after she was betrothed , in hopes of knowing what was the will of God . Neither her worldly nor her religious feelings were gratified by this important event . Men of higher rank , and of great personal /z/ beauty , had proposed for her ; and she blushed to compare the lover her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollection of her former desire of being a nun came pouring upon her . When her friends called to congratulate her upon her marriage , she wept bitterly , and exclaimed , " Oh , why did they notlet me take the veil ? Why am I not a nun ! " These melancholy presentiments were verified by experience . Her wedded home was fof her a house of mourning . Her husband 's mother resided with them ; and she appears to have been a very parsimonious , passionate , narrow-minded woman . She soon conceived an aversion to her noble , and probably somewhat lavish daughter-in-law . We do not know how much cause she had for this prejudice ; for she has not written her memoirs to inform us of her actions , or her motives ; all that we know of her we learn from Madame Guyon , who appears to write with artlessness and candor . The poor bride , according to her own account , was scolded from morning to night . The elegance and politeness to which she had been accustomed in her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when she went out , the footman had orders to bring an account of everything she did . Her husband being ill with the gout , she gave up all innocent diversions to attend to him ; for which service she was generally rewarded by petulant complaints , and angry speeches . Her mother related to her mother-in-law what /q/ a troublesome child she had been , while at the same time she took a prejudice against her husband , and complained that she was weaned from her own family . Even her father at one time became cold toward her ; for not knowing the tyrannical restrictions under which she was kept , he blamed her for not spending more of her time with him ; and during all this , the poor young wife was too much afraid of her husband and her mother-inlaw , to confide her troubles even to her father . I think here was enough to satisfy the most earnest desire of martyrdom in a girl of sixteen . Her husband forbade her to leave his mother 's room without permission ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she often did not know what she was saying . People who called to see her , observed to each other , w Is this the young lady so famous for her wit ? Why , she can not say two words . She is a fine image . " Madame Guyon says , " Such heavy blows so impaired the vivacity of my nature , that I became like a Iamb that is shearing . I prayed to the Lord to assist me , and he was my refuge . As my age differed from theirs , ( for my husband was twentytwo years older than myself ) I saw well that there was no probability of changing their humors , which were fortified with years : 1 found that whatever I said was offensive , even things which others would have been pleased with . I knew not how to act . One day , weighed down with grief , about six months after I was married , being alone , I took a /z/ knife to cut out my tongue , in order not to be obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fresh matter of rage against me . This extravagant operation I had effected , if God had not stopped me short , and made me see my folly . I prayed continually ; I partook the communion ; I wished even to become dumb , so simple and ignorant was I. Though I have had my share of crosses , I never found any so difficult to support , as that of perpetual contrariety , without relaxation ; of doing all one can to please , without ever succeeding therein , but even still offending by the very means designed to oblige ; and being kept with such persons , in a most severe confinement , from morning till night , without daring to quit them . I have found that great crosses overwhelm , and stifle all anger at once . But such a continual contrariety irritates and stirs up a sourness at the heart . It has such a strange effect , that it requires the utmost violence and self-restraint not to break out into vexation and rage . " " I prayed for patience with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and overcame my resolution of being silent . This was doubtless permitted , lest my self-love should be nourished with the idea of my own patience . A momentary slip of this sort caused me months of humiliation and sorrow , and proved the occasion of new crosses . " During the first year of my marriage , I did not make a right use of my afflictions . I s od in /q/ such fear of my husband and my mother-in-law , that I sometimes resorted to deception to screen me from their anger . My vanity still continued . When in the streets I sometimes set aside my veil , and drew the gloves from my hands . I could not hear a beautiful woman praised without finding some fault with her , or artfully causing some disparaging remark . " The good sister , whose affectionate instructions had such a salutary effect upon her in her early life , died two months before this unhappy marriage ; and she was thus deprived of her advice and consolation . Repeated pecuniary losses served still more to irritate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mother would say to his wife , " We were always prosperous before we knew you ; all our trouble began when you came into the house . " Not long after her marriage , her mother died , and left nearly all the fortune , of which she had a right to dispose , to her favorite son . This was a new source of bitterness : M. Guyon was angry that his wife did not receive a larger share ; and she was continually reproached for a circumstance , over which she had not the least control . An existence so hopeless , and so full of trouble , drove Madame Guyon to the only true and lasting source of consolation . Her whole soul became absorbed in religion . While she was seeking for the right way , her mind was very powerfully impressed by a conversation between her cousin , who /z/ had relumed from Cochin China , and a very pious woman , whom we are led to suppose was a Quietist . Their spiritual language was something new to her . She began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observances . After much perplexity and distress , she sought advice from a priest , whom her father recommended to her for the remarkable sanctity of his life , and the spirituality of his views . She told him of her darkness and doubts . He replied , " It is , madam , because you seek without what you have within . Seek God in your heart , and you will find him . " She says , " These few words brought to my soul what I had been seeking for years . Oh , my Lord ! thou wast in my heart , and demanded only the turning of my mind inward , to make me feel thy presence . Thou wast so near , while I ran hither - and thither seeking thee , and yet found thee not . It was for want of understanding the words , ' The kingdom of God cometh not with observation , neither shall they say , Lo , here , or Lo there ; for the kingdom of God is within you . ' " " Nothing was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed away like moments , while I could hardly do anything else but pray . The fervency of my love allowed me no intermission . It was a prayer of rejoicing and of possession ; wherein the taste of God was so great , so pure , unblended and uninterrupted , that it drew and absorbed the powers of the soul into a profound recollection , without act or discourse . For I had now /q/ no sight but of Jesus Christ alone . All else was excluded , in order to love with the greater extent , without any selfish motives or reasons for loving . " Such was the prayer that was given me at once , which is far above ecstasies , transports , and visions . All these gifts are more subject to the illusion or transformation of the adversary . " It is of such that St Paul speaks , when he says , that Satan transforms himself into an angel of light , which is generally the case with such as are fond of visions , and lay a stress on them ; because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least to hinder it from humbly attending on God alone . " Ecstasies arise from a sensible relish , and may be termed a spiritual sensuality , wherein the soul letting itself go too far , by reason of the sweetness it finds in them , falls imperceptibly into a state of decay . The crafty enemy presents such kinds of interior elevations and raptures , for baits to betray the soul ; to render it sensual , to fill it with vanity and self-love , to fix its esteem and attention on the gifts of God , and to hinder it from following Jesus Christ in the way of renunciation , and of death to all things but him only . " But the immediate word of God never deceives . It is incapable of any error . It is Jesus Christ himself , the word which is never one moment mute or unfruitful ; it never ceases in the centre of the soul , when disposed for the hearing of it . It is efficacious in that soul in which it is received , and /z/ in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them fruitful to eternal life ; Christ himself becoming the life of such souls . " She now avoided going into company , ceased to curl her hair , and seldom allowed herself to look in the glass ; suffering her maid to dress her just as she pleased . Her only pleasure was to be alone and pray . This state of mind exasperated her family . Her calmness and resignation probably appeared to them like a contempt of their power , or an affectation of sanctity superior to their own . She says , " The treatment of my husband and mother-in-law , however rigorous and insulting , I now bore in silence , which was not difficult for me ; because the greatness of my interior occupation , and what passed within , rendered me insensible to all the rest ; yet there were times when I was left to myself ; and then I could not refrain from tears , when they fell violently on me . I did the lowest offices for them , to humble myself ; preventing such as had been used to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they were in a rage , though I could not find that I had given them any occasion for it , yet I did not fail to beg their pardon , and even from the girl I have spoken of . I had a good deal of pain to surmount myself , as to the last ; because she became the more insolent for it ; reproaching me with things which ought to have made her blush , and to have covered her with shame . As she saw that I contradicted and resisted her no more in anything , she proceeded to treat /z/ me still worse : and when I asked her pardon , for the very offences which she had given me , she triumphed , saying , ' I knew very well I was in the right . ' Her arrogance rose to that height , that I would not have treated the meanest servant , or vassal , as she treated me . " One day , as she was dressing me , she pulled me very roughly , and spoke to me very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on'my own account that I am willing to answer you ; for what you do tojme gives me no pain ; but lest you should act thus before persons to whom it would give offence : moreover as I am your mistress , God is certainly offended therewith . ' She left me that moment , and ran like a mad woman to meet my husband , telling him , ' she would stay no longer , I treated her so ill , and that I hated her for the care she took of him in his indispositions , wanting her not to do any service for him . ' As my husband was very hasty , he took fire at these words . I finished the dressing of myself alone , since she had left me , and durst not call another girl ; for she would not suffer another girl to come near me . All on a sudden , I saw my husband coming like a lion . Whatever fury he had at any time before against me , was not equal to this . He vented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he did not strike me , but in his rage threw his crutch at me , which fell very near , without touching me . The girl in the meantime came in . At the sight of her , his rage redoubled . I kept near to God during the whole time , in pro- /z/ found silence , as a victim disposed to suffer whatever he would permit . My husband at length ordered me to beg her pardon , which I readily did , and thereby appeased him . I went presently into my closet , where I no sooner was , ' than my divine Director impelled me to go out and make this girl a present , to recompense her for the cross which she had caused me ; which I did . She was a little astonished , but her heart was too hard to be gained . " I often acted thus , for she frequently gave me such opportunities . She had a singular dexterity in attending the sick ; for this reason , ( as my husband was very seldom in health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would suffer none but her to touch him . Moreover , she was so artful , that before him she affected an extraordinary respect for me : but when he was not present , if I said a word to her , though with the greatest mildness , if she heard him coming , she cried out with all her might , that she was unhappy ; and acted the distressed in such a manner , that without informing himself of the truth , he was irritated against me , as was my mother-in-law too . " The violence I did to my proud and hasty nature was so great , that I could hold out no longer . I was quite spent with it . It seemed sometimes as if I was inwardly rent , and I have often fallen sick with the struggle . She did not forbear exclaiming against me , even before persons of distinction , who came to see me . If I was silent , she took offence at that yet more , and said , ' I despised her . ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every body ; but all this redounded to my honor and her own disgrace : my reputation was so well established , on account of my exterior modesty , my devotion , and the great acts of charity which I did , that nothing could shake it . " Her husband complained of her devotion , saying , " You love God so much , that you no longer love me . " The world ridiculed her , and many whimsical stories were told at her expense . " It could not bear that a woman , who w r as scarce twenty years of age , should thus make war against it and overcome . " No wonder that people , who did not understand her , thought her insane ; for she says when compelled to go into company , her soul was often so much engaged within , that she could not speak , or even hear what was said to her . Her husband and mother-in-law tried to hinder her from praying . She says , " The method they took to effect it , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durst not go out from my mother-in-law 's chamber , or from my husband 's bed-side . Sometimes I carried my work to the window , under a pretence of seeing better , in order to relieve myself with some moments ' repose ; but they came to watch me very closely , to see if I did not pray instead of working . When my husband and mother-in-law played at cards , if I did but turn towards the fire , they watched to see if I continued my work or shut my eyes ; if they observed that I elosed them , they would be in a fury against me /z/ for several hours : but what is most strange , when my husband went abroad , having some days of health , he would not allow me to pray in his absence . He marked my work , and sometimes , after he had just gone out , returning immediately , if he found me in my closet , he would be in a rage . In vain I said to him , ' Surely , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I be assiduous in attending you when you are present 1 3 That would not satisfy him ; he insisted upon it that I should no more pray in his absence than in his presence . " I believe there is hardly a torment equal to that of being ardently drawn to retirement , and not having it in our power to be retired . But , oh my God , the war they raised , to hinder me from loving thee , did but augment my love ; and while they were striving to prevent my addresses to thee , thou drewest me into an inexpressible silence ; and the more they labored to separate me from thee , the more closely didst thou unite me to thyself : the flame of thy love was kindled , and increased , by everything that was done to extinguish it . " Often through compliance I played at piquet with my husband , and at such times was even more interiorly attracted than if I had been at church . I was scarce able to contain the fire which burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what men call love , but nothing of its impetuosity ; for the more ardent , the more peaceable it was . This fire gained strength from everything /q/ that was done to suppress it : and the spirit of prayer was nourished and increased from their contrivances and endeavors to disallow me any time for practising it . I loved , without considering of a motive or reason for loving ; for nothing passed in my head , but much in the innermost of my soul . I thought not about any recompense , gift , or favor , which he could bestow , or I receive . He himself was the ' only object which attracted my heart . I could not contemplate his attributes . I knew nothing else , but to love and to suffer . Oh , ignorance , more truly learned than any science of the doctors ; since it taught me so well Jesus Christ crucified , and brought me to be in love with his holy cross . I could then have wished to die , in order to be inseparably united to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this passed in the will , the imagination and the understanding being absorbed in it , in a union of enjoyment , I knew not what to say , having never read or heard of such a state as I experienced . " This happy state of mind did not continue without interruption ; in the path of regeneration she passed through night as well as day , and winter followed where the summer had been . Her old temptations returned with renewed strength ; they were sometimes victorious in the struggle , and left her to mourn in bitterness the triumph of self-love over religion . While in these dark states of mind , her husband , enjoying a brief respite from his almost continual illness , proposed a journey to Or- /z/ leans and Tourraine . She says , i ( In this journey , my vanity made its last blaze . I received abundance of visits and applauses . But how clearly did I perceive the folly of men , who are so taken with vain beauty ! I disliked the passion , yet not that in myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be delivered from it . The continual combat of nature and grace cost me no small affliction . Nature was pleased with public applause ; but grace made me dread it . What augmented the temptation was , that they esteemed in me virtue , joined with youth and beauty ; not knowing that all the virtue was only in God , and his protection , and all the weakness in myself . " I went in search of confessors , to accuse myself of my failings , and to bewail my backslidings : But they were utterly insensible of my difficulties . They esteemed what God condemned . They treated as a virtue , what appeared to me detestable in thy sight . Far from measuring my faults by thy graces , they only considered what I was , in comparison with what I might have been : hence , instead of blaming me , they only flattered my pride , and justified me in what incurred thy rebuke ; or only treated as a slight fault what in me was highly displeasing to thee , from whom I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be measured singly by their nature , but also by the state of the person who commits them ; as the least unfaithfulness in a spouse is more injurious to her husband /q/ than far greater ones in his domestics . I told them all the trouble I had been under , for not having entirely covered my neck ; though it was covered much more than by other women of my age . They assured me that I was very modestly attired : and as my husband liked my dress , there could be nothing amiss in it . My inward director taught me quite the contrary ; but I had not courage enough to follow him , and to dress myself differently from others . Beside , my vanity furnished me with pretences , seemingly just , for following the mode . Oh , if pastors knew what hurt they do in humoring female vanity , they would be more severe against it . Had I but found one , honest enough to deal plainly with me , I should not have gone on thus ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , siding with the declared opinion of others , induced me to think them in the right , and my own scruples to be mere fancy . " When she returned from this journey , she found her eldest son and her little daughter were likely to die of the small pox . Her father urged her to escape the infection , by coming to his house with her second son . Her mother-in-law opposed her removal , and the physician agreed with her , in saying that if she were disposed to have the disease , she would be no safer at her father 's , than at home . Madame Guyon looked upon this resistance as an order from heaven , and thought she ought to sacrifice herself to Divine Providence . She says , " I can not express what nature suffered ; for I was like /z/ one who sees both certain death and an easy remedy , without being able to avoid the former , or try the latter . At length nature , finding there was no resource , consented to the sacrifice , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gained ground fast . My whole body became like that of a leper . All who beheld me said they had never seen such a shocking spectacle . But my soul enjoyed a tranquillity not to be expressed . The hopes of gaining its liberty by the loss of that beauty , which had so frequently brought it under bondage , united me so closely to God , that I would not have changed my condition for that of the most happy prince in the world . I had often prayed that I might become ugly ; I was willing to be blind , and deaf , and dumb , for the love of God . " After my eldest son had in some degree recovered , he came into my chamber . His face , lately so fair and beautiful , had become like a coarse spot of earth , full of furrows . This gave me curiosity to look at myself in the glass . I felt shocked : God had ordered the sacrifice in all its reality . " They sent me pomatums to recover my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small-pox . I had seen wonderful effects from it upon others , and therefore at first had a mind to try them : But Love , jealous of his work , would not suffer it . There was a voice in my heart which said , ' If I would have had thee fair , I should have left thee as thou wert . ' I was therefore obliged to lay aside every remedy , ahd to go into the air , which made /q/ the pitting worse , and to expose myself in the streets to the eyes of every one , when the redness of the small-pox was at the worst , in order to make my humiliation triumph , where I had exalted my pride . " My husband kept his bed almost all that time , and made good use of his indisposition . Only , as he now lost that which before had given him so much pleasure in viewing me , he grew much more susceptible of impressions against me . In consequence of this , the persons who spoke to my disadvantage , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more frequently . There was only thou , oh my God , who changed not for me . Thou didst redouble thy interior graces , in proportion as thou didst augment my exterior crosses . " My waiting-maid became every day more haughty : and as the devil incited her to torment me , seeing that her scoldings and outcries did not now trouble me , she thought , if she could hinder me from going to the communion , she should give me the oreatest of all vexations . She was not mistaken , oh Divine Spouse of pure souls , since the only satisfaction of my life was to receive and to honor thee . As much as was in my power , I caused the churches to be well adorned . I gave everything , of the finest I had , to furnish them with ornaments , and contributed to the utmost extent of my abilities , to make them have silver plates and chalices . ' Oh , my Love , ' I cried , ' let me be thy /z/ victim ! Spare nothing to annihilate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced , and to become , as it were , a Nothing . " This girl then knew my affection for the holy sacrament , where , when I could have liberty for it , I passed several hours on my knees. * She took it into her head to watch me daily . When she discovered my going thither , she ran to tell my motherin-law and my husband . There needed no more to chagrin them . Their invectives lasted the whole day . If a word escaped me in my own justification , it was enough to make them say , I was guilty of sacrilege , and to raise an outcry against all devotion . If I made them no answer at all , that still heightened their indignation , and made them say the most grating things they could devise . If I fell sick , which often happened , they took occasion to come to quarrel with me in my bed , saying , my communions and prayers were what made me sick ; as if there had been nothing else could make me ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She told me one day in her passion , that she was going to write to him , who she thought was my director , to get him to stop me from going to the communion ; for that he did not know me . And when I made her no answer , she cried out as loud as she could , ' that I treated her ill , and despised * The Catholic churches in France are commonly open , and the communion table laid out , so that persons have continually an opportunity of resorting there , and performieg their devotions as in private . /q/ her . ' When I went out to go to prayers , ( though I had taken care before to order everything about the house ) she ran to tell my husband that I was going abroad , and had left nothing in order . When I returned home , rage fell on me in all its violence ; they would hear none of my reasons , but said , ' they were all a pack of lies . ' My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to wreck , and that if she did not take care , he would be ruined . ' He believed it , and I bore all with patience , endeavoring as well as I could , to do my duty . What gave me the most trouble was the not knowing what course to take ; for when I ordered anything without her , she complained ' that I showed her no respect , that I did things of my own head , and they were done always the worse for it . ' Then she would order them quite contrary : If I consulted her to know what , or how she would have anything to be done , she said , ' she must have the care and trouble of everything . ' " I had scarce any rest but what I found in the iove of thy will , oh my God , and submission to thy orders , however rigorous they might be . They incessantly watched my words and actions to find occasion against me . They chid me all the day long , continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even before the footmen . How oftea have I made my meals on my tears , which were interpreted as the most criminal in the world ! " Yet if I happened to be for some days free /z/ from the exterior cross , it was a most sensible distress to me , and indeed a punishment more difficult to bear than the severest trials . I then comprehended what St Teresa says , ' let me suffer or die . ' For this absence of the cross was so grievous to me , that I languished with the ardency of desire for its return .  --  But no sooner was this earnest longing granted , and the blessed cross returned again , than strange as it may seem , it appeared so weighty and burdensome , as to be almost insupportable . " Though I loved my father extremely , and he loved me very tenderly , yet I never spoke to him of my sufferings . One of my relations , who loved me much , perceived the little moderation they used toward me . They spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and told my father of it ; adding , that I should pass for a fool . Soon after , I went to see my father ; who , contrary to his custom , sharply reprimanded me , ' for suffering them to treat me in such a manner , without saying anything in my own defence , adding , every one talked of me for it ; that it loked as if I had neither sense nor spirit to vindicate myself . ' I answered , ' If they remarked what my husband said to me , that was confusion enough for me , without my bringing any more of it on myself by replies ; that if they did not remark it , I ought not to cause it to be observed , nor expose my husband 's weakness ; that remaining silent stopped all disputes ; whereas I might cause them to be continued and increased , by my replies . ' /q/ My father answered , ' I did well ; and that I should continue to act as God should inspire me : ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . " They were ever talking to me against myfather , whom I most tenderly loved and respected : against my relations , and all such as I esteemed most . I felt this more keenly than all they could say against myself . I could not forbear defending them , and therein I did wrong ; as whatever I said served only to provoke them . If any complained of my father or relations , they were always in the right . If any , whom they had disliked before , spoke against them , they were presently approved of . If any showed friendship to me , such were not welcome . A relation , whom I greatly loved for her piety , coming to see me , they openly bid her be gone , or treated her in such a manner as obliged her to it , which gave me no small uneasiness . When any considerable person came , they would be speaking against me ; even to persons who knew me not , which surprised them : but when they saw me they pitied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as often to forget things without ; yet not anything which was of consequence . My husband was hasty , and this inattention frequently irritated him . I walked into the garden , without observing anything there : and when my husband , who could not go thither , asked me about it , I knew not what to say ; at which he was angry . I went thither on purpose to remark everything , in order to tell him about them ; and /z/ yet when there , did not think of looking at them . I went ten times one day , to see and bring him an account of them , and yet still forgot it . But when I did remember to look at them , I was much pleased ; yet it generally happened I was then asked nothing about them . " When they were telling any news , to mortify my curiosity , I used , under some pretext or other , to retire . When my husband afterward would be talking to me about it , I betrayed my ignorance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rage against me , which I would gladly have avoided being the occasion of . I was very desirous of doing my duty , and rendering everything agreeable to him , so far as it was in my power . " All my crosses would have seemed little , if I might have had liberty to pray , and to be alone . But I was obliged still to continue in their presence , under such a subjection as is scarcely conceivable . My husband looked on his watch , if at any time I had liberty allowed me for prayer , to see if I stayed above half an hour . If I exceeded it , he grew very uneasy . Sometimes I said to him , ' Grant me one hour to divert and employ myself as I have a mind . ' And though he would have granted it to me for other diversions , yet for prayer he would not . I confess , inexperience caused me much trouble , and I have often thereby given occasion for what they made me suffer : for ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of the will of my God , to content myself therein , and to /q/ make contentment my only desire and prayer ? But I often fell back again into the anxiety of wishing to get time for prayer ; which was not agreeable to my husband . It is true , those faults were more frequent in the beginning . Afterwards , I prayed to God in his own retreat , in the temple of my heart , and then I went out no more . " " The most sensible cross to me was the revolting of my own son against me , whom they inspired with so great a contempt for me , that I could not see him without causing me severe affliction . When I - was in my chamber with some of my friends , they sent him to listen to what we said ; and as he saw this pleased them , he invented a hundred things to tell them . If I caught him in a lie , as frequently I did , he would upbraid me , saying , ' My grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I answered him , J Therefore I know the deformity of that vice , and how hard a thing it is to get the better of it : and for this reason I would not have you suffer the like . ' He spoke very offensive things to me ; and because he remarked the awe I stood in of his grandmother and his father , if in their absence I found fault with him for anything , he insultingly upbraided me , and said , @#@ That now I wanted to set up for his mistress , because they were not there . ' All this they approved of , insomuch as to strengthen him in his most perverse inclinations . One day , he went to see my father , and rashly began talking against me to him , as he was used to do to his grandmother . But therj it did /z/ not meet with the same reception . It affected my father to tears : he came to our house to desire he might be corrected for it . They promised it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly afraid of the consequences of so bad an education . " Another great cross was the difficulty I had in attending my husband . I knew he was displeased when I was not with him ; and yet when I was with him , he never expressed any pleasure in it , or anything I did . On the contrary , he only rejected with scorn whatever office I performed . He was so very uneasy with me about everything , that I sometimes trembled when I approached him . I could do nothing to his liking ; and when I did not attend him , he was angry . He had taken such a dislike to soups , that he could not bear the sight of them ; and those that offered them had so rough a reception , that neither his mother nor any of the domestics would carry them to him . There was none but myself , who did not refuse that office . I brought them to him , and let his anger pass : and then tried in some agreeable manner to prevail on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I waited with patience , after which I said to him , 1 1 had rather be reprimanded several times a day , than let you surfer by not bringing you what is proper . ' Sometimes he took them ; at other times pushed them back . But as he saw my perseverance , he would at length submit to take them . " When he was in good humor , and I was carrying /q/ something agreeable to him , then my mother-inlaw would snatch it out of my hands , and carry it herself . And as he thought I was not so careful and studious to please him , he would fly in a rage against me , and express great thankfulness to his mother . I silently suffered it all . I used all my skill and endeavors to gain my mother-in-law 's favor by my assiduities , my presents , my services ; but was not fortunate enough to succeed . How bitter and grievous , oh my God , would such a life be , were it not for thee ? But thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few very short intervals from this severe and mortifying life ; but these served only to make the reverses more keen and bitter . " Madame Guyon continues to repeat the petty domestic vexations which she every day encountered . In a worldly point of view , no doubt her family had some cause for the complaints they made ; for such a state of perfect abstraction as she describes must have withdrawn her sympathy from those around her , and made her appear indifferent to them and to their interests . Perhaps , too , she gave to the church and the poor more liberally than her husband approved . She says that her mother-in-law often told him that he would be ruined by his wife 's charities . He ordered her to give in a written account of all she expended . She expresses much surprise that her accounts balanced exactly with what he was willing to crive her , though she never included in them the sums she gave away . She probably /z/ denied herself some unnecessary indulgences , and thus obtained what she calls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no union between Madame Guyon and her husband . What she thought duties appeared to him like grievous faults . II is mother urged her to pray for the restoration of the wealth they had lost , as that would in her opinion be praying to some purpose ; and she was much vexed when her daughter-inlaw said she could not pollute her lips with a prayer for any of the dross of this earth . All who came to the house were obliged to listen to her invectives , and Madame Guyon , considering it to be her duty to bear the cross , never attempted to justify herself , even when left alone with the people who had heard her blamed . The inflamed state of her eyes , after the small-pox had left her , made it necessary for her to go to Paris to consult physicians , Now that her beauty was gone , the gay metropolis was no longer a place to be dreaded for its temptations . She says its throngs only served to draw her into deeper recollection , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While at the abbey of St Erasmus , during this visit , she was suddenly awaked at four o'clock in the morning , with a presentiment that her father was dead ; and her love for him was so great , that her heart was filled with sorrow . She told the Abbess why it was that she was thus afflicted ; on the evening of that day , a courier arrived to inform her that her beloved parent was /q/ supposed to be dying . Madame Guyon , though weak and ill , travelled all night , through a forest , where the road was so bad that she was frequently obliged to get out of the carriage ; she arrived , however , too late  --  her father was dead ; and on account of the excessive heat had been immediately buried . She saw his face no more , not even in death . Feeble and fatigued as she was , she experienced a holy calm that almost amounted to joy . She says she felt ashamed not to give such indications of grief as were naturally expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawned on her countenance ; and she felt that she could neither look nor talk as pious people sometimes think it salutary to do in such afflictions . About two o'clock in the morning after her return from her journey , she was roused from sleep to hear that her little daughter was dead . She thus describes this singular child : " She was my only daughter , as dearly beloved as truly lovely . She had so many graces , both of body and mind , conferred on her , that one must have been insensible not to have loved her . She had an extraordinary share of love to God . Often was she found in corners at prayer . As soon as she perceived me at my devotions , she came and joined me ; and if she discovered that I had been praying without her , she would weep bitterly , and cry , ' Ah , mamma , you pray but I do n't . ' When we were alone , if she saw my eyes closed , she would whisper , ' are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are praying /z/ to our dear Jesus ; ' and dropping on her knees before me , she would begin to pray too . She was several times whipped by her grandmother , because she said , ' She would never have any other husband but our Lord ; ' yet she could never make her say otherwise . She was innocent and modest as a little angel ; very dutiful and endearing , and withal very beautiful . Her father doated on her ; and to me she was very dear , much more for the qualities of her mind than those of her lovely person . I looked upon her as my only consolation on earth : for she had as much affection for me , as her brother had aversion and contempt . She died of an unseasonable bleeding : but what shall I say ? she died by the hands of Him who was pleased , for wise reasons , to strip me of all . " As her second son had died of the small-pox , none now remained but her eldest boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the course of the following year she gave birth to another son . Before she recovered from her illness , she was severely afflicted by hearing of the death of the holy woman , who had first aroused in her mind a desire to see those things which are spiritually discerned ; on this account she was in the habit of calling her Mother Granger . The loss of this holy friend was followed by a long period of darkness and despondency , as Madame Guyon herself expresses it , " her road was lonely and difficult , bounded by precipices , and entangled with thorns ; and she who had always guided her was gone . " /q/ About this time an affair of worldly business caused Madame Guyon a good deal of perplexity . She says , ( a certain person conceived so much malice against my husband , that he was determined to ruin him if possible . He found no other way to attempt it , but by entering into a private engagement with my brother ; by which he obtained a power to demand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two hundred thousand livres , which he pretended to make appear that my brother and I owed him . My brother signed the processes , upon an assurance given him , that he should not pay anything . I think his youth engaged him in what he did not understand . This affair so chagrined my husband , that I have reason to believe it shortened his days . He was so angry with me , though I was innocent that he could not speak to me but in a fury . He would give me no light into the affair , and I did not know in what it consisted . In the height of his rage , he said he would not meddle in it , but give me up my portion , and let me live as I could ; with many other things still more grating . On the other side , my brother would not stir in it , nor suffer it to be done . The day when the trial was to come on , after prayers , I felt myself strongly pressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even so as to discover and unravel all the turns and artifices of this affair , without knowing how I could have been able to do it . The first judge was so surprised to see the affair so very different from what he had /z/ thought it before , that he himself exhorted me to go to the other judges , and especially to the intendant , who was just then going to court , and was quite misinformed about the matter . God enabled me to manifest the truth in so clear a light , and gave such power to my words , that the intendant thanked me for having so seasonably come to undeceive and set him to rights in the affair . Had I not done this , he assured me the cause had been lost . And as they saw the falsehood of every article , they would have condemned the plaintiff to the costs , if it had not been so great a prince , who lent his name to the officers that deceived him . But to save the honor of the prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hereby the two hundred thousand livres were reduced to only one hundred and fifty . My husband was exceedingly pleased at what I had done : but my brother appeared as outrageous against me , as if I had caused him some very great loss . Thus moderately , and at once , ended an affair , which had at first appeared so very weighty and alarming . " It pleased God to bless Madame Guyon with another daughter to supply the place of that sweet creature , who had so early gone to the world of spirits . Before she had recovered her strength , she was called to attend upon her dying husband . The poor invalid scarcely knew ' any intermission of agony . Gout , fever , and gravel succeeded each other . He seemed to bear bodily pain with patience , /q/ but those about him frequently incensed him against his wife , and led him to treat her harshly . Yet he seems to have had a kind of love for her : When she was ill , his distress knew no bounds ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a violent passion with her accusers . Sometimes he even spoke kindly of the religious views , which had so much displeased him , and told her it was evident that God was ever with her . The last journey he was able to take , he insisted upon having none but her to accompany him ; and he one day said to her , " If they would not speak to me against you , I should be more easy , and you more happy . " Probably these few and rare indications of tenderness now came to Madame Guyon 's memory with redoubled power . She was distressed that his mother tried to keep her from his bed-side . She seized an opportunity , when her mother-inlaw was out of the way to kneel before him , and beg him to forgive her , if she had ever voluntarily done anything to displease him . He was much affected , and said , " It is I , who ought to ask your forgiveness . I did not deserve you . " From that time , he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice concerning what she had better do after his death . He died on Magdalen 's eve , 1676 . Madame Guyon considered this as a remarkable coincidence , because it was the anniversary of what she regarded as her spiritual marriage with the Lord . Be- /z/ ing much exhausted by her long attendance upon him , lie had insisted that she should take some rest ; and she was not with him at the last moment . When told that he had expired , she exclaimed , " Oh God , thou hast broken my bonds , and I will offer thee a sacrifice of praise ! " Her desire to give herself entirely up to religion no doubt prompted this speech ; but had she really loved him , she never could , in any state of mind , have thus expressed herself . Like many , who , in a common , but expressive phrase are called " comfortable mourners " she made up for the deficiency of her sorrow by the magnificence of his funeral . Her brother had always been estranged from her ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom to apply for advice or assistance . The income from her estate is said to have been above 40,000 livres per annum . She says , " I was ignorant of affairs : but God , who , independent of my natural understanding , had always made me fit for everything that pleased him , supplied me with such a perfect intelligence herein that I succeeded . I omitted not the least punctilio , and was surprised that in these matters I should know without ever having learned . I arranged all my papers , and regulated all my affairs , without the least assistance from any one . My husband had abundance of writings deposited in his hands . T took an exact inventory of them , and sent them severally to their owners , which without divine assistance , would have been very difficult /q/ for me ; because my husband having been a long time sick , everything was in the greatest confusion . This gained me the reputation of a skilful woman , as well as another affair which had occurred . " A great number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , applied to my husband to settle their affairs . Though it was not probably the business of a gentleman , yet they applied to him . because he had both understanding and probity ; and as he had a love for several of them , he consented . There were twenty actions , one upon another ; and in all twentytwo concerned , ' who could not put any end to their differences , by reason of new incidents continually falling out . My husband charged himself with getting lawyers to examine their papers , but died before he could make any procedure therein . After his death , I sent for them , to give them their papers : but they would not receive them , begging of me that I would accommodate them , and prevent their ruin . It appeared to me as ridiculous , as impossible , to undertake an affair of so great consequence , and which would require so long a discussion : nevertheless , relying on the strength and wisdom of God , I followed the movement he gave me , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my closet , for all these affairs , without ever going out , but to mass and to my meals . The arbitration was at length prepared , and they all signed it , without knowing what it contained . They were all so well satisfied therewith , /z/ that they could not forbear publishing it everywhere . It was God alone who did those things ; for when I had no more to do with those affairs , I knew nothing about them : and if I now hear any talk of such things , to me it sounds like Arabic . " My friends , and persons of the greatest distinction in the country , now came to advise me to remove , from my mother-in-law : for though I never complained of her , every one knew her humor . I answered , that I should account it my place and duty to stay with her , if she would permit me . The view that was given me , was not to go from the cross . Wherefore I resolved neither to leave my mother-in-law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This turbulent domestic , having received an annuity for her services to M. Guyon , became more haughty and troublesome than ever . Indeed , a too liberal use of wine sometimes made her furious . Nothing but a love of martyrdom could have induced Madame Guyon to keep her . She says , " I answered only with mildness and charity all her passionate invectives , giving her every possible mark of my affection . If any other maid came to wait on me , she would draw her back in a rage , crying out that I hated her , on account of the affection with which she had served my husband . When she had not a mind to come , I was obliged to serve myself ; and when she did come , it was to chide and make a noise . When I was very unwell , as was often the case , this girl would appear /q/ to be in despair . From hence I thought it was from thee , Oh Lord , that all this came upon me ; for without thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She seemed not sensible of any faults , but always to think herself in the right . All those , whom thou hast made use of to cause me to suffer , thought they were rendering service to thee in so doing . " These self-inflicted torments seem singular enough to us ; but in order to do Madame Guvon justice , we must remember that she was educated in a church that deemed self-scourging a penance for crime . The path of salvation appeared to her to lead only through the regions of sorrow and mortification . She kept the girl , because she thought her spirit needed a perpetual blister to sting it into pasiveness . Even so wise a man as Pascal made his body uncomfortable , by wearing a rough hairshirt , for the good of his soul . Madame Guyon constantly complained that all the austerities she could practise did not satisfy her ardent desire for suffering . The instruments of torture tore her delicate frame without giving her pain enough , as she thought : she therefore attended closely upon the sick , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her by her own choice , Madame Guyon was afflicted with a severe and lingering illness occasioned by watching four-and-twenty nights with her husband , before her strength was sufficiently renovated for such a task . At this time a strong desire /z/ for rest and tranquillity led her to wish earnestly for the stillness of the cloister . But she says , " I was tied , by having two children given me so short a time before my husband 's death . I saw Divine Wisdom in this ; for had my eldest son only remained , I should have placed him at college , and then have gone into the convent of the Benedictines ; and so stolen myself from the designs of God upon me . " She foresaw truly that her crosses would not fail , so lono- as her mother-in-law survived . The same system of petty annoyances was carried on from day to day . She likewise found powerful enemies among some of the priesthood . They preached publicly against her , as a person under a great delusion ; and her character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often present when sermons were preached directly against her , as one who had formerly been a bright pattern , but had now become a scandal to the church . She says , " I thought abundantly worse of myself than the world could say of me . When any blamed me , I agreed to it as right and just . Nature sometimes rebelled , and tried to get out of such an abject condition , but could find no way . If I tried to make an outward appearance of righteousness by ' the practice of some good thing , my heart rebuked me as guilty of hypocrisy ; and God did not permit me to succeed . " During this period of outward and inward desolation , she tells us that some gentleman of rank and influence proposed to marry her . She appears /q/ to have had a wonderful power of gaining the hearts of those who knew her , even after the smallpox had left but few remains of her former beauty . It is not difficult to account for this . Her figure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education had given her an easy gracefulness of manner , which must have been peculiarly fascinating , when combined with the quietude and placidity of her religious character . Those who have seen a thoroughly polite member of the society of Friends , can readily understand the winning influence that is produced , when the charms of the world and the spirit are united in one person . The bland expression of Madame Guyo 's countenance was always remarked by strangers . They frequently observed to her friends , " One needs but look at her , to perceive that God is in her soul . " Lonely as she was , and surrounded by enemies , it is not wonderful that honorable offers of marriage should at times have proved a strong temptation to Madame Guyon . She however resisted the natural desire for protection and sympathy , which her riiid views led her to consider an unpardonable weakness . She never spoke of her temptations , or her victories , on this subject ; though her mother-in-law often said to her , " If you do not marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Her connexion with this vexatious relative was a neverending series of difficulties and attempts at recon- /z/ ciliation . Madame Guyon says , what is probably true , " I , perhaps , caused crosses to her without intending it , and she to me without knowing it . " Madame Guyon never suffered herself to forget her numerous trials for a while , by going into company , or joining in any amusements . One day , she was very near the Queen , whom she had never seen , and whom she had a great desire to see ; but being unwilling to lose any opportunity for taking up the cross , she refused to look . She was extremely fond of music ; but , for the same reason , would not ask any one to play , or sing . She reproaches herself for having sometimes followed the promptings of nature , by inquiring what people said against her . Several months after she became a widow , she visited a nun in a state of melancholy pronounced to be insanity . By her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restored her to health and cheerfulness . She says , " This was the beginning of the gift of discerning spirits , which I afterwards received more fully . " It is now necessary to introduce a person , who , though united to her merely by spiritual sympathy , is frequently mentioned in her memoir , and had considerable influence on her destiny . Father la Combe was a Catholic priest , whose conversation was so agreeable to M. Guyon , that he had often sent for him . During these visits , the priest being struck with the holy expression of Madame Guyon 's countenance , was led to talk with her /q/ frequently upon religious subjects . The result was , that he became a convert to her views . After this period she occasionally speaks of letters from him , to herself and others , which proved to her a most wonderful sympathy in their religious states of mind , at different times , while they were at a great natural distance from each other . Her own mention of Father la Combe , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to be obtained concerning their acquaintance . In 1680 , it was suddenly impressed upon Madame Guyon 's mind that she ought to go to Geneva , to erect an establishment for all such as should be willing truly to serve God , and give themselves up to him without reserve . This at first filled her with alarm ; for Geneva was the great resort of the disciples of Calvin ; and she feared that she was called upon to wander from the Catholic church into the paths of heresy . When she told the Bishop her design of forming such an establishment , he highly approved of it , and informed her that some new Catholics were going to establish themselves at Gex , and she could join them . She had dreamed that a woman came down from heaven , and told her she must go to Geneva ; she therefore answered the Bishop , " My vocation is not for Gex ; it is for Geneva . " He told her that she might easily go from one place to the other . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making her journey less difficult . She wrote to Father la Combe to pray for her on Magdalen 's Eve , consc-/z/ crated to her imagination by being the anniversary of what she considered her spiritual marriage with the Lord . While at prayer , it was impressed upon her mind thrice over , " Ye shall both dwell in one and the same place . " A prophecy which she thinks was afterward fulfilled , both in the inward and outward sense ; they having been called to the same part of the country , and been united in the same religious experience , and the same persecutions . With regard to her " vocation for Geneva , " she gives the following account : " I was obliged to go to Paris about some business .  --  Having entered into a church , that was very dark , I went up to the first confessor I found , whom I did not know , nor have ever seen since . I made a simple and short confession ; but to the confessor himself I said not a word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know not who you are , whether maid , wife , or widow ; but I feel a strong inward motion , to exhort you to do what the Lord has made known to you , that he requires of you . I have nothing else to say . 5 I answered him , ' Father , I am a widow who have little children . What else could God require of me , but to take due care of them in their education . ' He replied , ' I know nothing about this . You know if God manifests to you that he requires something of you ; there is nothing in the world which ought to hinder you from doing his will . One must leave children to do that . ' This surprised me much . However , I told him nothing of what I felt for Geneva . /q/ I disposed myself submissively to quit everything , if God required it of me . I did not look upon it a good I aspired to , or a virtue I hoped to acquire , or as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some return on God 's part ; but only gave myself up to be led in the way of my duty , whatever it might be ; feeling no distinction between my own will and the will of God in me . " At my return from Paris , I left myself in the hands of God ; resolved not to take any step , either to make the thing succeed or to hinder it , either to advance or retard it , but singly to move as he should be pleased to direct me . I had mysterious dreams , which portended nothing but crosses , persecutions , and afflictions . My heart submitted to whatever it should please God to ordain . I had one which was very significant . " Being employed in some necessary work , I saw near me a little animal which appeared to be dead . This animal I took to be the envy of some persons , which seemed to have been dead for some time . I took it up , and as I saw it strove hard to bite me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I cast it away ; but found thereupon that it filled my fincrers with sharp-pointed prickles like needles . I came to one of my acquaintance to get him to take them out ; but he pushed them deeper in , and left me so , till a charitable priest of great merit , ( whose countenance is still present with me , though 1 have not yet seen him , but believe I shall before I die ) took this animal up with a pair of pincers. 19G m ; adame guyon . As soon ns lie held ' it Fast , those sharp prickles fell off , of themselves . Then I found that I easily entered into a place which before had seemed inaccessible . And though the mire was up to my girdle , in my way to a deserted church , I went over it without getting defded . It will be easy to see in the sequel what this signified . " Doubtless you will wonder that I , who make so little account of things extraordinary , relate dreams . I do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having promised to omit nothing of what should come into my mind ; secondly , because it is the method God makes use of to communicate himself to faithful souls , to give them foretokens of things to come , which concern them . Thus mysterious dreams are found in many places of the holy scriptures . " As might naturally be expected , in a mind like hers , these mysterious impressions were obeyed . She resolved to go to Geneva ; and made the necessary arrangements in secret . Her mother-in-law at this time became very kind to her , and professed much affection , saying she had " great respect for her virtue . " Perhaps this was in consequence of her discovering the advantageous matrimonial offers that had been rejected ; or it might be that she had some suspicion of her design of leaving the country . Madame Guyon 's love for her children was the greatest obstacle in the way of her project . Her little daughter she intended to take with her ; but /q/ she was anxious about her younger son , fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says " the laws of her sacred marriage compelled her to give up everything , and to follow her spouse whithersoever it was his pleasure to call her . " In July , 1681 , she went off secretly , " in a state of strange renunciation , and in great simplicity ; scarcely able to give a reason for quitting her family in such a manner . " The world in general blamed her severely , and her enemies raised the report that she had carried away her fortune to give to the relations of Father la Combe . She took with her nine thousand livres . Six thousand she loaned to the new Catholics , who were to be established at Gex ; this money was afterward paid to her children . The remaining three thousand she gave to the nuns who travelled with her ; she even put her clothes into the common stock . She reduced herself to such poverty , ( she had always had a desire to take up the cross of poverty ) that when a beggar by the way asked alms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another she gave a plain gold ring , which she had worn in token of her spiritual marriage . She had with her on this journey her little daughter , and two maid-servants . She tells the following anecdote of her child 's behaviour while they were crossing the river in a boat : # " It was surprising that , without adverting to /z/ wh.it she did , she could not forbear making crosses ; employing a person to cut her bulrushes for that purpose . She then put round me , all over , above three hundred of them . I let her do it , and inwardly apprehended that it was not without its mystery . I felt an interior certainty that I was going to meet with crosses in abundance : and that this child was sowing the cross for me to reap it . Sister Gamier , who saw that they could not restrain her from covering me with crosses , said to me , ' What that child does appears to be mysterious ; ' and turning to the little girl , she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ' ' No , she replied , ' they are all for my dear mother ; ' but she gave her one to stop her importunity , then continued putting more on me : after which , she desired some river-flowers , which floated on the water , to be given to her ; and braiding a garland , she put it on my head , and said to me , ' after the cross you shall be crowned . ' I admired all this in silence , and offered myself up to the pure love of God , as a victim , free and willing to be sacrificed to him . " On the journey her daughter became very ill , and was worn away almost to a skeleton . The natural feelings of the mother returned with great pow r er . She looked upon her child as a victim imprudently sacrificed by her . The Catholic clergy are authorized , by the rules and practices of their church , to have a paternal power and care over each member of their flock . In this time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Combe to go to them and offer all the consolation in his power . She says , " As soon as I saw that father , I was surprised to feel an interior grace , which I may call communication ; and such as I had never had before with any person . It seemed to me that an influence of grace came from him to me , through the innermost of the soul ; and returned from me to him , in such a manner that he felt the same effect . Like a tide of grace it caused a flux and reflux , flowing on into the divine and invisible ocean . This is a pure and holy union , which God alone operates , and which has still subsisted , and even increased between us . It is a union exempt from all weakness , and from all self-interest , which causes those , who are blessed w r ith it , to rejoice in beholding themselves , as well as those beloved , loaded with crosses and afflictions ; a union which has no need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence makes not more absent , nor presence more present ; a union unknown to all men but such as are come to experience it : nor can it ever be experienced but between such souls as are united to God . As I never before felt such a union of this kind with any one , it then appeared to me quite new , having never heard of the like . I had no doubt of its being from God ; so far from turning the mind from him , it tended to draw it more deeply into him . It dissipated all my pains , and established me in the most profound peace . " Father la Combe advised her to place the child /z/ under the care of the Ursulines at Tonon , and to separate from the new Catholics ; foi he had long had an impression it was not the will of God thai she should unite with them . This coincided with her own views ; she had from the first complained of great darkness ; md difficulty with regard to engaging with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to Geneva ; ' and to take some little room , without any noise , and without declaring myself at first : and as I knew how to make up all sorts of ointments , to heal wounds , and especially the king 's evil , of which there is abundance in that place , and for which I had a most certain cure , I hoped easily to insinuate myself by this way ; and with the charities which I should have done , to have won over many of the people . " " 1 carried my little daughter to the Ursulines at Tonon . That poor child took a vast fondness for Father la Combe , saying , ' He is a good father , one from God . ' Here I found a hermit , whom they called Anselm . He was a person of the most extraordinary sanctity , that had appeared for some time . He was from Geneva ; and God had miraculously drawn him from thence , at twelve years of age . He had ( with the permission of the cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at nineteen years of age taken the habit of hermit of St Augustine . He and another lived alone in a little hermitage , where they saw nobody but such /q/ as came to visit their chapel . lie had lived twelve years in this hermitage , never eating anything but pulse with salt , and sometimes oil . Three times a week he lived on bread and water . He never drank wine , and generally made but one meal in twenty four hours . He wore for a shirt a coarse hair cloth , and lodged on the bare ground . He lived in a continual state of prayer , and in the greatest humility . God had done by him many signal miracles . " This good hermit had a great sense of the designs of God on Father la Combe and me . But God showed him at the same time that strange crosses were preparing for us both , and that we were both destined for the aid of souls . I did not find , as I expected , any fit place for my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself like Abraham when gomcr to sacrifice his son .  --  Father la Combe , accosting me here , said , ' Welcome , daughter of Abraham ! ' I found little encouragement to leave her there , and could still worse keep her with myself , because we had no room , and the little girls , whom they took took to make Catholics , were all mixed with us , and had contracted such habits as were pernicious . To leave her there I thought not right . The language of the country , where scarce any one understood French , and the food , which she could not take , being so far different from ours , were great hardships . All my tenderness for her was awakened , and I looked on myself as her destroyer . I experienced what /z/ Hagar suffered , when she put away lier son Ishmacl in the desert , that she might not be forced to see him perish . I thought if I had ventured to expose myself , I ought at least to have spared my daughter ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to me inevitable . Everything looked black in regard to her . " I thought that , with her naturaldisposition and fine qualities , she might have shone and attracted admiration , if educated in France , and been likely to have such offers of marriage , as she could never hope to meet with in this poor country , in which , if she should recover , she would never be likely to be fit for anything . Here she could eat nothing of what was prepared for her . All her subsistence was only some spoonfuls of unpleasant and disagreeable broth , which I forced her to take against her will . I seemed like a second Abraham , holding the knife over her to destroy her . Our Lord would have me make a sacrifice to him , without any consolation ; and plunged in sorrow , night was the time which gave vent to it . He made me see , on one side , the grief of her grandmother , if she should hear of her death , which she would impute to my taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be accounted among all the family . The gifts of nature she was endowed with , were now like pointed darts which pierced me . I believe that God so ordered it , to purify me from too human an attachment , which was still so ready to stick close to me . For after I returned /q/ from the Ursulines at Tonon , they changed her manner of diet , and gave her what was suitable to her delicacy ; whereby , in a short time she recovered . " As soon as it was known in France , that I was gone , there was a general outcry . Those who attacked me with the most violence upon it , were the human spiritualists ; Father de la Mothe* wrote to me , that all persons of learning , of piety , the gown and the sword , united in censuring me . To alarm me still more , he informed me that my mother-in-law , with whom I had trusted my younger son , and my children 's substance , was fallen into a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered all these thundering letters as the spirit dictated . My answers were thought very just , and were well relished ; whereby those violent exclamations were soon changed into applauses . Father la Mothe appeared to change his censures into esteem ; but it did not hold long . Self-interest threw him back again ; being disappointed in his hopes of a pension , which he expected I would have settled on him . Also sister Gamier , whatever was her reason , changed and declared against me . " Here I both ate and slept little . The food which was given us was rotten and full of worms , by reason of the great heat of the weather , and being /z/ kept too long ; insomuch that what I should have formerly beheld with abhorrence now became my only nourishment ; and yet everything was rendered easy to me . In God I found , with increase , everything which I had lost for him . That spirit , which I once thought I had lost in a strange stupidity , was restored to me with inconceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nothing which it was not fit for , or in which it did not succeed . Those who observed it said , ' I had a prodigious capacity . ' Though I well knew that I had but a poor one ; but that in God my spirit had received a quality which it never had before . I thought I experienced something of the state which the Apostles were in , after they had received the Holy Ghost . I knew , comprehended , I understood , I was enabled to do everything requisite , I had every sort of good thing , and no want of anything . I remembered that fine passage of wisdom , All good things came to me with her . Wisdom of Sol . vii . 2 . When Jesus Christ the eternal wisdom is formed in the soul , after the death of the first Adam , it finds in him all good things communicated to it . ft , " Some time after my arrival at Gex , the Bishop of Geneva came to see us . He was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not forbear expressing it . He opened his heart to me on what God required from him . He confessed to me his own deviations and infidelity . Every time 5 when I spoke to him , he entered into what I said , /q/ and acknowledged it to be the truth ; as indeed it was the spirit of truth , ' which inspired me to speak to him , without which I should be only a mere simpleton . And yet as soon as persons who sought for pre-eminence , and could not suffer any good but what came from themselves , spoke to him , he was so weak , as to let himself be imposed on with impressions against the truth . This foible , with others , has hindered him from doing all the good , which otherwise he might have done in his diocese . " After I had spoken to him , he said , ' he had it in his mind to give me Father la Combe for director ; for that he was a man illuminated of God , who well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pacifying souls . ' These were his own words . Greatly was I rejoiced , when the Bishop appointed him ; seeing thereby his authority united with the grace , which already seemed to have given him to me , by union and effusion of supernatural life and love . The fatigues I had , and watchings with my daughter , threw me into a violent disorder , attended with exquisite pains . The physicians judged me in danger , and yet the sisters of the house quite neglected me ; especially her who had the care of the economy ; she was so penurious , that she did not give me what was necessary to sustain life . I had not a penny to help myself with , as I had reserved nothing to myself . And beside , they at times received all the money which was remitted me from France , which was very considerable . Thus I prac'id poverty , and was in /z/ necessity even among those to whom I had given all .  --  They wrote to Father la Combe , desiring him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On hearing of my condition , he was so touched with compassion , as to walk on foot all night , it being eight leagues ; in that , as in everything else , endeavored to imitate our Lord Jesus Christ . " As soon as he entered the house , my pains abated ; and when he had prayed and blessed me , laying his hand on my head , I was perfectly cured , to the great astonishment of my physicians , who were not willing to acknowledge the miracle ; being not well pleased , as they knew that we were come on a religious motive , and their sentiments and profession were so opposite to ours . These sisters themselves advised me to go to my daughter , to take milk for a fortnight . Father la Combe returned with me . A violent storm arose on the lake , which made me very sick , and seemed likely to overset the boat . But the hand of Providence remarkably appeared in our favor ; so much that it was taken notice of by the mariners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saint . Thus we arrived at Tonon , where I found myself so perfectly recovered , that , instead of making and using the remedies I had proposed , I went into a retreat , * and stayed there twelve days . Here I made vows of perpetual chastity , poverty , and obedience ; to wit , readily to obey whatever I should * What the Catholics call a retreat is a voluntary and total seclusion from the world for a time . /q/ believe to be the will of God , also to obey the church , and to honor Jesus Christ in such a manner as he pleased . " I rose constantly at midnight , ever waking timely enough to do it : if I wound up my alarm-watch , then I used not to wake in time . I saw that God had the care of a father and a spouse over me . When I had any indisposition , and my body wanted rest , I did not awake , but at such times I felt even in my sleep a singular possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only a kind of half-sleep ; but my soul waked the more for God , as sleep seemed to steal from it every other attention . The Lord had made it known to many persons , that he designed me for a mother of a great people ; but a people simple and child-like . They took these intelligences in a literal sense , and thought it related to some institution or congregation ; but to me it appeared nothing else , than the persons whom it pleased God that I should afterwards win over to him , to whom I should serve as a mother , through his goodness : giving them the same union of affection for me as that of children for a parent , but a union much deeper and stronger : and giving me all that was necessary for them , to bring them to walk in the way by which he would lead them . " After I finished my retreat with the Ursulines at Tonon , I returned through Geneva ; and having found no other means of conveyance , the French Resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to - , ) l HADAME QUYON. ride n horseback , I made Borne difficulty of doing it : but he having assured me thai it was a very quiet horse , I ventured to mount him . There was a sort of smith , who , looking at me with a wild hazard look , . struck the horse a blow on the back , just as I had got upon him , which made him give a leap . He threw me on the ground with such force that they thought I was killed . I fell on my temple . My cheek-bone was broken , and two of my teeth driven into my head . I was supported by an invisible hand : and in a little time I mounted as w r ell as I could on another horse , and had a man by my side to keep me up . " My relations left me in peace at Gex , testifying their esteem for me : and as they had heard at Paris of my miraculous cure , it made a great noise there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I received letters from Mademoiselle De Lamoignon , and another young lady , who w 7 as so moved with my answ T er , that she sent me a hundred pistoles for our house , and let me know beside , ' that when we wanted money , I had only to write to her ; and that she would send me all I could desire . ' They talked in Paris of printing an account of the sacrifice I had made , and inserting in it the miracle of my sudden recovery . I do not know what prevented it : but such is the inconstancy of the creature , that this journey , which drew upon me at that time so much applause , has served for a pretext for the strange condemnation which has since passed upon me. /q/ " My near kinsfolks did not signify any eager desire for my return . The first thing they proposed to me , a month after my arrival at Gex , was not only to give up my guardianship , but to make over all my estate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This proposition , coming from those who regarded nothing- but their own interest , to some might have appeared very unpleasing : but it was in no wise so to me . I had no friend to advise with . I knew not any one , whom I could consult about the manner of executing the thing , as I was quite free and willing to do it . It appeared to me that I had now the means of accomplishing the extreme desire T had of being conformable to Jesus Christ , poor , naked , and stripped of all . They sent me an article to execute , which had been drawn under their inspection , and I accordingly signed it , not perceiving some clauses which were inserted therein . It expressed that , when my children should die , I should inherit nothing of my own estate , but it should devolve to my collateral kindred . There were many other things , which appeared to be equally to my disadvantage . Though what I had reserved to myself was sufficient to support me in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some others . I then gave up my estate with more joy , ( being thereby conformed to Jesus Christ , ) than they could have who obtained it from me . It is what I have never repented of , nor had any uneasiness about . What pleasure to lose all , and quit everything lor /z/ God ! The love of poverty thus contracted , is the kingdom of tranquillity . " I forgot to mention , that towards the end of my miserable state of privation , when just ready to enter into newness of life , our Lord illuminated me so clearly to see that the exterior crosses came from him , that I could not harbor any resentment against the persons who procured me them . On the contrary , I felt the tenderness of compassion for them , and had more pain for those which I innocently caused to them , than for any which they had heaped upon me . I saw that these persons feared God too much too oppress me as they did , had they known it . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they suffered , through the contrariety of their humors . It is hard to conceive the tenderness which God gave me for them , and the desire which I have had to procure them every sort of advantage . " After the accident which befel me , of the fall from the horse , from which I soon wonderfully recovered , the devil began to declare himself more openly my enemy , to break loose and become more outrageous . One night , when I least thought of it , something very monstrous and frightful presented itself . It seemed a kind of face , which was seen by a glimmering bluish light . I know not whether the flame itself composed this horrible appearance , for it was so mixed and passed by so rapidly , that I had not time to examine it . My soul rested in its calm situation and assurance , and it appeared no more . As I rose at midnight to pray , I then /q/ heard frightful noises in my chamber , and after I had lain down they were still worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour at a time , and the paper sashes were all burst . Every morning while this continued , they were found shattered and torn , yet I felt no fear . I rose and lighted my wax candle at a lamp which I kept in my chamber , because I had taken the office of sacristan , ( or vestry nun ) and the care of waking the sisters at the hour they were to rise , without having once failed in it for my indispositions ; ever being the first in all the observances : I made use of my little light to look all over the chamber , and at the sashes , at the very time the noise was strongest : as he saw that I was afraid of nothing , he left off all on a sudden , and attacked me no more in person : but he stirred up men against me , and that succeeded far better with him : for he found them disposed to do what he prompted them to , zealously , inasmuch as they counted it a good thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sisters , whom I had brought , a very beautiful girl , contracted an intimacy with an ecclesiastic , who had authority in this place . At first he inspired her with an aversion for me , being well assured that if she placed confidence in me , I should advise her not to suffer his visits so frequently . As she was about undertaking a religious retreat , the ecclesiastic was desirous to induce her to make it with them , in order to crain her entire confidence , which would have served as a cloak to /z/ his frequent visits . The Bishop of Geneva had given Father la Combe for director to our house , and as he was going to cause retreats to be made , I desired her to wait for him . As I had gained some share in her esteem , she submitted thereto even against her inclination , which was to have made it under this ecclesiastic . I began to talk to her on the subject of inward prayer , and drew her into the practice of this duty . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( one of good parts ) gave herself to God in right earnest , and with her whole heart : and the retreat completely won her over . She then became more reserved , and on her guard , towards this ecclesiastic , which exceedingly vexed him . It enraged him both against Father la Combe and me . This proved the source of the persecutions , which afterwards befel me . The noise in my chamber ended as that commenced . ' * This ecclesiastic began to talk privately of me , with much contempt . I knew it , but took no notice . There came a certain friar to see him , who mortally hated Father la Combe , on account of his regularity . These combined together to force me to quit the house , and to become masters of it themselves . All the means they could devise they studied for that purpose . " I had two maids of my own with me to serve me : yet as the community had need of one of them for their cook , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave them up , not thinking but they /q/ would allow them to serve me sometimes , and assist me in things I was not able to do myself ; for besides this , I let them still receive all my income , they having had already my first half of this year 's annuity ; and yet they would not permit either of my maid-servants to do anything for me . By my office of sacristan , I was obliged to sweep the church , which was large , and they would not let any one help me in it . I have several times fainted away over the broom , and have been forced to rest myself in little corners , quite spent . This obliged me to beg them , that they would suffer it sometimes to be swept by some of the lusty country girls which were there , new Catholics , which at last they had the charity to consent to . But what most embarrassed me was , that I never had washed , and was now obliged to wash all the vestry linen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because in attempting it by myself , I had done up the linen most awkwardly . But these sisters pulled her by the arms out of my chamber , telling her she should do her own business . I let it quietly pass , without making any objection to it . The other good sister , the girl I just mentioned , grew more and more fervent , by the practice of prayer , in her dedication of herself to the Lord , and more and more tender in her sympathy with me , which irritated this ecclesiastic ; insomuch that , after all his impotent attempts here , he went off to Annecy , in order to sow discord , and to effect more mischief to Father la Combe . " The Bishop of Geneva was displeased at the /z/ Dumber of proselytes she gained , Baying she won everybody to herself ; aud he wished she was out of his diocese . Finding herself unhappy at Gex , and in declining health , Madame Guyon retired to the convent of the Ursulines , where she had placed her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Combe , because he thought he did not use his influence to induce her to remain at Gex , and devote all the donations she received to the establishment of new Catholics . The most scandalous stories were soon circulated concerning Father la Combe and Madame Guyon , which appear to have distressed him much more than they did her . The sisterhood at Gex , angry at her departure , left no stratagem untried to prejudice the Ursulines against her , as a heretic , an enthusiast , and one guilty of very scandalous things . Her little daughter became very ill of the small-pox and the purples , and it was thought she would die . Father la Combe came and prayed with her , and blessed her , and she immediately recovered . She repeats an event which happened at this time , in order to show her entire trust in Providence . " I had sent for a pretty considerable bundle of things from Paris for my daughter . I heard they were lost on the lake , and could learn no further tidings about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always thought they would be found . The man who had taken /q/ the charge of them , made a search after them a whole month , in all the environs without hearing any news about them . At the end of three months , they were brought to me , having been found in the house of a poor man , who had not opened them , nor knew who brought them thither . Once , I had sent for all the money which was to serve me a whole year ; the person who had been to receive cash for the bill of exchange , having put that money in two bags on horseback , forgot that it was there , and gave the horse to a little boy to lead . The money fell from the horse in the middle of the market at Geneva . That instant I arrived , coming on the other side ; and having alighted from my litter , the first thing I found was my money , in walking over it : what was surprising , a great throng was in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things have attended me. " u Often , during my husband 's lifetime when I have been going out to prayers , the weather was so cloudy , that the girl I took with me , said , I could not go ; or if I did , I should be soaked with the rain . ' I answered her with my usual confidence , * God will assist us . ' I generally reached the chapel without being wet : but when I had arrived there , the rain fell excessively . During several years that I have acted in this manner , I have never been deceived when I confided in God . When I was in town , and could find nobody up to be seen , I was surprised that there came to me priests , to ask me if I was willing to receive the communion , and /z/ that if I were , they would give it to me . I had no mind to refuse , oh my Lord , the opportunity which thou thyself offeredst me ; for I had no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before I had contrived to get divine service at the chapel , I have often suddenly awaked with a strong impulse to go to prayers . My maid would say to me , ' But , madam , you are going to tire yourself in vain . There will be no service there . ' For that chapel was not yet regularly served : however I went full of faith ; and at my arrival have found them just ready to begin . If I could particularly enumerate the remarkable providences , which were hereupon given in my favor , there would be enough to fill up whole volumes . " When I was at our country house , before the chapel was built , I retired for prayer to woods and caverns . How many times , here , has God preserved me from dangerous and venomous beasts ! Sometimes , at unawares , I kneeled upon serpents , which were there in great plenty ; and they fled away , without doing me any harm . Once I happened to be alone in a little wood , wherein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these animals , and they for me , to such a degree as to single me out among several persons , and run after me . Every one cried out for fear ; but , without offering me the least hurt , he betook himself to flight . If I could recount all the providences of God , in my favor , it would appear wonderful : they were indeed so frequent and so continual , that I could not but be astonished at them . " /q/ While with the Ursulines , she had an impulse to write ; and though she knew not what to say , and had not one idea to begin with , when she took her pen the matter flowed copiously , nay , impetuously . She speaks of it , as a divine impulse , hard to contain or bear . More worldly writers than Madame Guyon have taken pen in hand in utter despair of knowing what to write , and have , like her , been urged onward by a sudden and overflowing inspiration , for which the fingers could not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who writes eloquently , has experienced this sensation of being propelled by a power out of himself , that would not always come and go at his bidding . The book which Madame Guyon wrote at this time was a treatise on the interior path of faith , under the comparison of torrents and rivers : it is called The Torrents . There was a girl in the convent over whose mind Madame Guyon obtained great power . This girl fell grievously ill . One day , Madame Guyon felt moved to say to her , " Arise from thy bed and be no longer sick ! " She rose , and was cured . The sisterhood attributed her disorder to the vapors  --  not so Madame Guyon . She says , " It was then 1 learned what it was to command by the the Word , and to obey by the Word . It was Jesus Christ in me , equally commanding and obeying . " " Miracles require the consent , or at least that there be no opposition , of the party on whom they are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people whom lie healed , ' Are ye icilUng to be healed ? ' 11 I have at sundry times experienced , and felt in myself , how much God respects the freedom of man , and even demands his free concurrence ; for when I said , ' Be healed , ' or , ' Be free from your troubles ; ' if such persons acquiesced therein , the Word was efficacious , and they were healed . If they doubted , or resisted , though under fair pretexts , as saying , ' I shall be healed when it pleases God , I will not be healed till he wills it ; ' or , in the way of despair , ' I can not be healed , I will not quit my condition ; ' then the word had no effect . I felt in myself , that the Divine virtue retired in me . " During her residence among the Ursulines , Madame Guyon had a lingering illness , in which she suffered extreme agony , and was brought to the very edge of the grave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , she calls " a state of childhood . " She says , " I was obliged to continue to tell my thoughts , or write them , to Father la Combe , and to help him according to the light which was given me . I was often so weak that I could not lift up my head to take nourishment ; and when God required me to write to him , either to help and encourage him , or to lay before him what was made known to me , I had strength given me to do it . When my letters were finished , I found myself in the same weakness . Our Lord had given us both /q/ to understand that he would unite us by faith and by the cross . Ours , then , has been a union of the cross , in every respect , as well by what I have made him suffer , as by what I have suffered for him . Thus it was reciprocal , and much stronger than I am able to express . The sufferings which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced me sometimes to extremity , and continued for several years : for though I have been much more of my time far from him , than near him , that did not relieve my suffering , which lasted till he was perfectly emptied of self , and to the very point of submission which God required of him . This operation made him suffer pains so much the more intense , as the designs of God upon him were the greater . He has occasioned me great pains when I was near a hundred leagues from him . I felt his disposition . If he were faithful in letting self be destroyed , I was in a state of peace and enlargement ; if he were unfaithful , in reflection , or hesitation , I suffered till that was passed over . He had no need to write me an account of his state , for 1 knew it ; but when he did write , it proved to be such as I had felt it . My heart had in it , as it were , a counterpart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was in . In short , to bear a soul , however distant the person may be , in all its different dispositions , and to suffer for all its resistances , is a thing very strange and mysterious . " " I can not express the mercies which God shewed me in the time of this indisposition , and the pro- /z/ found views of the future which he gave me . I saw the devil in great wrath going to excite a violent persecution . against prayer , and against the persons drawn into that holy exercise . I wrote an account of all this to Father la Combe ; and if he has not burned the letters , they will still serve as proofs of the truth hereof . The devil durst not attack myself ; he feared me too much . I was to him like a thunderbolt . I then comprehended what power a soul has , which is entirely annihilated . Our Lord then let me see all that has come to pass since that time , as my letters clearly manifest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dependence was , and so pure and intimate a union , I saw twice in a dream Jesus Christ , an infant of admirable beauty ; and it seemed to me that he very closely united us , saying , ' It is I who unite thee to myself , and am willing that we both be one . ' Another time he bade me see Father la Combe , who then kept himself at some distance from me through infidelity ; and , with great goodness he brought him back again , willing to help me in a state of childhood , as I helped him in the state of death . He had very great charity for me . Treating me as a real child , he often said to me , ' When I am with you , I seem to myself as if I were with a little child . ' I was frequently reduced to extremity , and seemed on the point of death . I had , as it were , its agonies . For several hours I only breathed a long time asunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattered me ; for I had a great /z/ fondness for it ; but it only appeared flying off . The father forbid me to rejoice at the prospect of death . I immediately discovered that it was an imperfection and did it no more ; remaining afterwards in the utmost indifference about it . " " During my extraordinary illness , the Lord gradually taught me that there was another manner of conversing among souls wholly his , than by speech . Thou madest me conceive , oh divine Word , that as thou art ever speaking and operating in a soul ,  - -  though therein thou appearest in profound silence ,  - -  so there was also a way of communication in thy creatures , in an ineffable silence ! I learned then a language which before had been unknown to me . I gradually perceived , when Father la Combe entered , that I could speak no more ; and that there was formed in my soul the same kind of silence towards him , as was formed in it , in regard to God . I comprehended that God was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn the language of angels . I was gradually reduced to speak to him only in silence . It was then we understood each other in God , after a manner unutterable and all divine . Our hearts spoke to each other , communicating a grace which no words can express . It was like a new country , both for him and me , but so divine , that I can not describe it . At first this was done in a manner so perceptible , that is to say , God penetrated us with himself in a manner so pure and so sweet , that we'passed hours in profound silence , always communicative , without being able to /z/ utter one word . It was in this that we learned , by our own experience , the operations of the heavenly Word to reduce souls into unitywith itself , and what purity one may arrive at in this life . It was given to me to communicate this way to other good souls ; but with this difference , that I did nothing but communicate to them the grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this sacred silence ; but I received nothing from them : whereas with Father la Combe , there was a flow and return of communication of grace , which he received from me , and I from him , in the greatest purity . " It was in this that I comprehended the ineffable commerce of the most holy Trinity to all the blessed ; and how God , who communicates himself to them , forms in them a flux and reflux of his own divine communications ; that the saints of the like degree , or hierarchy , return to each other these pure and blissful emanations , and further shed them on the inferior hierachies , and that all are reduced into the first principle , from whence they flow . I saw that we were created to partake in this life the unspeakable happiness of the celestial regions , and that it requires us to be very pure to receive God thus uninterruptedly , and to leave him to flow back into himself in that same purity . We must indeed be very pure to receive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , by a flux and reflux of communication , upon the other souls which God gives us . This is what fixes us in the divine unity , in which we are one in him from whom all is derived . " /q/ " It was shewn to me how this hierarchic order was , even in this life ; and that there are souls who communicate to an infinite number of other souls , without knowing it , to whom the grace of their perfection reaches ; that this hierarchy will be preserved through all eternity ; and that those who naturally communicate to each other will be in the like deo-ree . It was then that I learned the secret of spiritual fruitfulness and maternity ; how the Holy Spirit renders souls fruitful in himself , and that there would be given to me in this way a numberless offspring , as well known as unknown . All those , who are my true children , are drawn in their minds at once to continue in silence when with me : and I have the like tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . In this silence I discover their wants and failings , and communicate to them in an abundant plenitude , according to their necessities . When once they have tasted of this manner of communication , any other becomes burthensome to them . As for me , when I make use of speech , or the pen , with souls , I do it only on account of their weakness , and because either they are not pure enough for the interior communication ; or because it is yet needful to use condescension ; or for the regulation of outward affairs . " " In my sickness I was often in all appearance at the point of death . Father la Combe administered the sacrament to me , the Prioress of the Ursulines having desired him to do it , as their priest was /z/ then not at home . I was well satisfied to die , as was he also in the expectation of my departure . For being united in God , after a manner so pure , and so spiritual , death could not separate us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father la Combe , who was on his knees at my bedside , remarking the change of my countenance , and how my eyes faded , seemed ready to give me up for dying : when God inspired him to lift up his hands , and with a strong voice , which was heard of those who were in my chamber , at that time almost full , to command death to relinquish . Instantly it seemed to be stopped : and thus God was pleased wonderfully to raise me up again ; yet for a long time I continued extremely weak , during all which our Lord still gave me new testimonies of his love . How many times was he pleased to make use of his servant to restore me to life , when I was almost on the very point of expiring ! As they saw that my sicknesses and pains did not end , they judged that the air of the lake on which the convent was situated , was very prejudicial to my constitution . They concluded that it would be necessary for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it into the heart of Father la Combe , to establish a hospital in this place for poor people seized with maladies ; and to institute also a committee , or congregation of ladies of the charity , to furnish such as could not leave their families to go to the hospital , with the means of subsistence during their /q/ illness , after the manner of France ; there not having yet been any institution of this kind in that country . Willingly did I enter into it ; and without any other fund than Providence , and some useless chambers , which the gentlemen of the town gave us , we began it . We dedicated it to the holy child Jesus , and he was pleased to give the first beds to it from the earnest-pence of my pension , which belong to him . He gave such a blessing thereto , that several other persons joined in this charity . In a short time there were near twelve beds in it , and three persons of great piety gave themselves to this hospital to serve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of the poor patients . I supplied them with ointments and medicines , which were freely given to such of the poor people of the town as had need of them . These good ladies were so hearty in the cause , that , through their charity , and the care of the young women , this hospital was very well maintained and served . These ladies joined together also in providing for the sick , who could not go to the hospital : and I gave them some little regulations , such as I had observed when in France , which they continued to keep up with tenderness and love . " All these little things , which cost but little , and which owed all their success to the blessing God gave them , drew upon us new persecutions . The Bishop of Geneva was offended with me more than ever , especially in seeing that these small /z/ 226 M A n . U E G I ' J ON . matters rendered mc beloved . lie said , ' I won over everybody . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his diocese , ' though I had done therein nothing but good , or rather God by me. lie extended his persecutions to these good religions women , who had been my assistants . The Prioress in particular , had her own share to bear , though it did not last long ; : for as I was obliged , on account of the air , to remove , after having been there about two years and a half , they were then more in peace and quietness . On another side , my sister was very weary of this house : and as the season for the waters approached , they took occasion from thence to send her away , with the maid which I brought with me , who had molested me exceedingly in my late illness . I only kept her whom Providence had sent me by means of my sister : and I have ever thought that God had ordered my sister 's journey hither , only to bring her to me , as one chosen of him , and proper for the state which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I was yet , ( indisposed , ) with the Ursulines , the Bishop of Verceil earnestly requested the Father - General of the Bernabites , to seek among the religious , a man of merit , piety and learning , in whom he might place confidence , and who might serve him for a prebend and a counsellor . At first he cast his eyes on Father la Combe ; yet before he absolutely engaged him with the said Bishop , he wrote to him , to know , ' whether he had any objection thereto . ' Father la Combe replied , 1 that he had no other will but that of obeying him , /q/ and that he might command him herein as he should think best in the case . ' He gave me an account of this , and that we were going to be entirely separated . I was glad to find that our Lord would employ him under a Bishop who knew him , and would be likely to do him justice . Yet it was some time before he went , matters not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ursulines , the good hermit I have spoken of , wrote tome , earnestly entreating rve to go to Lausanne , which was only six leagues from Tonon , over the lake , because he still hoped to draw back his sister who lived there , in order to labor for her conversion . One can not go thither to speak about religion without running some risk . As soon as I was in a condition to walk , though but feebly , I resolved to go . We took a boat , and I requested Father la Combe to accompany us . We got over pretty easily : but as the lake was above a quarter of a league distant from the town , I was obliged , notwithstanding my weakness , to muster up all my forces to get thither on foot , for we could find no other means of conveyance . The boatmen bore me up as well as they could , but not sufficiently for the condition I was in . When I arrived at the town I was extremely reduced . Both Father la Combe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly married , and declared that , if it were not for regard to her brother , from whom we delivered letters , she would have informed against us , as /z/ bein come to debauch the Protestants . In our return we came near perishing on the lake , in a dangerous place , where there came a tempest against us , which seemed about to swallow us up ; but God protected us . Some days after , a bark foundered there , with thirtythree persons in it . " I then went off from the Ursulines , and they sought for a house for me at a distance from the lake . There was but one to be found empty , which had a look of the greatest poverty . It had no chimney but in the kitchen , through which one was obliged to pass to go to the chamber . I took my daughter with me , and gave up the largest chamber for her and the maid , who was to take care of her . I was lodged in a little hole , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we had no other furniture than our beds , which were quite plain and homely , I bought some straw chairs and bosses , with Dutch earthen , and wooden ware . Never did I enjoy greater content than in this little hovel , which appeared so very conformable to the humility of Jesus Christ . I fancied everything better on wood than on plate . I laid in all my provisions , hoping to stay there a long time ; but the devil did not leave me long in such sweet peace . It would be difficult for me to tell the persecutions that were stirred up against me . They threw stones in at my windows , which fell at my feet . I had my little garden put in order : They came in the night , tore it all up , broke down the arbor , and overturned everything /q/ in it , as if it had been ravaged by soldiers . They came to abuse me at the door all night long , making a noise as if they were going to break it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such work .  --  Though from time to time I continued my charities at Gex , I was not the less persecuted for it . They offered one person a warrant* to compel Father la Combe to stay atTonon , thinking he would otherwise be a support to me in the persecution ; but we prevented it . I knew not then the designs of God , and that he would soon draw me from that poor solitary place , in which I had enjoyed a sweet and solid satisfaction , notwithstanding the abuses from without . I thought myself happier here than any sovereign on earth .  --  It was for me like a nest and a place of repose ; and Christ was willing that I should be like him . The devil , as I have said , irritated my persecutors . They sent to desire me to go out of the diocese . All the good , which the Lord had caused me to do in it , was condemned more than the greatest crimes . Those crimes they tolerated , but me they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or repentance , for having left all ; not that I was assured of having done the will of God therein : such an assurance would have been too much for me . But I could neither see nor regard anything ,  - -  receiving all things alike from the hand of my God , who directed and disposed these crosses for me , either in justice or in mercy . " * Lettre de Cachet. // The Marchioness of Prunai , a pious widow and friend of Madame Guyon , having heard that she had removed from the Convent of the Ursulines , on account of the air of the lake , procured a letter to oblige Father la Combe to come to her house at Turin , and to bring the invalid with him . She afterward told Madame Guyon that a superior force moved her to do it , without her knowing the cause thereof . This step , however , c-aused bitter mortification to the pride of the Marchioness . It gave new activity to the scandalous stories , which had already been promulgated ; and as neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had enemies enough . It was reported that she was strolling about the country from province to province alone with Father la Combe ; the news was speedily carried to Paris , where comedies were acted upon it . It was not true , that she travelled alone with Father la Combe . She had with her an aged priest , a boy whom she had brought out of Fiance , her chamber-maid , and her little daughter . The women and child travelled in a litter , the others took horses . All these circumstances were , however , omitted in her enemies ' version of the story . Even the Marchioness of Prunai , in consequence of the reports she heard , looked very coldly upon her , for a while ; but being afterward convinced of the purity and sanctity of her life , she again became warmly attached to her . After some time , business of importance com- /z/ pelled the marchioness to leave Turin ; and Madame Guyon did not think it proper to stay there without her , being an entire stranger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Bishop of Verceil wrote to offer his protection , saying lie wished extremely to have her in his diocese , and that he should regard her as a sister . But Father la Combe was at Verceil , and she feared to distress him by going thither ; though she says , had they believed it to be the will of God , the loss of reputation would have been as nothing . Speaking of her converts at this time , she relates the following dream : " I saw a great number of very beautiful birds , which every one was pursuing with great emulation and eagerness . I beheld them all without taking part therein , and without wishing to catch any of them . I was not a little surprised to see that they all came to offer themselves to me , without my using any effort to take them . Among them there was one of an extraordinary beauty , which far surpassed all the others . Everybody was eager to get this : but it escaped them all , and me too as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to me , when I no longer expected it . There was one of the others , which after having come in the like manner , fluttered for a long time , one while offering itself , another while retiring , but at length gave itself up entirely . This last appeared to me to be the religious man I have just been speaking of . Others fled quite /z/ away .  --  But the beautiful bird , which had not any rival , * is not unknown to me , though lie hag not come yet . Be it either before , or after my death , I am assured the time will come when he will give himself wholly up to God . " As I was with the Marchioness of Prunai ,  --  undetermined whether I should place my daughter at the Visitation of Turin , to go thither with her , or take some other course ,  --  I was exceedingly surprised , at a time I least expected it , to see Father la Combe arrive from Verceil , and tell me , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the evening , and he said , ' I must set off next morning . ' I confess this sudden news startled me . It was for me a double sacrifice , to return to a place w 7 here they had cried me down so much ; and towards a family which held me in contempt , and who had represented my journey ( caused by pure necessity ) as a voluntary course , pursued through human attachments . Behold me then disposed to go off , without offering a single word in reply , with my daughter and my chambermaid , without any body to guide and attend us ; for Father la Combe was resolved not to accompany me , not so much as in passing the mountains ; because the Bishop of Geneva had written on all sides that I was gone to Turin , to run after him ; but the Father Provincial , who was a man of quality , and well acquainted with the virtue of Father la Combe , told him , * that it was im- * Perhaps Fenelon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these mountains , without some persons of my acquaintance ; and the more so , as I had my little daughter with me ; he therefore ordered him to accompany me . ' Father la Combe confessed to me that he had some reluctance to do it , and that only obedience , and the danger to which I should have been exposed , made him surmount it . He was merely to accompany me to Grenoble , and from thence to return to Turin . I went off then for Paris , there to suffer whatever crosses and trials it should please God to inflict . " What made me pass by Grenoble , was , the desire I had to spend two or three days with a lady , an eminent servant of God , and one of my friends . When I was there , Father la Combe and that lady spoke to me not to go any further ; that God would glorify himself in me and by me in that place . He returned to Verceil , and I left myself to be conducted , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house of a good widow , there not being accommodations at the inn ; and as I was ordered to stop at Grenoble , at her house I resided . I placed my daughter in a convent , and resolved to employ all this time in resigning myself to be possessed in solitude by Him who is the absolute Sovereign of my soul . I made not any visit in this place , though it had been my general custom to make them in other places where I had sojourned . But I was greatly surprised when , a few days after my arrival , there came to see me several persons , /z/ who made profession of a singular devotion to God . 1 perceived immediately a gift which he had given me , both of discerning spirits and of administering to each that which suited their states . I felt myself suddenly invested with the apostolic state , and discerned the condition of the souls that spoke to me with so much facility , that they were surprised at it . They said one to another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing they had stood in need of . ' It was thou , oh , my God , who didst all these things ; some of them sent others to me . It came to such an excess , that , generally from six in the morning till eight in the evening , I was taken up in speaking of God . People flocked on all sides , far and near , friars , priests , men of the world , maids , wives , widows , all came one after another ; and God supplied me with what was pertinent and satisfactory to them all , after a wonderful manner , without any share of my study or meditation therein . Nothing was hid from me of their interior state , and of what passed within them . Here , oh my God , thou didst make an infinite number of conquests known to thyself only . They were instantly furnished with a wonderful facility of prayer . God conferred on them his grace plentifully , and wrought marvellous changes in them . The most advanced of these souls found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , which they could neither comprehend , nor cease to admire . The others found an unction in my words , and that they operated in /q/ them what I said to them . They said , ' they had never experienced anything like it . ' Friars of different orders , and priests of merit , came to see me , to whom our Lord granted very great favors ; as indeed he did to all , without exception , who came in sincerity . 6t One thing was surprising ; I had not a syllable to say to such as came only to watch my words , and to criticise on them . Even when I thought to try to speak to them , I felt that I could not , and that God would not have me do it . Some of them in return said , ' The people are fools to go to see that lady . She can not speak . ' Others of them treated me as if I were only a stupid simpleton . After they left me , there came one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to apprize you not to speak to those persons ; they came from such and such , to try what they can catch from you to your disadvantage . ' I answered them , ' Our Lord has prevented your charity ; for I was not able to say one word to them . " Many of the priests in that part of the country deemed her doctrines heretical , and were alarmed at the multitudes who flocked to hear her . They burned in the public-square all the mystical books they could find , and refused to grant absolution to those who practised inward prayer . Some friars of this very order afterward became what Madame Guyon calls her " spiritual children ; " she says she had the power of guiding and consoling those who stood in this relation to her , whether they were near /z/ or distant , whether she had ever seen them or not : if they committed any faults , and concealed them from her , or covered them with disguises , she immediately felt it . She tells us , " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , saw in a dream , that our Lord gave me an infinite number of children , all uniformly clad , bearing on their habits the marks of candor and innocence . She thought I was coming to take care of the children of the hospital . But as soon as she told me , I discerned it was not that which the dream meant ; but that our Lord would give me , by a spiritual fruitfulness , a great number of children ; that they would not be my true children ; but in simplicity , candor and innocence . " While at Grenoble , she wrote her commentaries on the books of the Old and New Testament . Of these works she says , " when in writing on the Old Testament , I made use of passages of the New , to support what I had said , it was without seeking them , they were given me along with the explication ; and in writing on the New Testament , and therein making use of passages of the Old , they were given me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for writing but in the night , allowing only one or two hours for sleep . The Lord made me write with so much purity , that I was obliged to leave off or begin again , as he was pleased to order . He proved me every way herein . When I wrote by day , often suddenly interrupted , I left the word unfinished , and he afterwards /q/ gave me what he pleased . What I wrote was not in my head : that part was kept free and disengaged . If I gave any way to reflection , I was punished for it and could not proceed . And yet sometimes I was not duly attentive to the Divine Spirit , thinking I did well to continue when I had time , even without feeling his immediate impulse , or enlightening influence ; from whence it is easy to see some places clear and consistent , and others which have neither taste nor unction ; such is the difference of the spirit of God from the human and natural spirit , though they are left just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ordered to adjust them according to my present light . " At Grenoble she was likewise persuaded to publish a little tract , which had been written a long time , called " A Short and Easy Method of Prayer " : this book occasioned her much persecution . The confessors said it was none of her business to meddle with their province , and to administer to the help of souls . The Bishop of Geneva , and the people at Gex , did not fail to write to Grenoble against her , as they had done to other places . The Bishop of Grenoble 's almoner advised her to go to Marseilles , which was his native place , until the storm passed over . The Marchioness of Prunai , having returned to Turin , sent to urge her to take refuge there . But Turin was very near to Verceil ; and she knew the world would say she had gone after Father la Combe . She therefore embarked for Marseilles , with a /z/ young woman whom she had converted to her opinions , her chamber-maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , they met with several alarming accidents . The boat ran upon a rock , and opened at a stroke . All were terrified , except Madame Guyon ; her countenance was perfectly tranquil . She says , " I did not so much as feel the first emotions of surprise , which are natural to every body on those occasions , and depend not on ourselves . What caused my peace in such dangers as terrify others at once , was my resignation to God , and because death is much more agreeable to me than life , if such were his will , to which I desire to be ever patiently submissive . " * She arrived at Marseilles at ten o'clock in the morning ; and in the afternoon all was in an uproar about her . Several very offensive letters were written to her ; and the Bishop was requested to banish her immediately from the city , on account of her book on prayer . The Bishop of Marseilles , having talked with some who knew Madame Guyon , refused to comply with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the persecutions and difficulties she met with did not admit of her staying long in that city . She says , * She frequently showed this willingness to die , which sometimes seemed even to amount to anxiety . Once , when riding with her hushand , the carriage nearly overturned ; she exclaimed joyfully , " nevermind  --  it is breaking down on my side . " /q/ " From Marseilles , I knew not how or whither I should turn next . I saw no likelihood either of staying , or returning to Grenoble , where I had left my daughter in a convent . On the other side , Father la Combe had written to me that he did not think I ought to go to Paris . I even felt a strong reluctance to going thither , which made me think it was not yet the time for it . One morning I felt myself inwardly pressed to go off ; I took a litter to go to see the Marchioness of Prunai , which was , I thought , the most honorable refuge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have passed through Nice to her habitation , as some had assured me I might . But when I arrived at Nice , I was greatly surprised to learn that the litter could not pass the mountain to go thither . I knew not what to do , nor which way to turn , being here alone , forsaken of everybody , and not knowing what God required of me . My confusion and crosses seemed daily to increase . I saw myself , without refuse or retreat , wandering as a vagabond . ' All the tradesmen , whom I saw in their shops , appeared to me happy , in having a dwelling-place of their own to retire to . Nothing in the world seemed harder than this wandering life to me , who naturally loved honor and decorum . As I was in this uncertainty , not knowing what course to take , one came to tell mo that next day a shallop would set off , which used to go in one day to Genoa ; and that if I chose it , they would land me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Marchioness of Prunai 's house . To that I con- /z/ sented , as I could not be supplied with any other way of getting thither . " T I had sonic joy at embarking on the sea . I said in myself , ' If I be the dregs of the earth , and the scorn of nature , I am now going to embark on the element which above all others is the most treacherous ; if it be the Lord 's pleasure to plunge me in the waves , it shall be mine to perish in them . There came a tempest in a place pretty dangerous for a small boat ; and the mariners were some of the wickedest . The irritation of the waves gave a satisfaction to my mind . I pleased myself in thinking , that those mutinous billows might probably supply me with a grave . Perhaps I carried the point too far , in the pleasure I took at seeing myself beaten and bandied by the swelling waters . Those who were with me took notice of my intrepidity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thee , my Lord , some little hole of a rock to be placed in , there to live separate from all creatures . I figured to myself , that some uninhabited island would have terminated all my disgraces , and put me in a condition of infallibly doing thy will . But my divine Love designed me a prison far different from that of the rock , and quite another banishment than that of the uninhabited island . He reserved me to be battered by billows , more irritated than those of the sea . Calumnies proved the outrageous unrelenting waves , to which I was to be exposed , in order to be lashed and tossed by them without mercy . /z/ By the tempest swelling against us , we were kept back , and instead of a short day 's passage to Genoa , we were eleven days in making it . We could not land at Savona . We were obliged to #o on to Genoa . We arrived there in the beginning of the week before Easter . " The Doge was lately gone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the litters . Wherefore I could not get one , and was obliged to stay several days at great expense ; for the people there demanded of us exorbitant sums , and as much for every single person , as they would have asked for a company at the best eating-house in Paris . I had little money left , but my store in Providence could not be exhausted . I begged with the greatest earnestness for a litter at any price , to pass the feast of Easter at the Marchioness of Prunai 's house . It was then within three days of Easter ; and 1 could scarcely any way get myself understood . By the force of entreaty , they brought me at length a sorry litter with lame mules , and told me they would take me readily to Verceil , which was only two days ' journey , but demanded an enormous sum for it . They would not engage to take me to the Marm chioness of Prunai 's house , as they knew not where her estate lay . This was to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Verceil ; nevertheless , the proximity of Easter , and want of money , in a country where they used every kind of extortion and tyranny , left mono /z/ choice . I was under an absolute necessity of submitting to be conveyed to Verceil . " Thus Providence led me whither I would not . Our muleteer was one of the most brutal men to be met with ; and for an increase of my affliction , I had sent away to Verceil the ecclesiastic who accompanied us , to prevent their surprise at seeing me , after I had protested against going thither . " They were obliged to pass through a forest , where they were stopped by robbers , and slept at a house notorious for its private murders . They were led into these dangers by the wickedness of the muleteer ; but nothing could frighten a woman , who had so long wished to meet death . She arrived at Verceil in safety . She says , " Father la Combe came in a strange fret at my arrival ; God so permitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that every one would think I was come after him , and that would injure his reputation , which I found in that country was very high . I had no less pain to go thither . It was necessity only which had obliged me to submit to such a disagreeable task . The Father received me with coolness , and in such a manner as let me sufficiently see his sentiments , and indeed redoubled my pain . I asked him if he required me to return , adding , ' that , if he did , I would go off that moment , however oppressed and spent , both with fatigues and fastings . ' He replied , ' he did not know how the Bishop of Verceil would take my arrival , after he had given over all expectation of it ; after I had so long , and so /q/ obstinately , refused the obliging offers he had made me ; since which he no longer expressed any desire to see me . ' " It seemed to me then as if I were rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find any refuge in it , and as if all creatures were combined to crush me . I passed that night without sleep , not knowing what course I should pursue , being persecuted by my enemies , and a subject of disgrace to my friends . " The Bishop of Verceil , however , received her very kindly . He sent his niece to take her to her own house ; and the more he conversed with her , the greater was the respect he entertained for her . He urged her to settle permanently in his diocese ; and he wrote letters to his brethren in every direction , expressing his regard for her . He wished her to form a conorecration at Verceil , in connexion with her friend the Marchioness of Prunai . Some of his relations became very jealous , thinking Madame Guyon would persuade him to give away his money in donations . She says she never thought it was the Lord 's will that she should form an establishment there ; and this was soon decided by the air of the place proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must leave it , or die . The good prelate was even affected to tears . He said , " you were willing to stay in the diocese of Geneva , where they persecuted and rejected you ; and I , who would so gladly have you , can not keep you . But go  --  I had rather have you live at /z/ n distance from us , then sec you die liere . " He wrote to her half brother , and violent enemy , Father laMothe , that he was exceedingly sorry to part with her ; for she had been an angel in his diocese . This Father la Mothe , under an appearance of friendship for Father la Combe , tried to get hin removed to Paris , pretending that place was alone worthy of him ; and persisted in his endeavors , though the Bishop of Verceil strongly resisted parting with a man for whom he had such love and confidence . Madame Guyon says , " The Bishop of Verceil 's friend , the father-general of the Bernabites , departed this life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to the vicar-general , who now held his place till another should be elected , renewing his request to have Father la Combe as an assistant . The father , hearing that I was obliged on account of my indisposition to return into France , sent an order to Father la Combe to return to Paris , and to accompany me in my journey thither ; as his doing so would exempt their house at Paris , already poor , from the expenses of so long a journey . On the receipt hereof , Father la Combe , who did not penetrate the poison under this fair outside , consented thereto ; knowing it was my custom to have some ecclesiastic with me in travelling . Father la Combe went off twelve days before me , in order to transact some business , and to wait for me at the passage over the mountains , the place where I had most need of an escort . I set off in Lent , the weather then being very fine . It was /q/ a sorrowful parting to the prelate . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing Father la Combe and me . He caused me to be attended , at his own expense , as far as Turin ; giving me a gentleman and one of his ecclesiastics to accompany me . " As soon as the resolution was taken that Father la Combe should accompany me , Father la Mothe reported everywhere , ' that he had been obliged to do it , to make him return into France . ' He expatiated on the attachment I had for Father la Combe , pretending to pity me for it . Upon this , every one said , ' I ought to put myself under the direction of Father la Mothe . ' In the meantime he deceitfully palliated the malignity of his heart , writing letters full of esteem to Father la Combe , and of tenderness to me , ' desiring him to bring his dear sister , and to serve her in her infirmities , and in the hardships of so long a journey ; hat he should be sensibly obliged to him for his care , '  --  with many other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depart without going to see my good friend , the Marchioness of Prunai , notwithstanding the difficulty of the roads . I caused myself to be carried thither , it being scarce possible to go otherwise on account of the mountains . She was extremely joyful at seeing me arrive . Nothing could be more cordial than what passed between us with abundance of mutual openness . It was then she acknowledged that all I told her had come to pass ; and a good ecclesiastic , who /z/ lives with her , told me the same . We made ointments and plaisters together , and I gave her the secret of my remedies . I encouraged her , and so did Father la Combe , to establish an hospital in that place ; which was done while we were there . I contributed my mite to it , which has ever been blest to all the hospitals established in reliance on Providence . " I believe I had forgot to tell , that the Lord had made use of me to establish one near Grenoble , which subsists without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies made use of that afterwards to slander me , saying , ( I had wasted my children 's substance in establishing hospitals ; ' though , far from spending any of their substance , I had even given them my own ; and though those hospitals have been established only on the fund of divine providence , which is inexhaustible . " Madame Guyon returned to Paris in July , 1686 . Several of her friends warned her that her half brother had evil designs against her and Father la Combe ; and this proved true ; though the artful dissembler pretended the utmost friendship for both . He wished Madame Guyon to give up to her relations the small annuity she had left ; and he was angry with Father la Combe because he would not use his power to make her do it . The applause which followed Father la Combe 's preaching exasperated him still more . He demanded a small sum of money , which Madame Guyon had placed in /q/ his hands to pay for the entrance of a poor nun , saying he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Father la Combe replied that he had no right to dispose of the money contrary to the wishes of the giver , he told him he would make him suffer for it . It would be tedious to enter into a detail of all the petty stratagems of malice and envy . By means of forged letters , false confessionals , and the artful concealment of favorable evidence , Father la Combe and Madame Guyon were pretended to be convicted of heresy and other great crimes . Father la Combe was imprisoned in the Bastile , in 1687 . He appears to have been a conscientious man , singularly devoted to God . He endured his misfortunes with the calmness and resignation of a Christian , having an inward peace , which the world could not take from him . Soon after , an order was issued for the imprisonment of Madame Guyon ; but the execution of it was deferred for a few months on account of her extreme illness . During this sickness a certificate from the Inquisition , establishing the innocence of Father la Combe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by her wicked half-brother , under the pretence of setting the victim at liberty ; but as soon as he got possession of the important paper he destroyed it . She says , " To Father la Mothe 's insults I returned mildness , and for injuries made him presents . " In January , 1GG8 , while she was yet too weak /z/ to stand , she was imprisoned in the Convent of St Mary 's , and denied the privilege of occasionally seeing her daughter . A very severe woman was appointed for her keeper ; and the whole sisterhood had prejudices against her , as a heretic , an enthusiast , a hypocrite , and a mad woman . However , before many months had passed away , the prisoner won their entire affection and respect , by the meekness and purity of her conversation . This vexed Father la Mothe extremely . Liberty was offered her , if she would give up all guardianship of her daughter , and consent to her marriage with a certain unprincipled and dissipated man , with whom they wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom at the price of sacrificing her child ; and that she was content to stay in prison , as long as it was the Lord 's will . Want of air and exercise brought on a raging fever . Some of her friends tried to procure her liberation . Even Father la Mothe pretended to desire it , because he was afraid of being suspected of malice , by over-doing the matter . She was repeatedly urged to write a retraction of the sentiments she had professed , and was threatened with the scaffold if she did not . She answered she would sooner die than write what she believed to be false . A forged retraction was then circulated , in which she was made to accuse herself of heresy and crime , and to say she detested the day on which she first saw Father la Combe . /q/ At last , one of her female relatives obtained her freedom through the mediation of Madame Maintenon . She says , " Some days after my release , having heard of the Abbe de Fenelon , my mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed to me that the Lord would unite him to me in a very intimate manner , beyond any other , and that of him there would be formed a spiritual filiation ( or sonship ) to me . I had an opportunity of seeing him the next day. * I inwardly felt this first interview did not satisfy him . I experienced something which made me want to pour out my heart into his ; but I did not find yet the due correspondence for it , which made me suffer much . Next morning I saw him again . We remained in silence together for some time , till the cloud was dissipated ; but he was not yet as I desired him to be . Eight whole days I suffered on his account , after which I found myself united to him without any obstacle : and ever since , this union has increased , after a manner pure and ineffable . My soul seemed to be joined to his in the bond of divine love , as was that of Jonathan to David . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has upon this person , and how dear he is to him . " " At my coming out of St Mary 's , I entered into the community of Madame Miramion . My enemies , not yet tired of plotting against me , told me /z/ it was more proper for mc to enter into a private house . This was to set on foot new forgeries , as before . When they saw that , with all their endeavors for it , they could not prevail , they wrote to Madame Miramion , assuring her that they saw me go into bad houses in the suburb S. Marceau ; and that I held assemblies . Father la Mothe was the author of these letters . Madam Miramion , who knew that I had all this time kept my bed in a fever , with an imposthume in the eye , which was dressed every day , herself generally being present at the dressing , was very much provoked at such a procedure . Father la Mothe came to see her , to confirm what he had written , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said I had done within eight days past . She fell upon him sharply for the blackness of his accusations ; assuring him she now believed all that had been told her of the flagrant malignities with which he had all along pursued me ; having such manifest reasdn so to do , as she was a witness that for three months past I had kept my bed . " Her daughter was married , at the house of Madame Miramion , to Louis Nicholas Fouquet , Count de Vaux , son of the famous superintendent of the king 's finances . On account of her extreme youth , her mother remained with her two years and a half . The family of Fouquet were intimate friends of Fenelon , archbishop of Cambray ; and Madame Guyon had frequent opportunities of conversing with him . Having a dislike to everything /q/ like an affectation of singularity , he was at first disposed to avoid her ; but the modesty of her demeanor , and the extreme simplicity and gentleness of her manners , soon prepossessed him in her favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fenelon , she strongly resembled him in her disinterestedness , her love of God , her conscientious courage , and her total abandonment to the guidance of Divine Providence : it is not strange , therefore , that he became one of her disciples , as well as a zealous friend and admirer . Madame Guyon and Fenelon often met at the institution of St Cyr , where the scholars became very partial to her eloquent discourses and mystical writings . Even influential men , and brilliant ladies about the court , fascinated by the charms of her conversation , began to devote themselves to God and their families , to talk of the beauty and excellence of a spiritual life , and to express their pity for those immersed in the frivolous pleasures of the world . This was treated as fanaticism ; the zealots of the church became alarmed ; and no means were spared to bring the fair devotee into discredit . Tired of these annoyances , she privately made arrangements to enter the Convent at Montargis , intending to bind herself by a vow never to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , and effectually opposed it . She says , " I now took a little private house , to follow the inclination I had for retirement . I sometimes had the pleasure of seeing my family and a few /z/ particular friends . I often wont to St Cyr. * Certain young women of that house having informed Madam Maintenon , that they found in my conversation something which attracted them to God , she encouraged me to continue my instructions to them ; and by the agreeable change in some of them , with whom before she had not been well pleased , she found she had no reason to repent it . She then treated me with much respect ; and for three or four years after , while this lasted , I received from her every mark of esteem and confidence . But that very thing drew on me the most severe persecution . The free entrance I had into the house , and the confidence which some young ladies of the court , distinguished for their rank and piety , placed in me , gave no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Directors took umbrage at it ; and under pretext of the trouble I had had some years before , and of Quietism , which they said was making a great progress , they engaged the Bishop of Chartres , Superior of St Cyr , to represent to Madame Maintenon that , by my particular conduct , I troubled the order of the house ; that the young women in it were so attached to me , and to what I said to them , they no longer hearkened to their Superiors . She caused me to be respectfully told of it . I then went no more to St Cyr . I answered the letters the young ladies wrote to /z/ me , but my letters were unsealed , and passed through the hands of Madame Maintenon . " Before this period Madame Maintenon had treated her with distinguished respect and regard . Her prepossessing appearance , her mild and steadfast courage , and her captivating earnestness of style , had so much attracted the royal dame , that whenever she was wearied with the emptiness of the court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ console her . But now , the face of affairs was changed . M. Foquet assured his mother-in-law , that Madame Maintenon was amoncr the most open and decided of her enemies . Those who had before persecuted her , now kept no measures ; and the vilest stories were busily circulated at her expense . At this period three or four ineffectual attempts were made to poison Madame Guyon ; but we are not informed who were implicated in this wickedness . While thus surrounded by darkness and danger , death deprived her of the protection and counsels of her pious and faithful friend , M. Foquet . Much as she needed his assistance she says , " I felt nothing but joy , I was so certain of his happiness . " " I should rather have envied him than wept , if the love of the will of God had not prevailed above everything in my heart .  --  Some days after , I imagined I saw him as when he was alive . Knowing he was dead , I asked him how he fared in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Those who do the will of God are accepted of him . ' I thought this little digression would not be unpleasing to those for whom I have written it , as most of them knew him well . " Had Madame Guyon alone suffered by the bigotry , or mistaken zeal of her enemies , she probably would have endured all in silence ; but when she found that the slanders heaped upon her , threw a shadow upon the reputation of her friends , she thought it a duty to demand redress . In June , 1694 , she wrote to Madame Maintenon as follows : " Madame ,  --  Permit me to throw myself at your feet , and to trust in your hands my safety and reputation . For eighteen years , the love of God has been my only employment ; I have associated with none but persons of distinguished virtue and piety ; I have no connexion with any individual suspected by Church or State ; yet I am calumniated on all sides . The blackest suspicions are thrown upon my past and present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say I rebel against the church ; that I want to establish a religion of my own ; and that I , who profess to know nothing but Jesus Christ , think myself more learned and enlightened than the Doctors of the Sorbonne . " M. Bossuet is aware how perfectly I have always submitted to my spiritual directors . He himself once told me that 1 had the simplicity of a dove ; and he has offered to certify that I am a good Catholic . Yet he has forbidden me to approach the sacraments ; and painful as obedience has been , M A D A M E GUi'O X. 2oO I have abstained more than three months ; although mv soul is disquieted within me , I utter no complaints . My life , from its beginning to the present moment , has been irreproachable ; yet they persist in accusing me of the most scandalous vices . By the pure love our Saviour showed in dying for the good of men , I conjure you , madame , to use your influence with the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , and to give my doctrines an impartial consideration .  --  Will not you , madame , who so well know the malice of the world , protect me from the injustice of mankind , by giving me a fair opportunity to free mvself from the implication of the atrocious crimes , whereof I am accused ? " Not long after she again writes to the same lady : " Madame ,  --  Since they constantly accuse me of makincr harangues , and of teaching others to do so , I am content to remain in concealment . I have believed that in neither writing , nor talking to anv one , I should satisfy the world , appease my enemies , and abate the zeal of certain very worthy persons , whom prejudice has estranged from me . But when I continually hear mvself accused ot crimes , I feel that I owe it to the church , to my familv , and to myself , to demand an inquiry into facts . I merely claim the justice that is not refused to criminals , even in uncivilized countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine into my cause ; that half of /z/ them may be taken from the clergy , and half from the laity ; slander has blinded so many men of integrity , that mere probity is not sufficient ,  --  they should be unprejudiced . Could you obtain this favor for me , madame , you will discover that I am not wholly unworthy of the kindness with which you have heretofore honored me . If it be God 's will that I should submit to the accusations brought against me , I will adore his justice with all my heart , asking the punishment my sins deserve . " To these appeals , the royal dame replied , * ' She had never believed any of the reports which were propagated against my morals , which she believed were very good ; that it was my doctrine which was bad ; that in justifying my morals , there was room to fear they would give a free course to my sentiments , and in some sort authorize them ; that it was best to clear up first what related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of itself . " The request to have commissioners appointed , was refused . The real fact was , it was necessary to persecute Madame Guyon in order to destroy a more important personage . The Abbe Fenelon had powerful enemies at court . Madame Maintenon disliked him , because he had honestly advised the profligate old king not to marry her . Bossuet , Bishop of Meaux , having been accustomed to see himself admired as the first genius of the age , was jealous of his fame , and of his great influence over the mind of his royal pupil , the Duke of Burgundy . /q/ It was not to have been expected , that the unsuccessful tutor of the father should indulge a cordial friendship for the eminently successful tutor of the son . The disgrace of Fenelon was probably the real object , although the interests of religion were made the pretext . The Bishop of Meaux , the Bishop of Chalons , and Monsieur Tronson were appointed to examine the writings of Madame Guyon . At the particular request of Madame Maintenon , Fenelon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and all but the Archbishop of Cambray signed an unqualified censure . He insisted ' that her intentions were pure ; that in the course of their friendship she had unreservedly disclosed to him her inmost sentiments ; and he felt perfectly sure that if her books contained anything erroneous , the fault lay in the obscurity of the style , not in the unsoundness of her opinions . He said he had narrowly watched her practice , and observed the counsels she gave the ignorant ; and the more he had known her , the more she had risen in his esteem ; he therefore could not conscientiously condemn one , whose life and conversation had always been edifying to him ; the least he could do in this case was to preserve a profound silence . " This was precisely what his enemies liked  --  the imputed heresy of Madame Guyon at once fell back upon him . In December , 1G95 , Madame Guyon was imprisoned at Vincennes , and was soon after transferred to the Bastile. /z/ In the course of the following year , M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the severity of her punishment , obtained leave to remove her from the Bastile , and place her under the care of M. de la Chetardie , cure de St Sulpice . Two women were appointed to watch over her . About this time a letter was circulated , said to have been taken from Father la Combe , in which he besought Madame Guyon to repent of their criminal intimacy* When this was shown to her , she calmly replied , that it was either a forgery , or Father la Combe was crazy , and in that state looked upon the reiterated charges of his enemies as facts ; and it was indeed soon discovered that he was completely delirious ; in which condition he afterward died at Charenton . Madame Guyon always insisted that they continued to communicate in God , and that each spirit knew the other 's state , while debarred from every form of human intercourse . In 1697 , The Maxims of the Saints concerning Interior Life , by Fenelon , Archbishop of Cambray , was published . A general outcry was immediately raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrines of the Quietists . This book , combined with Father la Combe 's letter , excited fresh clamor against Madame Guyon . The king and Madame Maintenon , who , oddly enough , undertook to be rigid judges of female virtue and propriety , denounced the devout enthusiast as a corrupt and designing woman , and Fenelon no better than a fanatical protector of vice . /q/ Louis the Fourteenth wrote to Rome to hasten the condemnation of the book of Maxims ; and with the King , Madame Maintenon , and Bossuet , to oppose him , no saint on earth could have written a volume , that would have been pronounced orthodox . The Maxims were condemned ; Fenelon was disgraced at court , and banished to his diocese . It happened that his palace at Cambray , with all his furniture and books , was at the same time destroyed by fire . He met all his misfortunes with tranquillity and firmness : " It is better than if it had been the cottage of a poor family , " said he . The meekness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him . A celebrated writer said of him , " I know not whether Fenelon was a heretic in asserting that God ought to be loved for himself , but I know Fenelon deserves to be so loved . " Madame Guyon was punished with less mercy than her defender and friend . In vain the Bishop of Grenoble proclaimed his respect for her virtue and piety ; in vain the sisterhood of St Mary 's bore public testimony to the meekness , simplicity , patience , and devotion of her character . She had to contend with the enemies of the Abbe Fenelon combined with her own : and her candor , and childlike credulity , made her an easy prey to their cunning ; and intrigue . Madame Guyon was again imprisoned in the Bastile in 1G9S . Three of her friends at St Cyr were banished ; and one of her sons , who had served with distinction in the regiment of French Guards , was ordered to quit it . /z/ A strong effort was made to pollute the stainless reputation of the venerable Archbishop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enemies , his name has passed down to posterity , surrounded by the pure light of Christian virtue . As nothing could be proved against the innocence of Madame Guyon 's character , and the rectitude of her intentions , her family at last succeeded in obtaining her liberation . While in the Bastile , she thus describes her state of mind in an address to her children . " As my life has ever been consecrated to the cross , I was no sooner out of prison , and my spirit began to breathe a little , after so many persecutions , but my body was afflicted with all sorts of infirmities . I have had almost continual maladies , which often brought me to the very verge of death . " In these last times I can hardly speak at all of my dispositions . It is because my state is become simple and without any variations . It is a profound annihilation . All I know is that God is infinitely holy , righteous , good and happy . I see nothing below myself , nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I am a mere nothing . To me every condition seems equal . All is lost in his immensity , like a drop of water in the sea . In this divine immensity the soul sees itself no more , but it discerns every object in God ; without discerning them otherwise than by the feeling of the heart . All is darkness in regard to itself , all is light on the side of God , /q/ who permits me to be ignorant of nothing that is proper , or of real advantage . There is here neither clamor , nor sorrow , nor pain , nor vain pleasure , nor uncertainty ; but a perfect peace ; not in myself but in God : no interest for self , no anxiety or bustle for self . If any think there is any good in me , they are mistaken , and by such thought do injury to my Lord . All good is in him and for him . The greatest satisfaction I can have is because he is what he is ; and because ichat he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any should place confidence in such a poor creature as I am . Nevertheless , I answer what they ask without difficulty , my own will and inclinations are vanished . Sometimes indeed I could wish to undergo the worst of sufferings , so that souls might be brought thereby to know and love God . " I dearly love the church : whatever wounds that , wounds me . I seek nothing for myself . I study nothing ; but there are given me immediately , as occasion requires , expressions and words very forcible . If I wanted to have them they would escape me , and I could by no means catch them . When I have something to say , if I am interrupted , it is all lost . I am then like a child from whom , unperceiving , his apple is withdrawn , lie looks about for it ; but all in vain : he finds it no more . My God keeps me in an extreme simplicity , godly sincerity , uprightness of heart , and enlargedness of spirit ; in such sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look from and above them , and of /z/ them to see nothing at all , except when occasions present them . " He gives me a freedom with the various people who come to see me ; and makes me discourse with them , not according to any dispositions of my own , but according to their states . I am not afraid of any of them laying snares for me in what they say . I can not have recourse to precautions in any of these cases , conscious of my own innocence and uprightness in them . Oh , carnal prudence ! How opposite do I find thee to the simplicity of Jesus Christ ! I leave thee to thy partisans . As for me , all my prudence , my wisdom , is in following him in his simple and lowly appearance : and if to change my conduct would make me an empress , I could not do it ; or were my simplicity to cause me all the heaviest sufferings , I could not depart from it . " My children , I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlighten you , and to give you esteem , or disesteem , for me . I want only to keep my place , and go no more out , no more to move from my centre . I pray God to enlighten you always , to give you thereby the clear discernment of his holy will , that no false light may ever lead you to a precipice . " Let us abide in our nothingness , paying homage to his holiness : then shall we find in him all that we want . If we seek for anything for self out of him , then , however holy he may appear to us , we are liars , and the truth abideth not in us . We deceive ourselves ; and in that state shall never be the saints of God , who , having no other holiness /z/ than his , have renounced all selfish usurpation of his sacred rights . iC Holy Father , I have committed into thy hands those whom thou hast given me ; keep them in thy truth , that the lie may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's self is to be in the lie ; make them to know this to be the great truth of which thou art jealous . All language which deviates from this principle is falsehood . He who speaks only the all of god , and nothing of the creature , is in the truth , and the truth dwelleth in him ; usurpation and selfishness being banished from him . My children , receive this instruction from your mother , and it will procure you life . Receive it through her , not as of her , but as of and for God . Amen ! " During her imprisonment she composed five volumes of hymns and spiritual poems , several of which have been translated by Cowper . They are full of devotional fervor , and the versification is free and flowing . When she recovered her liberty , in 1701 , or 1703 , she was exiled to Diziers , near Blois , where her eldest son resided . She lived in a very secluded manner at Blois , for fifteen years , engaged in works of benevolence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudiced against her , learned to honor her simplicity , sincerity , and meekness . She died at Blois , June , 1717 , soon after she had entered her seventieth year . She was buried at the church of the Cordeliers ( an order of 2f ) 4 MADAME CUYON . Franciscan friars ) where a very beautiful epitaph commemorates her virtues . Her daughter , the Countess of Vaux , became , by a second marriage , Duchess of Sully ; and was again left a widow at the early age of twentyeight . I have thus endeavored to give a faithful portrait of one of the most remarkable of the Mystics . I have not deemed it either necessary , or useful , to inform the reader what appeared to me beautiful , or what appeared absurd . It is evident that Madame Guyon sincerely wished to follow the Lord in the path of regeneration ; though she was often lost in darkness , and still more frequently bewildered in the dazzling light of her own enthusiasm . I leave my readers to judge of her according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
