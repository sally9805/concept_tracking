txt WE have had occasion repeatedly to call the attention of our readers , to the subject of the disputed boundary between the United States and the British provinces of New Brunswick and Lower Canada . As it is a subject in which are involved the conflicting claims of Great Britain and the United States , to a valuable tract of territory , and one which has given rise to elahorate diplomatic discussions between the two nations , for a period of twenty years , without any approximation to an adjustment of the questions in controversy , we have deemed it a duty to keep the public correctly informed , respecting the various phases which these questions have assumed during the discussions . The documents now 1 ) uhlished embrace the whole correspondence , between the two governments , on the subject , during the last four years . The whole of the correspondence is now for the first time laid before the public , having been communicated to the Senate of the United States , in compliance with their request , and printed by their order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made in the state of the question under discussion , which are deserving of attention , not merely as interesting historical facts , but from their bearing on the probable final adjustment of the controversy . It is remarkable , that so much difficulty should have arisen in the actual designation of a line of boundary , which is defined in the treaty between the two countries , with so much precision , by reference to natural objects accurately known at the time , and is correctly delineated on maps then in common use . The main question in dispute , is that which relates to the Eastern and Northern lines , forming the Northeastern angle of the United States . These lines are thus described in the treaty ; viz. " from the . N*orthwest angle of . Vova Scotia , viz , that angle which is formed by a line drawn due JVorth from the source of the St. Croix river to the highlands ; along the said highlands which divide those rivers // that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from those which fall into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut river ; " and , after a description of the other boundaries , " East by a line to be drawn along the middle of the iiver St. Croix , from its mouth in the Bay of Fundy to its source , and from its source directly . N*orth to the aforesaid highlands , which divide the rivers that fall into the Atlantic ocean , from those which fall into the river St. Lawrence . " It will be perceived that there are three important and material parts to this description 1st . The . N*orthwest angle of Nova Scotia , which constitutes the place of beginning of the boundary 2d . The Highlands forming one side of the said angle , and dividing the waters of the St. Lawrence from those of the Atlantic ; and 3d . The line to be drawn from the source of the river St. Croix , directly . N'orth to the highlands before mentioned , and forming the other side of the angle of Nova Scotia , at which the whole described boundary begins and ends . The language in which these parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to facts so notorious and indisputable , as to defy all mistake or doubt . 1 . The first question is to ascertain the Northwest angle of Nova Scotia . This is easily done by reference to historical and legal documents of undoubted authority , notorious at the time when the treaty was framed , as well as at the present tine . We will cite here a few of these authorities ; and , in doing this , we give the assurance , that all the other documents of any authority bearing upon this point , of which there are many , concur in proving the same fact . At the date of the treaty of 1783 , John Parr , Esq. , was Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the Province of Nova Scotia . In his commission from the King of Great Britain the limits of the province are described , and in that description are the following words , viz. " bounded on the Westward , by a line drawn from Cape Sable across the entrance of the bay of Fundy , to the mouth of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by a line drawn due north from thence to the Southern boundary of our colony of Quebec , to the Northward by the said boundary , as far // as the western extremity of the bay of Chaleurs , " &amp;c . This description , which is repeated , in substance , in subsequent commissions from the same authority , confirmed as it is by the treaty , shows that the Northwest angle of Nova Scotia is to be found , at the intersection of a line running due North from the source of the river St. Croix , with the southern boundary of the colony of Quebec . The Southern boundary of the colony of Quebec is defined with equal clearness and certainty , in the royal Proclamation of October 7th , 1763 , establishing that province ; also in the act of Parliament of 1774 , for making more effectual provision for the government of the province of Quebec . In this lastnamed document , the province is described as " bounded on the South by a line from the bay of Chaleurs , along the highlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Lawrence , from . those which fall into the sea . " So also in the royal commission to Frederick Haldimand , Esq. , as Governor-in-Chief of the Province of Quebec , granted September 18th , 1777 , under which commission he remained in office until after the date of the treaty , the boundaries of the provil ) ce are described , in part , in the following words , " bounded on the South by a line from the bay of Chaleurn , along the highlands , which divide the rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence , from those which fall into the sea , to a point in forty-five degrees of North latitude , on the eastern bank of the river Connecticut . " No one can read these descriptions , of highlands extending from the bay of Chaleurs to the source of the Connecticut , and forming the southern boundary of the Province of Quebec ( since known as the Province of Lower Canada ) , without being satisfied that the highlands described are those which lie North of the river St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly East from the most northerly part of the St. John river , and no chain of highlands can be conceived of , as extending thence to the sources of the Connecticut , except to the Northward of the St. John . To the line here indicated , the jurisdiction of the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick has , in fact , always extended . If there be any difficulty in determining which are the highlands dividing the waters as described in the treaty , how have the // Governors of the two Provinces been able to define the limits of their respective jurisdictions , as described in their commissions ? It is well known that the jurisdiction of the goveminent of Lower Canada has in practice never extended to the lands watered by the St. John ; and that the government of New Brunswick , which succeeds that of Nova Scotia , by a division of the Province , has always extended beyond the St. John , to the waters falling into the bay of Chaleurs . It has never been suggested that the governments of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was , in fact , never thought that the language of the several proclamations admitted of but one interpretation . On what ground , then , can it be pretended that the treaty , which copies the same description , requires a different interpretation ? Thus we have clearly defined , by historical and official documents of the most unquestionable authority , the position of the Northwest angle of Nova Scotia . It is an angle formed by the meeting of the Easterly and Northerly boundary lines of the Province ; the former running due north from the source of the St. Croix , and the latter running *vesterly from the bay of Chaleurs , by highlands north of the river St. John , and forming the Southern boundary of the province of Lower Canada . By necessary consequence , the adjoining anole , formed by the meeting of the same lines , constitutes the Northeasterly angle of the United States . Here the Northern boundary described in the treaty begins , and here the Eastern boundary ends . This point is readily determined , by reference to any map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in existence , published either before or since the date of the treaty , on which this p*i* may not be easily designated , by the description in the treaty ; or on which the point , so designated , would not be shown to be north of the river St. John . Mitchell 's map , which is known to have been consulted by the commissioners who framed the treaty , indicates as clearly the position of the angle north of the St. John , as do the maps published at the present day . To delineate the same angle upon the soil itself , it is only necessary to run a meridian line from the monument already established at the source of the St. Croix , and to ascertain by investigations upon the spot , the point at which the waters // begin to run into the bay of Chaleurs , which is a part of the waters of the St. Lawrence , in contradistinction from the waters of the Atlantic . 2 . Having determined the position of the Northwest angle of Nova Scotia , we have necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line described in the treaty begins , but that of the highlands along which this line runs , in its course to the source of the Connecticut river . This line is describcd by the treaty , as running " along the said highlands , " and is of course identical with the line forming the angle . It is consequently identical with the southern boundary of the province of Quebec , and is defined in all the official descriptions of the limits of that province , from its establishment to the present day , as running from the bay of Chaleurs , along the highlands , to the source of the Connecticut . It is , consequently , a line running along the highlands north of the river St. John . In fact , we believe there is not extant a document of any sort , official or unofficial , in which any part of the territory watered by the streams falling into the St. John , is claimed as within the limits of the province of Quebec , or Lower Canada . It is not as a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or its modern designation , New Brunswick , that an attempt is made to extend the British claim over the territory watered by the branches of the St. John . We assume it therefore as indisputable , that the Northern line of the United States , not only begins at the Northeast angle of Nova Scotia , but is an extension of the same northern line which forms that angle , along the same highlands which designate the Northern boundary of Nova Scotia , and also the Southern boundary of Lower Canada . Beginning upon these highlands , it necessarily continues along them , until it reaches the source of the Connecticut . 3 . The only remaining part of the description in the treaty , to be considered , is that which defines the extreme Eastern portion of the boundary , namely , from the source of the river St. Croix " directly north to the AFORESAID highlands , " which divide the rivers that fall into the Atlantic Ocean from those which fall into the river St. Lawrence . " That by the " aforesaid highlands " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nova Scotia , and consequently the Southern boundary of the province of Quebec , there can not be the slightest question . Not only // does the language necessarily imply it , but , if they could be interpreted in any other sense , the description would be incomplete . The line described begins at the Northeast angle of Nova Scotia , and , after making the circuit of the territories of the Union , it ends at the same point . The Eastern boundary of the United States is consequently identical with the Western boundary of Nova Scotia , in its whole extent . It would not be answering the terms of the treaty that this line should terminate at Mars ' Hill , on the South of the St. John , if it could be admitted that that hill is a highland dividing waters falling into the St. Lawrence from waters falling into the Atlantic , because this hill is clearly not the " aforesaid highlands , " along which runs the line , forming the Northwest angle of Nova Scotia , and the Northeast angle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimants would evade this construction of the terms of the treaty , we believe are two . 1st , That there are no highlands between the St. Lawrence and the St. John , which answer the description in the treaty ; and , 2nd , Tbat the St. John is not to be regarded as one of the rivers described in the treaty , " which fall into the Atlantic Ocean , " since that river falls into the bay of Fundy , and the treaty must intend rivers which fall directly into the Atlantic . Resting on these two assumptions , they insist that the highlands which are not to be found north of the St. John , may be found at the south of that river , beginning at Mars ' Hill , and extending to the source of the Connecticut , and that these highlands divide rivers which fall into the St. Lawrence , from those which fall into the Atlantic . I. The position that there are no highlands between the rivers St. Lawrence and St. John , which correspond with the description in the treaty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . It ' it were true , that there is no elevated and mountainous tract of territory , answering the description of highlands in the ordinary acceptation of that term , it would be a sufficient compliance with the description , if there were designated a tract of ground , however low , so situated that the waters falling on one side of it , were found to flow into one of the rivers referred to , and those falling on the other side of it , to flow into the other . That there is such a tract of country between the St. Lawrence and St. John rivers , dividing the waters falling into one from those // which fall into the other , and consequently of a greater elevation than the adjoining country on each side of it no one can deny or doubt . Such a tract of countiy is appropriately designated by the term highlands , and it is in no other sense that the term was originally applied to this range of country , in the proclamation of 1763 , in the Act of Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors of Lower Canada , or adopted from those documents in the treaty of 1783 . Such a tract of country is not only discoverable , but has been actually discovered , and it forms the actual limit of the jurisdiction of the government of Lower Canada . It is only to give to the language of the treaty the same interpretation , which has been given by the British governors of that province to the same language in their commissions , and it will be construed according to its true and obvious meaning . Indeed a resort to this obvious definition of the term highlands , as used in the treaty , is unnecessary ; for it is certain , that the range of country , which in fact divides the waters of the two rivers , is an elevated , and in some parts mountainous ridge , well entitled to the appellation of highlands in the ordinary and popular sense of that term . II . The second objection to our interpretation of the treaty , and that which more than any thing else puzzled the King of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. John is not one of the rivers which is meant to be designated in the treaty as falling into the Atlantic . It is a sufficient answer to this objection , that the St. John river does in fact empty itself into the Atlantic Ocean , and not into the river St. Lawrence , or into the gulf of that name . It is true that its waters are first discharged into the Bay of Fundy , a branch of the ocean , and thence into the ocean itself , in the same manner as the river Penobscot discharges itself into Penobscot bay , and thence into the ocean . It is not only according to the literal sense of the words , but in conformity with the common use of language , that these rivers may be said to flow into the Atlantic Ocean , with the same truth and propriety as they can be said to flow into the bays through which they pass to the ocean . It may be replied , that , in this sense , the streams falling into the St. Lawrence may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we admit they might , if we were speaking of the head waters of this river , in contradistinction from waters falling into Hudson 's Bay , // or the Gulf of Mexico . The language of the treaty was used to describe the summit ridge , dividing the country bordering on the St. Lawrence from that bordering on the Atlantic . This dividing ridge was naturally , intelligibly , and accurately descrihed , in the language of the documents which we have cited , by reference to the course of the streams which water every part of the country . On one side they flow in courses more or less circuitous into the river St. Lawrence , and on the other in courses equally indirect into the Atlantic Ocean . Whether in their course they pass through waters bearing different names , whether rivers or bays , is a matter of not the least moment , and does not affect in the slightest degree the accuracy , or the intelligibleness , of the description . The British negotiators argue , that the framers of the treaty , in using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " could not have meant to designate any river , whose mouths were situated to the eastward of the river St. Croix , because that river is twice spoken of , in the same article of the treaty , as having its mouth in the Bay of Fundy . Sir Charles R. Vaughan , in his letter to Mr. Forsyth of December 8th , 1834 , says , " It is thought sufficient on the present occasion , to advert , in support of this construction of the words of the treaty , to the striking fact , that , whilst the river St. Mary , which was to form the Southern houndary of the United States , is descrihed in the second article of the treaty as falling into the Atlantic Ocean , the river St. Croix , which was to form the Eastern boundary , riot merely in the same article of the treaty , but in the very next member of the same sentence , is described as falling into the Bay of Fundy ; while a little further on in the same article , the Eastern line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river St. Croix , and the Southern line of boundary , where it terminates at the mouth of the river St. Mary , are descrihed as respectively touching the Bay of Fundy and the Atlantic Ocean . ' Can it be seriously maintained , that , in a treaty for settling a question of such vast importance as a boundary between two contiguous states , a matter which , of all others , imperiously requires preciseness of expression , the terms ' Bay of Fundy ' and Atlantic Ocean , ' should have been thus set , not once only , but twice in the same article , in pointed opposition to each other , and yet that no real distinction should have been intended to be drawn between them ; but that the Bay of Fundy ' and the Atlantic Ocean ' should have been carelessly // used as synonymous and convertible expressions ? His Majesty 's Government conceive that no reasonable doubt can be entertained , that , where the St. Croix , the Eastern limit of the United States , is described as falling into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contradistinction to the other rivers which are mentioned in the same article as falling into the Atlantic Ocean . But , if the St. Croix , whose mouth is situated at the very entrance of the Bay of Fundy , is not an Atlantic river in the meaning of the treaty , none of the rivers which discharge themselves to the eastward of the St. Croix , and higher up in the bay , can possibly be considered as such . " This reasoning is far from being conclusive . In both the instances in which the Bay of Fundy is named in connexion with the river St. Croix , it is not for the purpose of more definitely indicating the river intended , but for the purpose of indicating a specific point , namely , the mouth of the river . In one instance , the Eastern boundary line , is directed to be " a line drawn along the middle of the river St. Croix , from its mouth , in the Bay of Fundy . " In the other , it is provided , that all islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines to be drawn due east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries , between Nova Scotia on the one part , and East Florida on the other , shall respectively touch the Bay of Fundy , and the Atlantic Ocean " shall belong to the United States . It is sufficiently evident , that the description of a line to be drawn from the mouth of the river St. Croix in the fltlantic Ocean , and of the point where the said boundary shall touch the . /Itlantic Ocean , would be much less definite and intelligible , than the language used above ; for , although the river St. Croix as surely flows into the ocean , as it flows into the Bay of Fundy , yet the middle of the channel where it enters the ocean could not be so accurately determined , as that of the mouth where it enters the bay . This is a sufficient reason , why the terms " Bay of Fundy " and " Atlantic Ocean " should be placed " in pointed opposition to each other , " and the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , without the indication of any particular point upon them . On the contrary , it would have been quite superfluous , and even somewhat ludicrous , had the rivers , which are described with so much precision and certainty by the words " rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean , " been described as " rivers which // fall respectively into Merry-Meeting Bay , into Penobscot Bay , into Passamaquoddy Bay , or into the Bay of Fundy . " Sir Charles R. Vaughan remarks , that his Majesty 's Government conceive , that no reasonable doubt can be entertained , that , where the St. Croix is described as falling into the Bay of Fundy , it is advisedly so described , in contradistinction to the other rivers which are mentioned in the same article as falling into the Atlantic Ocean . It will he perceived from what we have said above , that it is not for the purpose of indicating the river in question , that the Bay of Fundy is named in connexion with it , hut for the purpose of indicating a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin . He remarks further , that , if the St. Croix , whose mouth is situate at the very entrance of the Bay of Fundy , is not an Atlantic river , in the meaning of the treaty , none of the rivers which discharge themselves to the eastward of the St. Croix , higher up the bay , can possibly be considered as such . Unfortunately for the pertinency of this remark , the St. Croix is considered , even in Mr. Vaughan 's construction of the treaty , as an Atlantic river . He places his highlands , which divide the waters of the St. Lawrence from those of the Atlantic at Mars ' Hill , between the rivers St. John and St. Croix , and consequently embraces the last-named river within the class of those described in the treaty as falling into the Atlantic ocean , although it is expressly named in the same article as having its mouth in the Bay of Fundy . This shows that the treaty does not use the terms " Bay of Fundy " and " Atlantic ocean " as descriptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this instance , as synonymous and convertible terms . If the terms " rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean do not embrace the waters of the river St. John , it is singular that neither of the governors of Lower Canada , Nova Scotia , or New Brunswick have ever made the discovery . The highlands north of the St. John , and the Ristigouche river rising therein and falling into the bay of Chaleurs , have formed the limit of the two provinces , from their establishment to the present day . On all the maps of the country , of any note , from the date of the proclamation of 1763 , to the publication of Bouchette 's map in 1815 , including the map in the Annual Register of 1763 , introduced for the purpose of illustrating the newly established boundaries of the Provinces of // Quebec and Nova Scotia , and also the maps which were published in 1783 for the illustration of the boundaries of the United States , as established by the treaty , the boundary line is uniformly laid down North of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that that river is one of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean . Mitchell 's map , which is known to have been consulted by the commissioners who framed the treaty , was published before the date of the proclamation of 1763 , and consequently no boundary running along the highlands is indicated upon it . But a line drawn upon it from the bay of Chaleurs , along any highlands , to the source of Connecticut river , would necessarily leave the St. John upon the South ; and it is not in the power of any man , with this map before him , as it is known to have been before the commissioners when they adopted the description of highlands , given in the treaty , to imagine for a moment , that they did not intend to include the St. John in the class of rivers described as falling into the Atlantic Ocean . But if it were possible to doubt upon this point , - if there were no definition whatever in the treaty , of the line by which the boundary is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the source of the Connecticut river , still the interpretation of the treaty must have been substantially the same . The supposed uncertainty respecting the highlands intended , can cause no uncertainty respecting the angle of Nova Scotia , on which depends the point where the boundary begins , and where it ends . But there is no uncertainty . Every part of the description is equally clear , and defies any other construction than that which we have given to it . The Northwestern angle of Nova Scotia , is formed by the Southern boundary line of Lower Canada , extending westerly from the Bay of Chaleurs on one side , and by a line running due north from the source of the river St. Croix on the other . Everybody conversant with the province knows , that this angle is far North of the river St. John , and that the jurisdiction of the province has always , both before and since the date of the treaty , extended North of that river . From this angle the boundary line defined in the treaty runs west by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut river . Everybody conversant with the province of Lower Canada knows , that the jurisdiction of that province has always been , both before and // since the date of the treaty , limited to the highlands North of the river St. John . So also the Eastern boundary of the United States runs due North from the source of the river St. Croix , not to Mars ' Hill as the British negotiators contend , for at this place there is no angle in the boundary of Nova Scotia *vhatever , hut to " the highlands aforesaid ; " that is , the highlands which form the boundary and angle , before so clearly described . These points being so clear and indisputable , it is surprising that the government of the United States ever admitted them to be a matter of uncertainty , and as affording a question for elaborate discussion and for arbitration . They probably fell into the error , from the supposition that , on investigation , a different state of facts might be found to exist , which would authorize a different construction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framing of the treaty of Ghent , that there was some actual ambiguity in the language of the treaty of 1733 , arising from some imagined misconception of facts , it is not probable that the position of the highlands which divide the United States from Lower Canada would have been admitted to be a debatable question . That admission however was made , and the question was referred to an arbitrator for decision . The King of the Netherlands , who was selected as the arbitrator , declined deciding the question submitted , on the ground that the treaty contained requisitions which were irreconcilable , and that it was incapable of literal execution . He did not understand the question , because probably it was obscured hy an excess of argument and illustration . He recoinmended , however , terms of compromise , which were infinitely preferable , for both parties , to a continuance of the controversy . It was a compromise , which , if it be admitted that there was any real uncertainty in the language of the treaty , or any doubt or difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as a reasonable and just one . But our government , not admitting the question to he one of real uncertainty , although they bad made it a question for negotiation , and had submitted it to arbitration , refused to accede to the proposed terms of compromise . We do not propose here to go into a discussion of the merits of that question , because we have considered it at large on a former occasion . We then recommended a compliance with the terms of the compromise proposed by the // arbitrator , not because the government were strictly bound to comply with it , but because it would be putting an end to a difficult and irritating controversy , and because a part of the recommendation , relating to another question in controversy , would have secured to us advantages which we have no right to exj ) ect from any other mode of adjustment . The arbitrator recommended , that Rouse 's Point , on which our government at the time of the late war built an expensive fort , and which is now found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to the United States , with a tract of territory enibraced within a radius of a thousand kilometres . We recommended , that our government should accept of these terms of compromise , and that , in consideration of the advan- * b by ta*e *ained the United States , by the happy settlement of all the points in controversy , and by the acquisition of Rouse 's Point , they should make an indemnity to the States of Maine and Massachusetts , for the loss of territory , which *vonld have been suffered by those States , by the acceptance of the award . It now appears tlat the British government were willing , and repeatedly offered , to accept the terms of compromise recommended by the arbitrator . The State of Maine protested against the acceptance of those terms , and they were rejected by our government . This decision is greatly to be regretted . rj7he British government has at length declared , that it is no longer ready to accept of terms so favorable , and has in fact since made a proposal of a basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed to give some account of the negotiations since the date of the award , as contained in the documents now published . These documents embrace the whole of the correspondence between the two governments , on this subject , since the decision of the King of the Netherlands was formally communicated to them . The negotiation opens with a letter from Mr. Livingston , the Secretary of State , to Mr. Bankhead , the British Charg6 d'Affaires , at Washington , in which he informs him of the determination of the Senate not to consider the decision of the King of the Netherlands as obligatory , and of their refusal to advise and consent to its ratification ; and also that they had passed a resolution , advising the President to open a new ne5otiation with the British government , for ascertail ) ing the boundary between the possessions // of the respective countries on the Northeastern frontier of the United States . He adds , that this decision was adopted , on the conviction felt by the Senate , that the sovereign arbiter had not decided the question submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not authorized by the submission . No reference is made in this letter , to either of the questions which were referred to the decision of the arbiter , except that which relates to the Northeastern boundary . It will be recollected , that two other questions were submitted , relating to the rectification of the Northern boundary line of Vermont , which is at present run about a mile too far North , and to the deteririination which of the head waters of Connecticut river is to be regarded as the Connecticut river rlesignated by the treaty . On both these questions the decision was favorable to the claim of Great Britain , with the exception of the recornmendaion above mentioned , that the fortress at Rouse 's Point should he suffered to remain to the United States . There is no room for pretending that the decision of the arbiter on these two questions was not correct . The Secretary states , as a reason , why the recommendation of the line indicated by the King of the Netherlands , not as that which was intended by the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the parties , could not be accepted by our government , that the State interested in the territory denied the right of the government of the United States to circumscribe the limits of the State , without its assent . But he states , by which the government would be clothed with more ample powers , by which they would be enabled to negotiate for a more convenient line of boundary . He was obliged subsequently to inform the British minister , that this negotiation , for obtaining more ample powers from the State of Maine , had failed . The Secretary intimated , that a negotiation for a more convenient boundary line would naturally embrace the question of the right of the navigation of the river St. John . It was apparently the intention of the government to propose to the British government , with the consent of the State of Maine , the adoption of the course of the river as the line of boundary , on the condition that the citizens of the United States should become entitled to the right of free navigation of the St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British territory . // The receipt of this letter was acknowledged by Mr. Bankhead , and it was transmitted by Li m to his government . On the return to Washington of Mr. Vaughan , British Minister , in April , 1S33 , he gave a specific ansxvcr to the propositions contained in the letter . The British government , he says , had not hesitated to declare its acceptance of the decision of the arbitrator , notwithstanding the large sacrifice which it involved , of territory heretofore considered as belonging to the British crown . He expresses the regret of his government , that they can not discover , in the new proposal of the American government , any probable means of arriving at a settlement of the difficult question . They considered it utterly hopeless to attempt to find out , at this time of day , by means of a new negotiation , an assumed line of boundary , which successive negotiators and commissioners , employed on the spot , had during so many years failed to discover , and which an impartial arbitrator , furnished by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question , had declared the impossibility of tracing , in conformity with the description contained in the treaty . He however requests to be informed , what is the principle of the new plan of boundary which the American government contemplate , and also what arrangement has been concluded with the government of Maine for avoiding the constitutional difficulty . He declares it to be necessary , that his government should be informed of the basis upon which it is proposed to negotiate , before they can either entertain the prol ) osal , or decide upon the instructions which it may be necessary to give to the minister , to whom the negotiation when agreed to may be entrusted ; and also that they should be previously assured , that the President will possess the power to carry into effect the engagement which may be concluded between the Plenipotentiaries of the two governments . He moreover states , that he is ordered distinctly to declare , that it will be impossible for the British government to connect with the discussion of the boundary question , that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to discuss that subject as a separate question , but can not consent to embarrass the negotiation respecting the botindary , by uniting with it a question respecting the navigation of the river St. John . Mr. Livingston , in reply to this communication , endeavours to show , that the probability of the success of a new commission , // appointed to examine and settle the question , is not so hopeless as the British government consider it . He proposes that a new commission be constituted , consisting of an equal number of commissioners to be appointed by each party , " with an umpire selected by some friendly sovereign , from among the most skilful men in Europe , to decide on all points on which they disagree ; or by a commission entirely composed of such men , so selected , to be attended , in the survey and view of the country , by agents appointed by the parties . " He intimates also an opinion , that a view of the subject not hitherto taken may be adopted , which may lead to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the consideration of the British government . He remarks , that boundaries of tracts of country , which are unexplored , are frequently designated by natural objects , the precise situation of which is not known , but which are supposed to be in the direction of a particular point of the compass . This remark seems to be preparatory to an admission that such an error was committed , in the designation of the boundary in question , by the framers of the treaty of 1783 . He proceeds to remark , that , " where the course will not touch the natural boundary , the rule universally adopted is , not to consider the boundary as one impossible to be traced , but to preserve the natural boundary , and to reach it by the nearest direct course . " " Thus , " he adds , " if , after more accurate surveys shall have been made , it should be found that the north course , from the head of the St. Croix , should not reach the highlands which answer the description of those designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the head of the St. Croix , whatever may be its direction , to such highlands , ought to be adopted , and the line would still be conformable to the treaty . As this principle does not seem hitherto to have been adopted , it appears to the government of the United States to offer to the commissioners , who may be appointed , the means of amicable adjustment . " Here Mr. Livingston makes an important admission , which is entirely gratuitous . It is perfectly well known , that the direct North line from the head of the St. Croix does reach the highlands which answer the description in the treaty ; and a more important consideration is , that it is the direct Northerly course of this line , forming the Westerly boundary of Nova Scotia , which serves to indicate the precise highlands , at which the boundary line begins . To abandon one of the // lines described by the treaty is virtually to abandon both , because it is the meeting of these lines , in the Southern boundary of Lower Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the allegation , that highlands may be found , dividing the waters falling into the St. Lawrence , from those which fall into the Atlantic ocean , other than the highlands North of the river St. John . This allegation our government has hitherto denied ; because the description requires , not only highlands which divide the waters of the Atlantic from those of the river , hut highlands running through the Northwest angle of Nova Scotia , which angle is formed on one side by a line running due North from the St. Croix . There are undoubtedly other highlands , which answer the first part of the description ; and , if the part of the description resting on the direct Northerly course of the Eastern line be dispensed with , our claim is virtually abandoned . In such a case , the highlands at the source of the Kennebeck would answer the description , as fully as those at the source of the streams at the North of the St. John and the consequence of the concession , offered by Mr. Livingston , would be the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Croix to the source of the Kennebeck , giving to Great Britain a greater tract of territory than her government has ever claimed . A hare inspection of the map will show , that this consequence will be inevitable . Mr. Vaughan , however , was not tempted , by this brilliant concession , to close with the proposition made by Mr. Livingston . Whether he did not comprehend the bearing and extent of the concession , - whether he was apprehensive that a treaty made upon the basis of it would stand little chance of being ratified by our government , - or whether lie was desirous of obtaining the concession in more explicit terms , before acceding to this basis of negotiation , can not be clearly inferred from the tenor of his reply . In this reply , he repeats the expression of his regret at the rejection of the decision of the King of the Netherlands , and explains the grounds on which his government felt bound to accept the decision , although the arbitrator , having declared himself unable to trace the line of boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and although the acceptance of the line so suggested would cause a great sacrifice of territory , hitherto considered as belonging to the British crown . He expresses his convic // tion that it is hopeless to expect a favorable result from a renewed negotiation upon the basis of the establishment of the boundary established by the treaty , and that it will be with great reluctance , that the British government will consent , after the expense , delay , and unsatisfactory result of the commission of boundary under the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent , to have recourse to the appointment of auother commission , like that proposed by Mr. Livingston . He professes not sufficiently to comprehend the new view suggested , by Mr. Livingston , for adoption as the basis of the renewed negotiation , and intimates that a deviation from a direct north line , might lead to tbe adoption of an oblique line towards highlands to the eastward of it , and thus trench upon the telritories of New Brunswick . He intimates in the close of his letter , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States revives to the full extent the pretensions of Great Britain , in consequence of which it becomes an object of great importance to put an end to the present question of boundary . After the receipt of this letter , Mr. Livingston explained his plan more fully to Mr. Vaughan , in two verbal conferences , and subsequently addressed to him a note containing the following further explanation . " The first point seems to be fully explained in any note above referred to , and I repeat that the President will agree to either of the modes therein suggested , to secure a final decision of the question . The reasons why , under the present circumstances , he can not undertake to negotiate , upon any other basis than that of the treaty of 1783 , drawn from the nature of our government , were fully explained to you in those conversations . And the probability of ascertaining the boundary according to that treaty , by applying the principle to which I , perhaps , too briefly alluded in my note , was further developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form to your government , I now repeat the substance of my observations . " The boundary , as far as the head of the river St. Croix , is ascertained and agreed upon by both nations . The monument erected there is then a fixed point of departure . From thence we have a two-fold description of boundary ; a line in a certain direction , and a natural object to which it was supposed the line in that direction would lead ; a line from the source of the river St. Croix directly North , ' and the highlands which divide the waters that flow into the Atlantic ocean from those which flow into the river St. Lawrence . The American government have believed // that the two descriptions would coincide , that is to say , that the highlands designated by the treaty would be reached by a North line drawn from the head of the St. Croix . They make no pretensions further east than that line ; but if , on a more accurate survey , it should be found , that the North line mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described , and that they should be found at some point further West , then the principle to which I refer would apply , to wit , that the direction of the line to counect the two natural boundaries must be altered , so as to suit their ascertained position . Thus , in the annexed diagram suppose A the monument at the head of the St. Croix , A B the North line drawn from them . If the highlands described in the tre ty should be found in the course of that line , both the descriptions in the treaty would be found to coincide , and the question would be at an end ; if , on the contrary , those highlands should be found at C or D , or any other point West of that . line , then the Eastern boundary of the United States , would be the line A C or A D , or any other line drawn directly from the point A , to the place which should be found to answer the description of the highlands mentioned in the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing , in order to simplify the operation , that the commission should be restricted to the simple question of determining the point designated by the treaty as the highlands which divide the waters , to which point a straight line shall be drawn from the monument , and this line shall , as far as it extends , form part of the boundary in question ; that they shall then designate the course of the line along the highlands , and fix on the point designated as the Northwesternmost head of the Connecticut river . " The diagram above referred to is in the following form . D C 13 A // It is not very apparent upon what ground the President , while he expressly disclaimed the power under the constitution of negotiating on a basis other than that of a recognition of the line descrihed in the treaty of 1783 , because such a negotiation would lead to a cession of territory claimed as belonging to one of the States , was yet willing , in the interpretation of the treaty , to wave one of the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , to justify a different interpretation of that instrument , and an interpretation by which a large tract of territory claimed hy the State of Maine would he abandoned to the British Provinces . Mr. Vaughan seems to have found it difficult to comprehend the distinction , in the mind of the President , which led him to prefer the basis proposed , to the direct proposal of an improved line . On the 31st of May , he addressed to Mr. McLane , who had succeeded Mr. Livingston in the office of Secretary of State , a letter in which he appears still not to comprehend the proposition made by Mr. Livingston . He thinks that the time has arrived , when the question can only be set at rest hy an abandonment of " the defective description of boundary contained in the treaty , " and hy the two governments mutually agreeing upon a conventional line of boundary more convenient to both parties . In fact he says , that the operation of the principle proposed by Mr. Livingston is so restricted to the terms of the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that which the undersigned has been instructed by his government to inform the government of the United States that it was hopeless to negotiate upon . " He proceeds to remark , that the British government had hitherto insisted upon the highlands of the treaty being sought exclusively south of the St. John river , and denies the claim of the United States to any territory north of the St. John . He remarks , that " the impression left on his mind , after his conversation with Mr. Livingston , and the production by him of a map upon a small scale , is , that the highlands to he sought in the manner he proposed , would probably he found north of the St. John , hut westward some miles of the river St. Francis . " LIe asks for further explanations before submitting the proposition to his government . Mr. MeLane replies in a letter dated June 5th , 1833 , in which after recapitulating the leading points of the case he proceeds as follows . // " It is true that Great Britain has hitherto insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for exclusively south of the St. John river ; but it is also true that the United States have , with equal confidence and pertinacity , insisted upon seeking for them exclusively north of that river . " It is the difficulty of reconciling these conflicting pretensions , which has hitherto prevented the settlement of the boundary question , arising , chiefly , however , from the impracticability of finding a point of highlands answering the description of the treaty , to which a line one north from the monument could be drawn . " It is now proposed , therefore , to make another effort , and by means which heretofore have not been tried , to overcome this difficulty , and , discarding the due north line , should that become necessary , to seek for , and find , in the first place , the ' highlands which divide those rivers which empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence , from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean ; ' and when these shall be found in any part of the disputed territory , north or south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monument to said highlands , and to that point thereof which shall be nearest to a due north line from the monument . Mr. Livingston in his note of the 28th May , has already provided against any deviation eastward from the direct north line from the St. Croix . " It will be perceived , that the two most important clauses in the treaty , descriptive of the boundary sought , viz , that which fixes upon the northwest angle of Nova Scotia as the point of departure , and that which adopts a direct north line , the ancient boundary of Nova Scotia , as one of the lines forming that angle , are abandoned in the proposed new basis of negotiation , the first by the omission of all reference to it , and the other by expressly waving it . Mr. Vaughan having thus obtained all the admissions which seemed necessary , in the most explicit terms he could extort from the Secretary of State , replied as follows ; " The undersigned begs leave to express his satisfaction upon learning that the President directed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assurance that no limitations are to be put upon the course of the proposed commission , which is to endeavour to find highlands separating waters as described in the treaty of 1783 , in any part ofthe disputed territory north or south of the St. John . The undersigned will lose no time in submitting the proposition made by the government of the United // States , to his Majesty 's government , as the President , it appears from Mr. McLane 's note , is not authorized , after the recent proceedings in the Senate , to agree upon a conventional line of boundary , without the consent of the State of Maine , which it is not prohable will he given , while there remains a reasonable prospect of discovering the line of the treaty of 1783 . " No reply to this proposition was received from the British government until February , 1834 . On the 10th of February , 1834 , Mr. Vaughan addressed two letters to the Secretary of State . One of them is devoted to certain remarks on the constitutional difficulty in accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of the objections of the State of Maine . The purpose of these remarks is to argue , that , as in the Arbiter 's opinion there are no highlands which fulfil both the conditions stated in the treaty , the territory which lies between the highlands claimed by Great Britain , and those claimed by the United States respectively , is not the absolute property of either party , but is in some proportion or other , to be hereafter determined , the property of both ; and that therefore it is not territory belonging of right to Maine , and consequently is not such territory as the American government can be precluded by the Constitution from relinquishing . The other letter is a direct reply to the proposition made by Mr. Livingston and Mr. McLane . It recapitulates the several points decided by the King of the Netherlands , and specifies those which the British government consider as being positively decided by the Arbiter , and as coming strictly within the terms of the reference . These decisions the British government considers binding on both parties . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North latitude , is accompanied with a recommendation that Rouse 's Point , with a surrounding circle with a radius of one kilometre , shall belong to the United States . The British government declares itself willing to accede to this recommendation . They say , that on two points out of the three the Arbiter has made a plain and positive decision , and on the other he has recoinmended a line which he considers conformable with the spirit of the treaty , and approaching most nearly to the probable intention of its framers ; and they are still willing to adopt this line . Mr. Vaughan proceeds to state a number of subordinate // questions , decided by the Arbiter , which have a bearing upon the main question , of the position of the Northwest angle of Nova Scotia , which decisions it is the opinion of the British government that the two governments ought to acquiesce in . They think that the spirit of the agreement , to make the reference , requires that the two parties should so acquiesce , and that , by so doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining points of difference , and would materially facilitate an amicable adjustment of the rest . Mr. Vaughan recites seven of those decisions of the Arbiter , which he proposes that the two governments should adopt as the ground-work of future proceedings , and remarks that no satisfactory or useful result could he obtained from the local survey proposed by the American government , until the two parties are agreed upon these seven points . He adds , " The treaty requires that highlands should be found dividing rivers which fall into the St. Lawrence from rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean ; and that those highlands should be found in a direction due north from a spot which has already been determined , namely , the source of the St. Croix . " Now , every thing which is known of the geography of the country , tends to show , that no such highlands can be found in that particular meridian ; and the American government , almost admitting that fact , suggests that the required highlands should be sought for in a northwesterly direction from the ascertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going far enough to the Westward , such highlands as those required by the treaty could be found , because it is well known , that the high ground in the neighbourhood of the source of the St. John , divides the Kennebec , which falls into the Atlantic , from the Chaudi*re , which falls into the river St. Lawrence . " Mr. Vaughan then alludes to the difficulty , which prevents the American government from acquiescing in the recommendation of the king of the Netherlands , that it has no authority to agree to any other line of boundary than that which is described by the treaty , especially one which might imply a cession of territory , and asks if this objection would not be equally fatal to the line suggested by Mr. Livingston . He concludes with the statement , that " his Majesty 's government think that in the first place , and previously to any further negotiation , they are entitled to claim from the United States an acquiescence in the decisions pronounced by the Arbiter upon all // those points which he has decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the government with which they will have to treat , is possessed of the powers necessary for carrying into effect any arrangement upon which the two parties might agree . * It is pretty apparent from this letter , that the real ground on which the British government declined acceding to the proposal of a new commission , on the basis proposed by Mr. Livingston , was an apprehension , which we can not think without foundation , that an arrangement concluded on that basis would be vehemently protested against by the State of Maine , as a sacrifice of its rights as secured by the treaty , and would not be ratified by the Senate . They were therefore desirous , before proceeding farther , of having an explicit recognition of the basis , by the party most deeply interested . in reference to the position taken by Mr. Vaughan , that no such highlands , as those described in the treaty , are to be found in a direction due north from the source of the St. Croix , we wish to recall the attention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only reason why he can find , in that direction , no highlands dividing waters falling into the St. Lawrence from waters falling into the Atlantic Ocean , is that he will not admit that the waters of the St. John fall into the Atlantic . But the most material , because the most specific part of the description in the treaty , is that of Highlands running through the . JVorthwest angle of JVova Scotia , and consequently , highlands forming the Southern boundary of Lower Canada and running westerly from the bay of Chaleurs to the source of Connecticut river . Mr. Vaughan can not deny , that the direct north line from the St. Croix will strike these highlands , nor can he deny that these highlands are as clearly indicated in the treaty , as it is in the power of language to describe them . To the letter of Mr. Vaughan , above referred to , Mr. McLane replied under date of March 11th , 1834 , by a long argument to prove , that an acquiescence in the seven points decided by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propositions , he argues , instead of aiding the Arbiter in coming to a decision , brought his mind to the conclusion that the line of 1783 was impracticable . He therefore declined , although all the seven propositions are conceded in substance , by Mr. Livingston 's proposition , to make any specific ac // knowledgment of them . As to the necessity of obtaining the previous assent of the State of Maine , Mr. McLane says , that , the authority of the general government being unquestionable , their power to employ all the legal and usual means for its ascertainmnent is equally clear ; and he expresses a hope , that l ) i5 Majesty 's government will not be deterred from embracing the means now proposed for settling the controversy , from an apprehension of difficulties , which it is confidently believed are not likely to occur . Mr. Vaughan in a letter , dated March 16th , states to Mr. 1IcLane his reasons for believing any further prosecution of the negotiation on the basis proposed , to be entirely hopeless . Mr. McLane , March 21st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the declaration that the United States have no power to adopt a new conventional line without the assent of Maine , and that this assent , in the present state of the controversy , it is not possible to obtain . He therefore invites the British government to unite with the President in another effort , " aided by the adoption of a plain and easy rule of surveying , to find the line of the treaty of 1783 . " Mr. Vaughan in reply , March 24th , informs Mr. McLane , that he will seize the earliest opportunity of laying before his government , this invitation . The question here rests until December 8th , 1834 , when we have the answer of Mr. Vaughan , under instructions from his government , addressed to Mr. Forsyth , who had now become Secretary of State . In regard to the " rule of surveying " stated by Mr. McLane , the British cabinet do not consider it to be so generally established and recognised , as Mr. McLane assumes it to be . " His Majesty 's government , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to the present , in which the principle here assumed has been actually put in practice ; but , on the con* trary , they recollect , that in an analogous case , arising out of the same article of the treaty of 1783 , this supposed rule was inverted by the agents of the American government . The treaty of 1783 , ' he says , declared that the line of boundary was to proceed from the Lake of the Woods in a due west course to the river Mississippi . It was afterwards ascertained , by actual survey , that even the sources of the Mississippi lie south of the latitude of the Lake of the Woods , and that , consequently , it would be impossible to reach the Mississippi by any line drawn // due west of that lake . In order to escape from the difficulty thus encountered , it was urged by the American commissioners , that the natural object , the Mississippi , should be wholly disregarded ; and in the final settlement of that part of the boundary , as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th , 1818 , the principle now contended for by the American government was reversed ; for , instead of the natural object being made the primary , and the connecting line the secondary guide , the natural object , namely , the river Mississippi , was put out of consideration , and the connecting line , namely , the line to be drawn due west from the Lake of the Woods , was converted into a primary element of the boundary . It was demonstrated that such a line could never reach the Mississippi at all ; but , instead of adhering to the source of the Mississippi as one fixed point , and drawing a new connecting line to it from the Lake of the Woods , which was the other fixed point , the commissioners adhered to the arbitrary line to be drawn due west from the lake , and wholly abandoned the Mississippi , though that river was specifically mentioned in the treaty as a landmark . ' Mr. Vaughan proceeds to state , that in the arguments which were laid before the Arbiter , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framers of the treaty in using the words " rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean , " could not have meant to designate any rivers whose mouths are at the eastward of the St. Croix , which falls into the Bay of Fundy . This view , he says , was confirmed by the opinion of the King of the Netherlands , an opinion , which , although not accepted by the government of the United States , as carrying with it the authority of an award , is at least as described in the report of the Senate , " the impartial opinion of a disinterested judge , selected by both parties , to settle a question of great perplexity . " The British government therefore propose , that the American government shall concede this point , and shall agree in deciding , " that the Atlantic rivers , which are to guide the commissioners in searching for the highlands described in the treaty , are those rivers which fall into the sea to the westward of the mouth of the river St. Croix . " This , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy , which although virtually yielded in Mr. Livingston 's proposition , was not conceded in express terms . Mr. Vaughan closes his letter by saying , // " The undersigned is instructed to represent to Mr. Forsyth that his Majesty 's government consider a clear agreement between the two governments on this point to be an indispensable preliminary to the establishment of any new commission of survey . Till this point is decided , no survey of commissioners can lead to any useful result . But the decision of this point turns upon the interpretation of the words of a treaty , and not upon the operations of surveyors ; and , his Majesty 's government having once submitted this point , in common with others , to the judgment of an impartial arbiter , by whose award they have declared themselves ready to abide , they can not now consent to submit it to any other arbitration . " Upon receiving this letter the President seems to have abandoned the attempt to obtain a delineation of the line of the treaty of 1783 through the agency of new commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated April 28th , 1835 , by informing Mr. Vaughan that " he is instructed to say , that he will be most happy to receive any such proposition as his Britannic Majesty 's government may think it expedient to make . " He intimates , that whatever proposition is made for the establishment of a conventional boundary , must , before being rati fled , receive the assent of the State of Maine . In the course of his explanation of the views with which the previous negotiation had been prosecuted , Mr. Forsyth remarks , that in the instance cited by Mr. Vaughan , of a supposed ( leparture from the rule of surveying laid down by the President , the line adopted was not assumed as the true line described by the treaty , but was adopted as a conventional substitute . He does not , however , press further the adoption of that rule . He remarks , that Mr. McLane had been authorized by the President to propose to Sir Charles R. Vaughan , for the consideration of his Majesty 's government , that if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three points of difference was accepted , the United States would , on their part , consent to adopt the place designated by Great Britain , as the Northwesternmost head of Connecticut river , and would also , as to the remaining point , the line from the Connecticut river to the St. Lawrence , adopt that which was run by Valentine and Collins , which , it was believed , would not be unacceptable to Great Britain . He also informs Mr. Vaughan , in reply to the suggestion that a negotiation should // be opened for the establishment of a conventional boundary , which , while it respects as far as practicable the existing pretensions of the two countries , shall secure the best interests of each , that he is specially instructed to assure him , that the President duly appreciates the suggestion ; and that he may assure his government , that , if the President had like powers with those which the British government has , " he would have met the suggestion in as favorable spirit as that by which it was prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions in this letter , remarks that " the general result of the arbitration , to which his Majesty 's government expressed a willingness to adhere , was so manifestly in favor of the United States , that to them were assigned three fifths of the territory in dispute , and Rouse 's Point in Lake Champlain , to which the American government had voluntarily resigned all claim . " He promises to transmit Mr. Forsyth 's note to his government without delay , and at the same time intimates the necessity of taking measures , in the first instance , for obtaining the consent of the State of Maine , to the adoption of a conventional substitute for the line of the treaty of 1783 . On the 28th of December last , Mr. Bankhead , the l3ritisli Charg* d'Affaires , by instructions of his government , replied to the letter of Mr. Forsyth , by taking a little higher ground , and a more positive tone , than had been before assumed . After recapitulating the course of proceedings , in reference to the arbitration , and the readiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the award , he proceeds to make the following communication . The Senate of the United States refused , in July , 1832 , to subscribe to the award ; and during the three years which have elapsed since that time , aithoagh the British government has more than once declared that it was still ready to abide by its offer to accept the award , the government of the United States has as often replied that , on its part , that award could not be agreed to . The British government must now , in its turn , declare that it considers itself , by this refusal of the United States , fully and entirely released from the conditional offer which it had made ; and the undersigned is instructed distinctly to announce to the President , that the British government withdraws its consent to accept the territorial compromise recommended by the king of the Netherlands . " // He proceeds to state the objections of his government to the several modes of proceeding which bad be3n proposed by the President . They are willing , however , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey , provided that there is a previous understanding that neither party shall be required to give up its own interpretation of the river question , and that the commissioners he instructed to search for highlands , upon the character of which no doubt could exist on either side . If this modification of the proposal shall be declined , they see no alternative but to abandon the attempt to draw a line in conformity with the words of the treaty , and to fix on a conventional line , on equitable principles , and with a view to the interests and convenience of the two parties . Lie proceeds to submit the following proposition . When a tract of country is claimed by each of two states , and each party is equally convinced of the justice of its own claims to the whole of the district in question , the fairest way of settling the controversy would seem to be , to divide in equal portions , between the two claimants , the territory in dispute . Such a mode of arrangement appears to be consistent with the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , propose to that of the United States , to adjust the present difference by dividing equally between Great Britain and the United States the territory in dispute ; allotting to each party that portion which , from contiguity or other circumstances , would be most desirable as a possession for each . " The general outline of such a division would be , that the boundary between the two states should be drawn ( as required by the treaty ) due north from the head of the St. Croix river , and should be carried straight on till it intersected the St. John ; from thence it should run up the bed of the St. John , to the southernmost source of that river ; and from that point it should be drawn to the head of the Connecticut river , in such manner as to make the northern and southern allotments of the divided territory , as nearly as possible equal to each other in extent ; the northern allotment to remain with Great Britain , the southern allotment to belong to the United States . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by apparently admitting the necessity of abandoning the attempt hitherto made , to establish the line defined by the treaty . // " The President , therefore , " he remarks , " as at present informed , is under the necessity of looking to the new and conventional line offered in Mr. Bankhead 's note . That equity in disputes about territory , when both parties are satisfied of the justice of their respective pretensions , requires a fair division of the disputed property , is a truth the President freely admits ; but the undersigned is instructed to remind Mr. Bankhead of what has been heretofore stated , that in a conventional line the wishes and interests of the State of Maine were to be consulted , and that the President can not , in justice to himself or that State , make any proposition utterly irreconcilable with her previous wellknown opinions on the subject . His Majesty 's government will not have forgotten , that the principle of compromise and equitable division was adopted by the King of the Netherlands in the line recommended by him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because unjust to Maine . And yet the line proposed by the King of the Netherlands gave to Great Britain little more than two millions , while the proposition now made by his Britannic Majesty 's government secures to Great Britain of the disputed laud more than four millions of acres . The division offered by Mr. Bankhead 's note is not in harmony with the equitable rule from which it is said to spring , and , if it were in conformity with it , could not be accepted without disrespect to the previous decisions and just expectations of Maine . The President is far from supposing this proposition is founded upon a desire of his Majesty 's government to acquire territory , or that the quantity of land , secured to Great Britain in the proposed compromise , was the leading motive to the offer made . 1-us Majesty 's government has , no doubt , made the offer without regard to the extent of the territory falling to the north or south of the St. John , from a belief that a change in the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundary , would be useful in preventing territorial disputes in future . Coinciding in this view of the subject , the President is nevertheless compelled to decline the boundary proposed , as inconsistent with the known wishes , rights , and decisions of the State . " With a view , however , to terminate at once all controversy ; and satisfactorily , without regard to the extent of territory lost by one party or acquired by the other , to establish an unchangeable and definite and indisputable boundary , the President will , if his Majesty 's government consents to it , apply to the State of Maine for its assent to make the river St. John , from its source to its mouth , the boundary between Maine and his Britannic Majesty 's dominions in that part of North America. ** // Mr. Bankhead in reply , March 4th , recalls the attention of Mr. Forsyth to the modification proposed of the President 's proposition , for a commission of exploration and survey , and repeats the proposal of such a commission on the conditions before specified . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the proposition offered in Mr. Forsyth 's note , to make the river St. John , from its source to its mouth , the houndary between the United States and the Province of New Brunswick , is one to which the British government , he is convinced , will never agree . Mr. Forsyth in a note to Mr. Bankhead , dated March 5th , which forms the last document of the series now puhlished , expresses the hope that the British government will think more favorahly of the proposition than Mr. Bankhead anticipated . In relation to the modification suggested of the President 's proposal , he declines answering , until the President shall he more fully informed of the views of the British government in offering it , that he may he enabled to judge how the report of a commission , thus limited in its powers , is likely to lead to a settlement of the question . The President also desires to he informed which mode of selecting the commission , in case the modification shall he agreed to , the British government prefer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-continued negotiation leaves the two governments apparently much further from an adjustment of the matters in controversy , than when it hegan . The terms of adjustment now proposed hy the British government demand a much greater sacrifice from this country , than those which they were willing to accede to , during the first three years of the negotiation ; and the admissions , which have been made by our government , will make it much more difficult to insist , with any hope of success , on a literal execution of the treaty of 1783 . The question has in the mean time become of much greater moment , from the great enhancement in value of the lands in controversy . The rapid diminution of the supply of timber , for the immense market now open for it , has led to an unprecedented advance in the price of timber lands in the State of Maine , and in the Province of New Brunswick . This consideration will naturally render both parties more tenacious of their claim to a tract of territory consisting of some millions of acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // It is much to be regretted , that a controversy , which a short time since might have been terminated with so much ease , should be protracted for so long a period of time , and be suffered to endanger the friendly relations between the two countries . The liie of boundary remains undetermined along a frontier of several hundred miles in extent , which is becoming daily tnore fully peopled , and on which serious collisions are constantly in danger of arising , from the conflicting claims of individuals , resulting from the conflicting claims of jurisdiction of the respective countries . In a former discussion of this subject , we expressed an opinion in favor of the acceptance of the award of the King of the Netherlands , accom panied with an indemnity to the States of Maine and Massachusetts for their loss of territory and of property , in consideration of the advantage which the United States would gain , as an equivalent for this sacrifice , in the acquisition of Rouse 's Point , and in the satisfactory adjustment of all the points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a settlement may still be made on nearly the same terms .
