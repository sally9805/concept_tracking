Tuckerman , Henry T. ( Henry Theodore ) , 1813-1871 : THE BRIDE 'S DEPARTURE . from The bride 's departure ( 1836 ) The bride bent o'er her sire , And filial fondness strove with woman 's love , As o'er the Eolian lyre Contending breezes tremulously move . That high and placid brow So long revered , shaded with hoary hair  --  Those lips that even now , In loving dreams , do bless her unaware ;  --  That hand that e'er has prest , At morn and eve , benignantly , her head , Swayed her , in infancy , to rest , And her young feet to the green pastures led ,  --  All speak , though he lies sleeping , And wake a mystic movement in her soul , Till , in silence , weeping  --  She inly breathes the thoughts that spurn control . " My father ! had ye felt The long lone strife that I have known within , Knew ye how oft I 've knelt , Asking , in prayer , if such love were a sin ; Could'st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wound thy exiled dove , Or her heart-throbbings hear ,  --  Ye might conceive a daughter 's quenchless love . " As o'er the mirror wave , In rapt delight , doth bend the timid deer , Nor durst her soft lips lave , Ere listing long for note of danger near ; So ere thy Clara 's breast Shrined any love , save what lives there for thee , For aught that could protest Against the spirit-call , she listened fervently . " Naught broke the solemn spell ; Sweet the light zephyr and the streamlet 's glide , And woodland carol fell Responsive on my ear , and hailed me bride ; Ay , by their music mild , By friendship 's tone and every gentle sound , My soul was more beguiled , For Nature hallowed love , love beamed from all around . " He stirs ! how dark the morrow To which he will awake ! Shall I  --  his child , Consign him to such sorrow ? No ; father , I will stay ; heart , cease thy beatings wild ! But ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love 's grasp ; I am a part of thee And can not choose , but go  --  This bleeding heart is thine by pure affinity . " Father above ! watch o'er Him who , through happy years , has been to me , And wilt be evermore , The emblem blest of thy paternity ! See  --  now the sunbeams play Upon his couch ; I hear the matin bell ! Yes , love ,  --  we must away ,  --  One gentle kiss ;  --  dear father , fare thee well ! "
