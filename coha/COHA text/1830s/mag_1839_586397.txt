txt THE Twenty-Fifth Congress has come and gone . It has been a violent , embittered , and factious one ; and it has exhibited many a scene which can afford very little satisfaction to the sincere lover of his country and her institution to contemplate or to recur to . But it is gone , with its good and its evil , to take its place in history - with all its aspirations of dishonest ambition , all its little interests , all its passions , its intrigues , its treacheries , itscrimes-.together , too , with all the features of a brighter character which it may also have exhibited . Through all the stormy excitements of the hour , the wheel of time has still rolled swiftly and steadily on ; and now , as we look hack upon the history of th' last two years-like a distant view of an agitated expanse of water-while the tossing froth of its waves is no longer distinguished in the broader scope of vision which the eye takes in , and the murmur of their fretful dashing can no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , planted firmly in the mid&amp;t and towering high above , arrest the attention only the more distinctly and the more strikingly , than they could before . We propose to take a rapid review of this period . The contrast between its commencement and its close will be found pregnant with valuable political instruction . There have been three sessions of the Twenty-Fifth Congress . Throughout the whole , the Administration has been in real minority in the lower , and in majority in the upper House-reversing the relative positions of parties during a portion of the previous Administration . Nothing has therefore been done on the great question which has now , like the rod of Aaron , swallowed up every minor one , the Divorce of Bank and State . It has been a period of transition , of preparation , of discussion , previous to the final settlement of the public opinion , which will develope itself in action , by establishing a permanent fiscal system for the country , at the next Congress // Throughout this period there has been no regular , legalized and or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept and administered almost wholly at the discretion and under the responsibility of the Executive , who has in vain repeatedly sought to be relieved from the burthen . The former system , resting upon the banking system of the States , had exploded , from the internal action of its own vicious principles , and only encumbered the country and the Government with *s ruins . By the universal suspensionof the banks , in May , 1837 , not only did the Government find itself suddenly cut off from all the existing provision for its support and for its immense expenditure , of which it was impossible to arrest the progress , but all the existing law for the custody of its accruing revenue suddenly expired by its own limitation ; and upon the Executive was thrown the vast responsibility of organizing a new system on the spur of the occasion , and of administering it , in the midst of all the clamor of faction , and the all but revolutionary agitation of panic with which the country was filled , at its own discretiori and its own peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own special regulations , and its own unresting and , so far as possible under such circumstances , omnipresent vigilance . The events of that memorable year of the suspension are already history . No Administration under our Government has ever been subjected to so severe an ordeal . It met fearlessly and firmly all the responsibility of the crisis . It never yielded or quailed an instant . It never suffered itself to he forced or tempted to recognize any other than the specie standard of value , as designed by the sagacious founders of our institutions . The Post Office Department , in despite of " mobs of gentlemen , " headed by distinguished members of Congress , resolutely adhered to the determination promptly antiounced by it , to receive and disburse gold and silver alone in its transactions . And the Treasury Department , by the expedient of receiving in payment its own protested drafts on the deposite banks , and by making the most of the small stock of specie on hand , was enabled successfully to resist the powerful pressure that was made upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper of the suspended banks ; until the convocation of Congress , at the Extra Session , relieved it by the issue of Treasury notes , at the same time that it relieved the institutions and individuals indebted to the Government br liberal allowances of time . But it is not to be denied that during that period , faithful as was the Administration to itself , to its cause and its creed , its party at large throughout the country became dreadfully confused and disorganized . The great majority of the old local leaders upon whom it had been long accustomed to rely , whether from having had the foundations of their democracy sapped by the long possession of party ascendancy and power , or corrupted typrosperityand by the // seductive blandishments of " the Credit System , ' either openly fell away from the simple and pure original principles of ' their political faith , or by their indecision and doubting lukewarmness produced no less injurious an effect on the public sentiment of their respective spheres of local influence . Great numbers also of the incumbents of office under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , were seen to imitate the instinct of the rats that abandon the falling house ; and either openly or indirectly were able by their very official positions to do it incalculable injury , in sowin.g dissension , distraction and panic , at the very moment when , most of all , all should have been union , , firmness and eourage . The Opposition , on The other hand , were full of confidence and energy . The fate of the Administration was regarded by them as sealed  --  the Latium of power , Their promised land , flowing with milk and honey , now full in view ! . Here was the legitimate result of its " experiments , " of its " tampering with the currency , " - here the fulfilment of every prediction of disaster ,  --  here the practical evidence and illustration , equally of its political profligacy , and of its ignorant incompetence for the responsibilities of government ! Their press surpassed itself ' in thundering daily against it the most vehement philippics of denunciation , mingled with the most exsilting p*ans of triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and on the part of ' the Opposition the only question was , which of their leaders was to be rewarded , for their long struggle in minori ? y , with the Presidential nomination , was their party candidate-such nomination being regarded as but the formal preliminary to the popular election which was to be carried , as matter of course , almost by default . On the assemblage of Congress the eyes of ' the country were turned with intense anxiety upon the seat of government ,  --  when the President 's Message ivent forth , with an electric effect , through the length and breadth of the land . It cut a clean swathe as it went , fat and wide , through the midst of the parties . It was immediately re*cognized by the Democratic party as a sign of power , which could not fail to lead them again to victory . Bold and strong as it was , at was promptly responded to , as an appeal that touched the very inner heart of the Democracy ; and though a very small proportion hesitated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear of the great popular movement of opinion of which it was at the same time a representative and a guide , yet as a whole the immense majority of that par'ty accepted it immediately , as the truebasis for that reorganization rendered necessary by the recent political earthquake . It effected , too , another important object . The unnatural *and ill-oniened union , which had grown out of peculiar causes to which it is unnecessary here to refer , between Northern Federalism , // with its National Bank , its internal Improvements , its Tariff and its high notions of strong and splendid consolidated government7 and the Southern ultra State-Rights school of politics , which could approach the former only on the principle of the meeting of extremes ,  --  that incongruous union was instantly broken by it , as by some potent spell-word which it had long been awaiting . The eminent individual who stood before the country as peculiarly representing and embodying th' , e political creed of that school , instantly was seen to feel and re*ognize its power ; and promptl*y , and in manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave in his adhesion to the principles of that document , and his powerful support to the policy which it recommended , in timely anticipation of that general movement of Southern opinion which the eagle eye of his intellectual vision eould not but foresee as an inevitabre certainty . During the Extra Session one of the finest debates of modei-n parliamentary history took place in Congress , in both of its branches , but more particularly in the Senate ; and the movement of the waters , begun there , extended itself in every direction , like the spreadin g ripple , throughout the country . The lawyers of the Opposition had a strong prima facie case against the Administration . The suspension , the distress , the panic , were in full vogue , and supplied the amplest materials of denunciation and plausible argument , against the party whose policy , it was maintained , had naturally developed itself to these consequences . Relief was the cry-regulation of the currency  --  a National Bank ! The bank alone-with the expulsion of the party in power-could afford the panacea which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . It alone could bring hack a resumption of specie payments-it alone restore order to the deranged foreign and domestic exchanges of the country-it alone reanimate its paralyzed industry and commerce ! Meantime it were indeed the unpardonable sin to refuse the moral sanction of the Government to the suspension of the banks , by withdrawing from them the use of the public revenues , and the agency for the custody and disbursement of them , and by attempting to make any tyrannical distinction between their depreciated paper currency and real substantial rncnmey ? On the other hand , the position and policy of the Administration were admirably sustained in argument hy its friends , sorely at disadvantage as they were placed by the circumstances of the times . We need not here retrace the grounds of the argument , which was carried on with unrelaxing vigor through both sessions of Congress .. Towards the close of the latter , its influence and the effects of the firm attitude pursued by the Democratic party , began already to make themselves apparent . In spite of the most strenuous efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the espe // vial guidance of the Bank of the United States , the public opinion thus generated and stimulated forced the banks to resume specie payments ; which movement , commencing in New York , gradually extended itself over other parts of the country . The natural and usual tendency to increased excess of issues , during a period of pressure and suspension , was effectually checked . Specie poured into the country . Its foreign debt , contracted by excess of importation and luxurious consump*on , gradually liquidated itself by the exportation of its natural products ; and p*zri passu with that process the foreign exchanges rectified themselves with the certainty with which , by the great laws of nature , water when left free to flow will find its own level ; while the continued disorder of the domestic exchanges so manifestly resolved itself into the difference of credit of the different local paper currencies , which required only the extension of the resumption to rectify , that this soon ceased to be an available topic of argument in favor of a National Bank . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and monopoly of certain important branches of mercantile business , especially its cotton speculations-its palpably illegal and fraudulent re*missioa of floods of the notes of the old bank-its strenuous but fruitless struggle to prolong the suspension , with all its incalculable evils , to continue the golden harvest which it was enabled to reap from the general derangement and disaster  --  the coolly unblushing insensibility evinced by it to the ordinary laws of honesty and morality , in the most unfortunate public letters of its President-these causes cobperated effectively with the others we have alluded to , and with the daily reviving industry and business of the country , in dispelling much of the delusion with which a large portion of the public mind had been so long possessed in favor of a National Bank , and especially of that one which had heretofore become so closely identified with the cause of the Whig party , as to render their political destinies necessarily inseparable . By this time the process of reaction in the public mind , from the state of opinion hostile to the Administration which the crisis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going steadily forward . The reorganization of the Democracy was rapidly completing and consolidating itself . All distrust and fear had long since vanished ; while they began unequivocally to manifest themselves on the side of our adversaries , as , one after another , the progress of time and the event swept away the foundations of their old arguments and popular appeals , and as they marked the hourly ebb of that tide of public excitement which their ill-omened efforts of panic-making , effective only in the hour of their country 's suffering and shame , had been able to lash up " To such a sudden flood of mutiny . " // The fall elections-with but one or two exceptions , which it was easy to exnlain by adequate peculiar causes-soon following the adjournment of Congress , bore signal and overwhelming evidence of the truth of this representation of the progress of opinion . We need not here dwell upon them One after another , the deep voices of the people came up from the different States , in accents that well rewarded the long patient endurance of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clamor of faction and panic-with their verd*ict , on their sober second-though't , of " Well done , thou good and faithful servant ! " There was this peculiarity in that crisis , that the long-protracted struggle between the two parties had at length reached an issue the decision of which must be final and conclusive of their political fate . With the Opposition all was staked upon it ; and if the Administration should weather such a storm , they might well indeed abandon all hope or thought of prevailing over it . If the infatuated people would not be convinced of the truth of the charges so long and loudly thundered against it , by the events of that year-and , d fortiori , if , after at first rashly condemning it , under the influence of the panic , distress , and party clamor , they should retract the error of that first delusion , and comeback to its support in daily swelling majorities- .. - then well indeed might they conclude , that they-would not believe " though one should rise from the dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elections of last fall , upon the Whig party itself . The increased majority in Missouri-the reaction in Maine , from the Whig majority of the preceding year to a large Democratic majority  --  the conversion of Maryland , from its ancient time-honored Federalism , to the election of a Democratic Governor , who had especially identified himself with the " odious Sub-Treasury " question  --  the recovery of the popular vote of New Jersey  --  the decisive triumph in the old Keystone State of Pennsylvania , contrary to the sanguine anticipations of the Whigs-the diminished Whig majority in Massachusetts  --  the manly and magnanimous accession , to the support of the Administration , of the gallant chivalry of South Carolina  --  the unanimity of the ma ? - jority of both parties in Georgia in favor of the great cardinal measure by which the classification of parties was now every where adjusting itself-and , above all , the astonishing revolution of Ohio , by the conversion of the strong Whig majority of a recent period to a stronger majority in favor of the Administration , not only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were , one and all , evidences against which no blindness of partizanship could close the eyes of any save the most infatuate and bigoted of our opponents , of a grand popular movement to the support of the principles and policy of the Administration , arising up out of the very lower depths of the public vnind ,  --  of precisely // The Twenty-Fifth Congress . such a popular movement as it had always , from the very outset , and in the midst of the darkest hour of its trial , so boldly appealed to , so confidently predicted , and so nobly trusted to . In all quarters , as manifested by the despondent tone of their press , and in private intercourse by the confession in countless instances wrung from the chagrin of discomfiture and disappointment , the Whigs as a party seemed to be on the point of giving up the contest-of abandoning the people to the m*ited fate of their own infatuation- .. of retiring in disgust from this ineffectual contest with the " fierce democracie , " upon whose obtuse intellect it proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an Administration which , sprung from them , had the sagacity , if we may not be permitted to call it the honesty , to place its strength and its reliance in its adherence to the first great principles of Democratic truth , and in its bold confidence in the ultimate sagacity of the honest popular judgment . And we sincerely believe that they would have done so-even , probably , to the extreme of not attempting a serious organization for the Presidential contest  --  but for the unexpected intervention of their victory in New York , to rescue them from the immediate agonies of political dissolution , and to postpone yet a little longer the evil day which , nevertheless , was neither to be averted nor mitigated . That defeat ( though by a largely diminished majority from that of the preceding year ) was as unexpected to ourselves , as had been many of the former triumphs which had preceded it It was easy , however , to explain it , on principles entirely peculiar to the particular case , and foreign from those on the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political contest . They have been stated in a former Article , and are familiar to our readers . The result of the New York election did not in the slightest degree affect the prospects of the Administration , nor touch the elevated security of its position . In comparison with the preceding election it was itself a victory ; and it was accompanied with such evidences of the progressing , though yet incomplete , re-organization of the long disordered and confused Democratic party in that State  --  and with such indications of real weakness and of inevitable approaching downfall , on the part of its opponents-that there was no affectation in the expressions of satisfaction which , on a calm review of the whole ground , were used in relation to it by some of the most enlightened friends of the very party which sustained the reverse . But to the Whigs this success-together with the god-send of the blessed discovery of the enormous defalcation of their former especial friend , the late Collector of the port of New York , came like the reprieve to the criminal on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little their exhausted hopes , re-inspirited their drooping courage , and rallied , for yet another effort , their wavering and 353 // yielding array of party organization . Well may they render praise and thanksgiving to the individual to whose unwearied exertions , next to the long accumulated errors and faults of our own party in that State , they were mainly indebted for it ! And if the triumphal processions , and broadly trumpeted ceremonials of reception and greeting , with which his friends may attempt to stimulate , to some faint show of warmth , a popular enthusiasm which never has and never can , under any circumsta.nces , be aroused in behalf of a political apostate-if , we say , such attempts , by a handful of personal friends and party associates , prove cold and meagre and spiritless failures  --  and if one-half of the local Whig press , with their gigantic sheets , regret to find themselves prevented by " the crowded state of their columns " from even spreading out in full the brief record of the high proceedingNot what it was , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make upon it , while we point ambitious politicians to the sad warning of the example , than that the Whigs of New York , in such a treatment of the able and distinguished ex-Senator who has last gone to swell the long array of the leaders they have derived from the secessions from the Democratic ranks , have only again proved their political gratitude to be about on a par with their political honesty of principle . Such , then  --  to return from the episode which has tempted us aside to moralize a moment upon an instructive political lessonsuch , then , was the state of parties on the re-assemblage of Congress , for its third and last session , within the period over which we are casting this rapid bird's-eye glance . In an Article in our December Number on " The Coming Session , " we expressed the curiosity which our readers must have shared with us , as to what the Whigs could have to say , what to do , for themselves at that session , on the main topic of party interest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time has now furnished the ans*vers to our queries which no foresight could have anticipated ; we hasten , therefore , to give our readers such account of them as we may . It certainly appeared a most embarrassing position that that party occupied in Congress , it being impossible to decide which course was the most awkward and impracticable , to advance , to retreat , or to remain stationary . All the old topics rendered unavailable-the distress at an end  --  the panic succeeded by a confidence already threatening to run into unhealthy excess-their cardinal principle , a National Bank , beginning , from a bitter necessity and with the worst grace imaginable , to be disavowed by its own friends -- the melancholy contrast in the state of public opinion , as indicated by the elections , between the present year and the last-what materials now remained to them for those copious floods of partisan invective with which it has been of late years their annual wont , instead // of attending to the proper duties of legislation , to consume the sessions of Congress ? And what could they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the responsibility was incumbent on them , of either adopting some legalized fiscal system , or of leaving the public revenue , unregulated by law , unprotected by the checks and safeguards of which recent events had so strikingly IIlustrated the necessity , at the sole discretion of the Executive . Of all imaginable alternativ* , the last appe*ired the least possible . It would be too palpable a confession of political profligacy , too open an admission of the falsehood of all the charges of corruption and incompetence , so long and vehemently urged against the Ad. ministration ! For the sole motives that could possibly dictate such a course must be , either a secret desire that the public Tr " ' ssury should be in fact badly and dishonestly managed , to afford materials for continued future partisan attack , as they themselves denounced and predicted ,  --  or a secret confidence in the wisdom , integrity , and patriotism of the Executive , in relation to " the purse , " similar to that manifested in another great measure of the session , in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of the two horns of the dilemma . We were justified , therefore , in assuming it to be impossible that the Whigs could undertake the responsibility of adjourning without having adopted some system or other ; which , in the manifest impossibility of reviving the old Deposite Bank System , or of even attempting the proposition of a National Bank , could be no other than at least some modification of " the odious Sub-Treasury Scheme . " We shall never again repeat the folly of believing any absurdity , any inconsistency , any self-contradiction , impossible to a party thus constituted , and actuated by such a spirit as the present Opposition in Congress has so long and so often exhibited . We acknowledge the mistake which none but themselves could have so effectually corrected ; and stand rebuked by their own conduct , for having given them a certain degree of credit which we shall certainly never again be guilty of thus imputing to them . They have again , contrary to our supposition , planted themselves on the old ground of prevention . It was early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friends of the Administration , in the House of Representatives , early gave up in despair all hope of carrying any measure for the establishment of the Independence of the Treasury through the present Congress ; while the Senate justly felt it to be incompatible with its proper dignity to send a third bill of a similar character to that body , to share the fate of its two predecessors . There appears to have been a general disposition , on the part of the friends of the measure , to leave the question now with the country and the next Congress ,  --  secure of the continued and confirmed ascendnncy of the vresent Administration and its // policy , and satisfied that every day was loosening more and more the hold that the banks have held upon the public favor , as agents for the fiscal administration of the government of the country . The Senate contented itself with passing a bill for the more effectual prevention and punishment of public defaulters  --  a bill very elaborate , complete and unexceptionable in its provisions for that object . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a distinct party questi*1 ; and in the House , where , on that ground , its fate could not have been long doubtful had it been acted upon at all , the dominant party allowed the session to expire without an attempt to adopt that or any measure of a similar character and object . How strongly this simple review of facts , on which no commentary could shed a clearer light , illustrates the flagrant dishonesty of all the clamors so long and loudly thundered against the party in power , especially in relation to its administration of the public finances . Is it possible that any considerable portion of that public opinion that has heretofore supported such leaders , can continue insensible to such open demonstration of party profligacy ! The topic of the public defalcations was the only gun that the Opposition have plied against the Administration at the last session-all the others of their former batteries having , as we have seen , either been silenced , or having exploded , one after another , of themselves , doing more injury among their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fires had been directed . This was the one idea of the session . It is true , that at the commencement of the session a strong but intemperate attempt was made to excite a little Abolition agitat*ion , but it was a most lamenttable failure . By one of the most skilful , prompt and energetic parliamentary movements that we have ever witnessed , the Democratic party in the House blighted in the bud every hope that might have been cherished of weakening the daily growing strength of the Administration at the South by the agitation of this question . By the famous " Atherton Resolutions , " not only wa* this long-vexed question , as a political one , placed at last , fully and distinctly , on its true ground of the State-Rights principle , so as to be able to combine the free support of all the Democracy of the North , of which many had before had but an imperfect understanding of it , but moreover a sudden and total extinguisher was put upon the very possibility of making it a means of party agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter at rest . The Whigs themselves evinced their consciousness of it by the desperate efforts which they made to evade or counteract it , when it was too late ; and by the petulant explosions of impotent chagrin by which some of their leaders , the loudest in declamation about Southern rights on this subject , showed that it was only for the low and unholy // purposes of political capital , that they had so long been deafening the wearied ear of the country with their clamor against the agitation of the slavery question on the floors of Congress . There was but one single eminent individual who did not perceive how completely the subject was now placed . at rest-that the tide had turned-that the iron which but a short time ago had been so hissing hot had now become cold ; - th*t eminent individual was Mr. Clay , who , towards the close of the*'ession , in his well known anti-Abolition speech , was seen to stab , and gash , and mutilate most ruthlessly the dead body of Political Abolitionism-reminding us of the country player who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the curtain descending , and the audience gone or going , recollected a most important speech , which he ought to have delivered at the beginning of the first act , and which therefore , as it contained a capital point of tragic effect , he begged the audience now to listen to , by way of epilogue . In fact this has always been Mr. Clay 's unfortunate fate in all his Presidential demonstrations ; and , with Mr. Niles ' permission , we would suggest as the most appropriate epitaph for his tomb on the consummati*n of that political death now less than two years distant-as embodying the whole moral of the life of an ambitious politician with whom expediency was the main governing principle- " ALWAYS A LITTLE TOO LATE ! " The defalcations were , then , the one idea of the Opposition at the late session . They plied it hard , but , after all , with lamentably little effect ! The proceedings in relation to that investigation have done vastly more injury to the cause of those who conducted them , than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance  --  the most unjust and unfair commentaries that were made upon the correspondence of the Treasury Department with the receivers , &amp;c. , which exhibited only one-half of the picture , not containing the letters of explanation from the officers referred to , as well as the vigilant communications of the Department to them , in relation to irregularities before the detection of their actual defalcations , defalcations into which they were tempted by the demoralizing seductions of the credit system , and which were rendered easy by the imperfections of the existing restraints of law , and by the facilities of the bank deposite system  --  the pledges to impeach the Head of the Treasury Department , if a fair committee of investigation should be allowed by the House  --  the most unblushing packing of that Committee by the secret ballot , so as not even to allow th' Democratic party the selection of its own members , on the miflQrity of three to six , by a party with whom it had long been a favorito topic to denounce the appointment of party committees by a Democratic Speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpable manifestation of the lowest spirit of partisanship which characterized all its proceedings  --  the violation of every principle of justice and fair dealing towards Mr. Hoyt , who was compelled to memorialize Congress for redress against the outrageous indecency of his persecution at their hands  --  the miserable contrast between the performance of the campaign and the promise of the manifesto  --  the disproporti*n between the foundations of evidence and the superstructure of " conclusions " derived by the Committee , insignificant as were even the latter in comparison with what their party had been taught to expect  --  the publication of four copies of the " report and conclusions , " of their ingenious and unscrupulous prosecuting lawyers , for every one copy of the evidencethe virtual acquittal of the Secretary of the Treasury , of all the heinous charges that had been so furiously urged against him , and the abashed abandonment of all word or idea of impeach.ment ,  --  all these things the country sees , standing too clearly in the light of day to be misunderstood , and they shall be made to appear yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may we say , with the confession made by some of the more candid and liberal of our opponents in Congress itself , before they left Washington , that the whole affair was a " miserable failure ; " in verification of which it is sufficient for us here to refer to the apathy and silence with which it has been received by the Whig press itself , to which it was intended to afford the stimulating aliment to sustain their cause through the elections of the present year . New Hampshire has nobly led off the ball , and by her Democratic majority doubled , in comparison with that of last year , has expressed her opinion upon the case submitted to her vote by this grand abortion of a party demonstration against the distinguished citizen from the " Granite State " who represents the Democracy of New England in the present Administration . We confidently predict that her example is but the prelude to a brilliant series of triumphs which will well repay it for its long and noble endurance of the ordeal of past adversity . The policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convulsion of the paper money system by the time of the next Presidential election ; and in the mean time to consolidate their union with the Conservatives , which may already be fairly regarded as complete , and to keep up what agitation may be in their power on the subject of the public defalcations . Hence their refusal to pass Mr. Wright 's Bill , which , by precluding almost the possibility of future defalcation , would have marred the success of this patriotic policy . They are also fast settling on Mr. Clay as their candidate , in accordance with the assurance we have more than once given them , that , desperate as is his chance , especially in the South // and West , neither of their other candidates can indulge even the faint h.ope which his sanguine temperament may yet possibly reserve to him . We have spoken of them as a party , yet they appear scarcely entitled to the name , avowing no distinctive principles nor distinctive measures . They are a mere Opposition , which is nothing else than mere . faction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated in one of theii*papers , " turn out the rogues ! " evading and avoiding all the distinct issues on large principles on which the Democratic party found their party organization , and which , uniformly cherished , proclaimed and pledged , constitute the political character of the Administration . Now , we put it to the good sense of the candid of our opponents-can even the slightest chance of success attend efforts so avowedly prompted hy the sole motive of an unholy ambition for power and place , against an Administration already so securely established in the confidence and affections of the great Democratic party of the country , and to the patriotism , moderation , discretion and integrity of whose chief they have themselves found themselves forced , at the close of the late session , to render so signal and unanimous a testimony ?
