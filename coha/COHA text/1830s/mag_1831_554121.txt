txt If Seged , emperor of Ethiopia , had thought fit to consult the poets before he set himself SerioLisly at work to be happy , he might have spared himself seven days ' useless labor . Those of England would have told him in plain terms , that his project came altogether too late in the day ; for Goldsmith , one of the most trustworthy of their number , had seen the rural virtues embark for the purpose of leaving the country , and no intelligence had ever been received of their arrival elsewhere ; while the poets of antiquity would have claimed the merit of promulgating the same doctrine some centuries earlier . He would have ascertained , in short , that the days of simplicity and innocence were all gone by ; and that the traditional recollections of a golden age were not very likely to be realized in any thing present or to comet Nor are the poets the only persons who have been haunted by these melancholy visions . Orators have proclaimed , that the age of chivalry is gone ; philosophers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts of civilization , and return to the independence of the savage state ; and even some political economists have reached the same conclusion hy a different process ; for if the danger of the overstocking of the earth with inhabitants be as imminent as they pretend , it is obvious , that the farther we retreat from their millennium of famine , the better . Now , though most of these opinions are little better than mere heresies , we can all of us detect in ourselves a lurking disposition to believe in them ; and the reason is , that we see them by a sort of candle-light , which makes them appear to greater advantage , than the broad clear light of noon . It is as hard to ascertain the latitude of the good old time on the chart of history , as to fix the precise compass of the memory of the oldest inhabitant ; and this uncertainty produces the same effect , as that of distance upon the landscape . We think of past times with a feeling similar to that , with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great event , or some act of generous self-devotion . Who is there that does not figure to himself with delight , the array of Canterbury // pilgrims issuing from the Court of the Tabard inn ,  - -  Queen Mab and Oberon leading the dances in the moon-light ring ,  --  the proud bearing of the mailed knight , and the peerless charms of the lady of his love ? It seems hard that truth should appear to read the charm backwards , and put to flight these truant fancies . We hardly admit our obligations to the sturdy chronicler , who reminds us , that all this belongs to a time of superstition and feudal bondage , and that there are higher accomplishments in the world , than the art of dealing hard blows . it is like waking from a delightful dream ; and this is a dream more liable to such an interruption than any other . Mr. Irving has made the world in love with the innocent simplicity of old English manners but a conscientious misgiving came over him , when he witnessed the battle which disfigured his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swains were somewhat less Arcadian than he previously thought them . He touched , however , very lightly on the error , for the same reason which prevents him from undeceiving people in regard to a ghost story ,  --  an unwillingness to disturb their comfort . Without adhering to this poetical faith , we are willing to believe , that the simplicity of old-fashioned manners was not without its charm ; and that the sports and festivals of early times carried happiness to many humble hearts , to which what is now called comfort was wholly unknown . The habits generated by artificial modes of life are , in some respects , less propitious to many valuable qualities of heart , than the unpretending quietness of rural life ;  --  the refinements of society , undoubtedly , repress the display of much honest warmth and sincerity of feeling ; and if we look only at the disadvantages of our present condition , and select all that is attractive in the other , the world must appear to he losers hy the exchange ; but reason , to say nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of comparison . The elaborate work of Mr. Strutt was designed to give an account of the sports and pastimes of the people of England from the earliest period to the present time ; and we trust it is unnecessary to say more in proof of its importance and value , than that it is the same which was constantly kept by Mr. Slingsby in his school-house near Bracebridge hall , in order to teach the boys to amuse themselves after the fashion of former times . Mr. Hone 's contributions , which consist only of an index , do not add much to its substantial value ; but he proposes // to increase the stock of information upon the same subjects in a future publication ; though we should have thought that his Every-day Book and Table Book must have drained its sources completely dry . We do not propose to enter largely into an investigation of the sports of children , on which this work is so full and satisfactory , as to entitle its author to the lasting veneration of every school-boy . He has completely redeemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a remote , if not a classical origin , with as much zeal , though far less bigotry , than Dr. Scriblerus before him . It may be , that boys are too thoughtless to regard this as an enhancement of their merit ; but it seriously affects their estimation in the eyes of men . An unrefiecting person might be disposed to think lightly of the accomplishment of riding upon a stick ; but his views are changed , when he learns that it was a favorite pastime of the boys in the time of Augustus ; and who does not at once perceive its philosophic dignity , when he learns that it was occasionally practised by Socrates and Agesilaus ? Ball-playing has always stood rather higher in the public estimation ; but it becomes venerable , when we see the father of history ascribing its invention to the Lydians , and Homer representing it - as the amusement of the Princess of Corcyra and her maidens . But there is one circumstance connected with these sports , which is worthy of attentive observation . It is the fidelity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , with scarcely any change in their progress ; there is nothing like it in the affairs of men . Learned persons have differed on the question , whether the Clrytrinda of the Greeks was the same game with our Hot-cockles , or Frog-in-the-middle ; Arbuthnot assures us , that it is idle to maintain that it corresponded to the former , and Mr. Strutt is ready to die in the belief , that it answered perfectly to the latter ; our poor opinion is , that there is no very momentous difference between the three . Virgil borrowed a well-known simile from the top , and trundling the hoop is generally believed to have been a favorite amusement among the Greeks and Romans ; but here another controversy has arisen ; as it is confidently asserted , though without much apparent reason , by some critics , that the hoop and top of the ancients were one and the same thing . It was some scruple upon this point , which induced Dr. Scrib-. lerus to prohibit his son Martinus from playing with either . // Blind-man 's buff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks with a very slight variation from its present form ; they were also extremely skilful in the accomplishment of hopping or sliding upon one leg . These are points upon which there is no dispute ; and there is as little with respect to the Greek extraction of cross and pile , or what is known among us by the name of turning coppers , or the Roman origin of the game of odd and even . Augustus played in his youth with nuts in the same way as our boys with marbles . Aristophanes mentions the art of spinning chaffers ; the Greek boys tied the string round the legs of the insect , while modern humanity attaches it by a crooked pin to the body . There are many sports , too , formerly in high repute , which would have perished from the earth , had they not been preserved by the young . The hall was originally used by the old and grave ; afterwards , it became common to persons of all ages . Amopg the expenditures of Henry VII. , there is an item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought worthy of commemoration , that St. Cuthbert acquired singular expertness at ball-playing in his boyhood . It is not known that the foot-ball was used by the ancients , though they sometimes played with a hand-ball , prepared in the same manner ; but it was early adopted in England , where peas were sometimes inserted into it , to make the entertainment more musical . James I. , who had an instinctive aversion to danger of all kinds , censured this amusement in strong terms , as involving peril of life and limb ; but it was pursued on a large scale longer than most others , and the last we hear of it is in the song written by Sir Walter Scott in 1815 , for the grand foot-ball match between the men of Ettrick and Yarrow . The quoit , though , if we may believe Dr. Johnson , it is not the discus of Homer 's heroes , is jilainly derived from it . Wrestling was once an art of no small importance . But civilization has crushed these sports and many others , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them under the appellation of gymnastics , have been attended with very transient success ; the pious reverence of the young is all that rescues them from oblivion . We must , however , leave this attractive subject , in order to attend to the main business of our article ; in which we propose to give some account of various observances , of which traces yet exist among us , as well as our materials will allow . Many of them have undergone such changes in // the course of centuries , as the inventive genius of man is apt to produce in every work of his hands . The writers upon them are not very numerous , and , in endeavoring to trace their origin , have sometimes been reduced to as much perplexity as the tailors in fitting the posture-master , when they confessed with tears in their eyes , that the task was beyond the competency of mortal shears . Most of these sports and festivals , as well as observances of every kind , may be traced far back into antiquity , when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be expected , nothing could exceed the fervency of the public devotion . Almost every day in the year was a holiday of one kind or another . The free citizens of Greece and Rome appear to have led a very idle , gentlemanly sort of life ; leaving all the hard work to be done by slaves , the mass of whom was so great in the Eternal City , that the Senate did not dare to number them , while they swarmed in Attica as they now do in the island of Grenada . A similar system prevailed under the feudal despotism of modern Europe ; the wants of life were few , and easily supplied ; the year was spent in pastime , because men had not discovered that there was any thing better for a community to do ; until civilization corrected the error , and bound labor and comfort together . It is easy to conceive the influence which early associations must have given to these observances over the popular mind ; it was so great , that it was found impossible to cast them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Christians , hopeless of effecting this , labored to divest them of their impurities , and consecrated them with a solemn lustration to the *vorship of the true God . There are many festivals in the old Romish calendar , which the progress of industry has done away , and many others , which have been deprived , by the same cause , of all traces of their former splendor , even in the countries where they were once most carefully observed ; and it is a curious instance of the tenacity with which men cling to their ancient customs , that any vestiges of them at all are to be discovered here . They must be wholly traditional , as there is every reason to believe , that due diligence was early used to extirpate them . The situation of our fathers was not particularly favorable to merriment ; and had it been otherwise , they would still have objected to these festivals , partly on account of their origin , and partly from their memory of some former // 196 July , controversies . These controversies , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their emigration , respected the toleration of sports upon the Sabbath . They denounced , also , many other usages of a graver character , as heathenish and superstitious ; though their success , as we shall have occasion to see , did not always correspond with their zeal and sincerity . We do not know , that the vigil of the new year is at this time celebrated in England in any other way , than by ringing out the old year and ringing in the new ; a practice of which some writers speak with satisfaction , as tending to revive many of their most delightful associations ; but to those who have no such associations with it , we fear that music so unseasonable would excite other feelings than those of rapture . Formerly it was the custom for young girls to carry on that evening from door to door the wassail bowl of spiced ale , receiving presents in return for the courtesy ; nor is it yet wholly laid aside . The term wassail , or wacs-had , was the phrase used by the Saxons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony may be regarded as a formal method of expressing good wishes for the coming year . Neighbors were also in the habit of assembling in merry meetings , at which the recollection of all animosities was drowned in liberal draughts of the wassail and saving the excess , the custom might probably be revived with advantage now . Here , the traces of all these observances , if they were ever known among us , appear to be wholly lost ; while the faces of the gravest commonly brighten at the coming in of New Year 's day ,  --  the season of gifts and mutual congratulation ,  --  when the most frugal are lavish of good wishes for the opening year ; and it may be satisfactory to know , that all the ceremonies which we consider appropriate to the occasion , have been handed down to us from very remote antiquity ; being coeval , as some say , with Romulus , and at all events , derived from ancient Rome . Prynne , in his Histrio-masrix , denounces the whole as a meere relique of Paganisme and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twofaced Janus ; ' the Roman knights availed themselves of the occasion to make presents to Augustus ; and an order of Tiberius is mentioned by Tacitus , prohibiting the giving or receiving of them at any other season . The ordinary congratulations were also liberally given , and the donation was of more value than it has been since ; being universally regarded as an omen of good fortune . There was , however , one practice among // the Romans , which has fallen into disuse as a part of the observance ; that of artisans working a little on New Year 's day , either as a pledge of industry in their callings , or to show their respect for the day , as a French traveller declares himself to have exhibited his regard for the customs of this country , by entering a church on the Sabbath and remaining there five minutes . January was also the season of the Saturnalia , which were celebrated with every possible demonstration of riot and extravagance . Among the rites observed in honor of the Father of the gods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beasts , by way of masquerade ; this was retained by the early Christians , who used on New Year 's day to run about masked , to the infinite terror of women and children , until their merriment was suddenly checked by a fearful anathema of Pope Zecharias . In fact , the early fathers labored diligently to exterminate all observance of the season , either from abhorrence of its occasional excess , or because they had a natural dislike of the source from which it was derived . They denounced the practice of wishing others a happy new year , and of making presents as pledges of good fortune , with as much zeal as the Covenanters objected to that of manufacturing wind by the winnowing machine , instead of waiting for the usual dispensation ; but the popular prejudice was in this instance stronger than the terr6r of the Church ; and it is curious to remark how universal the celebration has become , and how slight has been the variation in the mode *of observing it . The early Saxons , who appear to have been less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the habit of reckoning their age by the number of New Years ' feasts which they had witnessed ; the Druids , on the same occasion , scraped the mistletoe from the oak with great solemnity , and distributed it as a charm among the people ; and the Jews , some centuries ago , were in the habit of making splendid entertainments at the beginning of their year , at which each , as he partook , expressed the wish that the year might be propitious to every guest . It has also found its way into countries , where it is less easy to explain its origin ; the people of China and Japan are said to observe it with as much pomp , and nearly in the same manner , as those of European countries ; while the Persians celebrate the vernal equinox by a New Year 's festival , and make mutual presents of colored eggs with great solemnity . The practice of making presents and // of mutual congratulation on New Year 's day , has been at all times duly regarded in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode . Matthew Paris records with indignation , that Henry III . was in the habit of impudently extorting rich presents on that day from the citizens of London . The worthy historian seems to forget , that these reluctant donors must have esteemed themselves remarkably fortunate , if they received no similar compliments on the other days of the year . In the time of Henry VIII . the custom was materially altered for the better . When his nobles sent him valuable presents , we learn that it was his humor to send something in requital of the obligation ; though it does not appear that he made any acknowledgment of a New Year 's present of Bishop Latimer , which consisted of a Bible with the leaf folded down at Hebrews xiii . 4. a passage in which pretty broad allusion is made to the king 's private immorality . His son Edward VI . gave one year in this way , ? 155 ; a tolerable sum , considering the diminution since his time in the value of money . Queen Elizabeth 's wardrobe was regularly supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat more magnificence than the old song allows to that of King Stephen ; every one gave something ; twenty pounds were the allotted tribute of the highest temporal lord , and forty that of the highest of the lords spiritual ; even officers of her household were not exempt from the obligation ; we read , that her apothecary , among other things , gave her a pot of ginger candy , a more palatable donation than persons of that calling are in the habit of making ; her butcher , a meat-knife with a dainty device ; while Srnyth , the dustman , not to be behind the rest , presented her majesty with two bolts of cambric . She conformed to the example of her father , so far as to make some return ; but it is understood , that she was careful to keep the balance on her own side . After the reign of James I. we hear no more of this custom . We ought not to forget to mention , that towards the close of the fifteenth century , pins , which began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skewers , were an approved New Year 's present , as were also rings , gilt nutmegs , and oranges stuck with cloves . Gloves were sometimes used for the same purpose ; a pair containing forty angels , were sent by a lady to the Chancellor Sir Thomas More , as an acknowledgment for a decree in her favor ; he intimated his willingness to keep the present , sending back the // lining . These gifts , and indeed the whole observance of the day , were objected to by the Puritans , as heathenish and superstitious in themselves , besides being extremely disreputa .. ble in their origin . We have already quoted the testimony of Prynne upon this subject , which is only an expression of the sentiments of the rest ; but their censures were as ineffect-. ual as were those of the early fathers . The rites of the occasion were still observed , though probably with more moderation than before , as we do not perceive that they are now at all objeclionable on the score of morality . Annuals have nearly supplanted other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confectioner are largely put in requisition for the purpose of providing them ; but the best part of the good old custom remains unchanged ,  --  the expression of kind wishes for the happiness of those around us in the passing year . It is painful to witness the distress of antiquaries , in attempting to explain the origin of the custom of sending persons on sleeveless or fool 's errands on the first of April , which is generally known by the name of All Fools Day . These learned persons appear to have at length given up the task in utter despair ; not , however , until they had practised the ceremonies of the day with signal success upon their readers . One of them trace* the custom to the games instituted by Romulus in order to inveigle the Sabine women , which he supposes to have been established at this season of the year ; another derives it from the burlesque election of Church dignitaries , and the strange pageant of which Scott has given a vivid descrip. tion in the Abbot ; while a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attributes it to the mistake of Noah , in sending the dove from the ark before the waters had subsided , on the first day of the Hebrew month , which corresponds to April . These explanations can hardly be deemed very satisfactory ; but they serve to show the difficulty of hading a rational one , as they would not be likely to be proposed , except in the absence of better . Mr. Brand found in an old Romish calendar a feast of old fools , which was there expressly stated to have been removed from some other day of the year to the first of November ; he supposes the word all ' to he a mere alteration of the northern word auld ; ' and whatever the young may think of it , there is no reason to believe that aged persons of this description would be so tenacious of their festival , as not to acquiesce in such a change without // repining ; but the calendar gives no reason to believe , that the first of November was substituted for the first of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still liable to some objections . Anothee account is given by Maurice in his Indian Antiquities , which like the rest , is founded wholly on conjecture . lie believes that the first of April , being , according to the old style , very near the beginning of the year , was formerly considered as the season of rural sports and the pleasures of Spring ; and that the custom in question is merely a relic of the sports which were common on that occasion . He traces the Huh festival among the Hindoos , which is observe4 by all classes in precisely the same manner as All Fools Day , to an ancient practice of celebrating the recurrence of the vernal equinox . Without troubling our readers with any more attempts to explain the origin of a custom , whose pretensions to dignity are derived solely from its antiquity , we may remark , that there are few for which men appear to have entertained a more tender regard ; it seems to have been every where observed in one form or another . Fools are made in Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long established practice of hunting the gowk ' ; and there is a similar one in Lisbon on the Sunday and Monday preceding Lent . The name Poisson d ' . flvril , ' or April Fish , which was applied to Napoleon on his marriage to Maria Louisa , because it took place on the first of that month , is used by the French in the same manner as our April Fool ' ; but its etymology is entirely unknown . We find many allusions to the custom in the English poets of the last century ; it is also mentioned in the Spectator ; but it is not in the power of genius to render it either dignified or poetical . The early English writers have not , so far as we know , noticed it at all . Among us , it can hardly be said to be retained , except as an amusement of the young . We are naturally not unwilling to turn from this festival , if festival it can be called , to one whose return was hailed with universal welcome on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundary , which separated the reign of winter from the season of fruits and flowers ; and the heart appears every where to have expanded under its sweet influences . The returning splendor of summer was celebrated by the northern nations with rustic feasts and dances ; among the Goths and southern Swedes it was honored by a mock battle between the // seasons , in which the forces of winter were sure to be put to flight ; and the moon of May was poetically styled by the Indians of this continent the moon of flowers . Our English ancestors observed the first of May as the period of a great rural festival , which nature herself assisted to celebrate , by dis-. playing on this occasion the earliest verdure of the purple year ; but it should be remembered , that it did not formerly occur at precisely ihe same time that it does now ; the alteration of the style in the middle of the last century has unluckily carried it nearer by a fortnight to the dominions of winter . Lovibond 's Tears of Old May-day ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the change . It has been stated , we know not on what authority , *that the ancient Britons were wont to hold anniversary meetings on the first of May , at which they canvassed the conduct of their kings and rulers , and continued them in office or deposed them according to their demeanor during the preceding year ; and that the day continued to be observed by their descendants as a festival , long after the doctrine of divine right had destroyed all memory of the good old republican custom ; but there is every reason to believe , that the origin of the rites of May-day was earlier and more classical than this . They are more probably derived from the Floralia , games instituted by the Romans in honor of Flora , the presiding deity of fruits and flowers ; though we grieve to say , that these orgies more closely resembled those of St. Bartholomew 's fair , than the simple expression of gratitude and happiness , which the season was naturally fitted to inspire . When they descendei to the early Christians , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heathen custom being retained , but the gathering of flowers and branches , which were brought home to decorate the doors and windows of their houses . For centuries afterwards , they appear to have undergone little change . There is scarcely an English poet , who does not dwell with pleasure upon these simple customs ; many have given us descriptions of the Mayday festival ; but that of worthy old Stow is by far the most poetical of all . On May-day in the morning , ' says he , every man , except impediment , would walke into the sweete meadows and greene woods , there to rejoice their spirits with the beauty and savour of sweete flowers , and with the harmony of birds praysing God in their kind . ' In Chaucer 's Court of Love , the court are represented as going forth early on May // morning , to fetch the flouris fresh , and branch , and blome . ' Spenser gives the following animated description of the same ceremony : Then to the greene-wood they speeden them all , To fetchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a royall throne , Crowned as king ; and his queen attone Was Lady Flora , on whom did attend A faire flock of facries , and a fresh bend Of lovely nymphs . Oh that I were there To helpen the ladies their May-bush beare ! ' It was an ancient practice for large companies of persons of all ages to rise a little after midnight on May-day , and march forth with music to the wood , where they gathered branches of trees and flowers , which they brought home in triumph , and placed in the doors and windows of their houses . Henry VIII . and his queen were wont to go forth early with bows and arrows to the forest , to hring home the May ; and the same custom was observed by the court , so lately as the reign of James I. We do not wonder , that Shakspeare in his Midsummer-Night 's Dream , has spoken of the difficulty of sleeping on May-morning ; it must have been pretty serious at Oxford , when the hoys were accustomed to blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general was more appropriate to the occasion ; though it appears to have been boisterous enough to remind us of the penalty which we pay for freedom on the morning of the fourth of July . The May-pole , or . fWYIiai , as it is called in France , was sometimes permitted to stand through the year , like that which Mr. Irving saw with so much pleasure on the banks of the Dee . Most commonly , it was erected for the occasion ; being brought home early from the wood , gorgeously painted and covered with garlands , and accompanied by the multitude marching in solemn procession to the sound of music . Its top was decorated with banners and streamers ; arbors and bowers were prepared in the vicinity of the place where it was erected , and the rest of the day was spent in dancing round it , and in every other species of rustic revelry . The sport was not confined to the country ; the citizens of London were accustomed to erect their May-poles in various parts of the city , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leape and daunce round about them , as the heathen people did at the dedication of their // idols , whereof this is the perfect patterne , or rather the thyng itself . ' The Puritans denounced this celebration , not merely because they considered it a relic of idolatry , but because it was tolerated on the Sabbath day ; nor does it appear that their hostility to it was without effect ; for in the time of Edward VI . the people were so wrought upon by a sermon of one of them , that they seized a huge old May-pole , which had been quietly lying for years in one of the streets of London , and made a bonfire of it . Somewhat later , another of their writers was induced to write a book upon the subject , because he saw that even in Cheapside itself the rude rabble had set up this ensign of prophaneness , and had put the LordMayor to the trouble of seeing it pulled down . ' For many years afterwards , the luckless May-pole alternately sunk and rose like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his successor , probably in defiance of the Puritans , ordained that the people should be at liberty to set them up and dance round them on the Sabbath , as well as to pursue all other recreations , not expressly prohibited by law ; but the Long Parliament levelled a serious blow at alle and singular May-poles , ' by inflicting a penalty upon civil officers , proportioned to the length of time they should suffer them to stand . Not long after this , royal Government and the May-poles were restored together ; and the prodigious May-pole which Pope mentions as having once o'erlooked the Strand , ' was raised with great ceremony under the royal auspices . It is recorded that it highly pleased his majesty , and the illustrious Prince Duke of York ; little children did much rejoice , and antient people did clap their hands , saying , golden days began to appear . ' We are told that Dr. Parr was accustomed to dance round the May-pole , which was erected opposite his residence at Hatton . One would think that the admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed in much the same manner with that just mentioned . We can not omit to mention the Morris dancers , those ancient favorites of merry England , who were the ch*rm of many festivals , but were animated to the highest efforts of their art on this . History has not been just to the memory of these popular idols ; she has left us in the dark , not only in regard to their number , but as respects the origin of their art itself . They appear to have performed a Moorish dance , introduced early into England , with alterations to adapt it to the prevailing taste , // which still survives in Spain under the appellation of fandango . It had been usual from an early period to elect a King and Queen , or Lord and Lady of the May ; arid popular tradition was subsequently resorted to , to increase the splendor of the May-day festival , and Robin Hood and his merry companions re-appeared in the Morris dance . The bold outlaw himself was honored with the title of King of the May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known by her assumed name of Maid Marian , was the acknowledged Queen ; while the other characters of the dance were Friar Tuck , in whom our readers may recognise the Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst , the Fool , whose public functions have of late fallen into disrepute , Tom the piper , a general representative of the followers of the Joyous Science , the Hobby-horse , who edified the people by his ambles under the disguise denoted by his name , and Stokesley , Scarlet , and Little John , the inseparable companions of Robin Hood . The Dragon was sometimes , though more rarely , of the company ; in fact , all these characters were not uniformly included in the dance ; but Maid Marian , with her crown of gold , purple coif , red surcoat , blue cuffs , yellow skirts , carnation sleeves , red stomacher , and yellow lace in cross bars , was always conspicuous in the ceremony , and usually saluted as Queen of the May ; a distinction fairly earned by the exhibition of so much splendor . Mr. Douce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inclines to the opinion , that the royal office , upon this occasion , was elective ; and that Robin Hood and his companions were not essentially of the number of the Morris dancers . His opinion derives some confirmation from a remark of the wife of Robert Bruce in her adversity , that they should thenceforth be of no more account than the Kings and Queens who led the dances round the village May-pole ; for she would hardly have thought of levelling her fortunes to the standard of those of Maid Marian , and it will be perceived , from the account we have already given , that the remark would have lost much of its pathos in such an application . But such a fall would have hardly been greater than that which afterwards befel Maid Marian herself ; in the time of Queen Elizabeth she was so degraded from her high estate , that her part was personated by rude clowns , and her name converted into an epithet of ridicule and reproach . Before this time , the pageant was so alluring , that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of them which yet // remain , give an example of this , which hardly justifies the notion , that the trappings of royalty would defray the whole expenditure of a republic ; as in the reign of Henry VII. , eightpence were appropriated for a gown for the lady , and a shilling for her privy purse ; while some years afterwards , the spunging and brushing of Robin-Hode 's cotys ' came to no more than two-pence . When the Puritans made war upon this pageant , it had probably degenerated into a boisterous farce . With some labor , though gradually , they accomplished their purpose ; for though King James 's Book of Sports recognised Maid Marian and the Hobby-horse , without regard to the claims of Robin and Friar Tuck , the Long Parliament did not hesitate to demolish the whole . The ancient importance of Robin Hood is shown by a sermon of Bishop Latimer , in which he observes , that he once sent word into a town over night , that he would preach there the next morning ; but upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing a large audience collected , he found the church-door locked . I tarryed there , ' says he , halfe an houre and more ; at last the key was found , and one of the parish comes to me , and sayes ; " Syr , this is a busy day with us , we can not heare you ; this is Robin Hoode 's day ; the parish is gone abroad to gather for Robin Hoode . I pray you let them not . " I was fayne therefore to give place to Robin Hoode . I thought my rochet should have been regarded , though I were not ; but it would not serve , but was fayne to give place to Robin Hoode 's men . ' The only recent account of Morris dancers in England , is contained in a note to Reed 's edition of Shakspeare , which states , that they are yet occasionally seen on May-day , and that the Hobby-Horse still figures by the side of the Lord and Lady , the modern representatives of Robin Hood and Maid Marian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , has rendered the beginning of May less propitious to the observance of the customary rites than before ; but with us , the power of tradition may be seen in the interest with which many look forward to the return of that season , though there is little left to remind us of the ancient ceremonies of the day . In fact , the few flowers which are then to be gathered are not always a sufficient indemnity for the united perils of east-wind and cold ; yet when we remember that bathing the face in Maydew is an infallible specific to give and preserve beauty , it is rather singular , that *I few are fiund , who are willing to encounter // them . The ladies of a century ago did not hesitate for trifles . We find the following entry in Secretary Pepys 's diary : My wife away down with Jane and W. Hewer to Woolwich , in order to a little ayre , and to lie there to-night , and so to gather May-dew to-morrow morning , which Mrs. Turner has told her is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ; and I am contented with it . ' Few vestiges of the old mode of celebration remain in Europe . Miss Edgewortli gives us reason to believe , that the children in the English villages are yet in the habit of electing a Queen of the May ; and in the Isle of Man , a remnant of the old custom is preserved in a mock battle between the troops of two persons , dressed so as to represent summer and winter ; but in general , the whole observance has fallen sadly into decay . The chimney-sweepers of London , however , as if in scorn , still choose a King and Queen of the May , and dance to the music of a solitary fiddle . Before the revolutionary war , it was customary to celebrate the fifth of November , or the anniversary of what was called the Gunpowder Plot . ' The custom was borrowed from England , where Guy Fawkes , who seems to have received rather more than his share of popular honor , was the hero of the occasion ; his effigy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bundle of matches in the other , being borne round in solemn procession during the day , to the music of an appropriate song , and burnt with great pomp in the evening . The practice is not yet wholly forgotten by the boys of London ; though the police of that city regularly threaten both the usage , and the lawless youth who pursue it , with a fate not unlike that which Guy himself intended for the Parliament . When it came to this country , it seems to have received a material improvement by the addition of certain ceremonies , which in England were appropriated to the seventeenth of November , the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth 's accession ; when the effigies of the Devil and the Pope were regularly carried about and burnt in the same manner as Guy Fawkes , until , in the time of Queen Anne , that of the Pretender was added to the group . Here they were united on the fifth of November ; and it was not unusual for various parties to have their separate Popes , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the Guys in the mother country . There was nothing very romantic in the celebration , and the hereditary prejudice against the Catholic faith alone // would have induced the community to tolerate it so long ; for it seems to have been tolerated , though it was at best nothing more than a rude amusement of young men and boys . The whole was laid aside prior to our Revolution , when this prejudice had in a great degree subsided , and the memory of the Pretender began to be looked upon with a more favorable eye . So much has been written of late concerning the mode of observing Christmas , that we shall only allude to that part of it which is retained here , the decoration of churches and houses with evergreens . Like the rest of our customs , this , though there is nothing very heathenish in it , is borrowed from the heathens , who adorned their temples and houses in the same manner at the winter solstice . The Druids had a curious reason for the same usage ; they considered these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the return of a milder season should permit them to resort to their usual habitations . Some of the early councils made it the subject of a prohibitory edict , but without much effect ; as it prevailed universally in England very early , and was never omitted among the Christmas ceremonies . Every plant which remained green through the winter was considered appropriate to the occasion , except the mistletoe , which - was regarded with aversion , from the use whh*h had been formerly made of it in the Druidical festivals ; laurel , ivy , holly , and occasionally cypress and yew , were the most approved . These observances are the only old ones , which appear to be very generally remembered in this country ; but , in the absence of others , we have two of our own institution , which it were superfluous to describe ;  --  the day appointed for Thanksgiving in autumn , by no means wanting in pleasing associations for the people of New England , and the Fourth of July , which has worthily taken the place of St. Ulric 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , our festivals are occasional , and somewhat rare ; but if they have no claims on the score of antiquity , the manner in which they are celebrated , setting aside the public dinner , which , in its present form , may be looked upon as one of the great achievements of modern invention , is in tolerable conformity with ancient usage , so far , at least , as it affects the eye and ear . The merit of introducing hell-ringing , bonfires , and illuminations , rightfully belongs to our ancestors ; the art of public rejoicing has improved little during the last century in point of brilliancy or vociferation. // We look upon the bell as one of the earliest , as well as most popular of our musical instruments . The Romans are understood to have used small ones in their baths and places of business but the honor of inventing the large church-bell is generally ascribed to no less a personage than the Bishop of Nola , who may be emphatically said to have flourished in the fifth century . The praise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bells , when first set up , were solemnly consecrated by the clergy , with a ceremony which was generally called baptism ; hut which they explained to be nothing more than a benediction accompanied with the conferring of a name , by which they were always distinguished afterwards . This ceremony implied that they were supposed to possess some important virtues ; and it is certain , that many properties were ascribed to them of a very remarkable nature . All evil spirits were understood to entertain an insurmountable aversion to their music ; we learn from Wynkyn de Worde , that it threw the fiends into such perplexity , that a single flourish would cause them to decamp with amazing expedition . They were regularly rung during the continuance of high winds and thunder-storms , which were believed to be produced by malignant demons ; and as- they continued to ring so long as these phenomena lasted , it is not surprising that they should have received the credit of putting an end to them . This practice was not forgotten so late as the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of clearing the air during the prevalence of epidemic disorders . It is not improbable , that their virtue was believed to be proportioned to their size ; as we hear of an old hell at Canterbury , which took twenty-four men to ring it , and another which required thirty-two ; both of these seem to have been modelled after the seven bells of Pekin , which Father Lecomte assures us , weighed upwards of fifty tons each . But the most remarkable of all their properdes was that of locomotion ; - it was thought necessary , whenever a bell was removed , to secure it with a rope or chain , and to ring it regularly every evening , in order to prevent it from returning to its old place of residence . In England , the passion for bells prevailed very early ; St. Dunstan presented several to Malmesbury Abbey ; the Abbot of Croyland , in the time of King Edgar , made six bells , which were named after distinguished personages , and such a concert , adds the historian , was never before heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents King David striking with two hammers on several little bells , instead of his harp . Heutzner describes the English at the close of the sixteenth century , as vastly fond of great noises that fill the eare , suci as the firing of cannon , beating of drums , and the ringing of bells ; so that it is common for a number of them that have got a glasse in their heads to get up into some belfry and ringe the bells for hours together for the sake of exercise. * He does not appear to be aware , that the art of ringing was an inportant accomplishment ; it was not uncommon for eminent persons to pique themselves upon their skill . Ringing a single hell was the work of a novice , who gradually advanced in proficiency to a peal of grandsires upon five ; the perfection of the art consisting in accomplishing a bob-maxirnus upon twelve . The practice of ringing upon occasions of public rejoicing is derived from an early usage of the Catholics , who thus gave notice of the arrival of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high offence in a priest , if he suffered the bells to be silent whenever such an event occurred . A similar compliment was paid to distinguished persons on passing through English villages . The people , as if distrusting their own ability to make sufficiently audible demonstrations of satisfaction , have been for centuries in the habit of calling the church-bells to their assistance . Bonfires are a much more ancient mode of rejoicing ; there is much less doubt in regard to their antiquity , than as respects the origin of the name . Fire , as is well known , was liberally used in the worship of several of the pagan deities , particularly Baal ; and similar rites in honor of the sun and fire , are said to have been observed in some parts of Ireland half a century ago . Apollo was also worshipped by an attempt to imitate his own light . All the Gothic tribes were accustomed to kindle large fires on the tops of hills at the summer solstice , in honor of the same luminary , and to pursue all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a part of the great festivals of the Druids . The Christians adopted it , and used it on various occasions , but principally on Midsummer-eve , the same season to which it had been appropriated before ; when the various ceremonies of the vigil of St. John were practised by the light of what they were the first to call bonfires . This was the most brilliant of all the old English festivals ; the fires were kindled // early in the evening in every village , and in the streets of the cities ; young girls stole forth at midnight to gather the St. Jolin's-wort , in order to penetrate one , at least , of the important secrets of futurity , while the hold adventured to gather the magical fern-seed , in defiance of evil spirits , who guarded it from violation ; the midsummer watch was set with all possible splendor ; and the houses were decorated with the salutary fennel , 0rpm , and birch . It may serve to reconcile our youth to the modern uses of this last valuable plant , to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers . The fires used on this occasion had an apology which ours have not ; being used partly for the purpose of purifying the atmosphere from the infection produced by the inyriads of evil spirits , who were accustomed to convert the evening into a festival of their own ; mid hence the name of bon , or good fire , according to some ; while others are disposed to change the orthography , and adopt the explanation given by an old homily , which declares , that in worship of Saint Johan the people waked at home and made three manner of fyres , one was clene bones and noo woode , and that is called a bone fyre . ' These were , undoubtedly , the prototypes of our modern bonfires ; and we may , probably , trace the . practice of illumination to the setting of the watch on Midsummer-eve , to which allusion has just been made . The marching watch , or those who paraded the streets , were furnished with cressets , or huge lanterns fixed to the end of poles and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously wrought branches of iron , were placed before the doors of the wealthy citizens upon this and some other festivals . The illumination of windows was naturally delayed until glass windows became common , a period long subsequent to the Reformation ; but it seems to have been no where ca*'ried to so high a degree of perfection as in Italy . Fireworks are scarcely heard of before the reign of Henry VIII. ; when some rude ones were exhibited on the Thames at the coronation of Anne Boleyn. rrhose of Kenilworth have been duly commemorated by the animated pen of Master Laneham ; and when Queen Elizabeth visited the Earl of Ilertford at Elvetham , she was gratified by similar exhibitions . In the time of James I. the fireworks , though highly applauded by the writers of the time , consisted only of wheels , fire-trees and rockets , or squibs and crackers attached // to a pole , with which men combatted pasteboard dragons vomitting of fire like verie furies ; ' in all respects inferior to the fire-works of the present day . Our funeral customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state and ceremony on the ' one hand , and ridiculous affectation on the other . They are in general such as our fathers left them ; who thought it unbecoming and vain to attempt to add to the force and impressiveness of things spiritual , by appealing through the senses to the heart . These sentiments sprung not unnaturally from their situation r*nd character . They felt the presence of the Divinity in the humblest place where pardon could be asked for sin ; and nothing of human state , or ornament , or decoration , could have added to the dignity and power of such a conviction . So when the spirit had deserted the remains of perishing nature , they regarded it as a mockery to lavish honors upon the body as it was committed io the dust . There are many who maintain , that these are not the sentiments which nature teaches ; that the fires of all intense feeling , like those of the altar , must be first kindled by human hands . We do not pretend to say , which of these opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we simply state the reason , why some of the funeral ceremonies , which are elsewhere looked upon as the most affecting , are known hardly by tradition to us . Nor are the few which we retain , original ; like most others , they are borrowed from the mother country . We do not know , that the tolling of the passing , or soul bell , as it was sometimes called , at the hour of death , is at this time practised in any of our towns ; though several years ago , it was retained in some which adhered to the usages of the English church . It survived in England , long after the superstitious ideas formerly connected with it had been entirely forgotten ; and appears to have been coeval with the earliest introduction of the church-bell . It is related by Bede , that when the Abbess of St. Hilda was at the last extremity , a sister of a very distant monastery heard at midnight the well-known bell , which summoned the religious to pray for the dying . This was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was also designed to ivarn the priest to perform the last offices enjoined by the Catholic ritual ; and it is mentioned by a very old writer upon the subject of religious ceremonies , as the trumpet of the church militant , intended , // according to a superstition which we have already mentioned , to drive away the evil spirits which were waiting at the bedside of the dying , as well as to invoke the prayers of all good Christians for the parting soul . In the English Church , it was preserved as an ancient custom , founded on no good reason and strongly objected to by many of its members , on account of the alarm excited by its peal at midnight . Tolling when the body was borne to the grave is quite as ancient , and has undergone little variation , except that its duration was formerly proportioned to the age and sex of the deceased . It was the custom of the heathens , as it has since been of all Christians , to accompany the corpse to the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes been done to the music of a simple hymn , the effect of which is described by some writers as extremely solemn and affecting ; a more common usage was to carry evergreens in the hands , which were deposited in the grave . Allusion is made in an old tragedy to the custom of crowning the sepulchre with olive , myrrh , and bayes , The plants of Peace , of Sorrow , Victorie . ' These were intended as emblems of the soul 's immortality ; the bay , in particular , was considered one of the most striking , because it would revive , when seemingly dead , from the root , and resume its wonted verdure . The funeral sermon , or oration , was known in ancient times ; it was less common in Rome than in Greece , where it was frequently delivered in memory of the eminent , or those who had fallen in battle . Some fine specimens are still extant , in discourses of the fathers of the Christian church in remembrance of the martyrs . The position of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the usages of the Catholic and English churches . Any individual travelling through New England will perceive , that it is commonly laid with the head towards the West . Durand , a very old writer upon the ceremonies of the Catholic Church , in treating of the burial of the dead , observes , that they were laid with the feet toward the East , and the head toward the West ; in which posture they were in readiness to hasten from the setting to the rising sun ; from time to eternity . A different direction , that of North and South , was regarded as dishonorable , and a mark of guilt or disgrace . In Martin 's Month 's Mind , published in 1589 , where // an account is given of the funeral of Martin Mar-prelate , it is observed , that he would not be laid East and West ( for he went ever against the haire ) but North and South ; and in Cymbeline , Guiderius is represented as saying over the lifeless body of Imogen , Nay , Cadwal , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a reason for't . It is recorded of the antiquary Hearne , that he left injunctions to have his grave made East and West , according to the compass . Bede insists , that such was the position of our Saviour in the tomb Sir Thomas Browne speaks of it as the one uniformly adopted in England ; we decline , ' says he , the religious consideration , but , to avoid confusion , have adopted the Athenian custom ; ' the same which we have described . In early times , and in some countries at the present day , the last and most touching tribute of affection was paid , by fondly strewing flowers on the grave . Virgil refers to this simple custom , in his lines on the death of Marcellus ; the English poets are full of allusions to it . Sweet-scented flowers only were considered proper for this purpose ; but nettles and other dishonorable plants were sometimes thrown in scorn , or planted upon the grave of an enemy ; and garlands , generally composed of artificial flowers , were suspended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remind us that such a custom was ever known abroad , except the descriptions given of it by travellers and writers . That of erecting stones at the grave , inscribed with the name and character of the deceased , has descended to us from very remote antiquity . We now turn to the appropriate conclusion of the drama ; but the simplicity of our ancestors is plainly seen at this day in that of the marriage ceremony , wherever their mode of religious worship prevails . When they came to this country , they brought with them a very unfavorable recollection of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction they had left behind ; and it was this which induced them to render the marriage contract so exclusively civil , that clergymen were not even allowed to perform the nuptial ceremony , until the introduction of the provincial charter . It was previously performed by civil officers , as it may be now . In depriving the ceremony of its religious character , they put an end to many customs , which had once been connected with it ; we know not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain may have been imported more recently ; but however this may be , they are most of // them very ancient . The wedding or bride-cake , is a signal improvement upon a part of the old Roman ceremony of confarreation , or a verbal marriage contract , executed in the presence of ten witnesses , on which occasion the bride and bridegroom partook of a cake composed of flour , salt , and oil . In England , it has always been composed of a more luxurious assortment of ingredients ; in some instances it was broken at the altar over the head of the bride , and the fragments made the subject of a general scramble ; but most commonly , pieces of it were passed nine times through the wedding ring , as a charm to enable the young to ascertain in dreams how soon a similar fortune awaited them . The wedding ring was anciently regarded as a pledge of faith , and was worn by the Greeks and Romans upon the third finger of the left hand , because a small artery was believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; though a less sentimental reason is assigned for this usage by some , who pronounce this finger better calculated than the rest to preserve the ring from injury , because it is the only one which can not be extended alone . Among the North* em nations , a knot , as well as a ring , was a symbol of plighted faith ; bence the top-knots or bridal favors , which were once distributed in great profusion at weddings , and worn in the hat for some weeks afterwards . The Anglo-Saxons appointed bride-maids and bride-groom 's men to accompany the parties to the church ; but the old English custom appears to have been to put the bridegroom under the protection of the bridemaids for the same purpose , while the bride-knights , as they were called , accompanied the bride . Those who attended her to the church were bachelors ; but she was expected to return under the more experienced escort of married men . In the time of Henry VIII . it was usual for one of them to precede her , bearing a vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosemary , primroses , maiden 's blushes and violets were esteemed most appropriate , were liberally strewed before her . A morose old writer , probably a bachelor , states , that she takes it by tradition from her gossips , that she must weepe shoures upon her marriage day ; ' and more than intimates , that artificial means were used to extract the tears , which the heart had no disposition to bestow . It is asserted by another , that in some countries , the bride was crowned by the matrons with a garland of prickles and delivered to her husband , that bee might know bee hath tyed himself to a thorny pleasure ; ' but the // reason assigned may be nothing more than the suggestion of his own experience . After the ceremony , the day was commonly devoted to sport and feasting . There was a custom among the Anglo-Saxons , which , fifty years ago , was in remarkable preservation here ; the youth amused themselves with dancing , while the ancient sate down to a drinking- bout , in which they highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England upon this occasion . A horizontal bar was attached to a perpendicular one , and turned freely upon a pivot in the centre ; on one end of it was placed a target , and at the other a bag of sand ; the assailant on horseback , rode full at the target with his lance , and the speciality of the sport , ' according to Master Laneharn , was to see how some for his slacknesse had a good boh with the bag , and some for his haste to topple downright , and come tumbling to the post . ' A country bridal was one of the sports exhibited for the amusement of Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth . It would be an endless task , however , to give an account of the wedding customs of different countries ; perhaps the strangest of all is one described by Park in his travels in Africa ; he was awakened at midnight to receive a present from a bride , which consisted of a well-filled howl dashed directly in his face , and which he was somewhat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until informed that it was a mark of particular favor . The wedding serenade was known , in rather a rude form , two centruies ago . Misson , an old traveller in England , after describing the nuptial ceremony , adds ; If the drums and fiddles have notice of it , they are sure to be with them , making a horrible racket , till they have got the pence ; ' and a vivid idea of this compliment may be formed , by examining one of Hogarth 's pictures of the Industrious and Idle Apprentice . We have thus attempted , in a very imperfect and cursory manner , to illustrate some of those festivals and customs which have come down to us , like mutilated fragments of antiquity . Our limits will not permit us even to allude to a vast number of them ; they would hardly be sufficient for the full description of any one . The subject may not be generally regarded as entitled to much consideration , and the attention may doubtless be directed to many of a graver and more imposing character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation of ancient manners and modes of life , it is at least as valuable as most other subjects of antiquarian tnquiry.
