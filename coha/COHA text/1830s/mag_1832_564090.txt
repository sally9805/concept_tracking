txt GENTLE READER ! Wert thou ever so far forsaken by thy good Genius , as to be left to build a house ? If thou hast not been , thank thy stars most devoutly that thou hast been spared , and pray that the " mania a domu " may never seize thee . If , however , thou hast , like us , been engaged in racking thy brains , fretting thy patience , and exhausting thy purse , to bring into being a pile of timber , and brick and mortar , bearing the cognomen of a House , thou needest not be told , that Architecture furnishes a vast theme for solemn reflection . There was a sublime moral in the message which Marius sent back to Rome from amidst the ruins of Carthage ; but if the reflections were solemn , which were awakened amidst the crumbling walls , the prostrate columns , the silent streets , and the desolate market-places of that once proud city , after these had once served the purposes of their creation , and been the abodes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what must be the troubled ruminations of him , who , amidst scattered lumber , shapeless piles of bricks , deep excavations in the earth , and unsightly masses of unhewed stone , sits down to plan out how these discordant elements shall be fashioned into form ; and how infinitely less grating to a delicate ear , is the silence that broods over the ruined domes of a depopulated city , than the discordant din and ring of hammers , and axes , and trowels , mingled with the hoarse bawl of the master and the men , in the dreadful process of giving to these materials a habitation and a name ! // Let his name be forever held in reprobation , be he Greek , or be he Egyptian , who first contrived the fashion of building houses for the dwelling place of man , instead of the cave , or the sheltering tree , which nature designed , with so much kindness , for his habitation ; and in which the parents of our race were contented and happy , till their innocence was lost . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sense , has a building mania more than once , any more , to use a borrowed comparison , than our children do their measles , or our collegians and young men of genius , their poetry . We have already suffered so much on this score , that we perfectly hate a brick or a lime cask , and nothing would keep us among the " Clay Men " of our country , so odious is the name , but the fact that through all the fiery furnaces which he has passed , he has neither changed his color , his character , nor his name . But if it is wise to learn wisdom from others ' misfortunes , it certainly can not be less so to derive useful reflections for our own and others ' benefit ; and since men will live in houses , and will , moreover , build them , it can not be an uninteresting theme of consideration , in what manner these should be built . We speak now of the dwelling houses of our citizens , the homes of our men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fortune , who are scattered through the country , and in these we include all who are able to own the estates which they occupy . On this subject , sober judgement and our daily observation are utterly opposed to each other . Neatness , comfort , and economy are sacrificed to fashion and false pride ; and go where we may in NewEngland , and , especially in Massachusetts , the traveler finds few things , so much to be lamented , as the sacrifice which is thus made to false taste , false judgement , and a falser estimate of what is valu-* able . In the first place , our houses are too large for comfort , convenience , or beauty . The consequence of erecting them of such dimensions is , often , that they remain unfinished and incomplete ; and , instead of the neat rural villa , which almost every farmer might own and enjoy , we see huge houses , the original cost of erecting which , too often , has entailed upon its tenant a load of debt , which he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toiling to keep down the accumulating interest of the money , thus expended for what he can not enjoy , with a consciousness , every year , that his chance of redemption is becoming less , and that his children must , ere long , yield their paternal acres to some stranger , who will enter to enjoy , if he can , the mansion , lbr which the tenant has sacrificed the best years of his life , and the best hopes of his family . This weakness is , if we mistake not , a peculiarity of New-England , and New-England men . We should look in vain , for such an idle expenditure of money among the thrifty descendants of the Dutch and Germans , in New-York or Pennsylvania . They understand these things better . Whatever they expend , in the way of buildings , is put to actual use . They have large barns , and large granaries , because they can fill them , and if they know not the luxury of a fine house , they know the comfort of a full and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying ease and competence , of voluntarily becoming the tenants of a griping landlord , and paying rent in the form of interest , // for money expended in enlarging their dwelling houses , and contracting their means of enjoyment . It has so often been our misfortune to trace the progress of a farmer or mechanic , who has , indiscreetly , run into debt to build , or purchase a larger house than he has had occasion to put to actual use , that we can almost infallibly tell , at the first sight , the precise stage of his career of ruin . Here might very easily be formed a pretty accurate scale , by which we could determine the condition of a stranger by the external marks , that meet the eye of a traveler while passing by his dwelling house . if we see a large house , with here and there a tattered garment supplying the places of broken panes of glass , we expect soon to see the shingles or clapboards loose , the doors with broken hinges , the fences broken down or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last step in this downward scale , a sheriff 's flag hanging from the premises , to tell the passers-by that the tenant 's equity of redemption in those premises is about to be sold to pay a store debt , or settle a tavern score . We might point out , too , the marks of this progress of poverty , within the doors of such an estate ; but the dwelling soon becomes too desolate , and the wife and children too strongly marked with the seal which ruin has set upon them , to make such a spectacle any thing but painful and melancholy . Let no man imagine that this is a fancied picture . It may be seen in almost every town in New-England . Go with us to the registry of deeds for any county in Massachusetts , and , we doubt not , we can point to instances , in every volume of its records , of mortgages of estates made to secure the payment of money borrowed to renew or enlarge the buildings upon those estates , and where the whole has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been the independent tenant of the acres he had purchased , or inherited . Of the propensity to which we have referred , though it is the besetting weakness of our men of moderate fortunes , it is difficult to trace the origin or the cause of its general prevalence . We are willing to ascribe it to honorable and praiseworthy considerations , but we think them unfortunate and indiscreet . There is a feeling of independence , and of republican equality among our citizens , which , if properly directed , makes them the best citizens in the world ; but which , if misapplied , makes them the veriest slaves . And this feeling may be traced in the style of our farm houses , as well as in other objects of luxury or convenience . No man is willing to be out done , if he can avoid it , by his neighbor . In the consciousness of acknowledged equality , he can not bear with patience to be surpassed in the externals of style or independence . Instead of converting this feeling into an incentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his more fortunate neighbors in wealth , and the means of display , too many begin with assuming the appearance of this equality , which they can not sustain , and thereby take a load upon themselves that sinks them to the dust . Fashion in this thing is a tyrant , to whom they blindly submit , even with all their high notions of independence , which spurn every appearance of control . They are dazzled by the hugeness of the idol they worship , and lie down to be crushed by the wheels of his car , the willing victims of their own idolatry . We have , again and again , seen families of limited // Domestic Architecture . means , forego the very necessaries of life , in order to keep up the appearance of being able to enjoy its luxuries , and this , because they were unwilling to seem inferior to those with whom they have been accustomed to associate in life . The folly of an individual who has blundered into a fortune , or acquired it at the sacrifice of all pretensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lasting injury of a country village . His extravagance gives a tone to the fashion of the place ; and the dimensions of his house , as well as his style of expenditure , become a sort of standard for others ; and many is the village , we could name , where a false style has thus been introduced in the construction of their dwelling houses , in which comfort , and fitness , and neatness , have been sac rificed to a false and ill-grourded jealousy or pride . The active capital , that gives life to business , is thereby absorbed or withdrawn from general use , by being thus converted into what can not be profitably improved ; and how often , where we . see the marks of dilapidation and decay in a village , may it be traced to an injudicious and misapplied expenditure of the wealth of its inhabitants in idle and useless show . We might dwell upon this part of our subject , and show by abundant examples , how this foolish fashion of extravagance in building houses , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public loss . But enough has been said , and the observation of every one would , of itself , be sufficient to illustrate the truth of the proverb , that " fools build houses , and wise men live in them . " Indeed , if we were to pursue this part of our subject any farther , we might find ourselves wandering in the mazes of political economy , and we will , therefore , turn to another view of it ; and that is , the violence which is done to good taste , in the style of building houses , so generally adopted in the country in New-England . Every one , from the most untutored clown to the finest connoisseur , feels , though he may not be equally able to account for the feeling , that there ought to be an adaptation of a thing to the purposes for which it is designed ; and any thing which does violence to this principle is a violence done to good taste . Now , the great object of houses , in this climate of alternate heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the extremes of these , as well as from the ordinary inconveniences of the elements , and thus to promote the comfort and convenience of their tenants . We would not say how far these are sacrificed , for we had rather look for an illustration among examples which we meet with every day . We we say nothing of the utter disregard to orders and proportions , which we so often observe , for that is the fault of the artist . We will take a case where the fancy of the occupant has been consulted , and who is said to possess a very fine , because a very large house . And there it is , towering up into its two stories in height , with its large and numerous windows , its white glaring walls , and , if you please , ( for we will take one of the best we can find ) its white fence in front , enclosing a green plat of untrodden grass , but without a tree near it to shade or shelter it from the sun and storm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye as it gazes upon it . What can , in fact , be more ill-suited than that pile for the purposes for whi*hit was designed ? * It is an independent farmer 's dwelling house , and one half of it is scarcely ever , if ever , brought into use . The wind moans along its wide entrje* VOL . II . // and through its unoccupied rooms , when the weather is cold , with a sound that is truly appalling ; and anon , when the summer heat drives us to seek a shelter from the scorching rays of the sun , we may see them pouring into those open windows , which seem intended to expose the inmates to the gaze and the pity of the spectator , while they are suffering from the oppressive heat of the climate , rather than let in the pure light of heaven , and the cooling breeze , as they may be wanted for the convenience or comfort of its occupants . Where shall we look in such an object for either the beauties of nature , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , shut out entirely . She is not permitted to lend the cooling shade of her forest trees , nor the bright and beautiful flowers of her exhaustless store of shrubs , to deck what man , not art , has tortured into the abode of a rational being , in whom nature originally implanted a fondness for her simple beauties . If we lay out of view the future destiny of such an estate , and regard only the uses to which it is applied by its present possessors , is there a man in his sob ' *r senses , who can call the construction of it a wise or a judicious expenditure of money , or one which indicates a man of native refinement , or of cultivated taste ? To test this style farther , let us turn our eyes for a moment towards that little cottage , ( for we have a few such ) which we see yonder among the trees . Go there , and we shall see neatness , and comfort , and taste combined . Its white walls peep out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose amidst its own green leaves , and the eye is delighted and relieved by the order and symmetry that prevails through every part of the little grounds that surround it . You may enter the humble door of that cottage , over which a woodbine has been trained , or look into its windows through the honey-suckles that are climbing over them , and you will find every thing convenient , though every spot is occupied for some useful purpose . And yet that is the dwelling house of a mechanic of humble means , who has made his own estate by industry , and knows how to enjoy it to the utmost . The first cost of that cottage was but trifling , compared to the large mansion of his neighbor , and it has been by his own hand , and without interfering with his accustomed employments , that he has planted these trees , and shrubs , and vines , and made that little spot so charming and inviting . No traveler can pass these two dwellings , without almost envying the scene of comfort and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant of the other , whenever a comparison is made between them . These are no fancied pictures , let us repeat , but are faithful descriptions of what may be met with among the substantial , intelligent citizens of New-England ; and nothing is wanted but a proper diffusion of good taste in the community , to make the instances of the one far more numerous than they now are , while the fashion of the other would , at the same time , become almost obsolete . We have not the power of comparing , by actual observation , the state of rural architecture , by which we mean the style of building generally adopted in the country in New-England , with that in some parts of Europe , especially in England ; but we can not read the descriptions Which travelers give us of rural life , arid rural scenery , there , without // lamenting the perversion of our public taste , especially in regard to this species of architecture . We ask no finer scenery , or brighter suns , or milder skies , than na* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for the objects of art , for the ornaments which nature borrows from the taste and skill of man , we look , too often , in vain . We have the most cheering and animating scenes of business and enterprise on every side . At one point , the towering walls of a Factory , surrounded with its clusters of dwelling houses and shops ; at another , the huge proportions of the village Tavern , and its neighboring stores , and shops of artizans ; and on every side are objects indicating the busy , hustling habits of our people , and the eagerness with which they pursue the acquisition of wealth . But how few are the marks of that cultivated taste , which we might look for in a country enjoying so many means of knowledge and cultivation ? Where do we look for the neat cottages , with their inclosures of hedges and their beautiful draperies of flowers and foliage ? or , in short , where shall we look for many of those simple and unpretending beauties , which give so much interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reason is , not that nature has been sparing on her part , but man , the lord of this part of the creation , will not follow her hints nor improve the advantages which she places within his reach . Here and there , we find men breaking through the trammels of custom and fashion , and exhibiting a refined taste in selecting the situations of their dwelling houses , and the style of their construction , and of the grounds around them . We look forward to the time when this taste will be more generally cultivated and improved , and its effects better understood . Our Horticultural Societies may do much in this respect , and their influence can not but be salutary upon the community . We say again , we do not want intelligence as a people , nor do we want capacity for enjoying the beautiful objects of nature and art . The fault is the slavery to fashion and custom , and here must the remedy be applied . In the success of an effort directed to this end , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance of the utter destitution of good taste , which has prevailed in many , and , we had almost said , most places , in regard to that appendage of every village-a grave-yard  --  the model of which will be before the public in the Cemetery at Mount Auburn-will have a most beneficial and decided effect . A similar effect may be produced in regard to other matters of taste , and by the same means  --  the force of example . We look forward , therefore , with confidence to the time , when the beautiful valleys and hill-sides of New-England , shall present objects more interesting to the eye of the traveler , than the huge naked and unpainted dwelling house - which mar the beauty of our landscapes at this day ; and where neat snug cottages and farm houses , with their shade trees , their vines , and their shrubbery , their gardens and their orchards-ornaments which only demand attention to secure their possession ,  --  where nature , and art , and economy shall all combine-shall be scattered through the land , and mark the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could fill a volume upon this subject , for we have hardly touched upon it in its interesting , economical , moral , and political effect upon // the community . We could draw illustrations from the history of past ages , as well as the condition of the present ; but we have already exceeded our limits , and must forbear. ii these hasty thoughts , begun in playfulness , but closed in serious earnest , shall serve to call the attention of others to this subject , we shall have done something towards the advancement of the arts in our country , and the happiness of her citizens . Z.@@183068102.txt I HAVE been repeatedly asked , what are the peculiar inducements to settle in Ohio ? The question comes in every possible shape . Is Ohio preferable to Indiana or Illinois ? Is your land as rich as fame reports ? Is it not sufficiently covered with population already ? Is money plenty ? Have you many broken banks ? Can debts be cob lected ? Can children be educated ? Are morality and religion cared for ? Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are your staples ? How do your inhabitants get a living ? These and such like interrogatories , are daily soliciting answers . Now , as one can not make time , and is obliged to eat and sleep occasionally , he must either devise a summary method of replying to the whole at once , or leave them unanswered ; for to reply to each , eparately , is utterly impossible . In this dilemma , it occurred to me , that I might make a general answer through this Magazine . I take it for granted that every body reads it ; if not , every body ought to read it . Ignorantia neminem excusat . Mental starvation would be a just doom to the presumptuous wight , who should neglect to feed himself from such a store-house . Therefore , let all querists take notice that they must look for answers here . These have been partially given in the preceding numbers ; they will be continued in this and the succeeding , provided the editors do not demur . In this sensible age , men ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a single acre of Ohio land , without any appliances , has produced one hundred and fourteen bushels of corn . It is a fact , that near Cincinnati , nine acres have yielded nine hundred and sixty-three bushels . It is an inference from these facts , that the soil is as rich as nature can provide . Further , it is a fact that Ohio contains twenty-five millions of acres of such land , and only one million of inhabitants . The inference is , that there is ample room for more . It is a fact , that there is not a bank now in operation in Ohio , of which the notes are not perfectly good in every part of the state . The inference is , that bank credit is in a sound and healthy condition . As to the abundance of money , I can not speak from experience . It is a fact , that my coffers are sadly empty . The inference is , that I must go to work . For , to working-men , money is plenty . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands a price one third higher than in the Eastern states . Indeed , so dear is labor , and so cheap is land , that any industrious man can earn money enough in three years to buy an ample farm . The consequence is , that it is next to impossible to procure servants . Frequently , you can not have them at any price , and , acting on the maxim of Franklin , you must serve yourself It is a fact , that many families , who are abundantly able , and anxious to hire help , do all their work themselves . This is looked upon as a great grievance , particularly in Cincinnati ; and induces hundreds to live at board , who , but for this , would be at house.keeping . The inference is , that the young men and women of the Eastern states , who are obliged to labor , could not do a better thing , than come to the West . They might have almost any wages they would ask . They might be // called domestics or assistants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They might retire from service , to a freehold of their own , after three years of fidelity and industry , and for the remainder of life , enjoy all the pleasures of abundance and independence . In eight years , by settling in the new counties , the men might reach the dignity of legislators , justices of the peace , or even associate judges ; and the women might safely count upon becoming the wives of similar dignitaries . I trust , that I am one of the last to join in the vulgar hue and cry against aristocracy . I believe with Pope- " some are and must be greater than the rest . " There is but one place , where all can be exactly on a level , and that is the grave . It is as much a law of nature that men should excel one another , as that the trees of the forest should be of different heights , or that hills should rise above plains , and mountains above hills . The universe is filled with diversity , and man forms not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As well might you look for a waveless ocean . But while I bow to the aristocracy of nature , and find myself penetrated with a spontaneous feeling of profound respect and admiration , whenever I see a man rising above others by the force of his own efforts , I look with as much contempt as any other person , and more than I know how to express , upon those artificial distinctions , by which one is placed above another , from adventitious circumstances . And I deem it no small recommendation to Ohio , that prescription can give no man power or place . It can neither bring one into good society , nor keep him out . The question is not , who his father was ? but , what he is ? The ridiculous cant about good family and high connexions , of which so much is bruited in the older cities , even of this republican country , I have scarcely heard this side of the mountains . It is a general observation that the laboring classes are more respected and have more influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eminently true in reference to Ohio ; and the inference is , that so far as ambition for office and pride of character are motives to emigrate , Ohio appeals to them with great effect . As I have before hinted , every man who wishes it , even if he begins with nothing , can soon become a freeholder . And the moment he has a farm of his own , he may promise himself leisure . The land brings forth almost spontaneously . You have but to sow , and you are sure to reap . The farmer is not obliged to be eternally delving for a scanty subsistence . He finds time to inform and interest himself about public affairs . He talks politics , becomes known , is elected to office , and soon finds himself an influential man . The mechanic has a similar advantage , from the exorbitant price of that kind of labor . Indeed , the only kind of labor , which is not amply compensated , is intellectual or professional . High salaries and large fees are not known . Teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Haud inexperitus loquor ; I presume I keep within the truth , when I say that a given amount of professional skill and labor , will command a third more compensation in Boston , New-York , or Philadelphia , than in Cincinnati ; and perhaps I might add , twice as much influence . For there has been a prevailing and deep-set jealousy of professional pretension and authority . In this jealousy , quackery finds // its appropriate aliment , and it feeds and fattens upon it . Every profession , therefore , has abounded with quacks , because they , from the smallness of their capital , can best afford to work for the price offered , and because , to employ them , looks more republican . In the more thickly settled portions of the state , however , this evil is rapidly diminishing , and the standard of professional excellence is daily growing higher . As wealth increases , professional compensation increases too . Men who can afford to pay well , will not trust their lives or their property in the hands of those doctors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is with respect to education . Hitherto , no class of men have met with so little pecuniary encouragement as teachers . But they already begin to see the dawn of better things . Parents appear to feel the momentous truth , that the instruction which their children receive , does more to determine their future characters , than all other circumstances put together ; and hence they become less solicitous about finding the cheapest school . On the contrary , they begin to think it something in favor of a man , that he charges a high price for tuition . It shows , at least , that he himself holds his services in high estimation , and disposes them to make trial . But what would be called a high price here , would be small in the Eastern cities . If I would have a house or a carriage built , or a coat , hat , or pair of boots made , I must give about thirty per cent . more than in Bcston ; but if I wish to have a cause argued , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it done about as much cheaper . Nor am I surprised at this discrepancy . The physical wants of men must be satisfied , or the wheels of life will not turn . But their intellectual wants are not so peremptory ; they can be neglected without danger to life . Accordingly , in a new country , mechanics are in a much greater demand than professors , and can command a proportionably higher price . This has been the case in Ohio ; and even in Cincinnati , this cause still operates . The unparalleled influx of emigration makes the want of a house to live in , the most difficult want to be supplied . No sooner is the corner stone of a tenement laid , than the inquirer finds that it is engaged . in this connexion , I will observe that one thirty-sixth part of all the laad in Ohio , was forever set apart by Congress , for the support of education , and another thirty-sixth , for the support of religion . Never , perhaps , has there been a nobler instance of liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six miles square . These were divided into thirty-six sections , each containing a square mile , and numbered in order . The sixteenth section was consecrated , in perpetuum , to education ; and the twenty-ninth to religion . The faith of the state is pledged , that these sections shall never be otherwise appropriated ; and subject to this condition , they are left in the hands of the state legislature . In addition to this general provision , several entire townships have been given for the establishment of colleges . All this is the work of the general government . But , meantime , the state has not been inactive on this all-important subject . By dint of the most energetic and persevering efforts of a few public-spirited individuals , among whom , without injustice to the rest , may be especially mentioned , Nathan Guildford , a native of Massachusetts , the leader in this great enterprise , the glorious // system of Free Schools has , within seven years , been established throughout the state . This system is yet in its infancy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support these common schools , in addition to the profits of the land above-mentioned , a tax of three-fourths of a mill upon the dollar is levied upon all the taxable property of Ohio ; and proper provisions are enacted , for carrying the system into complete effect . It may be regarded as matter of surprise , that struggles should have been required to procure such a law . But such was the fact . Although the constitution declares , in words worthy to be written in gold , that " SCHOOL5 AND THE MEANS OF INSTRUCTION SHALL FOREVER BE ENCOURAGED BY LEGISLATIVE PROVISION , " yet there were many so jealous of their rights as to doubt and even deny the constitutionality of a tax , making it compulsory on every property holder to assist in the support of free schools , whether he sent children to them or not . There were still more who professed to doubt the expediency of the measure . Nor is this objection as yet , wholly removed , though daily diminishing . Indeed , the free schools themselves are their own most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . Thank heaven , the law is made , and there is 110 danger of its repeal . Time will but indurate and strengthen the noble fabric . While they , to whose efforts we owe it , will have , as they deserve , a bright place in the grateful memory of their posterity . We have Lyceums too , and illechanics Institutes . They are few as yet , but a beginning is made . In Cincinnati the lecture rooms are filled . The best taste of the city is there seen . Only one thing is wanting to their rapid spread , and that is the countenance of men , who , from the position they occupy , give , by their very names , an impetus to any good undertaking ; men , I mean , who stand in the same relation to our society , that Story , Webster , Shaw , Sullivan , and the Everetts do to the society of Boston . Almost every mail announces some one of these distinguished men as a lecturer ; and I want no better proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unambitious way , a fame that will wear well , for it will be written on the hearts of their fellow citizens . We have , as yet received rio aid from our statesmen or distinguished lawyers . They have hardly deigned to make their appearance in the hall . The burthen has been borne chiefly by the young men of the city and some of the leading physicians . Among the latter , were it not invidious , I would mention the iiames of two or three , who , notwithstanding the numerous calls of an extensive practice and a professorship in the medical school , nevertheless hold themselves ready and willing to bring in their frequent and valuable contributions , to the diffusion of general information . They deserve and will have the gratitude of the community . I shall advert , at this time , to but one more fact . Slavery is forever prohibited north of the river Ohio . Fugitive slaves are permitted to be recovered and carried back to bondage ; but if their master comes here to reside , and brings them with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our limits , and their fetters fall . " 1 can not join in the too frequent anathemas against slave holders . I look upon slavery as a stupendous calamity , which no words can adequately describe . But it has been entailed upon the present slave holders by their ancestors ; // and they are no more to blame for it , than are the hapless victims of an hereditary disease . I speak , therefore , in sorrow and not in anger , of this dark blot upon our country 's fame . And while I deprecate and abhor , as much as the slave holders themselves , the reckless fanaticism of some incendiary writers , I yet thank heaven for the eternal prohibition of slavery in Ohio , as the most transcendant blessing this happy state enjoys . Leaving out of view the injustice , and looking only at the impolicy of slavery , the example of Ohio is worth a book of abstract arguments . Kentucky , for instance , is almost as old again as Ohio . The first lots laid out in Cincinnati , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the clog of slavery impeded her in the race , and soon Ohio was seen far in advance . The distance between them grows wider and wider . The population of Ohio is now one third greater . To what can this be ascribed , but the prevalence of slavery in Kentucky ? The advantage of mild climate is on her side , her soil is equally fertile , and she has an equal extent of boundary on the same noble river . But her work is done by slaves , instead of freemen and freeholders ; and this explains the difference . Is it not a striking fact that there is not a single non-slave-holding state in the twentyfour , which does not increase in a more rapid ratio than any of the slave-holding states except Missouri and perhaps Louisiana ? But I have not time to pursue the subject further . W.@@183068107.txt AN Opinion has of late been advanced , on very high authority , that the action of governments is becoming less important , and that of individuals more so . We suspect this is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , that the agency of individuals in the government is becoming less important , and that of the community more so . Governments are becoming more popular ; public opinion is gain .. ing more strength . Less therefore depends , in any form of government , on the caprices of the individuals who compose it , and a greater deference is required from the governors to the wishes and opinions of the subjects of their government . But , for this very reason , and after these conditions have been complied with , government is not weaker but stronger . It has gained , by all the force of that pub .. lic opinion , which has been gratified by the mode , in which the government is constituted and carried on . It is strong , because it is popular , and as long as it is popular ; stronger than a government , nominally more absolute , exerted over a discontented and disaffected community . No government is so strong , as a party ; we mean , no where is the will of a government obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a well-drilled party . A republican government , within its sphere , is more powerful than a monarchy . General Jackson has much more personal power than Charles X. who , after the round of official observance was gone through ,  --  after the courtiers had bowed , and the guards had presented arms ,  --  had really no power at all . But it has become necessary to governments , to act in conformity with the interests and opinions of the people . This is the great change , which has taken place , and is still proceeding . This is the great reform bill of the age , introduced not by kings and ministers , but by those mighty causes of improvement , which have been in action since the revival of letters , but have received their greatest development within the last seventy years . Governments were formerly organized on the pretence of promoting the welfare of the people . Some body ,  --  certain privileged orders ,  --  inheriting the power of government from generation to generation , were supposed to have a call of Providence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disinterested wish to govern , not for their own sakes , but for the good of the people . It was further supposed , that the people did not know so well what was for their welfare , as these rulers did , who were understood to be inspired with supernatural wisdom , to fit them for the discharge of their high functions . This was the theory and practice of the governments ; and to make the state of facts , as far as possible , support this theory and practice , the people were kept as ignorant as possible , and their interests as far as possible identified with the preservation of the ascendancy of the privileged orders . There was no public opinion therefore on the part of the mass . The great vice of the existing governments is , that they are organized on the old plan ; with much of the old machinery , while the // state of the world is entirely changed . Education is so common that the great mass of the people in several parts of Europe , read , write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own opinions . The prodigious extension of the operations of the press , and the great facilities for communication of all kinds , have formed , out of this mass of private opinions , a public sentiment of uncalculated power . The Romans intersected the world with imperial roads , designed for the march of their armies to the remotest provinces ; hut the canals and turnpikes , the railroads and steamboats of the last century , have proved so many means of facilitating the intercourse of the members of the community , and giving concentration to their opinions and wishes . All governments have undergone and must constantly undergo great changes , by the mere force of circumstances . The governors like the governed , are men , subject to the laws of human nature and the action of social influences . Compare Alexander with Peter the Great ; each a despot-ruling the same people , and with an interval between their reigns of less than a century . Alexander is a polished , benevolent gentleman ; Peter the Great an enlightened savage . In the gradual amelioration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much improved . The ancient ferocity of government has been abated ; and the life of man , that inexplicable essence ,  --  the thing in which a perpetual miracle seems wrought before our eyes ,  --  life has been raised up from its ancient state of worthlessness . If one wished to point out the most affecting instance of ancient barbarity , ( and by antiquity , we mean all time prior to the last century , ) he might well fix on the recklessness of human life , which prevailed in all countries , as it still prevails in the East . It is shocking to see with what levity eminent individuals , on the slightest turn of affairs , were led to the scaffold , and sanguinary laws enforced on thousands of the humbler ranks of the community . But the great difficulty in Europe is , that , except these changes , insensibly produced by events and not implying the necessary modification of the great institutions of government , no improvement can take place , but in the way of revolution . The privileged orders constantly fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or they affect this fear , and the privileges of their order , are , in some cases , themselves , the evil to be reformed . Thus it is with the Reform in England . It is opposed by the aristocratic party , not so much from incurable aversion to the measure itself as from a just fear of its natural consequences . The radical party , where they advocate it , do so , not because it goes far enough , but because they regard it as a pledge of more thorough change . While the reforming aristocracy defend it on a ground , which renders it justly suspicious to the friends of liberal institutions , viz , that it will strengthen and not subvert the existing aristocracy of Great-Britain . Now , an artificial , privileged , and hereditary aristocracy is an institution altogether at war with all the notions of natural law and of human nature , which , originating with the theoretical writers of the latter part of the seventeenth century , have grown in our day into common place . There is no true aristocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fortune . The two first can not he transmitted ; the latter can be transmitted only to a limited degree , under the direct patronage of the // law ; and the spirit of the age tends strongly to counteract such legislation . This being the case , the controlling power exercised by the heads of the aristocracy in former times , over all the other members of the state , can not possibly be tolerated in communities , where this aristocracy is in no respect discriminated from the mass of well educated citizens around them . We see this in France . Notwithstanding the recency of their revolution , and the tremendous evils which it inflicted on all orders of the community-evils , as it would seem , which would make the word revolution inauspicious in the ears of Frenchmen for centuries to come , and lead them to connect every idea of political and social happiness with the stability of existing things ,  --  we yet see an overwhelming majority of the deputies voting down the hereditary peerage . These deputies are not the mob , nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paris , which has decided against a hereditary House of Peers ; but it is the intelligent , the well educated , influential members of the community , chosen on a system of elections by no means extremely popular , and representing beyond doubt the sense of the soundest part of the French people . At present , in France , it seems they do not think it wise to go farther . In framing the American Constitution , the happy circumstance that the colonies had , from their infancy , been free from a hereditary aristocracy , prevented its being thought of as an element of the new governments . The incongruity of such an institution with the improved character of the age was felt too strongly , to admit its being thought of for a moment , and merely in consequence of the fact that it did not previously exist in our society . But will the mere fact that this institution has nominally existed , though with constantly diminishing personal influence , in England , be considered as a sufficient reason for perpetuating it , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all principles of polity , and in opposition to the feelings and prejudices of the people ? In fact there can be no constitution , properly so called , that is not fourMled professedly and substantially on a reference to the popular will . All the rest is military usurpation . The Roman emperors felt this so strongly , that they did not dare to throw off the republican forms . They passed through the dignities of the republic , the tribuneship and consulate themselves , interchanging occasionally with their horses . In modern times , the horse-guards are not formally chosen to high offices of state , but they discharge its most important functions . Can such a state of things be called a constitutional government ? it is a mitigated military despotism , resting at last on the exhibition and application of force . An enlightened public sentiment may impose considerable restraints on the exclusive and selfish spirit inherent in all bodies possessing a monopoly . If there be an intermixture of democratic institutions ,  --  an elective House of Commons for instance ,  --  still greater force may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocratic principle remains in force , the result of the intermixture will be the constant recurrence of distressing collisions . This grand arcanum of a mixed government is likely to turn out a great delusion . Mixture of what ? Of the interests of the people with something that is not of their interests ? Of the will of the people with // something which is not of their will ? Of institutions in accordance with their feelings and institutions not in accordance with their feelings ? If this is the mixture of the British government , it may indeed be a wonder that it has lasted so long ; but it is a greater wonder that it should have been lauded for its wisdom . But it may be said in simpler language , that it is a mixture of king , lords and commons . But the lords have been reduced by the force of circumstances and the gradual change of things to the condition of the commons . They are part and parcel of the commons . The king , having lost the divine right , is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commoner . There is therefore in reality nothing to mix . But in compliance with certain antiquated forms , the present British Constitution selects one family , by the chance of birth , and clothes it with royal attributes . It selects the heads of three or four hundred other families by the same chance , and gives them a controlling power in the legislation of the country ; and leaves these four hundred and one men , to struggle against their fellowmen . And this is called a mixed government . But the only mixture in it is that of popular will with the lottery of birth . It is a mixture of chance and choice . Now , who wills this mixture ? Who orders , constitutes , and upholds it ? It is not of divine right ,  --  that is abandoned . So then it is man . It is British men , who wish this heterogeneous mixture . Qua*rc de Iwc . We doubt the fact . It is absurd , impossible . It will not bear discussion . Such a mixture can be supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suicidal , and self-contradictory . Was it ever heard of , that intelligent men should , in grave and vital matters , wish their serious deliberations and conclusions to be balanced and mixed up with a reference to chance of any kind ? We suppose it must be considered as about an equal chance ,  - -  in the most favorable supposition ,  --  that the privileged orders , on any given subject , should think with or against the people . Their concurrence might , therefore , as well be made to depend on the cast of the dice , as be ascertained in any other way . Now suppose , after the House of Commons have passed a bill ,  --  the reform bill for instance ,  - -  instead of sending it to the Peers for concurrence , they should agree to draw lots , or cast the dice , whether it should become a law or not . What sort of a government would that be ? And how much better is the present mixture ? There is another thing that deserves consideration . It is the standing reproach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , that they are fluctuating and open to continual change . As far as the United States are concerned , this reproach is certainly thus far unfounded . Our Union is composed of numerous independent commonwealths , each with its own constitution , and is itself organized under the constitution of the United States . In every one of these constitutions , ( we believe in every one , certainly in those of the most important states , ) there is incorporated the conservative principle , by which changes of the constitution are required to be made with great deliberation , and in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of frequent and unadvised alterations . In point of fact , although several of the states have once , since their constitutional history began , instituted formal revisions of their constitutions , introducing what have been considered // at the time important amendments , yet has there been no change in any of these republics , which , to a stranger , taking a general view of the subject , would be deemed essential , or just ground for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Massachusetts , NewYork and Virginia have revised their constitutions . It is doubtful if any practical change , in the mode in which the government is administered , has resulted from either revision ; certainly not from the two first n*imed . At the same time , the process is attended with such difficulty , that once in a half a century , judging from experience , is quite as often , as the public mind can be wrought up to its adoption . And yet it should be considered , that , without being justly obnoxious to the charge of fluctuation , it was to be expected , that so many new states , coming out of a protracted revolutionary war , and constructing for themselves written constitutions of government , in many respects wholly novel in their principles , should , on the first essay , fall upon experiments that would fail in their farther prosecution . This was the rather to be expected , as the community itself ,  --  the people over whom the constitutions were established ,  --  was in a constantly changing condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the present constitution of the United States , now about forty-four years old , no practical change has been made . It is true the change in the mode of electing the President , substituting separate ballots for President and Vice-President , instead of a joint ballot for two persons , of whom the highest was to be the President and the next Vice-President , is , on paper , a considerable change . But it has been , we think , justly stated , that the same individuals that have been chosen to our Chief Magistracy , since l7S* ) , would have been chosen , had the change not been made , or had the constitution , in this respect , contained from the first the provisions introduced into it by the amendment . The entire constitution of 1739 is , we must admit , a change of vital character , from the confederation which preceded it . But it is surely not a change of a revolutionary and disorganizing character . It was an improving , a consolidating change . A change from weakness to strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the tendency of our written constitution to permanence , that the friends of reform in and out of Parliament in Great-Britain , have been warned not to forget , that the British constitution is destitute of that conservative principle , which exists in the constitution of the United States . But there is no virtue in mere technical principles of conservation . In itself , the provision that no amendment shall be made in the constitution of the United States , till it has been approved by two thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states , would be of no avail , were not the foundations of the system laid in principles purely popular . The constitution begins by recognizing the equal rights of the people , and is but an efficient mode of collecting and giving constant expression to their will . There is , therefore , no occasion for those great changes , which are from time to time required in the governments of Europe , to fit the antiquated machinery of the feudal system to the wants of modern society . Beginning with a liberal organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of keeping the legislation of the country in constant harmony with public opinion . // The steady and insensible change , required by the change of circumstances , is silently and peacefully made . Abuses are not allowed to root themselves . If we may so express it , a gentle and constitutional revolution is perpetually going on , as healthful to the body politic , as violent revolutions , at long intervals , are disastrous . In order to get the British constitution into a safe and permanent state , it is probably necessary , if we may be excused the plagiarism from Mrs. Glass , that they should first have a constitution that is an authentic charter of government , to which the people have deliberately given their assent . Many very important institutions in England ,  - -  integral portions of their constitution so called ,  --  seem to have no foundation in law , and to rest on mere sufferance . Thus the vote of the spiritual lords in the House of Peers . We do not recollect , and can not now take time to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in Great-Britain , nor whether the suppression of the convocation as an estate of the realm , the suppression of the mitred abbots , and the introduction of the bishops into the House of Peers , were ever matters of definite enactment . If they were , it was a a good while ago , under a very different positive and relative state of things . There is no authentic instrument constituting the two houses of parliament , and they were arranged into something like their existing separate organization , in an age , when the lords and commons ,  - -  in their comparative importance as elements of the community ,  --  bore not the least resemblance to their present condition . The crown of England was originally a conquest , both in the ordinary and legal sense of that word , and has been transmitted by inheritance under legal modifications , to the present day . The people of England have never given a free deliberate assent to the existing monarchy . There has never beQn a time , when it was an open question . An open question ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discussed , without involving the adventurous theorist in the pains and penalties of high treason . The consent , which the people of England have given to a government of kings , lords , and commons , is substantially the consent , which a man is very apt to give to any thing offered him , under pain of being hanged , drawn , and quartered . No permanence , no security against revolution can be hoped for , in a system thus vicious in the outset . You may shore it up , and surround it with buttresses ; but the foundation is insecure . Since the American constitutions have set the example ,  --  an example which will become every year more imposing , with the continued prosperity of this country ,  --  it will be impossible to content a kindred people , with a chaos of traditionary abuses , under the name of a constitution . We consider it certain , that in no very long time , some means will be provided for organizing , in Great-Britain , a constituent assembly , either by clothing parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose . It is impossible to foretell what sort of a government such a convention would offer to the people . But we doubt not it would be a republic . Not because we as Americans , think it the best , but because , whether best or not in itself , it is the form of government , which the people , from the nature of things , if left free to choose , will always think the best . // It will be seen that we assume the probable permanence of our own constitutions , and ascribe to this circumstance much of the force , which our example is to have , in accelerating the march of reform . We know it is a favorite idea with some , that these constitutions have not been put to the test . But why not ' ? Several of them , in their great features , are near two centuries old . It is true , till 1775 , we were under a colonial superintendence ; but we do not think the Crown did any thing by way of promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace by an armed force , nor supplied , by a paternal administration , any supposed deficiency in the colonial institutions of government . On the contrary , we were traversed and embarrassed , at every step , by ungracious and unfriendly foreign interference . Sinze the revolution , we have certainly passed through a series of political changes , of a nature adapted to put the stability of our institutions to the severest test . It is sometimes said , that the abundance of vacant land o rates as the safety valve of our system . Be it so ; and we may promise ourselves , for centuries , all the security derived from this source . Rapidly as our population increases , it must be centuries before North-America is full . But it must not be too hastily inferred , that the strength and efficiency of our forms of government , have been tried only , over a very thin population . Massachusetts has a population of seventy-eight to a square mile . The average population of Europe is but sixty-six to the square mile . We know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that a radically different fhrm of govern .. ment would be required , if our population should be , like that of England , thrice as dense as it is now , will seem to us , on this side of the water , the merest chimera . On the whole , we believe that the first leaves only of the book of revolutions ,  --  we had almost said revelations ,  --  are opened for Europe . God grant , as its successive seals are broken , that dispensations , not of confusion and bloodshed , but of peace and improvement , may diffuse their blessings over its inhabitants.
