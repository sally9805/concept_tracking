txt THE earliest French traders soon discovered that the lands of the Saques and Foxes were rich in lead . The celebrated Du Buque was the first who taught the Indians to collect the ore , and to make an article of trade of it . Tradition tells strange tales about this man , and his memory is still cherished by the Saques and Foxes . He led them to battle , was a valiant warrior himself , and gained an authority over them which none of their own chiefs have ever possessed . He had the faculty of handling rattlesnakes and copper-heads without injury , and was thence esteemed a potent sorcerer . He lived on the west bank of the Mississippi , about twenty miles above the mouth of Fever river , and an orchard planted by his hands is still to be seen about the site of his dwelling . When on his death bed , he desired that his remains should be deposited on the summit of a perpendicular bluff ; three hundred feet high , which hangs over the river ; the savages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the cliff , secured it with a leaden door weighing more than a ton , and shut up the body of Da Buque in it . There the trader slept unmolested till the Americans came into the country . Some of them , with that disregard to the feelings of the Indians , which , I am sorry to say , has always characterised my countrymen , broke into the sepulchre , hewed the door in pieces , and carried it away . The savages replaced it with a wooden one , and Du Buque has not since been molested . His grave is still a land mark well known to all who have travelled on the Mississippi . When it became known that this then remote district contained mineral wealth , the Saques and Foxes were importuned to sell it . They did finally convey to government a tract on the eastern side of the Mississippi , about the mouth of Fever river . The tract was eighteen miles square . Some say it was sold by the Winnebagoes , and not the Saques and Foxes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am unable to settle this point or the date of the treaty . I believe , however , that I am right , and that the transactions took place about the beginning of the present century . For a long time the tract was much neglected ; the attention of the borderers was chiefly directed to the mines of Missouri . Some , however , broke ground about the mouth of Fever river ; some very rich mines were discovered , and some fortunes were made . Such occurrences becoming more frequent , toward the year 1820 , swarms of adventurers began to pour in . The town of Galena was built-in the most filthy , inconvenient spot that can be imagined . It stands on the side of a steep hill , six miles from the mouth of Fever river , and at the head of its navigation . Whenever the river overflows , which it does very often , it washes the lower street of Galena . Whenever it rains , boots can not defend the legs from pollution ; the town is a quagmire . It is proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that my remarks apply to its condition then . I do not think , however , that much improvement has been made . When I saw Galena last , it contained two rough stone buildings ; all the rest were of logs ; some hewn , seine rough . It had three taverns , and a great many shops or stores . It was riOt then known whether it belonged to Miehigati or Illinois ; conse quently , there was no provision fot the adlninistratiQn of justice . // The miners , or as they called themselves , diggers , soon spread all over the tract owned by the United States , and so vexed the soil as to give it the appearance of having been ploughed with a team of earthquakes . A very rich mine was found , I believe in 1825 , by three brothers of the name of Gratiot . They erected smelting furnaces , and employed a great many laborers . Others were attracted to the spot by their success , and in a short time , a log village was built , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very near the boundary line of the tract . One Schull having made a similar discovery two miles further , similar results ensued . The town founded by him was called Schullsburgh . The diggers continued to penetrate deeper and deeper , and farther and farther into the bowels of the land . They did not go far from the Mississippi , but spread along its eastern bank . In 1826 , they had encroached fifty miles upon the Winnebagoes . The advanced guard built two log huts opposite the mouth of Turkey river , sixty miles above Galena , and the city in embryo was christened Turkeytown . Afterwards , when it contained a dozen huts , it received the dulcet appellation of Cassville , in honor of the governor of Michigan . The Winnebagoes beheld the invasion of their hunting grounds with jealousy and alarm , but offered neither resistance nor complaint . They were soon to be roused to more active exertion . There was a French inhabitant of Prairie du Chien , Brisbois by name , who had traded with the Winnebagoes many years , and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked permission of the Winnebagoes to search for this mine , promising , if he could find and work it , to pay them a stipulated price . The savages accepted his terms , and he began to dig , in the spring of 1827 . He ibond no mine , but appearances were so flattering , that a host of adventurers hurried from Galena to the spot , and began to break up the ground . The prairies rang from morning to night with the strokes of the mattock and the report of the western rifle . The Winnebagoes saw that they had lost their lands forever . I must go back a little . The year previous , a barbarous murder had been committed near Prairie du Chien by a party of Winnebagoes . They slew a man named Methode , with circumstances of peculiar atrocity . Two of the culprits were apprehended and committed to prison in Prairie du Chien . They broke jail , were retaken , and , as the civil authorities had little or no power , were delivered to the military for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post at Prairie du Chien was broken up , and the troops were removed to St. Peter 's , two hundred miles above . The prisoners were carried to St. Peter 's as a matter of course . In the summer of 1827 , a party of Chippeways , coming to St. Peter 's on business with the Indian agent , were attacked under the walls of the fort by the Dahcotahs , on ground belonging to the United States , and lost two men . Several more were wounded . The last treaty had promised protection to each of these tribes while under the A*ri*an flag , and , in pursuance of that stipulation , the commanding officer t*eized four of the aggressors , ( all he could catch , ) and delivered them to the Chippeways for punishment . They were shot forthwith , to the great displeasure of their tribe . Not daring to avenge themselves , // they sent a messenger to the Winnebagoes to inform them that the two prisoners of their tribe had been put to death by the Chippeways in the most cruel manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever held the name of American in utter abhorrence ; and this piece of false intelligence roused their ire . Four of them repaired without delay to Prairie du Chien , where they killed two persons and dangerously wounded another . Two days after , a large party attacked two boats on the river , and killed and wounded several Americans . These hostile acts put a stop to all mining in every part of the country . The utmost confusion ensued . The inhabitants of Prairie du Chien prepared to defend themselves , but the diggers thought of nothing but escaping . Hundreds fled down the Mississippi , and hundreds wept because the means of escape were insufficient for all . Those who remained crowded together at Gratiot 's and Galena , where they heard the war whoop in every breeze , and the Winnebago rifle in every sound . The diggers might have amounted to six thousand fighting men in all , yet they were thrown into this panic by a thousand Indian warriors , no better armed than themselves , and not so well provided . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigade , and , lest this force should prove insufficient , raised a corps of mounted men at Galena . These last were divided into companies , consisting each of the least possible number of men , but each provided with the full number of commissioned and non-commissioned officers . This was done to increase the demand for compensation , as was afterwards found by the disbursing officer . General Atkinson proceeded up the Wisconsin with his forces , which were farther augmented by a detachment of regulars and a body of friendly Indians , which met him at the portage between the Wisconsin and Fox rivers . The Winnebagoes , having no adequate means of resistance , submitted , delivered up the most prominent actors in the late ou.trages , and promised to molest the whites no more . One of the captives obtained a temporary notoriety . He was a chief , named The Red Bird , a warrior of approved courage , and had till then ever been friendly to the Americans . He gave himself up voluntarily , and so did his fellows . To make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in prison of a dysentery before his trial came on . The Indian war being thus ended , things returned to their usual course . The fugitives returned to their " digging , " and more came in their train . The heroes of the war received their pay , and reposed in the shade of their laurels . As there was no farther danger from the savages. , they extended their operations still farther . Cassville increased in magnitude , and could boast of its tippling shop and tavern . Large bodies squatted upon the Upper Wisconsin , and the Indians dared not interfere . The ignorant pioneers of civilization were not without official example for their encroachments . They had divided the land at Cassville , into building lots , and allowed each man to take as many as he could build houses upon . It was understood that each lot must be occupied and furnished with a building , and he that could comply with this regulation might take as many as he pleased . The Winnebago sub-agent at Priarie du Chien took a lot on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a major-general of militia , con* // ducted a party of fifty well armed men to the vicinity of the portage , where they built a stockade fort , resolved to resist all attempts to remove them , by whomsoever made . All these things were done in open contempt of the Indian right , which had not then been defined to be a right of occupancy . Moreover , a clamor arose , which was soon heard at Washington , that the Winnebagoes ought to relinquish their lands as an indemnification for the expenses of the late war . They , poor creatures , were daily complaining of their increasing wrongs to General Street , their agent at Prairie du Chien , who , though a good man , gave them no redress-he could not . All he could do , he did . lie called on the military to remove General Dodge and his people , and a small party was sent for that purpose . Dodge heard of their approach , manned his works , and bade them approach at their peril . So the matter ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Winnebagoes to send a deputation of their chiefs to Washington in order to hold a " talk . " They did so , and the chiefs reached the seat of government during the winter of 1828 . Their first request was that those of their people who had been convicted of the outrages before men tioned , and sentenced to death , might be pardoned . Mr. Adams granted their request , saying , at the same time , that he did so in the expectation that they would give up the lands in question in gratitude for the favor . They replied that they had no power to make the desired cession , but would use their influence to effect their great father 's object . They then returned home . Those who had co-operated with the Red Bird in his first aggression had slain persons who had never injured them , in the most barbarous manner . It appears to me , that their pardon , granted on such an implied condition , was a bargain for the blood of our citizens . In the mean while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing that the United States would soon supply themselves with the article , sent over great quantities ; and , much having been obtained at the Lead Mines of the Mississippi , the price fell to almost nothing . The consequence was that great numbers of the " diggers " gave up their pursuit , and the business became stagnant . It has since revived . In the first year of the administration of President Jackson , a treaty was held with the Winnebagoes , who made a merit of necessity , and ceded a tract extending along the Mississippi from Rock river to the Wisconsin , and about a hundred miles inland . They received forty thousand dollars in hand , one fourth of which they were to pay to those who had suffered by their depredations , and were promised an annuity of eighteen thousand dollars for thirty years . This was not a fair equivalent , nor was the bargain favorable to the Winnebagoes , in any respect . Five hundred thousand dollars worth of lead , at the very least , may easily be raised annually from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred years to come , estimating the article at its lowest market price . The ore is inexhaustible ; the land appears to be one vast bed of ' metal . As a mere hunting ground , the tract would have supported the whole tribe . It would have supported a population of millions subsisting by agriculture . The sum they received could be of little consequence distributed among so many , and could have been of no permanent benefit . An* // nuities appear to me to have been au invention of the devil , intended to destroy Indians . It takes away the habit of depending on themselves for subsistence . When an annuity is about to be distributed , hundreds of unprincipled whites huiry to the spoil , as crows do to carrion . Booths are erected , and the unfortunate savage , who enters one of them , does not leave it while he has a cent or an article of value remaining . When all is gone , he is thrust out of doors , with outrage and insult . When he has slept off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was before , and degraded in his own eyes . While the money is changing owners , a scene of riot , drunkenness , and degradation , is exhibited , which those only who have seen can imagine . The morals of the females suffer most . The lands opposite those now in possession of the whites , belong to the Saques and Foxes , who have steadily refused to sell them . They are more valuable than those we have already , if possible . It seems , by the latest advices , that a dispute has arisen relative to the title to certain lands on the Mississippi . I know not which party has the best claim , but I was certain that a pretext to deprive the Indians of their mineral district would not long be wanting . A staff it is said , is quickly found to beat a dog , and here we have the adage exemplified . I'he papers state that General Gaines has led an overwhelming force against them , and driven them across the Mississippi . These proceedings will , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much for the history of the Lead Mines . I will now proceed to other matters . The soil of the whole country is good ; well adapted to grain . Timber would grow , did not the biennial fires keep it under . At present , there is little ; just enough for the wants of the settlers , and no more . On the prairie , or high lands , the trees are principally oak ; in the bottoms or strips of low ground on the borders of the streams , are oak , ash , elm , many varieties of maple and walnut , ironwood , hackberry , or bois inconnu , and many others . The only fruits I have seen are several varieties of plums , all very good , and nuts . Very deep ravines run up from the Mississippi into the country , and serve to drain away heavy rains and the melted snows . The face of the *country is what is called rolling prairie , that is , it is agreeably diversified with hill and dale . The tract is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock river , the Wisconsin , and the River du Grand ; all navigable streams . The name of the last is corrupted by the inhabitants into Grant river , and by this it will ultimately be known , probably . The Fever river is a deep , stagnant pool , through the whole of its navigable course , which only extends six miles . There are a great many smaller streams , which fall into those already mentioned . Most of them are nearly dry in summer . All that have sufficient water abound in fish . Carnelians and fortification agates are as common as other pebbles on the borders of some of them . These , with small rock crystals , are the only precious stones I ever saw in the territory . The ore that has so much excited the cupidity of the borderers is very pure . Smelted in the slovenly fashion of the country , it yields about seventy per cent . of pure metal . It is found in different situations and at different depths . The Gratiots discovered their prize at the depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some shafts have // been sunk two hundred feet . Sometimes the mineral is found in a solid , isolated body , sometimes in a horizontal sheet , but most frequently in veins , or , as they are called by the diggers , leads . About Gale-. na the ore is imbedded in clay , but , at the River du Grand and some other places , it is necessary to penetrate into the solid rock , often very deep . In all cases , the diggers abandon the search when they come to water , and thousands of tons of lead have thus been relinquished , that may , some day , be recovered by the application of machinery . The first formation of rock is lime , below which is a formation of silex , so hard , in many places , that , after laboring all day , a man may carry home his chips in a bucket . Where clay only is to be removed , trenches are cut , and the shovel and spade are the only tools required . Where the diggers penetrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chisels , and wedges . When the shaft is sunk so low that the fragments can not be thrown out by hand , a windlass is placed over it , and the earth or stone is drawn up in a tub . Two men always work in one shaft , in partnership , for hired labor is difficult to procure . These operations are carried on at all seasons , though in summer the weather is as warm as in Massachusetts , and in winter the cold is much more severe . These remarks apply to the order of things that obtained three years since , and I believe there has been little change since . There were three agents for the United States , who granted licenses to the diggers . A man , who had observed indications of ore , surveyed a small tract , I believe a hundred yards square , and obtained permission to dig in it , to the exclusion of all others . The condition was , that he should pay to the United States the tythe of all minerals he might obtain , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the smelters . The smelters were the most considerable of the settlers ,  --  that business requiring some capital . They were obliged by a bond to keep the necessary cattle , laborers , &amp;c. , and to deliver to the agent the tythe of all metal snielted . The operation is performed in a very clumsy manner . A huge , thick stone wall is built , with recesses resembling chimneys . These are filled with oak logs , the interstices filled with small sticks , and the whole loaded with lead . The whole is then fired , and the metal drains off through a hole in the wall below . This business destroys the health of those employed in a year , or in two years at most . The climate is fine , and the inhabitants are healthy everywhere but in the bottoms , where intermittent fevers prevail . The smelters , on the contrary , from fatigue , watching , and inhaling the fumes of arsenic , soon fall victims to their dreadful trade . About a third of the metal is obtained from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then passed through what is called an ash furnace , after which the dross is thrown away . No capital nor even character was needed by a digger . Every shopkeeper was ready to furnish any man with tools and provisions , and trust to his success for payment . This systeni has , I am informed , been changed , and Trust is dead . The digger went forth and dug in one place till he was satisfied that there was no prospect of Success , and then tried another . I believe I may state as the average rate of success , that a digger found enough lead in the course of a year to // pay his debts and leave him something more than the wages of an ordinary laborer . There were some , who , in a very short time found fortunes , but these were very few . Nevertheless , the news of these prizes induced swarms to adventure eagerly in the lottery , in which there could indeed be no total blanks . Sometimes a digger labored a whole year without finding as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cases , most persevered , till a lucky chance made up their losses . The agents permitted very little timber to be cut . Consequently , agriculture was wholly neglected , and the settlers depended on the arrival of boats for food , as well as every thing else . The Indians seldom came near them . I believe that , when the Indian war broke out , the savages might easily have destroyed the diggers to a man , without any loss on their own part . They had only to scatter over the country on some fair day and throw stones into the several shafts , and the intruders must have perished miserably . This done , the shopkeepers , smelters , &amp;c. were too few to have offered much resistance . About one fourth of the settlers were foreigners , principally Irish . The rest , as classified by themselves , were Missourians , Suckers , and Pukes ;  --  the latter name implying natives of Kentucky . The Suckers were from Illinois , and so called because most of them , like the fish of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned in autumn . Here were seen the extremes of society . The scholar and gentleman were seen at the same table with the blacklegs and the half-horse half-alligator , vulgar , fierce , overbearing , and scarce farther advanced in civilization than the Winnebago , with whom he was like to contend for a home . There were very many shopkeepers and an abundant supply of quacks . As there was no code of law established , there were no attorneys , but as the country has been discovered to form a part of Illinois , it is to be presumed the evil has been remedied . Every man had a title , either Doctor , General , or Captain at the very least . At ordinaries and other places of assemblage , this caused much confusion . If any one cried , " Doctor , " or " General , " a dozen answered . I once observed a teamster in the street of Galena crying for assistance to extricate his wagon from the slough in which it was engulfed , and a person soon came to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frock , and armed to the teeth , with rifle , dirk , pistols and broadsword . Such a ruffianly looking kill-cow , I never saw before but once . He laid his rifle aside , put his shoulder to the wheel , while the owner of the vehicle directed him with such exhortations , as " A little forward , Gineral  --  a little backward , Ginerallift a leetle , Gineral , if you please . " On inquiry , I found the object of my attention was a bona fide Major-General of Militia , and had been a member of a western legislature . He went thus armed because he was at deadly feud with another person , and expected a meeting . Most of the buildings at Galena were shops , taverns , or boarding houses . Of the latter there were some respectable , and others where the landlord threw their portions across the table to his guests , and where the guests wiped their knives on the dogs that ran about and under the table . I saw few cases of actual drunkenness at Galena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first salutation to a visiter was the offer of a dram . // All difficulties were settled by arbitration necessarily ; now the miners may enjoy the luxury of a lawsuit . There was less quarreling than might have been expected where the bonds of the law were loosened . Strife often occurred , indeed , but it seldom went to the length of shooting or stabbing . Biting , gouging and fisticuff were the worst enormities of which I was an eye witness , and I only saw the two former operations performed in one instance . Altogether , though the tone of society was coarse , and most of the miners much given to " bullragging " or bullying , the Americans had a pride and sense of self-respect that made them tolerable , and savored of something sound at the core . Thus , though the lowest of them entered any house without knocking or doffing the hat , they were seldom , when sober , guilty of any downright incivility . A barefooted Irishman was addressed as " Sir , " or " St ranger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as " that gentleman . " They took fire immediately at a blunt address or any other want of courtesy , real or supposed . So great was their jealousy of their personal rights , that , in the Winnebago war , it was very difficult to drill them . I am convinced that this trait of character would have made them wholly useless on any emergency . Such is the Lead Mine district , and such are its inhabitants . The sketch will not be complete without a brief notice of their neighbors , the Saques and Foxes and the Winnebagoes . The Saques lived on the Fox river about a century since , where the Winnebagoes do now . They were in the habit of pillaging every trader who passed through their country , till the French governor of the Canadas sent a force to reduce them . They were beaten-almost exterminated at the Butte des Morts  --  but about a score of individuals escaped . The bones of the slain still cumber the field of battle . At the treaty before mentioned , the commissioners pointed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the fate awaiting those who might resist the United States . The few remaining Saques fled to the Mississippi and incorporated themselves with their relatives the Foxes . Since that time they have multiplied prodigiously , and the united tribes can bring upwards of a thousand warriors into the field . They are the only tribe of the Algonquin stock who dwell east of the Mississippi , and , by a strange coincidence , the Winnebagoes , who till l8S*9 dwelt opposite them , are the only tribe of Dahcotah origin on the eastern side of the great river . From a long inactivity the Saques and Foxes were taunted by their savage neighbors with cowardice , but unjustly , as will be seen . When the late war broke out , the governor of Missouri cut off the trade with them , for fear they should turn our own arms against us . This measure was equivalent to a declaration of war ; it deprived the united tribes of the means of existence . They obtained arms of the British traders , fought gallantly through the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . They took a gun-boat at the Rock river rapids , burned her to the water 's edge , slew every man on board , and sent her consort back to St. Louis , riddled with bullets , to show the governor the wisdom of his policy . Not to dwell on their exploits , the Saques and Foxes and Winnebagoes did the United States more damage dur. ing the war than all the rest of the Indians , collectively . At the close 29 // of the contest , the former obtained peace at the expense of a portion of their land , according to the laudable custom of our government in such cases . The Saques and Foxes have made some slight progress in civilization since the war . They have a distinction of property and live partly by agriculture . Their fate is sealed ; they possess a valuable territory , and must , therefore , soon move to Arkansas . The Winnebagoes are from the borders of Mexico , whence they were driven by the Spaniards . They are a proud , fierce race , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most eminently a part of their code . In former times , when the power of the United States did not extend to them , they visited the frontiers with a heavy hand , and made it a rule , when one of their race was slain , to bury at least five whites around his grave . A great many of them were at Tippecanoe , where they distinguished themselves above all others . They lost upwards of sixty of their best and bravest there , and have not yet forgiven us . In case of a war with Great-Britain , they would assuredly be found in the British ranks , as indeed would every tribe that has ever had dealings with us . They now live on the Fox river and the Mississippi , above the Wisconsin . At present the frontier is in no danger from them , for they know the strength of the United States , and their own weakness . But if an opportunity favorable to them should ever occur , they will remember the late treaty . The lands described in this article are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock river up that stream to the mouth of the Pokotanokee ; up that river to the mouth of Sugar river ; up Sugar river to the mouth of its extreme eastern branch ; up that branch to the point where it is crossed by the track leading from the Blue Mound to the Portage of the Wisconsin ; thence along that track through the Four Lakes to Duck creek ; up Duck creek to its source ; thence to Lake Apperquay , an expansion of the Fox river ; up Fox river to the Portage ; thence down the Wisconsin and the Mississippi back to the mouth of Rock river . All this tract , containing nearly seven millions of acres , now belongs to the United States , excepting certain reservations . One of these , a small one , was retained by the Winnebagoes . It was also stipulated that each half-breed of that tribe should have six hundred and forty acres , to be designated by the United States in any part of the tract " not supposed to contain lead ore . " The Winnebagoes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grossly overrated , made by individuals said to have suffered by them . The Pottawottamies also set up a claim to the tract on the ground of original occupancy , and were bought off by an offer of a rent of half a cent an acre to be paid during their existence as a ration . The late decision of the Supreme Court , that no Indian tribe is a nation , has made this stipulation a nullity , whenever it shall please the executive so to construe it .
