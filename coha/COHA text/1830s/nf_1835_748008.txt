txt /q/ sailor ; the subdued anxiety of the passenger ; the straining and groaning of the vessel ; the roaring and battling of the waters as they resisted our impetuous course ; were full of sublimity . At such a time , the snapping of a cord or the starting of a plank might have brought not merely disaster , but death . But the ocean , what shall be said of it ? When it rose in all its mightiness , and shut up our view , which was before illimitable , to a small span in the heavens ; when it stood around our little bark in unbroken mountains , as once it did around the Egyptians , threatening to ingulf us in an instant and for ever ; then I had an advanced and unutterable conception of Nature and of Omnipotence . In crossing our channels , and in running along our coasts , I had thought I knew what the sea was ; but I was then satisfied I had never seen it before . . I will not trouble you further with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-serpents . We were told that we saw some whales ; but I should fear to avouch it . Indeed , we were now beginning to look for the land , as decidedly the most interesting object . But while searching for it , calm and fog came on , and made us in turn fearful of the object of our anxious search . This pause to our hopes was hard to bear so near to our haven . Every wish was now directed to the pilot-boats ; and when at length one was discovered , like the wing of a bird through the opening mists , there was universal joy . We felt as if , on getting the pilot on board , we should make a decided movement towards our port . But the breeze was still faint and the fog heavy . Fogs , it is understood , prevail very much at this season of the year for many days ; and they arise from the sudden return of hot weather , which dissolves the ice , and produces immense evaporation . We moved slowly through the Narrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening off Staten Island , and about six miles from the city . In the morning we quitted our vessel for a steamboat . The mists were still heavy , and veiled ( Bvery thing from sight ; we lost , therefore , for the pies- /z/ ent , the view of the bay , which is admitted to be exceed ' * ingly good . This , with a new world before us , was but a slight disappointment . About ten o'clock I sprang on the landing at New- York , and realized the presence of a country which had long dwelt as a picture of interest and of hope in my imagination . ' We made the best of our way to Bunker 's Hotel . Our first inquiry was for single-bedded rooms , as we understood that to be the only matter of doubt . They were readily obtained ; and a black servant was com-* missioned to conduct us to them . After dressing , our first concern was , to use our retirement in acknowledging the Hand which had conducted us safely over the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now that we were strangers in a strange land . Before we retired to our rooms , we had expressed a wish for some refreshment ; and I expected , on coming down , to see a little breakfast-table set for us . Nothing of this sort was , however , visible . I went into the barroom , and looked at the papers , still waiting for a summons to the anticipated refreshinent . At last I approached to the bar , and ventured to ask for it . The master of the ceremonies , without speaking , placed a small basket of biscuits and a plate of cheese before us as we stood . We were amused , as well as disappointed ; and , as we seemed to be without choice , we partook of the supply that was offered . We thought , at least , that the little set-out had been for us ; but while we were busy with it , two or three gentlemen came up , and , without permission , or without seeking a separate knife or plate , claimed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass was literally supplied , and the decanter restored to its place . When our repast was over , we still waited in the bar-room , and must have shown some of the awkwardness of strangers . At length our host was conscious of this , and came with an apology for having forgotten to show us to a sitting-room . We were tiien introduced to a handsome withdrawing-roem , which open to other residents at the hotel . /q/ While I give you this incident as illustrative of ners , you are not to suppose that the other arrangementa of the house were on a level with this : tliey were excellent . But the case was , our appetite was out of time . The breakfast hour was past , and the dinner hour was not come ; and the American inn , while it provides bountifully for periodical hunger , has no compassion for a disorderly appetite . There is one hour , one table , one meal , one summons ; and if you are ready , you may fare very well ; if you miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . It was interesting to see how readily the American , with his love of freedom , submitted to these restraints , while John Bull insists on naming his own dinner , at his own table , at his own time , and in his own room . He has certainly more independence in his habits , if not in hit opinioruj than his transatlantic brethren . After disposing of our snack and our host , we naturally desired to see something of the world around us . We walked up the Broadway . It is every way the principal street : its width is about that of Piccadilly , and its length about two miles and a half . It meets the eye well . The straight line it offers to the sight is relieved in some measure by the fohage of trees and the towers of churches , while it conveys to the imagination a sense of magnitude and importance beyond the reality . My first impressions from the objects were such as these . The habitations , from frequently having the Venetian oi other shutters closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me painfully , as though death had entered them . The ordinary signs of health could not be so prevalent as With us ; for I was continually saying to myself , How ill that man looks . The shops are not at all ; they are Parisian ; indeed , nowhere but in England can you meet with that shop-front which is so indicative of wealth , of the security of property* and of tact for catching the eye of the hasty passenger . The ladies , who were using the Broadway as a promenade strmck me as of less stature than oors . Those who /z/ piiMl to fashion , used Parisian dresses ; and they had a mindlljff tread , which was meant to be Parisian , but is certainly not so ; it is affectation , and therefore disagreeable . /z/ NewTork is the counterpart of Liverpool ; they have grown remarkably together . At no very distant period , they both bad some 5,000 inhabitants ; they have ad vanced ahnost thousand by thousand , and are now nearly equal in population . In point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the water , and , by its various elevation , presents more picture to the eye ; while for water conveyance , and the mere purposes of business , the advantage is with New- York . It stands on a plane only sufficiently inclined to ensure a good drainage , and of course supplies great facilities for e transit of goods . At present , Liverpool does by far the greatest amount of business ; but , because New- York has more home trade , there is with it a greater show of mercantile activity and life . This city is really worthy of the reputation she has for the frequency of the fires . There were six to my knowledge in ten days . They appear to arise partly from wood being the common fuel , which is less safe than coal ; and partly from flues being carried through framebuildings , which is very hazardous . Some , however , as with ourselves , are intentional ; persons of bad principle and embarrassed circumstances abuse the benefit of ensurance , and seek to save themselves by fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , we were kindly waited on by Drs . Cox and Peters , and the Rev. W. Patton . They came as a deputation from the Third Presbytery , which was then in session . They stated that they were instructed to invite us to attend its sittings , and to accept of accommodations which had been made in Mr. Patton 's family in expectation of our arrival . We accepted the invitations in the spirit in which they were given ; and were refreshed by intercourse with brethren whom we had kDovm and esteemed in the Father Land . /q/ /z/ Mt dear Friend , On the following day , according to the previous arrangement , we changed our habitation , and did honour to the invitation of the Presbytery . There were about thirty persons present . We were received by the Moderator , in the name of the body , with affectionate respect . We were glad to observe their methods of business . They are similar to those with which we are familiar in our committee meetings . Several subjects were discussed and disposed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the afternoon a young man was on trial for his license . His examination at this sitting was theological . He read a theme which discovered fair talent and true piety . It was pretty closely discussed . I could see that the examiners were not quite agreed among themselves . This circumstance gave an unnatural perplexity to the subject , as well as to the person examined . He obtained , however , the favourable suffrage of his brethren . We had declined all application for ministerial service on the Sabbath after ourarrival . I had suffered so much in the voyage as to leave me unfit for it ; and besides , I was anxious to improve an occasion for hearing , which I foresaw it would be more difficult to secure as our stay advanced . On the morning of the day we tended at Laight-street Church , and united in the thanksgiving and prayers which Dr. Cox affectionately offered on our account . It was an affecting thing , after traversing the great deep , to commit one 's self for the first time to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of God ; and it was the more affecting from the strong resemblance it has to what we most enjoy at home . The order of service , the singing , the hymns , the tunes /z/ the sennon , the devout aspect of the congregation , were as our own . It brought one directly into a state of fel ' lowship ; it destroyed the sense of distance , and disposed feelingly to say , ** No more a stranger or a guest , But like a child at home . ' * In the evening of the day we went to the opening of a free church . Of the nature of this class of provision for the religious wants of the people , I shall have occasion to speak in anol ; her connexion . It was to be opened by a protracted meeting , running through the week ; and Mr. K. , an active revivalist preacher , was to take the service . We had reason to expect , that , at such a time , he would try the eflt of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all taste ; but it was large , and apparently well built . The groundfloor was fitted up for schools : the superior floor was the area of the church ; and although this was at an elevation of some twenty steps , there were above it two tiers of galleries , and these running along three sides of the place . It would accommodate 2000 persons ; and I suppose 1500 might be in it . The service was good ; the sermon very good . I - had been led to think that I might hear some statements which might be deemed extravagant ; but there was in this exercise nothing of the kind . The preacher was evidently pious and truly in earnest : his statements were plain and scriptural : his appeals were popular , appropriate , and direct to the conscience and the heart . The impression was strong and general on the people . When the sermon would have closed with us , I obeerved that the preacher was giving his remarks a new direction ; and I was speedily led to*conclude , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to justify the measure , and then to challenge the people to use it , as a means and expression of religious decision . The persons occupying the two seats immediately before the pulpit were requested to vacate them , that the anx- /z/ /q/ ioU8 might use them . Then a pause occurred . Two or three females , by degrees , appeared on the end of the seat . The preacher , with some of the awkwardness disappointment upon him , renewed his address ; and xirged the young persons , and especially the young men , to decision , and to this mode of expressing it . Another pause was made ; but no young men came . Dr. L. , the minister of the church , renewed the appeal ; and employed rests in different parts of it , as if waiting for signs of compliance ; and when he saw that no greater effect was likely to follow , he changed the terms of the invitation , and begged all those who wished to be prayed for to come forward . He then gave out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congregation began to disperse ; and many serious persons , as might be expected , went before the pulpit to join in the proposed act of prayer . It was by this time neacly ten o'clock , and we left with the congregation . This , then , was the first occasion on which I saw the anxious seat employed ; and if emplojred I can hardly conceive of its being with less extravagance or iQore sagacity ; but it was certainly a failure . Without deciding here on the abstract merits of this measure , its adoption in this instance was assuredly bad . The sermon had shed seriousness over the congregation , and had produced tenderness on many ; and had they been allowed to retire at a suitable hour for reflection in their closets , one could not avoid hoping that the effect would have been most happy . As it was , I had deep regret . When it was felt , indeed , by the people , that the seat was to be used , there was a sensible excitement produced , which the novice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could perceive that a large portion of the*eople were excited to see how others would act in this crisis , and were thus relieved from thinking of themselves ; while another portion , composed of such as had been affected by the discourse , feared that they should be overcome by the alarming appeals usual to such occasions , and by diverting their attention , stop-s ' /z/ ping their ears , or a suppressed shuddering , told you that they were hardening themselves into resistance as well as they could . But I must offer a different picture to your attention . You are aware that the time of our arrival in New- York was one of great excitement . Without indulging in political opinion , it may be understood that this excitement was created by some decided measures recently adopted by the Government relative to'the National Bank . Those measures , whether good or ill in their issue , bad so shaken public credit , that two hundred and fifty mercantile houses were prostrate in insolvency , and their vibrations were felt in the remote parts of Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proposed to make a matter of local and limited interest the test of opinion on the policy of the General Government . The polling for the city elections is taken in the different wards , and it usually occurs not only without danger to the peace , but without interruption to business . On this occasion , however , there was a riot in one of the wards . The losing party , with its other losses , as is . usual , lost its temper ; and when it could not succeed in obtaining votes , set itself to breaking heads . Some twenty persons were seriously hurt in the affray . A slight show of military power prevented farther evil . If these things were to happen , I was not sorry to see them , as they throw up national character ; but the good citizens were greatly scandalized that such scenes should disgrace them as had never happened , they said , in the republic before . The Whigs , as the friends of the Bank strangely called themselves , although they had not the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they were resolved on a Whig celebration , padily accepted a ticket of admission , as it enlarged myxoid of observation . I must endeavour to place it before you . The place of celebration was the Battery ; and the manner was by a collation and speeches . The Battery stands on a slip of open ground at the end of the Broadway and butting on the Hudson river . It is now dismantled ; /q/ not being used for purposes of defence , but for those of recreation and amusement . When we arrived many thousand persons were assembled within and without ; and it was after delay , and with difficulty , that we succeeded in making an entrance . We ascended to the bulwarks , which are built in a circle , and are usually a promenade , but which were now fitted up with a gallery of seats , and filled with spectators . We looked on a circular area of large dimensions , which was also crowded with people . Opposite us was the port by which we entered , and over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on duty here . On the roofing , parapets , and abutments , were flags , wooden guns , and a rigged vessel surmounting painted waves . This dumb show was animated by a number of spectators , whose ambition could be satisfied with nothing less than the highest point ; but their presence gave a ludicrous air to the whole , as there appeared to be men sitting in the ocean , and upholding a vessel which should have held them . A balcony was prepared before the windows of the rooms I have named , for the speakers ; a band of music was beneath , to fill in the pauses ; colours were displayed in all directions , and were floating gracefully over the many-headed multitude . Immediately over us , and opposite the rostrum , was the national flag , with its dark blue field and brilliant constellation of twenty-foui stars ; and above it , that all the decorations might not be void of reality , was a living eagle , placed on a perch , and fastened by the leg , as the emblem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular engagements ; but the good people were by no means idle . The Americansho are quick to dine , had finished their refreshments . Many were evidently ready to attend to such addresses as might be made ; but many also , who had sat down to eat , rose up to play . These were giving themselves to all manner of practical jokes . Hats and the remnants of bread were flying about ; ladders were made of human shoulders to convey water , jKui /z/ glasses , and bread , from those ui the area to those in the galleries ; while in the centre of the picture a far more earnest group were surrounding and surmounting some barrels of beer , th &; contents of which they were exhausting with alarming speed . A cry was made for silence and attention . The* music stopped ; but the multitude seemed little jdisposed to listen . A carman , with his frock on , came to the balcony . The fellow-feehng which the more noisy had with him disposed them to attention . That claims of persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was one of the best of his class . He had the good sense to make a short speech ; and he uttered himself with plan sense , stout honesty , and especially with decision on the Whig side of the question . Trade , and of course , carts and wagons , had a vital interest i it . When he finished , hurrahs rang round the bulwarks , and ascended into the air ; and that nothing might be wanting to the scene , the man who had the care of the eagle twitched the string , and made the bird flap its wings over the assembly . But heroics did not long suit them ; they eagerly returned to gossip , of to sport , or to the barrels in the centre of the court , which were still rising in popular favour . Another call was made , and one of their orators came forward . He had no doubt claims on them , from his zeal in the cause , but he could have little to oratory , or . . the people would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice ; but in vain . Those at the windows and beneath him gazed and shouted ; but his words died in his own atmosphere , and could not subdue the conflicting sounds in the distance . This gave a new character to the picture . Speech-maMng and sport , the grave and the gay , were so mixed ami opposed , as to make the whole , to an eye like Hogarth 's , exceedingly amusing and comical ; while the numbers of the meeting , the beauty of the thronged amphitheatre , opening only into the bright bhie heavens , saved it from the trivial , and made it interesting and delightful I observed it for /z/ /q/ some time ; and then , as the more respectable portion of the assembly was moving oiT , I prepared to leave with it . I soon found myself moving with a body which had become processional , walking in order , and three or four abreast . It was understood that the celebrated Daniel Webster was at a house in the neighbourhood , and the procession moved in that direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheered him . He advanced to the window . He could not have been heard in a speech , and therefore contented himself with bowing , and throwing out at the top of his voice a fev short sentences as watchwords to the party . They received them with hurrahs , and passed on in order . The procession must have been quite a mile in length . As this was the first , so it was the largest assemblage or this interesting people , which I witnessed while in the States . There was less of dignity and gravity about it than I had been led to expect from so grave a people ; and there was more of English animation , humour , and audible expression of opinion , than I looked for , and more , certainly , than is usual . It is , however , to be remembered , that this was not a deliberative , but a commemorative occasion ; and there was no crisis directly before them to point the speeches or to quicken the attention . On the whole , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw not a smgle person intoxicated ; nor did I hear afterward of a single squabble , or of a pocke spoiled of its contents . It is remarkable , too , and indicative of a great sense of feminine propriety , that I saw not within or about the place a single female . It was feared that the meeting might provoke the Tories to come and create a disturbance ; but they were satisfied with the mischief they had already done , and remained quiet at the West End of the town . The evening of this celebration day was spent at Mr. T. 's . I wish it accorded with my plan to give you a sketch of the party which we had the gratification of meeting . Suffice it to say , that though it was composed /z/ of the friends of temperance , there was no want of elegant refreshments ; that though composed of religious persons , it was cheerful and refined ; that though composed of the two sexes , there was no want of ease in the intercourse or variety in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no lack of good-breeding or benevolent attentions . In fact , that it was the reverse of every thing lately held up to ridicule under the denomination of " domestic manners , " and equal to any thing to be found , of its own grade , in the parent country . LETTER m . Mt dear Friend , I MUST now take you with me to Washington , without pausing to expatiate on the Hudson , or Philadelphia , or Baltimore , in our way . A more favourable opportunity will occur for a brief notice of them . Among the advantages of our speedy passage was the redemption of time ; and of the time so redeemed I was anxious to make the best possible use . It appeared to us that no appropriation of spare time could be better than that of employing it for a visit to the capital , and the Congress which was then sitting ; since it would not be possible to have a well-balanced opinion of the country we were visiting , in total ignorance of the character and proceedings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance . The first two days we travelled by steamboat , or rail-road , and very pleasantly . The last day was mostly consU " * med in going from Baltimore to Washington ; we were nearly seven hours in going less than forty miles , and sometimes with six horses . The road , though the highway to the capital , was exceedingly bad ; in many parts /z/ /q/ it was several inches deep in dust and sand , and in others it was clogged with loose stones as big as our paving-stones . No excuse could be offered for this , except that they were constructing a rail-road , and so were disposed to consign it to premature ruin . This was the first time of using their stagecoach , and it calls for notice . It is very like the singk-bodied coach which you have seen in France . It is heavy and strong , to meet the condition of the roads . It carnee Bd outside passengers ; but it has three seats within and each seat receives three persons . To atone for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the elbow upwards , and the roof takes the appearance of canopy . If you wish to be endosed , there are lUding shutters , partially glazed , to tiie doors , tend leather eartains for the other openings ; a proviiioirthat may do Yery well in the summer , but which moet be far from ooovfortable in the really cold weather . When we took our seats the vehicle was not full : and as the day was very hot , we hoped not to be crowded ; but before we had cleared the skirts of the town , three men , rough and large , sought admittance . Myself and an elderly lady occupied the back seat , and the stoutest of the three directed his movements towards us . We retired into our corners , and left him what room we could in the middle He showed some desire for the outer seats ; but this was not regarded , and he took his place I soon saw that he had the abominable habit of chewing the " noisome weed , " and began to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon began to look about him for relief . He looked on my side ; I sat forward and looked very grave ; he looked on the lady , and regarding her as the weaker sex , he put his head forward and spat across her face into the road . Nobody , not even the lady , seemed surprised at this , though she must have been annoyed . It was so often repeated as to induce her to change seats with him ; and T fear it must be said that the annoyance was the more readily renewed in the hope of such an issue . /z/ On the whole , it was an unpleasant ride . The countiy was not interesting ; and , what with the heat of the day , the dust of the road , the crowded state of the coach , and our slow progress , we were rendered weary and unwell . We were glad to be set down at Gadsby 's Hotel , which is very large , has good accommodations , and would be all you could desire if somewhat cleaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Potomac . The plan of the . city is magnificent ; it is laid down in right lines , answering to the cardinal points of the compass , and these are intersected by diagonal lines to prevent a tiresome uniformity of aspect . It is a city that is to be , however ; and is never Ukely to become what was intended , as its distance from the sea , and other disad- /z/ vantages , deny it the benefits of commerce . While it is waiting to be something better , it appears less than it is . It is computed to have a population of 30,000 persons ; but from the width of the streets , with the comparative meanness of the buildings , and from the scattered and unfinished state of every thing , you would think 10,000 the utmost amount . There is , too , a want of timber about here , which gives a nakedness to the picture that does not please you , and leaves you in doubt whether it is a city shrinking from its dimensions into ruin , or ascending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance are the President 's house and the Capitol and thesare connected by an avenue some 120 feet wide , and about a mile and a half long , which would , indeed , be fine , if it were sustained by a fine growth of timber , or fine Unes of habitations . We were quickly found out by Mr. Post , the excellent minister of the first Presbyterian church , and he insisted on our removing to his dwelling ; urging that it was against usage in America to allow clergymen to stay at an inn . We met his kindness with returning confidence , and passed several days in his family - days to which my memory will always revert with pleasure . Our first concern was to visit the Capitol , and become acquainted with the Congress , and our friend was anxious to secure to us every advantage . The Chamber of Representatives is always regarded as the chief object of sight . It is indeed highly imposing . It is a very large room , with its roof sustained by twenty-four fine marble columns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raised and canopied seat in the centre of the straight line , with more glitter about it than you would find about ' the British throne ; and the desks and seats of the members diverge from it in radiating lines . A gallery runs behind the pillars , through the course of the half circle . The general impression was not on the whole pleasing . Less than one third of the place was occupied ; and the empty space and large proportions of Vol . I. - B 3 /z/ the room give a diminutiveness and insignificance to the persons present . There was not much of interest in this house at the f time . But I heard one speech that was certainly long , and that was considered to be good . The speaker rose from his desk ; his speech lay written before him ; he dehvered it however , without much reference to the document , and with a strong voice and energetic manner . But it was all a forced effort , and of necessity it was such . No one listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen . It was understood by both parties that he was using the house as a medium of speech to his constituents across the Alleganies ) and they seemed content to have it so . It is in this way that the floor is occupied here for two or more days together ; and that the most important business of the Slate is postponed or neglected , while the house is afflicted with speeches which none will hear , and which are ment to be pamphlets that , with few exceptions none will read . The celebrated Colonel Crockett made an advance on this vicious usage , and it would be a great relief if his proposal were acted on . It is said he rose and claimed the notice of the chair , and stated that he had many times tried to obtain the floor , but had been so unfortuiate as not to succeed ; that he was now leaving to visit his constituents ; and as he could not then deliver his speech , he begged to know whether he might publish it as a speech intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncandid , however , in the coloneVs case , as to think this was a mere trick ; and that he wanted to impress the public with a belief that he had sought an opportunity to make an important speech , but had not been able to find it , when in fact he had no such speech to dehver . The Senate Chamber is of far less size , and of no pretensions ; but it is weU adapted to its uses , and therefore gives the eye satisfaction . All the interest , too , at this time , was here . The larger house had agreed to /q/ sustain the President in his measures against the Bank ; but in the Senate , some strong resolutions had been adopted against them . The President sent down a proterst on the subject , and the excitement was raised to the highest . The occasion called up all their best speakers ; and if they spoke with less preparatfem , they spoke under those present impulses which throw out a mans best thoughts in hid best manner . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aware what confusion will arise among , shrewd men , by the action of strong party prejudices and sudden excitation , it would have been conclude wihat this deliberative body had very small knowledge of the laws of debate . The discussion soon turned from the principal subject to a point of order , and strange to say , it was two days in disposing of this point of order . The party opposed to the protest proposed some resolutions to the effect that the protest be not received , and for reasons contained in the protest . Their object was to prevent the protest being entered on the records ; but their resolutions made it necessary . The other party saw this error , and proposed , as an amendment , that the word not be omitted , and for reasons contained in the protest ; so that which ever way they dealt with it , they would do what the objecting party wished to avoid - place the protest on the minutes . None of them could see their way out of this ! They contended that thei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that no amendment could be proposed which was a contradiction to the original proposition : they applied to the chair ; they applied from the chair to the senate ; and from the senate back again to the chair ; till they , were more than thrice confounded . The Senate is now unusually rich in distinguished men . In this , and some following discussions , we heard most of them : Clay , Webster , Calhoun , Clayton , Leighi Ewing , Frelinghuysen , and Forsyth . I should like to give you . a sketch of these men , as they dwell in my memory , but opportunity fails me ; and perhaps I might /z/ do them some injustice if I attempted any thing more than general impression , from such slight opportunities of knowing them . Suffice it to say , Clay 's strength is in popular address ; Webster 's , in cool argument ; Calhoun 's , in his imagination , and his weakness too ; Frelinghuysen 's , in his truly Christian character ; Swing 's , in his stout honesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , in his vanity - Kiertainly , in my eye , the very image of self-complacency . On the whole , I was much gratified in becoming acquainted with the Congress of this great empire . Yet I must candidly admit , that it fell somewhat below my expectations . In its presence I was not impressed , as I think I should have been in the presence of the men who signed the Declaration ; and my eye wandered over the assembly , anxiously seeking another Washington , who , by his morai worth , mental sagacity , and unquestionable patriotism , should , in a second crisis , become the confidence and salvation of his country ; but it wandered in vain . Such a one might have been there ; the occasion might bring out many such ; but I failed to receive such an impression . Nor do I think , on the whole , that the representation is worthy of the people . It.has less of a reUgious character than you would expect from so religious a people ; and it has also leas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . But as matters stand , it is now only a sacrifice for the thriving man to be a member of Congress ; while , to the needy man , it is a strong temptation . In this state of things , it is not wonderful that the less worthy person should labour hard to gain an election ; or that , when it is gained , he should consider his own interests rather than those of his constituents . The good Americans must look to this , and not . suffer themselves to be absorbed in the farm aid merchandise ; lest , on an emergency , they should be surprised to find their fine country , and all its fine prospects , in the hands of a few aipbitious and ill-principled demagogues . It was pleasing to find that a number of the members president 's house . 29 were fonned into a Temperance Society ; and that a smaller number were accustomed to meet weekly for religious exercises . Many of the elder members too , whose minds are certainly not under a religious influence , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that religion is essential to the stability of their institutions . This is salutary . Before leaving the Capitol , do you expect that I should sketch it ? It stands on a swell of land , which is so abrupt on one side as to have the effect of being artificial . The inclination should be made far less acute . The erection is of very large dimensions , approaching , though still very distant , to our St. Paul 's . It is compos'ed of two wings and a centre ; and the centre is graced with steps , portico , and dome . The columns of the portico are too slender ; and they are made to look more so , from the oppressive flights of steps which lead to them . The smaller domes and semicircular hghts in the roof , are disights which might readily be avoided . It is , however , with these and other . faults , a grand building , and everywhere in the distance has a very striking effect . There is , in its principal front , a monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthy of Italy , but of America . Were the names not on it , it would say nothing ; and , worse than all , it stands in a basin of water . The President 's house is the reverse of the Capitol ; and the two places might be supposed to indicate the genius of the people . It has no pretensions ; but is a plain erection in the Grecian style ; and , in size and aspect , resembles greatly the modern dwelling of our country gentleman . It is , however , not unsuitable to the claims of Washington , and the other provisions made for the chief magistrate by the constitution . . Our kind friends had taken care to supply us with many letters of introduction for Washington , and among them was one for the President . If we had intended , we had no occasion to use it . An intimation was made by one of the household that the President would have /z/ k. /z/ pleasure in receiring a call from us . It was of course accepted . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ' iih us . We were received with respect , but without formality . The President is tall ; full six feet in height* He stoops now , and is evidently feeble* The thermometer was at but he was near a strong fire . He is sixty-eight years of age . He is soldier-like and gentlemanly in his carriage ; his manners were courteous and simple , and put us immediately at ease with him . He conversed freely ; chiefly of the older country , as interesting to us . He expressed pleasure at the growing intercourse between the countries ; at the arrival of ourselves as a deputation in evidence of this ; and at the prospect there was of continued peace . He spoke of the Banking question also without reserve . He thought there was a resemblance between the state of the moneyed interest in America , and its state with us in 1825 , and was desirous of information . We conversed of it freely , and . for some time . Without judging his opinions , with which , as they are political , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression was , that he held them with a strong conviction that they were right , and beneficial for the country . After remaining about half an hour , we took our leave , with very pleasant recollections of our interview . Some days afterward we received an invitation to dine with the President . By this time the excitement on the Bank question had risen very high ; and it was reported that his dwelling was guarded by troops , from fear of assault on his person . Instead of which there was less of form than before . When we arrived , the entrance-doors were open ; and on being conducted , by a single servant , to what we thought an ante-room , we found the general himself waiting to receive us . We were soon led into the dining-room . The table was laid Only for six persons ; and it was meant to show us respect , by receiving us alone . Mr. Post , whom the President regards as his minister , was requested to implore a blessing . Four men were in attendance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended well . Every thing was good and sufficient ; nothing overcharged . It was a moderate and elegant repast . After dinner , we retired to the drawing-room . Conversation was there renewed ; and by the general on the Bank affairs . It was a delicate subject ; we passed from it to other interests of the new country . On leaving , the President inquired of our route ; and when he found that I was designing to travel into the west , very obligingly pressed me , if I should visit Tennessee , to tarry at the Hermitage , the name of his estate in that country , and to which he retires in the summer . The President regularly attends on public worship at Mr. Post 's , when he is well . On the following Sabbath morning I was engaged to preach . Himself and some fifty or sixty of the CongroM were present . His manner was very attentive and serious . When the service had ended , I was a little curious to see how he would be noticed . I supposed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out first , and - that a few respectful inclinations of the head would be offered . - But no ; he was not . noticed at all ; he had to move out , and take ' his turn like any other person , and there was nothing at any time to indicate the presence of the chief magistrate . You might be disposed to refer this to the spirit of their institutions ; but it has a closer connexion with the character of the people . They have , in most of the States , less titude to give expression to their sentiments than the English . When afterward the general was passing through Lexington , on his way home , where a strong feeling existed on the part of the merchants against him , I inquired if any marks of disapprobation were offered to him . The reply was , " O no , we merely Icept out of his way , and allowed him to change horses , and go on without notice . " I think it may be safely said that John Bull would have acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have offered some decided marks of respect ; and in the other , he would not have been backward to show that he was offeoded. /z/ It was at Waflhington we first saw the slave-pen. it is usually a sort of wooden shed , whitewashed , and attached to the residence Of a slave-dealer . Slaves are bought up here , as aft other places , to forward to the south : the gain is considerable , and the inducement in proportion . ' The slaves have great horror of this . One poor woman , who was expecting to be thus transferred , lately escaped ; and on being pu ; rsued , she jumped over the bridge , choosing death rather than such a life . But I shaU bve other opportunities for this subject : let it be ' sufficient to remark , that here these enormities are the more flagrant , as they are acted under the eye of the Capitol , a capitol ' for ever echoing with " Rights of man , " The essential equality of man , " and a thousand such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coloured people who are free ; and they appear to thrive . They attend in large numbers to worship , and have lately purchased the place in which Mr. Post 's congregation did formerly assemble . I attended on one occasion : it was full , and they were veiy serious . They are Episcopal Methodists ; their bishop was with them , and they were holding a conference . It was a high time . It was remarkable to have a white person among them . On leaving , they were happy to be spoken to and free to converse . ' I also was happy to realize that they held with us a common and the common hope of salvation . While at Washington , I first witnessed the windstorm , which is common in this country . It is peculiar - sometimes awfuL The morning had been hot , and the sky fair ; I had been to the Senate , and was now resting and writing in my chamber . Quietly the soft and refreshing breezes went down ; a haze came over the sun , 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , was stilled , except that of the frog , which was unpleas- I antly audible . The sky got silently darker and darker ; i the atmosphere became oppressive ; and not a breath of air was felt . Suddenly , in the distance , you would see things in commotion ; uid , while every thing was yet /z/ quiet about you , you might hear the distant roaring of the wind . Then the cattle run away to their best shelter ; then the mother calls in her heedless children ; and the housewife flies from story to stoiy to close her windows and shutters against the entrance of the coming foe . Now the dust , - taken up in whirlwinds , would come flying along the roads ; and then would come the rush of wind , which would make every thing tremble , and set the doors , windows , and trees flying , creaking , and crashing around you . You would expect the torrent to fall and the thunder to roll ; but no , there was neither rain nor thunder there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wanted nothing to increase its power on the imagination . It raged for a few minutes , and then passed as suddenly away , leaving earth and sky as tranquil and as fair as it found them . It is not easy to account for this very sudden destruction and restoration of an equilibrium in nature . The phenomenon , however , suppUes a fine illustration of some striking passages in hdly Scripture . We spent one day with Dr. Laurie before we left the city . He is a Scotchman , and happy to commune with any from the parent land . He has been many years here , in the Presbyterian church , and holds an office under government ; but he has lost none ' of his nationality . He was kind enough to take us to Georgetown . Here is a Catholic seminary of some celebrity : it is a great help to the CathoUc interest , and is nourished from Europe . It is said that the bishop of the district has lately received , 000 dollars from the pope . We paused to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing an amiable fkmily ; of seeing a nice cottage , in somewhat ESiglish style , situated on a beautiful estate , commanding fine views of the river and of the city . We afterward rode over the heights ; and I was thankful to our friend for this excursion , as , without we should not have formed so just an opinion of Washington and its vicinity . We could not quit this neighbourhood without visiting Mount Vernon , the place wlere . ishington /z/ and died , and is entombed . We left early in the morning , with Mr. Post , by steamboat to Alexandria . This town is on the margin of the river . It presents what is , in this country , an unusual spectacle of a place in a state of declension . It had a population of 10,000 persons , but it has now not more than 7,000 , and there is ' an air of desolation on it . We engaged a carriage here to take us to Vernon , a distance of nine miles ; and we were two hours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a fine spring morning ; the hill-sides were pretty ; most of our way was through the forest , and the woodlands ' were bursting into life . We were not sorry to feel that we were getting out of the world ; and were much dehghted with the number of wildflowers* which were expanding to the sun . The groundhoneysuckle , and the brilliant dogwood , especially engaged us . About a mile and a half before you reach ' the house , we entered the estate . It is iQ fact a continuation of the forest ; as jild , as quiet , and as beautiful . We were received by a black servant , old and worn out in the service of the family . We presented our cards , and the servant was instructed to attend us over the grounds . We walked quietly round . They assorted with our feelings . Every thing had an appearance of desertion and decay . No hand of repair had seemed to have passed over the cottage , the garden , the plantations . We were about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except only yegetation , and that had been allowed to grow so thick and high , as p throw heavy shadows and quiet solemnity on all things . At length we descended a bank and stood before the tomb of Washington . It is built of brick , with , an iron door . All , except the face of the vault , is hidden ; it is grrown over wilk dwarf cedar and forest-trees . I can not tell you my emotions . I chiefly longed for hours to rest there in silence and solitude . We went to the cottage . The interior was in harmony with all the external appearances . We were re- /z/ ceived in the library ; it was just as the general had left it . We saw the curiosities : they were just where he had placed them . The inmates , too , were affectingly in keeping . Three females : a widow , an orphan , and an unprotected sister . And they moved and spoke as if the catastrophe had just happened , and they had dried up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . I have had more pleasure and more melancholy ; biit I never had more of the pleasure of melancholy . Mrs. Jane Washington was indisposed ; but she sent us kind messages as to Englishmen , and some small remembrances of the place and the departed . We wound our way quietly from the cottage , and we soon left the domain , perhaps for ever , which was once dignified by the presence , and which is still sacred by the remains of Washington - /z/ THE BRAVE , THE WISE , TilE GOOD . ' /z/ fear ; and CONFIDENT , WITHOUT PRESUMPTION : /z/ THE FATHER OF NATIONS , THii FRIEND OF MANKIND ; /z/ Forgive me , my dear friend , this ebullition . I never /z/ can turn to the name of Washington without enthusiasm . But I will glance at a more sober and worldly view of the case . It is said the goTemment made an offer to purchase the property of the family . How could they make such an offer ! How noble it was in the family to decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they are in confined circumstances ! Again : How can the people suffer the place to pass to ruin , and the remnants of the family to exist without the means of sustaining it ? Surely , if the people of America really knew the state of the case , they would rather sell NewYork than suffer such things to happen . /z/ Mt dear Friknd , Wb remained nine days at the capital ; and might have remained longer to advantage , but the meetings at New-* York were coming on , and it was needful to hasten thither . I looked to these meetings with something more of confidence and pleasure now , as my strength was considerably recruited ; although I was still suffering from cold and partial loss of voice . This cold was brought on by one of those sudden changes of temperature to which this climate is subject . On the previous day to our arrival at Washington , the glass was at and the day before we quitted it , it was at ; and we were shivering with cold , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of May , it wajs colder still ; we had severe frosts , which cut off all the fruit ; and snow fell in abundance in the State of New- York . On returning to the place which we considered our home , we were received into the family of Mr. Boorman , of Washington Square ; an arrangement kindly suggested by Dr. Cos , and none could have afforded us more real feomfort. /q/ We found ourselves fully engaged for the following Sabbath , the 4tb of Maj ; but in consequence of the af fection of voice from which I- still sufiered , I could in the issue onlj- answer for a portion of my engagements . I was fixed to in the evening at the consecration of a new church in Brooklyn . What is called th oonse* cration of a church among the Presbyterians is only what we should call an opening ; and as , at this opening , a collection was to be made , I was very unwilling to disappoint them . The occasion was an interesting one . The church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a revived state of religion in the place . It cost 80,000 dollars , and would accommodate 1,300 persons . It was very full . As the week of anniversaries opened , there were decided marks of activity and engagement in the religious community . Previously , too , a wise regard is had to method and accommodation . The pastors give notice to their congregations , that those persons who are desirous to entertain one or more ministers during the meeting , may communicate their intentions either to himself or some elder appointed for that service . A counter-notice is inserted in the newspapers , to inform the ministers visiting at the time , that accommodation will be provided ; and directing them where to apply . At the place of reference an entry is made of all the friends who are prepared to accommodate ; and the names of the applicants are filled in as they apply . The whole of this arrangement is effected on Christian principle , and it is on that account effectual . Of course , a respect is had to the requests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn that a minister ever failed of acconunpdation because he was either poor or imknown ; nor could I find that , whatever might be the numbers , any suffered disappointment . There- must have been firom 300 to 400 ministers at this time in New- York ; but I believe none were necessitated to sojourn at the hotel or the lodginghouse . To also the attendance of strangers and the /z/ eHnniiuiitr generally , a small map Ut p ) repared of that portion ef the cit j which is to be the - tbeatre of pious interest and activity ; and cards are printed containing , a table of the meetings , i insert a copy of one ; which , although it does not embrace the meetings of Baptists , Methodists , or Episcopalians , will show that the wek is by no means ui idle one . /z/ ** ANNiTsaBAET WiiK. - Ths foOowing Is a complete list of the meetings for the Amuyersary Week , for ss we hsve been able to ascertain : - " Monday , May 5. &#9632; **Amibican Sbamsn 's Fbibnd Socibtt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ** Ambbican AAti-Slatbbt Socibtt ; meeting of Delegates at Society 's rooms , 130 Nassau-street , 4 p. m. - " Tuesday , ' May 6 .

" - ' Had I leisure , it woali not be desirable that I should attempt to describe all these fneetings : for they are very similar to eaxih other , and indeed very like our own : but I will endeaTOur to place one before you as a sample of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done by any friendly hand . Dp not , however , expect- tiiat it should equal in magnitude what we have seen in Surrey Chapel or Exeter Hall ; for this would not be just . The States have at present no metropolis ; the interest of their meetings , therefore , is divided among several places , rather than concentrated in one , as it isjn London . However , if I succeed in placing it properly under your eye , ' you will - not think it inconsiderable . If it does not equal our central , it surpasses most of our provincial meetings . The Societies creating tha most interest are the Tract , the Home Mission , the Education , the Bibkr , and the Foreign Missionary . The last of these was the last in order ; but , as it surpassed , perhips , all in impression , it is to this I will refer . The ordinary place of meeting is Chatham-street // Chapel . The place was a theatre ; it has been purchased and converted into a free church ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the purposes of public meetings . It has , like Zipn - Chapel , strong indica- tions of what were its original uses . The platform of the stage remains . In the centre of the iront line of the stage is a roomy pulpit . From the foot of the pulpit springs a gallery of seats , which rises backwards to tiiie external wdls , and fills the . whole space over the stage . This is reserved for the ministers ; and when it is filled by them , it presents to the eye , as you pass up the aisles , a striking and impressive object . On reaching the platform , and turning round , you hate a face of things presented to you somewhat resembling what it would be in a siinilar position in Spafields Chapel . There is a considerable area , and over it two tiers of galleries. - The place , I should think , will contain 8,000 persons ; and filled , as it wais on this obcasioc , there could not be less than 3,600 . At this meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith presided . Dr. Proudfit was called on to open the proceedings by prayer . Dt* . Wisner then , as Secretary to the Societ/ was looked to for a report of its state and prospects . This was not the occasion oh which that Society ' makes it full annual report ; it was an auziliiuT ' exelcise , and the statement made was a mere abstract . That abstract , however , was wisely given ; it was brief , clear , discriminating , and made to turn on vital and great prinoiples of hope and of action ; and it was delivered , not by dry and hasty reading , but with- fireedota and cogent earnestness . Mr. WinSlowl an excellent missionary , who had returned from Ceylon , followed . He gave an interesting account of the condition of missionary work in ' India , with much pious feeling , and urged for support in corX6spoQdence with the opening prospects . A very good unpressioA was made by his ispeech ; showq not in audible admiration of the man , but in aUent appreciation of the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different character , but not of contrary effect* It was gumentative , but popular , serious , and urgent , embracing burge views of a great subject , and making strong claims on the conscience . The temper of the meeting was Aill j sustained by his address . I was expected to follow him with another resrfution . I began by referring to ' my responsibility , for at that moment I deeply felt it . . What was said was reeeived with the greatest indulgence and attention ; and I was thankful if it did not disturb or allay the state of feeling which happily existed . After- a slight pause , the Rev. Mr. Blagden , of Boston , rose , and referring to the felt state of the meeting , proposed that contributions should be immediately made , and that we should resolve ourselves into a prayer-meeting , to seek the especial blessing of God on our object and ourselves . The president and one or two senior members about the chair thought that they had better first pass through the usual and remaining business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethune , and Dr. Spring , followed . They spoke under some disadvantage . The general feeling required not to be excited by continued appeal ; but rather to be relieved by devout supplication . The business was disposed of . Notice was given that contributions should be sent to the collectors of the several congregations ; and I was requested to close the meeting in parajrer . I sought to be excused , but in vain . It was a mpst solemn and delightful occasion . The profound silence showed that all were engaged in one act ; and sweet and- refreshing tears were shed in abundance . That time is worth a thousand ordinary ones ; it stands out in the places of memory as Bethel , did in the recollections of the patriarch , never to be forgotten ! Happy as the service was , it wa generally regretted that the suggestion made by Mr. Blagden was not acted upon . S6me 5,000 dollars would certainly have been added to the funds of the Society ; and such an occaaiopi /z/ iZ SO aeldom occurring , impioved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To plead order under such circumslancos , and lo prevent the exercise of religious feeling , is reducing order to formality , and turning the good into an evil . However , the feeling waa ao strong after the disappointment it had suffered , and after the expression which had been given to it , iliat before the meeting separated , it was . resolved to open two places for special prayer on the following Sabbath evening . These meetings were thronged , and most serious and intereating . The meetings were mo.Htly lield in the morning and evening ; commencing at ten and half past seven , and iinishing at an uncertain time . Tlie evening meetings closed about ten o'clock , and the morning about two ; the one I have described finished at half past two . The* meetinga , U a whole , were proncunced to be more interesting ll tbey bad ever been , and tills was said in connexion with the assurance that they had been much longer . The morning meeting had previously seldom exceeded two hours or two hours and a half . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which met in the evening , threw some singers inlo the gallery be- hind the rostrum , and relieved the meeting by one or two iH musical compositions . This was not , to my taste , an improvement . Had the whole assembly been challenged to sing , as an expression of e feeling which possessed It , it would have been natural and beautiful ; as theatrical . It was a coauoon thing to prepare printed slips , with the resolutions a names of the mover and seconder , as a bill of fare . Generally , the meetings were , m my judgment , delightful . There was more spirit and efficiency in them than I had been taught to expect ; or than one might reasonably expect , in the remembrance that the platform meeting is of later date with them than with us . They are in no way inferior to our meetings at Briatol , Liverpool , or Manchester and in some respects they , are perhaps superior . They have fewer men tliat speak j bijl vi r then they have fewer formicl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us mora play of talent , and more beauty of period ; bul with them there is less claptrap , leas trifling , and no frivolity . They meet as men who have a serious business in hand , and who a , te delermined to do it in a manly and aerious manner ; and they look with wonder and pity on the impeninence of a man who , at such a lime , will seek to amuse them with pun , and humom , and prettineas . The speaken , perhaps , aak more time to prepare than tn England , but they do not lean more on their notes ; and if they have less action , they do not create less interest . That interest is , indeed , , not expressed as with ua , by strong and audible signs , till one 's head aches . I witnessed , in all the meetingH , but one burst of this tind , and that was severely put down by a rigid chairman . But if the speaker has a worthy Iheme , and if he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the judgment and die heart , that he is addressing himself to a people who can wait on his tips with intelligecit smiles , and silent teats , and with what , after all , perhaps , is the highest compliment , silence itself - deep and sublime - like the silence of heaven . Two things should be remarked before this subject is dismissed from youi attention . The first is , that , at no one of these meetings , was a public collection made ; and the other is , that , in connexion with all of them , eariy prayer- meetings were held at different parts of the town . . - At length this busy week came to its close . A week it was , in which I had made more acquaintance than in any similar period of lime ; in which the dwelling of our worthy host was made too much like a house of call ; in which ft field of service was opening before us ; not only in the States , but over the Canadas ; and in which my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mt DEAii Friend , ' I HATE now to introduce you to new and different stenes . . Hitherto we had seen nothing of the rural population ; nor had we found an opportunity of marking the effects of a very recent revival . Morristown , which is some rty miles from New- York , and in the State of New-Jersey , supplied the double occasion ; and our kind friend Mr. Phelps , partly , to meet this desire , and partly a benevolent concern to relieVe me from the pressure of too many engagements , proposed to take us thither . We readily accepted his offer , and left on Saturday for that place . We went by a steamer fo Elizabethtown , and from thence by a coach , which was waiting the airiyal of the boat . The road wad bad , and tbe run heavy j but the country was varied and pretty , and all the objects were new . Apple-orshaids prevail greatly about here . That , firuit has been cultivated extensively and profitably for distillation ; bat the Temperance Society has destroyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-sized house just finished , and placed on stilts , with this notice on it : /z/ Morristown is beautifully located . It is placed on ridges of land , which drop away into the valleys . The scattered cottages run round a green of irregular form , and having the Presbyterian Church as a centre-piece ; and from the green they run off again into the different avenues which lead to it , and are half concealed among the trees . The cottages are what is called frame buildings ; they have a frame or skeleton of wood ; and this is clothed externally with feather-edeed boatding . The /q/ foof is coTered with shingle ; which , is a sort of wooden slate , made either of pine or cedar . Every thing indeed is of wood except the chimneys , which are carried up in brick . When they are kept nicely painted , and have green Venetian shutters , as is mostly the case here , they look pretty , and will endure a long time . The church was raised of the same materials ; with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a projection on the front elevation of the edifice . This is the usual material , and the usual form given to it , in'the construction of the rural church . Not being expected here , nor having even the knowledge of any person , we made our way to one of the two inns on the Green ; but before we could make our little arr.angements , the rumour of our arrival had got abroad , and we were not allowed to stay there . Mr. Matheson went to Mr. Hover 's , the minister of the Presbyterian Church ; and Mr. Phelps and myself accepted the invitation of Mr. Cook , a zealous member of the Methodist Church , and who had first shown us kindness . The next day was Ibi ; Sabbath . I declined all engagement for the day , opt only aa necessary to my state of health , but as I sougiitttKMQ oQitiikiilies of hearii and of quiet observation which were requisite to assist one 's judgment . I had the less delicacy in this , as the ministers were all prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist Mr. Hover in duties somewhat arduous . In the morning I ' worshipped at the Presbyterian Church . ' . The avenues and green were animated by uie little groiips hastening to the House of God ; some sixty . light wagons stood bout the green and church , fence , which had already deliye'fed their charge . The people were all before the time . ' I Ishould* think twenty persons did not enter after me , and I waa'in time . There were , I should nk , above a thousand persons present . The exercisres were well and piously conducted . Mr. Hover read his sermon , but he read it with tears . It was on the duty of parents to their childieni and it made a good /z/ 46 BBUoiON ' at morristown. imprei0ion . It was adapted to this end ; for it was excellent in composition and in fdeling . The people did not show much ihterest in the singing , nor all the interest in prayer which I expected ; but on the whole it was , perhaps , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still surrounded by the effects and influence of a revival which had lasted most of the winter . The particulars of this revival I will here put down ; postpo* ning any observations on the subject generally till I can give it the . full . consideration which it importance demands . /z/ From all I could learn , religion must have been low this congregation previous to the revival ; that is , , fJIpiwer than it usually is in our churches . There are " J ; any causes that might contribute to this ; and chiefly , , .. - f think , il might arise from many persons who , as they gS0W up , have no wish to be thought irreligious , and yet have no conscientious regard for religion ; and who , feeling towards ih/B predominant ohuroh as a sort of parish church , aittach themselves to it , and thus flrom time * to time infuse into it a worldly character . Several pious persons , principally the minister and elders , J believe , felt for the condition of the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace ; and they met together for prayer and consultation . The pastor engaged to bring the subject , as it impressed themselves , before the attention of the church ; and special meetings for prayer and a special visitation were determined on . The township was laid out in districts , and thirty-four visiters were appointed . They were to go two and two ; and to visit every family ' and individual mere or less in attendance at church . Their busiovis was , by conversation and prayer , and earnest app'eal to the conscience , to press the claims of domestic and personal religion on all ; and this was to be done without mixinB it up with ordinary topics of converse , or partaking of social refreshments , that nothing . might terfere with the impression . The visitation was to be ade within one week ; this limitation was ol great use ; and as this people htYS /z/ /q/ Binch leiiure at the period of the year which was chosen , it could be attended with no difficulty . The results were highly encouraging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serious inquiry . The deputies reported whatever was interesting , to the pastor , and encouraged the people to communicate with him ; and his hands were soon full of occupation . He determined on holding a protracted meeting in the month of February for some days , and by this means he brought to his youth and his overladen hands Ihe help of some brethren in the ministry . It was conducted , I believe , with prudence and efficiency ; and it advanced the good work which had been begun . As the fruit of these exercises , the happy pastor was looking to receive nearly fifty persons to the communion of the pious at the next sacrament . It should be observed that their sacraments , and consequently their admissionsi occur only once in three months ; and that this circumstance-gives to their amount of admissioBS an apparent advantage over ours . In the aflemoon of the day I attended the Episcopal Church . It is small and thhily attended . There were not two hundred persons . The minister is , I believe , of worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon in essay style ; fairly put together indeed , yet void of thought , of distinctness , and of point . It would provoke neither objection nor inquiry ; and was therefore not likely to do good . The service closed as it began : the people were evidently not interested . what a lifeless thing professed religion may become , and what a responsibility rests with the minister , leSt he should deprive itof life as it passes through his hands ! On leaving the place , I took a circuitous and unfrequented path home , and was delighted with the scenes it presented to me . One spot especially dwells in my memory . You stood on a slope above the village ; and in looking upon it , you saw only the turret of the hall , the spire of the church , and the angles of a few cottages ffarough the foliage of the poplar , the oak , and the pine , r // which concealed all the rest . Here and there little parties appealed and disappeared , as they quietly moved on from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be- . L hind you were two verdant lanes , nluch promised to 9 transport you from the world ; while at your side the , ' land broke suddenly away some hundred feet , and pre- - ' sented you with a. small lake finely fringed with wood ; and again it fell away , and ran into the distance , giving to the eye Tale after vale , and hill after hill , beautifully formed , beautifully clothed , and in beautiful perspective . The sun was shining brilliantly on this distant scenery ; " &#9632; v and a fine dark cloud had risen like a curtain over the M other portion of it , so as to throw as much of quiet am- ' roaiiua into the whole picture as possible . It was a Bweet study . " In the evening I went with Mr. Cook and my friend ' to the Episcopal Methodist Church . It is not large , and has been recently built . The men occupied one side of the place , and the women the other ; an unsocial plan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were there before the service comntenced . The silence was ioierrupted disagreeably , by continued spiltmg , which fell , to a strange ear , like the drippings from the eaves on a rainy day . They have the custom of turning their back to the minister in singing , that they may face the singers ; and they have also the practice , to a great eilent , of interlining the prayer with esclamations and prayers of their own . Such as these , for instance , were common : - Amen - Do so , Lord - Lord , Ihou knoweat - ' , Let it be bo , Lord - Yes , yes . Lord - Come , come . Lord , fl &c.; - You will recognise in this otily what you have ' witnessed at home . Their minister came ot ) t from Ireland . He is an intelhgent , humble , pious man ; and preached a sound and useful sermon . But he has no management of his voice ; it was at one elevation , and that the highest , throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and threatens , I fear , to Vear himself out with vociferation . The ministers m this connexion , 1 found , are allowed to /q/ ' &#9632; &#9632; tile . Ha - is jutl setUad ; he has a wife and three cfaildxen , and has 600 dollars a year . - .. It was nearly ten o'clock when we left . The night WIS dark . The clouds had settled heavily all round the horizon , and the lightning was flashing most vividly dirough the whole circle . We seemed like Saturn surrounded by rings of fire . I had not before seen American lightning . On the whole , the state of this township is very good . There aje in it 3,500 persons . There are 2,500 in attendance on worship , and about 1,000 in communion ; and there are not less than 700 children in the schools . ' The change , too , - must have been great . One fact will satisfy you of this ; there were in this township , before ti &e; Temperance efforts , fourteen stores for the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now there is only one . It would have been pleasant to us all could we have stayed a day or two here ; but as we had to be present at the sittings of the General Assembly , we were obliged to leave on the ' Monday evening . We parted with our friends with the hope of meeting again ; and hastened back to New- York . So soon as we arrived we found that , in consequence of the special prayer-meetings having been so well attended , and of some disappointment having arisen from our absence , a supplemental prayermeeting had been , fixed for that evening , and we were announced as expected . We made haste therefore to go ; and united with Dr. Spring , Mr. Norton , and other ministers , in conducting the meeting . The following day was fully occupied ; the morning in meeting those claims which arose on leaving our American home for a considerable time ; and the . evening in the society of many friends which our kind ho9t and hostess had invited to meet us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , with the happiness of still being attended by Mr. Phelps , who was delegated to the Assembly , and two of his daughters , who werc availing themselves of this opportunity to Vol .

We were nortmngera to tlKB plce , bb it had lain in our way to and from WashijAgton ; Bor bad me to seek a dwellkig , for Dr. Ely , w.had before received us , still insisted that we should accept of the bospitality of his hospitable fjuocdly. /z/ My DBAa Friend , Wb had no sooner time to look about us in Philadelphia , than we found ourselyes in a full tide of occupation not inferior to what we had known at New- York . The Assembly would require a close attention , and have , iujttry sittings , and crowded attendance , as questions of ' * ' ippit , and , in the judgment of many , of fearful interest , j V ' ' ffimiA come on . In addition to this , the public institu ' - vftpm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were edged into all 4iie niches of time which it was hoped the Assembly would leave disengaged ; and it was a matter of earnest request that wo should attend thfiin . Our home , too , gave the same signs of busy engigement . Dr. Ely on occasions keeps open house . There were thirteen or fourteen of us dwelling there , and always more than this number at the dinner-table . As these visiters were tnir bssftuen , and came from all parts of the States , it : ' applied a means of profitable and pleasant intercourse , woh suffered no deduction , except what from the difficulty of finding time to enjoy it . Let me , however , put the more important engagements before you in the of their occurrence . On the evening of our arrival , we found that the Episcopal Church Missionary Society was holding a meeting . I went to it . It was respectably attended . The venenble /q/ Bishop White the chair . Sereral clergjr* men spoke from written speeches . They were good* one very good ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deUvery .. Dr. Blilnor , a name well known among ns , and now very pleasant lo my recollections , had come on with the effects of the New*-York meetings , upon him , and he urged that something should he done for China . A vote was carried unani* mously to send out a missionary ; and it gave new life to their proceedings . This altogether was an infant at* tempt on the part of the evangelical Episcopal clergy , and it was well and piously sustained . The next mommg we attended the Oeneral Assembly . They met in the church which was built for Mr. Hay , formerly of Bristol ; it is the seventh Presbyterian Church . It is capacious and handsome , and well adapted fiar sighs and sound . The sittings are opened by a doTOtional service of the usual order ; and the moderator of the lailr year is always appointed to preach . The place WW . thronged , and with such an assemblage of pastors , eldil and saints , as is seldom witnessed . The preachsK.Wiik Dr. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eiii4 ' Jerusalem ; " and the sermon breathed the spirit of A text . The whole service - sermon , prayers , psalmodi - was devout and refreshing . It was like some of die best things we have at home , and was calculated to have a happy effect in the pending discussions . After the public worship , the congregation dispersed or retired to the galleries , or to that portion of the area which was assigned to spectators ; e one half of the area nearest to the pulpit being retained for the uses of the members of assembly . The Assembly is formed by , the standing committee of commissioners , making a report of the persons present who re duly appointed to sh as commissioners in this convention . It appeared that there were nearly 200 present ; the nuners returned had been reduced to avoid the inconveniences which attach to very large bodies sitting in legislative and judi* cial capacities . The congregational bodies send dekN /z/ goteft to this Assembly , but they are not allowed td vote By the time that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grant a recess . At four o'clock they met again . The first businesft was , after prayer , to choose a moderator and temporary clerk ; who , with the two permanent clerks , composed the official staff of the court . Committs were then appointed , whose duties were either to dispose of trivial business , or to prepare more serious business for the consideration of the Assembly . These arrangements were followed by reports from the permanent and stated clerks . Dr. McDowell and Dr. Ely , on the correspondence and the outline of business waiting the attention of the commissioners . These were all preliminaries , and when they were arranged it was time to adjourn , or al least it was deemed so by the meeting . Dr. Philip Lindsley , President of Nashville College* was chosen as moderator ; a gentleman whose acquaints ance I had the pleasure of making at Washington . So as intelligence , impartiahty , and urbane and Christian oanriage Were qualifications , the choice was a happy one ; bat a person who presides over a large meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ike forms of proceeding , and where strong discussiHi and party feeling are expected to break out , requires , above all things much promptitude and tact in the ways of business generally , and a good acquaintance with the practices of the body over which he is placed in particular . This Dr. Lindsley candidly acknowledged he did not possess ; and , firom the want of it , both himself and the court were often embarrassed , sometimes in a humorous , and sometimes in a veiratious manner . On the following day , much time was consumed in minor affairs ; but at length came the subject of the complaint and appeal of the Second Presbytery of Philadelphia against the Synod ' of Philadelphia . An effort waa made by an amendment to postpone it , on which there was much confusion . Biit all were waiting for the disduaien , and the proposition was overruled i and the coia- OEVXRAL AMBHUnr . S8 /z/ phutit aid appeal were allowed to take ikeit hearingf . A long hearing it was , for it lasted beyond the remainder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Assembly . Tl indeed was the question of questions ; and as it was by no means one of lodid of temporary interest , I must endeavour to place it iMriefly before you . Some of the ' pastiyrs and churches in ths hj had adopted opinions and courses which fall gnrally under the head of new measures ; while those Who have not adopted them hare &llen,; by a contrast of temuT , under the denomination of old measures . As these measuresi both new and old , affect other churches besides ( he Presbyterian , they must be noticed distinctly and more at large elsewhere . It is sufficient to state here , that they were the occasion of much , and sometimes of bitter dispute , in the existing Presbyteries . The new-measure party , who were a minority in the existing Presbyteries , and who felt themselves annoyed , proposed to withdraw , their connexion , and form themselves into a separate Presbytery , a measure of peace , under the style of an Elective Affinity Presbytery . The existing Presbyteries j of the Synod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed a salutary influence ; and . especially they were alarmed at a proposed departure from the constitution of the church , which recognised no such principle of separation . The whole matter went before the General Assembly ; and , after seven days heated and painful discussion , the Assembly confirmed the existence of the Second Presbytery , and instructed the Synod to receive it . The Synod refused to comply and assigned its reasons in a string of resolutions , and the Presbytery came up again with its appeal and complaint . Thus the affair stood at this time ; and it vwas now thrown open , and with it the old wounds , to firesh exacerbation . Each party was heard by its own advocates , even to weariness , for the argument lay in a small space , and a great length of time was bestowed on it . Then came the rights of the judicatory . The roll was /z/ called ) and every member in giving his vote had tfas right to give his reasons too ; and very many availed themselves it . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that about two thirds of the court were against disturbing the previous determination . Qn the character of the discussion as it advanced , there is not much room for remark . There was not a great deal of good speaking . One speech was argumentative and very clever , but it wanted perspicuity and condensation to give it power . Another speaker was remarkable and amusing , from the manner in which scraps of common Latin fell from his lips at every third sentence , and with all sorts of accent . And another awakened extraordinary excitement by his power in biting sarcasm , a power used so waywardly as to alarm both friends and foes . While many in the course of the debate expressed themselves with brevity , in nothing remarkable , except ' for that good sense and gracious feeling which savoureth all things . I have given you this account somewhat in detail , because this body is next in importance to the Congress itself . The persons composing it are the elect of their particular societies , and they come from all parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,300 miles . Many of them were ashamed that we should witness discussions which involved much personal allusion , and which , while man is man , will throw up his infirmities to the surface . For my own part , I was glad of an occasion of observing the conduct of such a body under very trying circumstances ; and the result was that of unfeigned admiraHan , Apart from the conduct of the leading speakers , who , residing in the city , and pledged to certain views , might be regarded as ex parte advocates , the Assembly generally did not forget their character as judges , but carried themselves with much gravity , impartiality , and forbearance . They overlooked the effects of passion in others , and subdued them in themselves ; they evidently acted under the fear of God , and with a desire of promoting the tilings that **make for /q/ peace . " I could not help thinking , at various times of provocation , what a different conduct would have been shown had it hot been for the restraints of religion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt to produce the amount of restraint . I have seen many religious bodies , when less tried , and when more habituated to this sort of trial , and when dwelling in a more refined atmosphere , not behave so well In saying as much as this , however , in fJEivour of the court , you must understand , what I have already intimated , that this question was regarded by neither party , nor by the Assembly , as of local interest . It was not a question whether a new Presbytery , constituted on new principles , in Philadelphia , should exist or be annihilated ; but it was a question which was considered as a test of the strength or weakness of the new-measure men throughout the whole church . That the New Presbytery should be willing to make it so is not surprising ; but that the Synod should have been so disposed is amazing , as it was placing a subject which they deemed to be of the first magnitude in a most unequal and perilous position . In fact , it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Assembly had , at a former sitting , heard and passed judgment on a case brought regularly before them by appellant and defendant . The Sjrnod had refused to act on that judgment ; and the real question now was , whether the Assembly should retain its place in the constitution as a supreme and final court of appeal . All who know how backward men are to review and reverse a decision they have formally made , will see that there were few chances , even if wrong , of getting it set right , and if right , just no chance at all . And the Synod , by still identifying the case with the greater question , have created an impression in favour of the new measures , which they must deem as fatal as it is general . Up to this moment , it is generally considered that the majority obtained against the Sjmod is a victory on the side of new measures ; whereas , you will now see , that it is a resolution of the Assembly to assert its own qwq Before leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references . In the course of the proceedings some interesting reports were brought up , relative to their college , the mission cause , and the state of reUgion . The report on the slate of religion was brought up on the Monday morning after our anival . We were looked lo , in otu turn , as delegates Irom the Congregational Union . for some account of the numbers and condition of our churches . Mr. Matheson made a brief and general and presented the congratulations of our conI was urged to support him , bat from the renewed toss of voice , I was obliged to eicuse myself . The reports generally were not made so prominent and interesting as 1 eipected , or as , perhaps , they commonly are ; there was at this time an sicitmg and absorbing subject before the meeting unsettled , and , of courae , there was an eagerness lo pass lo it . It is the custom of the Assembly to set apart a morning diAing their sessions for special devotion - reading the Scriptures , eihortation , and prayer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I went to the place of meeting with high expectation of thronged attendance and happy worship . But no ; it was too much there as it is here ; the persons who will crowd to a rebgious debate are not the persons who rejoice in a pure act of worship . At the time of commencement there were not more than two hundred persons present . However , the attendance aoon increased to eight hundiedora thousand , and these , wfAiout doubt , of the more serious and pious character . I WU. with live of my Presbyterian tn leading the services . There was over the meeting a ve/y subdued and tender spirit . All unused to teais , 1 never saw so many men weeping before . We enjoyed much ; and it was an evidence of what might have been enjoyed in more auspicious circumstances . At the close of the service , Dr. Oieen , the father of /q/ tha Assembly , rose and proposed that , instead of proceeding to business , as was usual , they should adjourn , in order to cherish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was overruled by a proposal that they should receive the Mission Report , which was thought to be in harmony with the ezistinf state of feeling . Of the other engagements while in this city little need be said . My object is not to report all that was done and said , but so much as may afford information and advantage . The pubUc meetings were mostly duplicates of those held at New- York . The chief of them were connected with the Presbyterian Education , the Temperance , and the Sunday School Union Societies . These were all well attended and well sustained . The Sunday School Union has its establishment here , and appears to be admirably conducted . There is one service , however , which may claim notice . It was the ordination of Mr. Pariser as a missionary to China . . It took place on the second evening of our arrival , in the presence of a large assembly of persons . It was by the Second Presbytery , and we were made corresponding members for the time . The Presbytery was constituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society , gave an introductory sermon . Dr. Ely asked the usual questions ; which were replied to , not as with us , but by the mere expression of assent . He then offered the ordaining prayer , with impositicMi hands ; and led in giving the rigt hand of fellowship , which is not given in silence , but with explanatbry and affectionate remark . Mr. Barnes gave the charge . Mr. Winsiow and myself then followed widi short addresses , and the service closed with singing and pwjer . This was in itself a delightfiil senice ; fo me it was peculiarly so . It was the second serrice , in order of time , which I attended here , and both services related to China . I had for the last three years attempted to call up attention to the claims of China home , but in vain , and I went out to America not prepared to find much interest there ; and when I really found that Christiana of that CDunliy were looWng on Cluna as a field of p labour , and were sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lis redemption , it seemed aa though one had crossed the Atlantic to receive an answer to one 's prayers . Siill , on reluming , home , you are surprised with the question , la China open ? My reply in , America has answered that question . China is as open now , and has been lor the last twenty years , aa it ever will be till we Htrive to enter . It is not open to indolent inquiry ; it is open to faith , prayer , and filed perseverance . Our negligence to this subject for a long period is more remarlcable , since we have had the greatest facilitiea for the work ) and to juatify what we had done , it was indispenaable that we should do more . Thirty years ago China secured our attention . Morrison and Mtlne were devoted to it ; and with the most exhilarating success . Malacca . Singapore , and Ponang , were taken up aa outposts , to bear on this great empire , and have hena sustained , at an immense expense , for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no movement of the least importance from that time to this has been made on a country which , with its dependants and accessories , contains one half of the world 's population . Surely the churches wiU awake to a sense of their duty ; and while expending their resources on fields of acknowledged importance , will still maintain , that the firal in importance has , in wisdom and in mercy , the rst claim to our services of benevolence . You will perhaps be scarcely satisfied if I leave Philadelphia without speaking of it as a place . What has been often aaid , I need not repeat : it will be enough if I give you my impressions . It is indeed a Quaker city , neat , clean , uniform , without any strikmg features . There is the drab bonnet , and the drab gown , and ( he ftill , and neckerchief and apron to correspond ; aU very good , and , in a certain acceptation , very handsome ; bat there are no feathers , no flounces , no gaudy colours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets inter- k /z/ sect each otheT at lighi angles ; and everj itreet ii so like its fellow as aoaietiiDjeH to tira on the eye and perplex ihe course . It is the cleanest city 1 hare BCen in this new worM ; it has the finest market ; and is admirably supplied with excellent water . 1 should think a family would find as many comfurta and as few inconveniences as may be , in residing here . The females , too , struck me as more interesting in appearance ; but they might owe this to their dress . You seldom see Quaker dress in lliis town ; but it has evidently qualified aU you do see . It is a happy medium between what you would find in Quaker life and fashionable life ; It borrows taste from the one , and feminine nicety from other . The society , I should tlunk , is agreeable and excellent . As for sights , after what I have said , you will suppose that tliey may soon be disposed of . Yet there is something under this head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a laige expense ; and , like many of our expensive things , ought 10 bo good . It is built of marble , ami has some fine Corinthjan columns , with beautiful wrought capitals ; but , for the rest , it is sad indeed . Surely no architect could have given such an elevation . The porticoes to the two banks are admirable ; I remember gazing on the larger one , in the moonlight , with great pleasure . The comer of the ground in which Franklin lies , and iho room in which the Declaration of Independence was first read , interested me . There is here an excellent library and museum . The library has upwards of 30,000 volumes , and is more select than most . It has been greatly enriched by the bequest of an English clergyman . The museum is chiefiy remarkable for a fine skeleton of the mammoth . 1 saw also the spot where Penn signed his treaty with the Indians . A. tree , springing from the roots of the parent tree under which they stood , shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small monument there ; I will not ssy erected , for it is not more than half the si/0 of one of our alielisks ; and il has a shabby en- /z/ Oq tba seveial faces there is insciibed : /z/ rUE PENN BOCIETV 1SQ7 . I went also to see the Water-workB and the Penitentiary . The former is the boast of the town . As a. work of art , affording great benefit 10 the people , it is good ; as a place of agreeable resort , it is very inviting ; but , as a. discovery in science , which J3 the ground of boast to many , it is nothing ' . A thousand miilstreams are made available on the same principle . The Petuientiary is really admirable . I can confirm what has generally been said of it . There are some nice and sitilful arrangements for the order , supervision , cleansing , and ventilation of the prison . All was good - all , except the method of warming , which had perplexed them . They were about to try a new method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply Mr. Woods with the plan adopted in the London Orphan Asylum . He is an excellent man , a Friend ; who presides over the establisiiment gratuitously , finding his reward in the fruits of his benevolence . I have referred to the Quakers . I am sorry to say thai a considerable portion of them have lapsed into fatal heresy . The orthodox have separated from them , and Ihey now bear the appellation of Hicksites . I could not , assuredly , learn Iheir opinions , but I fear it amounts almost to Deism . On authority , which I behove I may trust , it is said that they have lately resolved that the word Holy shall no longer be an afHx to the word Bible . On the morning of the 24th , we quitted this city for New- York on oui way to Boston ; after having had the most favourable opportunity of becoming acquainted with /z/ ' fe-nww fti*r#w-T0RK- . I the habrta and chaiacler of the people , and after ban had muCli enjoyment in truly Christian jnterc worship .

" I Ml ncAR Friehd , I Tkk reason which pressed us to return to New- York on the Saturday was , that me had engagements lo fulfil &#9632; in that city . I preached on the Sabbath at Laight-atroat , &#9632; and at the Middle Dutch Church . I had become ac- tquainted with the ministers of this church through Mr. Abeel , their InisaioDary , who had stayed aa an invalid /z/ some weeks in my fiunily : and the greater my acquaint* ance with them , the greater was my esteem . They invited us to their classes , and passed resolutions ezpressiTe of congratulations on our arrival , and sympathy in our object . On the Monday morning , we left home soon after five , to attend a merchants prayer-meeting , which was held weekly at six o'clock , and passed in rotation , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mr. Oliphant ' 89 and it was the more interesting , as he and Mr. PariLer , the recently ordained missionary , were about to leave for China . Though he went as a merchant , he wished rather to advance rehgion than to secure gain . Two friends engaged in prayer ; and then the President , as the meeting was of a special character , invited us to offer remarks . Mr. Matheson referred to what Mr. Angus had sought to do in this country ; but with little encouragement . I expressed a wish to know if they had defraed objects before them in this , friendly meeting . It was stated tiiat ey had , and they were understood to be - To advance personal piety ; to intercede for their families , and to seek , as merchants the promotion of the missionary cause . Of course , we could only express warm sympathy in such objects ; but it was suggested whether , by assuming a more open character , and calling up the attentiqn of the merchants generally , they might not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest consecrating mercantile avocations to missionary objects . Extending remarks of this nature were kindly received , and were to be seriously coneidered . Mr. Parker also addressed the meeting with humility and affection . There was a sweet spirit over it , and all were , I believe , refreshed with the interview . Altogether , there were about eighteen of us present . After the exercise , we breakfasted with Dr. Spring . The subject became naturally a principal one in our conversations . He entered into it as warmly as ourselves ; and we agreed that we would work in its favour as we /z/ had occasion , in the hope that , befoato we left , something equal to the object might be attempted . In the afternoon of the same day , we left for Boston by the Providence steamer . Messrs . Boorman and Wilder , whom I had known in Paris , attended us to the boat ; and Dr. Peters and Mr. Yale , of CmdksmJd , were our companions . The Sound , of which little is said , is &#9660; ery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aathe temptations to ** go below were few , and the eftmng was fine and warm , I remained on deck . As the nigt advanced , which was dark , the effect of the sparks emitted from the pine wood used in the furnace was peculiar . You saw not whence they came ; they spread over the dark ground of the sky , and shot abroad with every ynai " ety of form and motion ; they were equal in brdliancy and grace to any fireworks which I have seen . Morning came , and we found ourselves surrounded by heavy mists ; so that the vessel was obliged to reduce her speed almost to nothing , for the want of landmarks . We reached Providence . four hours later than usuaL The mail was waiting our arrival and we went on by it . We travelled at the rate of eight miles an hour , the quickest I have witnessed in this country . It was very hot till we came within five miles of Boston , when the temperature changed many degrees , and made us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven olock . A meeting of the Home Missionary Society was then assembled , and we had ben announced as expected . Persons were watching the first arrival ; and Dr. Codman and other friends were immediately with us to con- , vey us to Park-street Church . Remonstrance was in vain , and without dressing and without repose , away we went . I soon found myself on the platform of a crowded assembly ; and , weary and dirty , and unwilling as I was to take a public part in the engagements of the evening , I was still happy at last , and thus suddenly , to be in the midst of the children of the Pilgrim Fathers . We had an excellent meeting . It was iter ten oclock when we got away ; and Dr. Codman kindly attended us to hie /z/ iionour Lieutenant-govwnor Armstrong 's , who had ili vited us to a residence in his family . In the morning , Dr. Codman , who was anxious to &#9632; how us all kindness , called to take us to the Pastoral Association . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about one hundred- present ; the Association , of course , embraced only the ministers of the State of Massachusetts . We were introduced to the moderator , Dr. Fay , and afterward received the fraternal congratulations of the brethren . There was no special business before them . We afterward went to hear the annual sermon for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge ; yes , it is exactly so ; in this , as in most things , yoii shsdl find here a type of all ' that we have in the olden land . Mr. Stearns preached . He is a poet ; and the style of the sermon was rather too poetical for prose . It was fine ; it was good ; but it did not carry the auditors sufficiently from the preacher to the subject . The following day I attended , with Dr. Codman , the Congregational Convention . This , unlike the Pastoral Association , includes Unitarians . The Convention is of the nature of our Widow 's Fund Society ; and , like it , it embraces persons of different creeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship . I can easily see how the Unitarian and the orthodox may act together for any purely civil or charitable end , without difficulty ; but if it is to be extended to acts of prayer , and the ministration of the word of life , I see nothing but difficulty . So far , however , as the difficulty is practical , the brethren think it is overcome , as of late years the decided majority is with the orthodox , and they always appoint , by the consent of the minority , the preacher . The business of the Convention was unimportant , and the forms not peculiar . There were but few present ; as it was understood , at the previous meeting yesterday , which was large , that little remained to demand attention . The meeting broke up ; and quickly after the public service began in the same place . The sermon was plain god orthodox ; but it was orthodoxy with effort , and ox* BAPTIST EDVCATIOW aOCUTT . Oft AjNloxy fearing to offend . The worthy preadier fritt I am pexeuaded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paeeed through the eenrice with constraint Of the public meetings generally I need not speak ; to say , that we had enough to do to attend and that they were attended with an interest and in numbers equal in proportion to what we had seen elsewhere . Tliere is , however , one meeting which , perhaps , I'Oi : ght to notice briefly , on account of its results , and OQ account of its belonging to another denomination . We had uniformly deaired to show that our missioii was not from one sect to another sect ; but from the Christian churches of one land , to those of another and a sister land ; and had sought all opportunities of dis covering that Catholic spirit , which , after all , alas ! has so few occasions to show itself . The friends of ths Baptist denomination had applied to me to attend the meeting of their Education Society ; and I readily oonfifented to meet their wishes , not only on the principle to which I have alluded , but to offer what support I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next to the Methodists , the Baptists , perhaps , were wanting oo this subject ; they were now awaking to a sense of the - evils attendant on an uneducated ministry , and were that their instructors should themselves first bs instructed . The meeting was held in a chapel of moderate sions . It was full , but not crowded , and ift had wealth about it than most of the meetings . There wet about a dozen ministers on the platform . The early past of the meeting was not very promising . After the report was read , which was good , and ought to have been very impressive by the facts it reeorded , one of ths brethren rose to offer a resolution . His speech was written , and he used the notes freely , and yet did not appear at lbeity . It was an argument in support of ths society ; reason after reason adduced ; and at length , as the climax of all , it was to be-shown , that the peculiar opinions thay as Baptists , were peculiarly favourable /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meant for unbaptized ears . The ministers , looked at the speaker , then at me ; the people were disconcerted . He ' from not having been at liberty , became confused , and feh perhaps more generously than he need to have done . He referred " to what might have been said ; tut as they were favoured with the presence of visiters , he would pass it by ; " and then he hastened to a conclusion ; and I confess , such is the perversity of our najture , that I have always wished to know what this argument , wfcch I am never to know , could have been . This little slip of a brother was truly useful . . It awakened the dormant feeling in the meeting ; and all that feeling was kindness . When I rose to support his resolution as requested , all were generously attentive . At the close , I alluded emphatically to one fact in the report , which was , that out of 4,600 churches , there were 2,000 not only void of educated pastors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literailyy they ought not to sleep on such a state of things . The Rev. Mr. Malcolm , who has visited our country , and who is an excellent minister in this city , rose out of turn , and expressed his great pleasure at the presence of a brother from England ; and referring to what had been said , he confessed that he , for one , could not sleep with things as they were ; he had never felt them as he did then ; and he must da something to correspond ; he proposed to answer for another scholarship . To support a scholar at college is estimated at from sixty to seventy dollars a year . Another person below the platform rose , and , referring with much simplicity and feeling to that , part- of the report which announced the death of an excellent man of their number who had sustained two scholarships , said he would answer for another scholarship , and then there would be no loss by the demise of their friend to the society . Another persoiit alluding to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By this time a delightful feeing was in the place ; zKt boastful and ostentatious but meek ao4 tJTBLlC MEETINGS* 87 subdued . I sought to catch a little of it , and to improve an evident occasion of usefulness . I rose , and spoke with brevity ; and proposed that if the meeting , under a sense of duty and gratitude , should be disposed to answer for nineteen scholaiships , I would answer for the twentieth . This , from a stranger , and he belonging to another section of the church , had an effect beyond any thing I could have expected . A tender spirit , and fror heaven , as I trust , came over the people . They rose in succession , and with deep emotion gave in their pledges till they had made up the nineteen , and secured me . Still , on the feeling went - and on it went , till no less than FORTT-FiVE SCHOLARSHIPS wcro taken . This , under all the circumstances , was the most remarkable meeting I had yet attended : the effort for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anointed and sustained it so admirable . " Surely God was in that place ! " Qne pleasing incident I must yet attach to this meeting . On the next morning I received a letter from a Mr. Jones , stating that he had been at the meeting - the ; pleasure he had in having been there - his pleasure at the participation of a stranger from the Old Country in the exercises ; and a request , expressed in the most handsome terms , that I would allow him to be responsible for my scholarship . This letter contained the check for the amount . The letter I value as a specimen of what is most courteous and generous in Christian , conduct . I should , perhaps , have remarked , that the public meetings , which ran through the week , and were attached to the Congregational body , were not only good ; they improved as they advanced . The last , the Foreign Mission , was excellent . From the state of the ifteeting , it was suggested to the managing powers that a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eveiiiiig , in Parkstreet Church . That large church was fulL I united with Drs . Cogeswell and Jenka and Mr. Blagden m leading the service . It was a delightful and solemn season . In the morning of this day , I pceached at the Old South Meeting : the places of worship here preserve their puritanic designation , although they have the form and aspect of a church , equally with Bow Church , Cheapside . The history of this place is curious and interesting , and shall receive more extended notice , as it deserves , should I hereafter find opportunity . It is , I believe , the original place ; and it is the only place which held fast the name of Christ , and kept itself pure ip the great defection . It is the place where Whitefield has preached , where the troops were quartered in the revolution , and where , to this day , a band of Christians have continued together , like the primitive saints , " to singhymns to Christ , to engage eadi other to commit no sin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for die light of a better day . It is like one of our good old ' churches , and is very Bicely kept . We had a double service , as the sacrament was to be administered . The attendance was large to both services ; full to the first , and about four hundzed conununicants at the table . The saints here retain more than ourselves , and for natural reasons , the puritanic form and precision . As a stranger , I was kindly supplied with the order of service . There were no less than seventeen things to be done in succession . Only twa deacons officiated on the occasion , but there was a full supply of cups and plates ; and as they merely conveyed them to one person in a given section of communicants , who passed it from hand to hand , the service was ae quickly , and perhaps more quietly done , than when many are employed . Nor do the deacons sit with the pKBStoiv as with us ; they come out fiK ) m tiieir respective seals , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befoxe him till he is xeady , . aQd on fulfilling esdi Rervice , letire to their eeats . The whole i about three lioura . AU the associations mude il to me an interesting season , and to the people , I trust , not wholly unprofitable . Mr. Matheson spent this Sabbath ax Dorchester , preaching foi Dr. Codnuut . While at Boston wa received an afTecIionate letter from the brethren at Plymouth and its neighbourhood , urging us to visit them . It was quite in our mind lo do so ; and on the Monday we went . It was about the aame distance as to Provuienee ; but the travelling was very different . In a run of forty-two miles we consumed seven hoius ; had to change coaches three tunes , and bioke down once . However , the country was all new and qwq But the tock - - the rock ' . I had a feveush desire to see it , and could rjot well address myself to any second thing till I had . Mr. Robins sympathized with the feeling , and kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such eiplansliond as might cool down our enthusiasm . This was considerate ; for if the impression were to be taken from present appearance only , it must be weak indeed . It is in the most unpoelical predicament imaginable . You look for a bold piece of rock-work , standing out in the ocean , distinct and alone , great in its own greatness ; instead of which , it is already under your feet ; small piera , for the use of the small craft , have been carried out over it and beyond it , and you require to examine the spot you occupy before you are assured that it is substantial rock . But what of all this ; it was the rock - the very rock still , which first offered a restingplace to the fool of the vfeary pilgrim ; which was first anointed by his tears and prayers , and which introduced him to " a wealthy place , " where he might dwell unscathed by the fires of persecution , and irresponsible to " the things that are God 's . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect and misdoings of the good people in this matter ; but for me , it did not need to be adorned with the palisade , the chisel , or the inscription , to make it interesting : I stood on it , and trembled as I stood . I know of no spot more sacred on earth , except the one spot where the Holy One suffered , " the just for the unjust . " We had wished only a social sendee , but we found that a public one had been fixed for the nBxt morning . We could not , however , stay over the morning of that day ; and in this difficulty , it was necessary to arrange as they could for it that evening . Although there was not an hour 's notice , the meeting-house was filled , and it would accommodate firom 700 to 800 persons . Unitarians and Universalists all came . The Rev. Mr. Conant , of the Baptist Church , offered prayer . The Rev. Mr. Boutelle then introduced us to the meeting , and addressed us in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his address ; and as it is short and appropriate , and may be taken as a specimen of the spirit in which we were received by the Christiajis of New-England , T think you will be pleased by its insertion : - " It is with heartfelt gratification , Rev. sirs , that ' we welcome you to this hallowed spot , where our forefathers first planted their feet - a spot hallowed by their sufferings and tears , their pious labours and sleeping dust . " We welcome you as descendants of the Puritans , - that noble race of men , who , during the sixteenth century , rose as benefactors of mankind , and in the midst of surrounding darkness , hung up , in mid heaven , the lamp of civil and religious freedom ; thus kindling a light which has been glowing ever since with a constantly increasing lustre , and which is destined to blaze on until its bright beams shall have illuminated every dark spot on earth . " Descended from the Puritans ourselves , we delight to cherish their memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posterity dwelling on the other side gf e water . /z/ ** Our ancestors were your ancestors ; your forefathers our forefathers ; we therefore are brethren . As such , most cordially do we welcome you . " As delegates from more than 1,600 Congregational churches in our father land , we welcome you . Contending as those churches are for religious toleration , for the faith of our common ancestors , and for that form of church polity /or which they so nobly struggled , we can not but feel a deep interest in your welfare . We pray for , we rejoice in your prosperity ; and we will strive to be coworkers in promoting essentially the same great objects . " As citizens of England , we welcome you - that land whence our Pilgrim Fathers came ; - that land of science , of literature , and of great national prosperity , where so much is doing for the cause of human freedom , for the advancement of pure religion , for the amelioration of the great family of man , and the ushering in of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we welcome you , and commend you to his favour and protection . " May Heaven smile propitiously on your mission , rendering it subservient to the interests of his kingdom , both in England and America , a &d; making it conducive to the strengthening of those cords , which should unite in one common brotherhood two nations , exerting a powerful influence on the destinies of the world . " Of course , we could do no less than acknowledge the address . The last address and the concluditig prayer devolved on me ; and we then united in singing the fine hymn in Watts - " Give me the wings of faith to rise , " &c.; I never saw so much of its beauty , for I never sung it in such appropriate and affecting circumstances . It was , on the whole , a remarkable service ; and was evidently deemed a considerable event in the history of this small and quiet town - an event , I trust , not without permanent advantages . As you will have a strong interest in this place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the township has a population of 5,400 persons . There are four orthodox Congregational places . having 1,200 hear- /z/ // en , and 400 communicants ; there is one Baptist , having about 350 hearers and 100 communicants ; there are one Unitarian and one Universalist , having together about 600 hearers and about 40 communicants . The schools are in proportion . About 600 of the males are sailors . In consequence of a neglect of pure religion , and a corresponding temptation to the use of ardent q ) irits , the people had sadly degenerated from the manners of their fathers ; bat there is now , in manners and in religion , a great change for the better . The Temperancir cause here has wrought most beneficially . Three fourths of the pauperism has been destroyed by it ; and last year , where so much liquor was once used , not one person applied ioT a license to sell it . Many might still have been fad of the profits ; but none was willing to inciur the iniiuny , for such it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits always visible to them , it is not wonderful if the good cause should have been , in some instances , pressed too far . We had oAen heard that many , in their zeal , had pledged themselves and each otiier to disuse tea , coffee , &c.; ; but had not met with such persons . There were many hera ; and our excellent hostess , at least , provided for such a state of things . At our teapservice , I observed that there were two pots , as usuaL When asked , which I wouldtake % I replied , " Tea and coffee , have you I** " No , , sir , " was the answer ; * the one is tea , and the oer is water . " And this arrangement was necessary ; for one half of the persons present , I should think , declined the tea , and took either water , or milk and water . The nelt morning , early , we visited the Court-House , the Pilgrim Hall , and the Burial-Giound . The first has nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Hall is a recent erection , and still unfinished . It is for the speeches on the commemoration days , and for the care of relics and curiosities . At present there are not many , nor do these demand to be noted . The Burial-Ground is unique . It is on the face of a rode hill above the town , and has , in a high de- F m , e a tongh , weathei-worn , old , and venerable aspect , the genealogical table of the whole people . Manyftf the dates go back almost to the first aettlore . It realizes , more than any thing , lo the mind , the whole story of tlwFaihers ; and , more than most things in this new country , it speaks of an olden lime - of men and tilings tliat were and are not , and have long gone by . Give it me fot elTecl before Pcre la Chaise . It is the grave , and nothing but the grave . It must be seen to be &lt; i and , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have coveted hours , minutes only were allowed roe . I hastened home , to prepare for leaving , and requested that wo might have a special act of prayer before we sepaialed . Our host brought all his family together from their various abodes - tluree generations . I urged him lo present our prayers ; and it viae welt I did : I might have forgot him othwwise ; I shall never forget him now . I think we all prayed ; certainly we were all inlerested . Other ministers and friends now arrived , erpeciiag our Slay ; but our coach was ready , and our calls imperative ; and at ten o'clock we left fot Boston . Soon our beloved friends were out of sight ; and soon Plymouth itself disappeared ; but neither the one noi the other will soon pass from memory . From this lime we stayed only a single day in Boston ; but I shall have more to say of this important and interesling city . This I wish , however , to reserve for a subsequent visit , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me lo do so wiih more matured knowledge . /z/ // LETTER Vni . My dear Friend , The reason of quitting the metropolis of New-England so soon , is to be found in some vaariation of plan . In consequence of the earnest representations made ' from Canada , we determined to visit that country ; and this made it needful to resolve on staying over the month of September , instead of returning in that month , as at first proposed . Throughout , I had determined to visit the West ; and it appeared that both visits might be moie safely made at the commencement , than at the close of the sununer . With these views , we prepared to move immediately in these directions ; and to reserve the month of September for a revisit to these States . We have much cause to be tiiankful that we came to these arrangements , as , quickly after we had- left the Canadas , the cholera swept ov the whole territory ; and the West , though dangerous to a foreigner when I was there , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . of the 5th , after rather exhausting services on the previous day , fof Burlington , which was to be a journey of three days . The coach arrangements at present have little regard to the convenience of the passengers . At the office , on inquiring at what time we were to start , the answer was , At four o'clock . " " And the next day V " At four o'clock . " " And the third day 1 " Still , at four o'clock . " And at four , of course it was necessary to be up at IfcMe . And all this was without advantage . We travelled on an average about seventy miles a day ; and urived each day in the afternoon . For lot have been two qwq Most of Ae way we had soaking rain . Tbe coach /q/ was of the ordinary kind , such as I have described it ; and though it is open and cheerful in fair weather , when it is closed on account of cold or heavy rain , it is dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , these occasions took one out of more select circles , and allowed you to look on the world in this country as ' it is , and from this circumstance they were desirable . The present was by no means an unfruitM occasion ; if we weitf shut up greatly from the objects on the roadside the companions of our journey supplied us , if not with edification , certainly with some entertainment . First of all , our coachman was a very saucy fellow ; he evidently thought himself better than one half of his passengers , and as good as the other half . I complained to him , when we stopped , that my luggage was getting wet . * ' Why , " he exclaimed , " you do nt expect to keep it dry such a day as this , do you V " Why , " I replied , ** it Uk the very sort of day in which ' it is your duty to keep it dry ! " " Ha , ha , it will be all right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eod , I found that it was soaked through . . He did , indeed , give some directions on the subject ; but the care of the luggage , has little attention here . When we stopped at Lowell , to change horses , a female wished to secure a place onward . We were already , as the phrase is , more than full ; we had nine persons , and two children , which are made to go for nothing except in the waybill . Our saucy driver 6 ) ened the door , and addressiiq twq men , who , with us , would have been outside passengers , " Now , I say , I want one of you to ride with me , and let a lady have your seat . " The men felt they were addressed by a superior , bujt kept - their places . " Come , I say , " he continued , ** yf ' shall have a good buffalo and wnbrelf and nothing wiB hurt you . Still they kept their places , and refused hink His lordship frti.tffended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jfty. ecking himself , exclaimed , Wbll , if I can getfflsitt , hang it , if PU take you on till one of you gets oot ! ' And there we stood f ( %some tin ; /z/ 76 A CffA &ACTER; and he gained his point , at , last , and in civiilei.tenns , b persuading the persons oh the middle seat to receive the lady ; so that we had now twelve inside . I name this as it occurred ; not as a sample of this class of men . Generally , they feel tiiat they owe you nothing ; but if they offer you . few attentionsr they seldopi offend you . This was the worst instance I met with , I think , at any time . Then within , crowded and almost saflfocated as we were , we had an old lady who did not fail to amuse us . She sat opposite me , and would force a conveition ; and as her voice was sharp and shrill , what was meant for me went to all , and diverted all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as another if we did bur duty ; andiier notion of duty was , to mind ; our own business . For her pan , she had always done so - she ridiculed those who employed others to do it for them-Hshe ceuld always do hers best for herself - she could make fifteen per cent of money - had small sums out now at ' fifteen per cent ; ' ' She fblt that this was not approved . ** Oh , she was not hard with the poor creatures - if they were pressed , she waitedy and lent them a tittle more , so that they could pay at last She had always been unmarried not for want of Qffers , but she liked her independence , and would relsent the offer of any man who would want to get her property . " I remaxked , that she had done well not to marry ; as a persoii like herself , who could do every thing so weU , could have no need of . a husband . " Right , right , sir , ' * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she continued , But I have a great deal of care ; and I often think I should Kke to retire , and be qoiet. ; and then I feel as though I could not be quiet - then I should have no fHend . I should want a friend if I retlxed-Tlse I could afford it , you know . ' ' ' * Q , I had no doubt of her having a handsome property . " ** O , no , sir , your joke is very pretty ; but I did not mean to say I was rich . I have somewhere or other about 7,000 dollars ; but I guess you have more money than all of us put together . " And thus she continued through li &; joumey . FIKB 8CEKB &r.; 7T never embarrassed , always prepared to meet jou in ply , and always satisfied with her own shrewdness . She was really a character - person , features , dress , ailbut a most pitiable one . A. greal usurer on a small scale ; the love of money had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her indifferent to a future world , and destroyed all that was feminine , tender , and benevolent . We reached Concord in the afternoon . Many of the brethren had arrived here to take their place in the meet* ing of the Pastoral Association . We took our repaet with them , and united in prayer , and then retired to our inn , as we had to start again early in the morning . ThiB next day we left for Royalton . It was a fine day , and we had a most delightM ride . I could peMr ceive that the previous ride offered some fine sceneij to the eye , but it was now evidently improving , and to enjoy it , I took my seat with the driver . The views on the borders of the Connecticut , and the Black and White rivers , are full of picture , and will compare with some of the good things on the Rhine ' and the Bangor road . The objectst are brought closer together than is common in this couhtry , and give fierce to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you jcould desire ; but I must not dwell upon them . Conceive of yourself running along the margin of a sweet river , sometimes in quiet , sometimee in gushing motion ; of undulating land , of green cornfields , of pretty cottages , of hill rising above hill , clothed with verdant and olive fir-trees , and of the Green Mountains of Vermont , lying in the distance , all placed in thetf best relations to eiach other ; and you will , in some gree , participate in the actual scenes . and pleasures of this ride . We passed through some interesting towns and villages . Ianover is one of them ; pleasantly situated , and reputed for its college . Montpelier is a young and thriving town , and is raising to itself a very handsome court-house . One office that we should deem considerable , however , remains on its old scale . It is a wooden loom , not a with its gable-end to the street ; tiie /z/ 78 iTHAKfiRS. . door was standiDg open , exhibiting a dQsk , table , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the label , Secretary of State A small plate With the word " Mntual** on it , now began to make its appearance over or on the doors . At it might be taken for the name of the resident ; but we soon fomid that there was an ensurance company bearing that designation . I was pleased to observe , that most of the detached dwellings had on them ) or near them , raised on a ' pole , a bird-cote for the use of the m'artiii , ' the wren , and the blue-birdl They were frequently a miniature representationr of the house itself ; and they were a grateflil assurance of the kind-heartedness of the people . Such habits are beau-v fifblly illustrative of that religion , which teaches us that CM. cares for the lowest work of his hands , and which commands us to be the cheerM ministers of his mercy towards them . - Sharon and Canterbury , also , are delightful locations . The latter is a Shaker settlement . I will not now detain you by setting down the extravagances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they repudiate max* nage , and the intercourse of the sexes : they can , therefore , only exist as an excrescence on society. ; They are a sort of Protestant monastery ; and their settlements are fed by similar causes . But , apart from their religious views , their economy , in its effects , is admirable . I have seen several of their establishments , and all of them , like this , are finely situated , finely cultivated , and in the best state of preservation . There are no farms like theirs ; and in the market their articles go by the name , and fetch a higher price in consequence . Their dwellings ' have the same character ; they are neat , clean , well painted and kept . The eye was refreshed by the spec* tacle , standing , as it did , in contrast with all around it ; and there was nothing to abate the satis &ction,; except tiiat the people did not look happy , and that - there were no children . ' We began now to meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is osiially sustained /z/ /q/ on fltone ot wooden uprights , and composed of trussed girders , with loose bosurding , and mostly with a roof to protect it from the weather . A notice is put up at each end , of No trotting orfer this bridge ; a most needfiil provtiiion , for certainly a good trot would bring some of them down . A few of the more important ones have been constructed ifecently on an excellent principle , and are very steady . They say you should ** speak well of the bridge thi carries you iafe oyer ; ** and certainly I never felt so much dispositioa to do a set of bridges justice , for while they always discharged their duty , they often ' left me wondering how they were able to do it . We met on this route with a great many Irish , who were passing from Canada to Lowell and Boston for emplojrment : many of them very poor , and suffering much . Those who still had some means clubbed togeUier and hired ft cart , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief in turn . One poor fellow , with bare and blistered feet , dnd haggard look , cast ft very imploring eye on me . I felt he was a countryman , and that we were both strangers in a strange land ; I cast him what little silver I had ; . and his " Grod bless your honour* ' touched my heart , for it spoke to me of home . The next day we were to reach Burlington . We had been charged to go by the Gulf road , as presenting some extraordinary scenery ; and I was rejoiced to find , that on this dxty the coach took that course . With high expectations I took my sdat again outside , much to the surprise of the coachman , as no one sits with him by choice . The- early ride TOgembled what occurred yesterday ; but differeiltly circumstanced . Heavy mists hung over the landscape , as if unjrilling to be compaiped with what was to follow . Then , as the day advanced , the sleeping mists began to expand and separate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unveiling all by turns , so as to clothe it with a bewitching loveliness . At length the features began to heighten and concentrate , and indicated that something greater was to come . As we ran down an inclined plane , the scene continiitd /z/ to thicken and rise about us , till we found ourselves in the very crevice of the gulf , shut up from every thing beside , - and with only room for our carriage and a smaLL slow stream to make their way through the surrounding brushwood . The gulf is three ' miles through ; it is composed of precipitous hills , running twice the height of tholse at CUfton ; they are much closer and finer clothed . At one point especially it is most striking . The sluggish water gathers life and tumbles over a rocky slope on which you stand , with sweet gushing sounds . You occupy a dell into which the sun never shines . Yoii look up on surrounding galleries of bold and beautiful hills , clothed all overvirith the bursting green foliage ' of spring , and mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine . The sun has risen in all his efiidgence on the upper world ; and his vivid lights shoot across the picture , so as to cover its higher parts with all his brilliancy , and to leave you in a state of distance and darkness which is felt and visible . It is , as a scene , perfect of its kind . But I know not that it is - now what it was then . As we began to ascend we found the hand of man busy in indiscriminate destruction . But I will not trouble you with unavailing lamentations . Orf getting free of the gulf , the scenery was still " good . One view especially was in contrast with it , and at that time of a very novel character . The hills still stood about you in grandeur . The forests had some years since been fired . Young timber had grown up in their stead ; but the blasted and black firs rose above all on the rocks and heights , tm of other generations , and gave , in an eminent degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the hour of noon , and every thiig supported the general impression . The indolent river seemed to sleep on the greensward . The woodman 's cot was deserted ; the door open ; the axe and billet lying on the threshold . Nor man , nor child , nor noi bird , was to be eeen or heard . Nothing broke on the . wiU of lliat hour but the distant cry of the bull-firog. /q/ qwq however , we had not got two miles from the iaOf before we reached what are called the Waterbury FaUs ; and a view was opened before us surpassing all that had been previously exhibited . But how shaU I make you see it % Let us try . A sweet smiling river is gliding . along , like a bed of quicksilver , at your feet . A- little below you , its quiet course is obstructed by a rock , which springs suddenly from its bed , and which is in place , form , and colour , among the finaat I have seen ; and it is crowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs off to the left with quickened motion but in friendly channels ; while , on the right , the other half has cut its passage through the rock , and is dashing down the ruin it has made . Beyond this obstructiony you see the two streams hastening to embrace each other , like sisters who have been separated and in trouble , but are one again . This is the foregrpund ; Then , on the one haAd , close on the Fall , rises abruptly rather a mountain than a hill , presenting you with a ledge of rock-work , by which you are to pass , overhanging the waters , overshadowed with trees , and suppljring you with a loop-hole to look out on the distant scenery . On the other hand , tiers of hills form themselves into receding and rising galleries , adorned with forests of the brightest and daricest hues . Before and beyond , others still spread themselves in the distance , in rival forms of loveliness , till at length the picture is qlosed by the fine outUne of the camel-backed mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of perspective ; the striking foreground is thrown up with surprising power ; while the eye reposes beyond it in fields of softened brightness and beauty . /q/ conntry ; and these sketches may possibly assist you to that acquaintance better than , means of more imposing pretensions . ' Early in the afternoon we came in sight of Burlington ; and below it lay the Lake Champlain , expanding in all its glory . Had I wished for anoUier scene this day to ' compare with the preyious ones , and yet of an entirely new character , I could hardly ha ? e had a better . . The town is excellently situated , for health , for appeaoce , and . for business ; and it is in a very thriving and advancing state . The boat by which we weie to cross . the lake to St. John 's , would not arrive tiU ten o'clock . We joined the evening meal at the iMe i'Adte ; and having looked Over the town and the bookstore , took a seat under the piazza of - the ion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me was animated and interest ing , but it hardly agreed with the quiet joys of the day . I found myself on one side of a square , which was the centre of bustle and parade to the good town of Burlington ; and being the last evening in the week , it was specially occupied . The inn itself was . very noisy . Numbers of youth who boarded here , had closed their labours , and were full of frolic . The boys were engaged in some of their stormy plays . One auctioneer had just finished , to his satisfaction , his moinitebank sale before the . door ; and another had just his noisy gibberish in a distant shop . Though distant , I could distinctly hear . His voice , in the t instance , answered the jurpose of a bell , to caU the people together , and it did it effectually . To hear him cry as he did ! " Six cents and a hal only six cents and a half ! What ! shall it go for six eents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Nobody bid any n ( iore - not another cent ! " That ever man should crack . ) iis voice , and emit a world of noise , about six cedU andahalf ! /z/ exhibit eithM his Umdem or himself ; how , fben , cmddht part with the admiration of the sqaare ? Ail were engaged ; but they seemed poorly engaged . One of the lakes in the world lay under their , eye in the last lights of evening- - no one saw it ! The bright and lovely stars were walking in silence over their heads , through the paths of heaven - no one admired them ! But I must check myself . The day had not disposed me to noise and bustle , and it was Saturday evening - a period usually given to . serious objects and absent ; * and I was in danger of being seveire on thi work-a-day world - so full of itself , . and so much withoift Crod ! From Burlington we passed into the Oanadas . . As the excursion into tins country will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point at which mt entered the Amorican territories . /z/ Mr BiAB Friknd , Now for the Falls ' * T% &; town of Niagara has no cop* nexion with the Falls of Niagtuot they are fifteen milai apart . We left the town , therefore , on the morning the d4th , deeming the ' time lost which kept us from t &e; great object of pursuit . The ride is very pleasant , by the side of the nver , which is im narrow and deep , compressed by hills on both oijitt and $nely fringed by fbrest trees . The land is gbojfr'ti this vicinity , and some of it in good keeping ; the roadside is verdant and is * made fragrant and cheerful by an abundance of sweet- - forier , which is growing nfid and was ihen in bloom . We passed through Queenstown , the heights of which- are made memorable and interesting by the gallant defence and lamented fall of General Brock , in the last nnhaplpy war . it /z/ is about IdO feet and must supply a fine view of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were eagerly looking out for some indications of the great wonder which we were so rapidly approaching . At length we saw the spray rising through the trees , and settling like a white cloud over them ; and then we heard the voice of the mighty waters - a voice all its own , and worthy of itself . Have you never felt a trembling backwardness to look on what you have intensely desired td see % If not , you will hardly understand my feeling . While all were now searching for some glance of the object itself , I was disposed to turn aside , lest it should surprise me . ThiSi no doubt , was partly caused by the remark I had so often heard , that Ibe first view disappoints you . I concluded , that this arose from the first view not beingka fair one , and I was determined te do justice to the object of my reverence . In fulfilling this purpose , I reached the Pavilion without sMng any thing ; disposed of my affairs therej and hasted down towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive my first impressions . Let any one pursue the same course , and he will not talk of first fBBpressions disappointing lum ; or if he should ; then He ought to go twenty miles anoer way . Niagara was not made for liim . From the Table Rock I descended to the base . Xbsre I clambered out on the broken rocks , and sat - I know not how long . The day was the least favourable oi any we had . The atmosphere was heavy ; the oam hn about the object and concealed one half of it ; and tiie.iRDd blew from the opposite side , and brought the spray upon you , so as to wet you exceedingly . The use of ck ) ak and umbrella yrere troublesome ; you could not wholly forget your person , and think only of one thing . However , had I not seen it m this state of the atmosphere , ' I should have wanted some views which now cupy my imagination . The whole is exceedingly solemn when nature frowns ; and when much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked the outline , there is a rnystSi* /z/ liousnesis spread over the object which suits your conception of its greatness , and in which the imagination loves to luxunate . I can scarcely define to you my impressions on this first day ; 1 can scarcely define thm to myself . I was certainly not disappointed ; but I Was confounded . I felt as though J had received a shock , and required time to - right myself again . I returned to the Pavilion , which is about half a mile om the Falls , and retiiftd to my chamber , which overlooked them . I mused on what I had seen , and was still confounded . I sought rest that I might be fresh for the morrow ; but rest did not come so freely . The continuous deep sounds of the waters would have sing me to sleep , but the tremour of the house and ground , which shook the windows like those of a stagecoach , kept wakeful ; and when 4 fell into slumbers , the flitting dreams of what I had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbances , I rose . on the next morning in good spirits . - The day was all that could be wished . The sun shining , the heavens transparent , garnished with bright and peaceful clouds . The wind , too , was gentle and refreshing ; and had shifted to our side , so as to promise thb nearest points of sight without the discomfort of getting wet through . I now looked fairly on the scene as it plresented itself at my window , in the fair lights of the morning . It is composed rather of the accompaniments of the fall than of the fall itself . You look up the river fuU ten miles , and it runs in this part from two to three miles in breadth . V Here it has formed in its passage , beautiful * little bays ; and there ' it has worked through the slips of mainland , putting out the fragments as , so many islets to decorate its surfkce ; while , on either hand , it is bounded by the original forests of pine . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more cerulean Ifeavens ; while nearer to you it becomes agitated , like a strong nm preparing to run a race . . It swells , and foams , and recoils , as though it were committed to some THE FALUk 87 desperate issue ; and then suddenly contracts its dip mensions , as if to gather up all its . power for the mighty leap it is about to iftake . This is all you see here ; and it is enpugh . . I left the hotel , and went down to the Table Rock . This is usually deemed the great point of sight ; and for an upper view it uhdoubtedly is . It is composed oi several ledges of rock , having different advantages , and . projecting as far over the gulf below as they can to be safe . But how shall I describe the objects before me I The mysterious veil which lay heavily yesterday on a large part of it , was now removed ; and the outline of the picture was mostly seen . An ordinary picture would have suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast , and so far beyond what the eye has measured , that to see them is not to fetter , but to . assist the imagination . This fall , which is called the Horseshoe Fall , is upwards of 2,000 feet in extent , and makes a leap , on an aversige , of about 200 feet . Now just enlarge your conceptions to these surprising dimensions , and suppose yourself to be recumbent on the projecting rock which I have named , as near the verge as you dare , and I will assist you to look at the objects as they present themselves . You see not now above the cataract the bed of the river ; but you still see the foaming heads of the rapids , like waves of the ocean , hurrying to the precipice ; and oVer them the light clouds which float , on the horizon . Then comes the ckuie itself . It is not in the form of the horseshoe ; it is not composed of either circular or straight lines ; but it partakes of both ; and throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazing variety of form and aspect . ' With aU this variety it is one . It has all the power which is derived from unity , and none of tle stiffness which belongs to uniformity . There it falls in one dense awful mass of green waters , unbroken and resistless ; here it is broken into drops , and faUs like a sea of diamonds sparking in the sun . Now it shoots forth like rockets ift endless succession ; aM now it is so light and foaming that it dan- 8B THB PAIlJi. m. tfi0 ran u it goes , and before it has reached the pool it is driTen up again by the ascending currents of air . Tlien there is the deep expanding pool below . Where the waters pitch , all is agitation and foam , so that the tec of the fall is never seen ; and beyond it and away , the waters spread themselves out like a rippling sea of liqnid alabaster . This last feature is perfectly unique , and you would think nothing could add to its exquisite loveliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made for each other , ' ' heaven own bow. ** O never had it , in heaven itself , so fair a resting-place ! Besides , by reason of the different degrees of rarity in the waters and the atmosphere , the sun is pervading the whole scene with unwonted lights and hues . And the foam which is flying off in all directions , is insensibly condensed , and forms a pillar of cloud , which mioves over the scene , as it once did over the tents of Israel , and apparently by the same bidding , giving amazing va riety , and sublimity , and unearthliness to the picture . Then there is sound as well as sight ; but what sound ! It is not like the sea ; nor like the thunder ; nor like any thing I have heard . There is no roar , no rattle ; nothing sharp or angry in its tones ; it is deep , awful , one ! Well , as soon as I could disengage myself from this spot , I descended to the bed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till I have availed myself of the very lowest standing it supplies ; it is there usually tiiat you become susceptible of its utmost power . I scrambled , therefore , over the dislocated rocks , and put myself as near as possible to the object which I wished to absozb me . I was not disappointed . There were now fewer objects in the picture ; but what you saw had gireater prominence and power over you . Every thing ordinary - foliage , trees , hills - was shut out ; the smaller attributes of the fall were also excluded ; and I was left alone with its own greatness . At my feet the Waters were creaming , swelling , and dashing away , as if in terror , from the scene of conflict , at die rate of twenty miles an hour . Above and overhanging qwq I found that there was a amall lei of rock behind diis fall , and ventured on it to about the centre . You can Bland here without getting at all wet ; the waters shoot out several feet before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is entirely safe . I need not say that the novelty and beauty of the situation amply rewanl you . You are behind the sheet of water , and the sun is shining on its face , lUmninBting the whole body with a variety propor- /z/ tioned to its density . Here , before yon , the heavy waters fall in unbroken columns of bright green . - There , they flow down like a shower of massy crystals , radiant with liiht , and emitting as they fall all the prismatic colours ; while there , again , they are so broken and divided , as to resemble a shower of gems sparkling in light , and shoot* ing across the blue heavens . I passed by what is called Goat Island to the extremity of the Horseshoe Fall on this side . Thre is carried out over the head of this fall a limb of timber , with a hand-rail to it . It projects some 12 feet over the abyss , and is meant to supply the place of the Table Bock on the other side . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is quite as safe , it gives you far less sense of safety , it disposes you the more to sympathize with objects of terror . Indeed , when you fairly get to the extremity , and find yourself standing out in this world ef waters on a slip of wood only large enough for yoqr feet to rest on , and which is quivering beneath you ; when the waters are rushing down under you ; when the spray is flying over you ; and when the eye seeks to fathom the unfathomable and boisterous gulf below ; you have , perhaps , as much of the terrible as will consist with gratification . Very many of the visiters never think of encountering this point of view : those who do and have a taste for it will never forget it . It is among the finest of the fine . In returning , I wandered round the little island . It is covered with forest-trees of a fine growth , and is full of picturesque beauty . Days might be spent here in happy and deep seclusion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature , and the musie of the sweetest waters ; and in fellowship , at wiU , with the mighty Falls . The next morning was the last ; and it was given wholly to the Great Fall : I prepared , in the first instance , to go behind it . This is the chief adventure ; and is by most writers described as dangeroiis . There is no dan ger if the oreifaangiDg rocks keep their places , and if yoa /z/ have moderate self-poMession . I made use of the oil-cloth insa provided by tiie guide , and waa quarrelling with it as damp and uncomfortable ; but that grievance was quickly disposed of . I had not made my entrance behind the scenes before I was drenched , and the less I had on the better . However , it was an admirable shower-bath ; and there was an end to the question of wet or dry . * Take care of your breath , " was the cry of the guide ; and I had need , for it was almost gone . On making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved . . Now give me your hahd , * ' said the guide ; " this is the narrowest pan. ** Onward I went , till he assured me that I was on Termmaition Rock ; the extreme point accessible to the foot of man . As the labour of the foot was over , and there was good standing , I determined on making the best use of my eyes . But this it was not so eksy to do . The spray and waters were driving in my face , and coursing dovm my sides most strangely : a strong wind from the foot of the fall was driving in the bpposite direction , so as to threaten not to blow me down , but to blow me up to the roof of the vault . However , I soon ascertained that we were at the extremity of a oavem of large and wonderful construction . It is in the form of a pointed arch ; the one span composed of rolling and dense water , and the other of livid black rocks . It was some 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , and I had entered about 70 feet . On the entrance , which is mostly of thinner waters , the sun played cheerfully , and wi glowing power ; but within it was contrasted By the dim light and heavy obscurity which are generated by the density of the fall , to which the whole power of the sun can give only a semi-transparency . What with this visible gloom , the stunning noise of the fall , and the endless commotion of wind and waters , the effect is most singular and awful . It is a scene that would harmonize with the creations of Fuseli ; and it has , I will venture to say , real horrors beyond what the cave of old . olus ever knew . /z/ On retulming to my dressiiiff-room , I reoeived a certificate from the guide that I had reaUy been to Terminatioii Rock ; a ridiculous device to give importance to his vocation , but ii the success of which he does not miscalculate on human nature . The rest of the morninff was employed in taking peeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Table Rock , and at the foot of the Great Fall . The day was ezcsedingly fine , and every feajtuise of the amazing scene was lighted up with an its beauty ; and I now conmiuned with it as one would with a friend who has already afforded you rich enjoyment in his society . I was deUghted - was fascinated . Every thing , apart or together , seemed to have acquired greater power and expression . I studied all the parts ; they were exquisite , lovely , noble ; I put them all together , and it overwhelmed me , subdued me , fixed me to the spot . Long I stayed ; but all time was short I went ; and returned ; and knew not how to go .. I have been thus particular in my account of these Falls , because the world knows nothing like them ; and because I wished you to participate in my pleasures . I have seen many fiedls , and with unspeakable delight ; but nothing to be named with this . It would in parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not supjply a just idea of it . It-is better to see it than a thousand ordinary sights ; they may revive sleeping emotions , and go bring delight ; but this creates new emotion , and raises the mind a step higher in its conceptions of the power and eternity of iHim whom " to know is life etemaL ' * The day on which it is seen should be memorable in Ihfi life of any man . I am sorry , in- closing , that I can not 3ay much for the taste either of the visiters or inhabitants of this spot . The visiters seemed to regard the Falls rather as an object of curiosity than otherwise ; and when they had satisfied their curiosity ( which in most cases was very quickly done ) , and could report that they had seen them , the duty was discharged . Such persons drove in on the momingf explored for a couple of hours , dined , and hunied awa /z/ Or , if they stayed , they had had enough of Niagara , and they made an excursion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , is full of miserable trash ; it is a sad contrast to the album at Chamouni . With the residents I am half disposed to be angry . On the American side they have got up a shabby town , and called it Manchester . Manchester and the Falls of Niagara ! A proposition has been made to buy Groat Island , and turn it into a botanical garden , to inhprove the scenery - and such scenery ! On the Canadian side , a moneyseeking party have bought up 400 acres , with the hope of erecting " The City of the Falls ; * ' and still worse , close on the Table Rock , some party was busy in erecting a mill-dam ! One has hardiy patience to record these things . ' The iiniverssd voice ought to interfere , and prevent them . Niagara does not belong to them ; Niagara does not belong to Canada or America . Such spots should be deemed the property of civilized mankind ; and nothing should be aUowed to weaken their efficacy on the tastes , the morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SKAR FaiKND , Ha VINO paused so long with you at . the Falls , we must move forward with the greater celerity . We left on the 36th for Buffalo . The ride is still along the Niagara , and is very pleasing . On coming opposite the Black Rock , we had to cross the river by the ferry-boat . This boat Was constructed on the principle of the steant boat ; but the moving power was obtained from horses , as more economical on a small scale . The water-wheels were driven by a horizontal wheel , which was impelled by four horses . It was provided with an upward face large enough for the horses to stand on ; they were /z/ tened by traces to a fixed bar , so that when they were in motion , instead of ad ? ancing , they thrust the wheel backward . BuffalQ is a beautiful town , situated on rising ground , at the junction of the river and Lake Erie ; and it is thriving almost beyond Jxample . In the year 1814 , it was entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is said only one house was left standing ; and this was saved by a remarkable adventure on the part of an old woman , who still Uving . Seeing every thing in ruin and in flames around her , and made desperate by the thougtafc of her dwelling meeting the common fate , she resolved to enter the camp of the adversary , and , plead her cause In fulfilling this determination , she supplied herself with a broomstick , tied a white hanjIU kerchief to it , made her way to the sentinels , and dbmanded an audience of the commanding officer . She was not in a temper to subinit readily to denial ; , and at lenffth she sticceeded . She represented to him , with the feeling and tatis which the occasion awakened , that she was a poor widow ; that she had many fatherless children ; that the house was all that the fathe/ had left to them ; that it had hitherto sustained them ; but that if it were destroyed , they were all utterly ruined . The house W$ spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of the war , the Congress voted 80,000 dollars to atone for the losses sufiered . This gava , in union with the indignation natural to the sufferers , great life to the efforts for restoring the town ; and it quickly rose , like another pheniz , from the flames . Advancing commerce , however , has done more for it than aiqr other cause . In 1825 it had only a population of 2,300 ; now it amounts to 12,000 ! . The JBagle Hotel , at vichich we stayed for the night , is excellent . The Rev. Mr. Eaton , with whom we had met at the public meetings , showed us kind attentions . The morning of the ensuing day we left by the steamboat . We had no sooner got on board than we foun4 that there was a strong opposition between this and LAKE ERiy. 95 another boat . Our boat actually stayed an hour and a half after time , to get the other out , that it might race with it . Some of . us remonstrated ; but the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our vMsel was compelled to start first ; but still not to abandon its purpose . It moiled quietly down Ae creek , and beyond the pier , with the other boat in its rear ; it then described a fine circle in ' the water , and thus brought itself fairly alongside of its antagonist , and thus gave it chayenge ' on equal terms . Great and hazardous effort was now made on each side , the advantage being on ours . . The other boat , after running us close , though ttill faUing behind , either feigned* to have or had an accident wi her machinery , and suddenly stopped in the waters . We had no reason to think the occurrence serious to the passengers ; and were not sorry to pursue our path on the waters unattended by this troublesome spirit of rivalry . My wonder was that the passengers , including judges and governors , should have been such mute witnesies of thse liberties in public conveyances . We werp now advanced some ' thirty miles on the boaom of Lake Erie . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other it was from two to four miles distant .. The dimensions of these larger lakes are often quoted by travellers as pledges sufficient of thpir intexilft .4. and grandeur ; but , as you know , these properties ae * ofteh in the inverse proportion to the dimensions . These waters , for instance , are too vasx to iupply you with the picturesque , and they are too small - to supply you with the grandeur of the ocean . They are invsduable , hovvever , as ' the highways of commerce ; or rather , they have become so since the use of steam as a motive powejr . ' The average voyage to Detroit used to be three weeks ; it is now four days . Six years ago there were only five steamboats on this lake ; there are now thirtyfive . In the last year 1833 , 100,000 persons were transported across these waters ; ' and , what is remarka- * " / ble , two thirds of that ilumber were natives . The boat which was conveying us , is 9he /z/ // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all jexcellent . Mr. Pratt , a proprietor , was on board . He was . very obliging . He allowed no spirits to be on the table ; and requested me to implore a blessing on our repast . Tiiis was the first occasion in which I had known it done at a public meal . Our company was very miscellaneous , but , on the whole , agreeable . We had , particularly , some interesting conversations with Judg% Wilkinson on important subjects , and the Western country . There were some tradesmen on board , who , on reaching home , would have made a journey of from 3,000 to 3,000 miles to go to market . After a run of about forty miles , we came to Dunkirk , a small town on the left bank , where we were to deposite passengers and take in wood . Stillman , a worthy and discreet minister of the Baptist communion , who had been lately settled here , came on board. - I embraced the passing opportunity to learn something of the religious state of the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were three places of worship ; Presbyterian , Methodist , and Baptist . When the settlement was much smaller , and before they could get churches erected , it was found that the people 's morals were relaxing , and that many who came to settle refused to do so . Those , therefore , wh , o had a worldly interest in the place , united with the religious in building churches . In this way , six persons of worldly habits and views had agreed at first to sustain him They had , in the last winter , which was a season of revival , been converted , and were at thi time building him a church . Thus it is that " the earth " is made to ** help the woman , " and in doing bo becomes less earthly . In the eTening " of the day we reached Erie ; the place at which , by jurevious agreement , Mr. Matheson and myself were to separate . He thought this the best opportunity of visiting a relative in Pennsylvania ; and as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more trying ' region . Indeed , the reports from the West had been discouraging ; and , under the dreamStances , /q/ I did not feel at liberty to urge him when it might have been to his injury . For myself , my mind was fixed . It was indispensable to our duty , not that both , but Uiat one of us should see as much of the West and South as possible . #@# We parted , therefore , in the expectation , if life were preserved , of " meeting at Pittsburgh . , As the night shut in , we passed by Portland , a still younger settlement , but very promising . It is chiefly remarkable for a lighthouse , brilliantly lighted from a burning spring , full three quarters of a mile from the spot* In the morning we paused at Cleaveland . This is a great thoroughfare for the West : . and it was here that I originally intended to debark . But on finding I should still be sure of convejrances by going on to the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would supply me with better opportunities of seeing the State of Ohio . The remainder of the passage was . made pleasant by the conversation of a minister of tliat State , who was returniiig to his charge . There had been recently two revivals ' in his and other congregations . Generally , they occur- ' red in the following way . &#9632; In the first , concern came over the minds of a few Christians for a better state of religion . They met with him for prayer ; and agreed to visit , and converse , and pray with the people . While the feeling and acting , the monthly conference of ministers and elders came round to this place . Report was made of the state of the churches ; and the awakened state of the people at the place of meeting was in turn reported . All weie much impressed . The preaching and prayers received their character firom iL The effect wiui very general and very good . Many became tndy serious n ; and for six months afterward , there wete instances of religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of an aged woman , a member of the church , and " a mother in Israel . " She had children : they were now Vol . I. - E 9 /z/ grown up and settled in life ; but , notwithstanding all her instructions and prayers , they had become exceedingly worldly , and during her lifetime , disregarded serious religion . Her death , however , did what her life failed to do . Her eldest daughter was much affected by the event , %nd by the painful reflections it brouglt with it . She was visited and conversed with . Her husband came in. at the time ; and the conversation , without changing its character , naturally turned to him ; and the season justified a , pointed address , and he also fell under the force of salutary conviction . Another son , who was brought from New- York to the funeral , and who had been conspicuous in the infidel club of that city , became fearfully convicted of sin , and was driven to temporary despair ; but in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great earnestness and decision . In such a rural population , these things . Would not be done in a comer , but woiild be known to all . They had a very beneficial effect on many ; and the good minister sought a careful improvement of the dispensation . The effect On this family was , that five of the seven children were united to the church ; and the effect of the two seasons of revived influence was , that about one hundred persons gave good " reason of the hope that was in them. ** No peculiarity of method was adopted here ; and the anxious seat was not used . At present , I merely record facta . In the middle of the day we reached Sandusky , at which place I separated from the boat . It is prettily situated on the margin of a small bay ; and the country lies well and quietly around it . It has not more than 700 or 800 inhabitants ; but it is nevertheless . a city , with its corporate rights and offkrs . Of course there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor and council , and they are , therefore , small men ; but they are in keeping . With the plade and people , and that is more than one could say of the lord mayor an aldermen of the city of London , if they should be here . It is truly a city in a forest ; for the large stumps of the original pines are still standing in the main street , and /q/ over the spots that have been cleared for settlement , the new wood is springing up with amazing vigour , as if to defy the hand of man . I went to the best inn in the town . It was not such as one could boast of ; but it had been better , had it been daaner . It was , however , welcome . to me , as a heavy thunder-storm was just beginning to put forth its tremendous power . When seated at the table of the refectory , in search of refreshments , I congratulated myself on my safety ; but my confidence was quickly moderated , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came spattering down the walls of the room in strange style . By-the-by , few things seem to be water-proof here . A second time , my luggage has been soaked through . I had placed it under the upper deck of the vessel as a place of perfect security ; but it was van . A searching rain came on in the night ; the deck leaked , and my portmanteau suffered . However , I had made up my mind , in starting , not to be disturbed by any thing that might be injured , lost , or stolen on the way : a precaution that had certainly more wisdom in it than I was aware of ; for , without it , I might have had a pretty good share of disturbance . Already much was injured , and some was stolen : of the future I could not speak ; but , if things went on in the same promising manner , I had the prospect of being returned to New- York in a coatless , ' shirtless , and very bootless condition . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterians , and the other for the Episcopal Methodists ; The fmst is wiUiout a minister ; and neither of them in a very flourishing state . They stand on the greensward ; they are about thirty feet square , and for want of paint , have a worn and dirty aspect . The good people here reverse the Dutch proverb ; it is not " Paint coss nothing , " but " Wood costs nothing ; " and they act accordingly , ' They will , however , improve with the town ; and at present they offer accommodation enough for its wants ; but half the adult population certainly go nowhere* . /z/ Indeed , the state of religious and moral feeling was evidently very lovrhere . For the first time I overheard obscene conversation ; and I heard more swearing and saw more Sabbith-breaking than 1 had before witnessed . There Were many Groceries , as they call themselves , here ; Groggeries , as their enemies call them ; and they were all 11 . Mannei , which are consequent on religion and morality , ' were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . introduced to a new state of things , , which demanded my best attention . Having rested here . over the Sabbath , I arranged to leave by coach early in the morning for Columbus . We were to start , I was told , at three o'clock ; I rosef therefore , at two . Soon after I had risen , the bar*agent came , to say that the coach was ready , and would start in ten minutes , as the rain had made the roads bad . This was rather an ominous as well as untimely intimation . But there was no remedy ; so I made what haste I could in dressing , and went down to take my place . I had no sooner begun to enter the coach , than splash went my foot in mud and water . I exclaimed with . surprise . ' ' " Soon be ' dry , sir , " was the reply ; While he withdrew the light , that I might not explore the . cause of complaint . The fact was , that the vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-tight , and the rain had found an entrance . There was , indeed , in this coach , as in most others , a provision in the bottom , of holes , to le off both water and dirt ; - but here the dirt had become mud , and thickeAed about the ori &ces; so as to prevent escape . I found I was the only passenger ; the morning was damp and chilly ; the state of the coach added to the sensation ; and I eagerly looked about for some means of protection . ' I drew up the wooden windows ; out of five small panes of glass in the sashes , three were broken . I endeavoured to secure the curtains ; two of them had most of the ties broken , and flapped in one 's face . There was no help in the coach ; so I looked to myself . I made the best use I could of my garments , and put myself as snugly as I could in the comer of a stage meant Russell 's tavern . 101 to accommodate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most cheerful . I could see nothing ; everywhere I could feel the wind drawn in upon me ; , and as fyt sounds , I had the calls of the driver , the screeching of the wheels , and the song of the bull-frog , for my entertainment . But the worst of my solitary situation was to come . All that ' had been intimated about bad roads now came upon me . They were not only bad ; they were intolerable : they were rather like a stony ditch than a road . The horses , on the first stages , could only walk most of the way ; We were frequently in to the azletree , uncertain whether we should ever get out ; and I had no sooner recovered from a terrible plunge on one side , than there came another in the opposite direction , and confounded all my efforts to preserve a steady sitting . I was literally thrown about like a balL How gladly should I have kept fixed possession of that comer , which I at first occupied With some degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads for this journey , by stating , in illustration , that , with an empty coach , and four horses , we were seven hours in going twenty-three miles ; and that we were twenty-eight hours in getting to Columbus , a distance of 110 miles . Yet this line of conveyance was advertised as a " splendid line , equal to any in the States . " At . ' six o'clock we arrived at Russell 's Tavern , where we were to take breakfast . I was quite as glad of the respite as of the meal . This is a nice inn ; in good order , very clean , and the best provision . There was an abundant supply ; but most of it was prepared with butter and the frying-pan ; still there was good coffee and eggs , and delightful bread . Most of the family and the driver sat down at table , and the two daughters of our host waited on us . Mr. Russell , as is commonly the case in such districts , made the occupation of innkeeper subsidiary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm from the door , and it was really a fine picture ; the soil so good , the ground so well kept , and /z/ the young crops so blopming and promising in the midst of the desert . From the . gBod manners of this family ) and from the good husbandry and respectable carriage of - the father , I hoped to find a regard for religion here . I turned to the rack of the bar , and found there three books ; they were , the Gazetteer of Ohia , Popular Greography , and the Bible ; they all denoted , intelligence . ; the last was the most used . This was as I expected , and as it should be . Things now began to mend with me ; daylight had come ; . the atmosphere was getting warm and bland ; I had . the benefit of a good breakfast ; the road was . in some measure improved ; it was possible to look abroad , and every thing was inviting attention . We were now passing over what is called the Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you know , conspicuous among its phenomena . I will not burden you by my speculations on the subject , except to say they are certsdnly of vegetable formation ; and it may , I conceive , be readily determined by what processes .. The first impression did not please me so much as I expected . The soil when recovered is h6h , and the staple strong ' ; but in its natural state much of it is inclined to be wet and boggy . It is fiat ; it is covered with a thick , coarse , knotted grass , and in the near view is prettily coloured by the bright colours of the rose , the fiag , the marigold , the dwarf Willow , and the lupin , which is ' here a little shrub . It rather interests by its singularity , than otherwise . If there be any . other source of interest , it may be found in its expansion over k wide region . In this respect it has been compared with the sea ; but it can only suffer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity of the ociean . Specimens of the real log-hut , with its proper accompaniments , weire beginning to appear . It is composed of stems of timber unbarked , and in their rough state , of from ' six to nine inches in diameter . These are notdied at the extremities to receive each other , and are laid on till they get ten or twelve feet above the gioand ' ; . they /q/ then shoot off to form the gables . The roof is composed of loose boarding ( not amounting to , shingle ) , and it is kept in'its place against wind and rain by stems , similar to those already used , laid lengthwise , at about two feet apart . They commonly afford two small rooms , and show a door and window in front . At one end there is a projection for a fireplace ; it is carried up . distinctly from the base , and is mostly constructed of a rude sort of lath , and coated with day . In case of fire it can be instantly knocked down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not look amiss in the picture , although they are far behind Switzerland . But where shall we find any thing of its class so picturesque a ; the Swiss cottage t These huts , such as I have described , cost , in the erection , about twenty-eight dollars . Let m also add as an assistance to your judgment , that land here is worth about two dollars and a half per . acre ; . and you may get a piece of five acres cleared , and a good eightrailed fence round it , for forty dollars . Most of the recent settlers along thi6 road seem to be Germans . We passed a little settlement of eight families , who had airived this season . They were busily enraged in clearing their land and getting up a shelter for the winter . The log-house is the only description of house in these new a , nd scattered settlements . I passed one occupied by a doctor of medicine ; and another tenLnted by to bachelors , one of . them being a judge . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It now appeared in all its pristine state and grandeur , tall , magnificent boundless . I had been somewhat disappointed in not finding vegetation , develop itself in larger forms in NewEngland than with us ; buttiiere was no place , for disappointment here . I shidl fail , however , to give you the impression it makes on one . Did it arise from height , or figure , or grouping , it might readily be conveyed to you ; but it.arisea chiefly from combination . You must see it in all its stages of /z/ decay , dissolution , and regeneration ; you must see it pressing on you and overshadowing you by its silent forms , and at times spreading itself before you , like a natural park ; you must see that all the clearances made by the human hand bear no higher relation to it than does a mountain to the globe ; you must travel in it in solitariness , hour after hour , and day after day , frequently gazing on it with solemn delight , and occasionally casting the eye round in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any , before you can fully understand the impression . Men say there is nothing in America to give you the sense of antiquity ; and they mean that as there are no works of art to produce this eff6ct , there ' can be nothing else . Tou can not thiic thai I would depreciate what they mean to extol ; but I hope you will sympathize with me , when I say that I have met vriih nothing among the most venerable forms of art , which impresses you so thoroughly with the idea of indefmite distance and endless continuity ; of antiquity shrouded in all its mystery of solitude , illimitable and eternal . The . clearances , . too , which appeared in this ride , were on so small a scale as to strengthen this impression , and to convey distinct impressions of their own . On them the vast trees of the forest had been girdled to prevent the foliage from appearing to overshadow the ground ; and the land at their feet was grubbed up and sown with com , which was expanding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indian com were strangely contrasted with the huge thmks of the pine and oak , and the verdant surface below was as strangely opposed to the skeleton trees towering above , spreading out their leafless arms to the warm sun and the refreshing rains , and doing it in vain . Life and desolation were never brought closer together . It appeared , in this moming ride , that the storm which passed over Sandusky had spent its power chiefly on this road . I passed by a spot where it had been very destractive . A man had been kiUed by the lightning , luad two cottages crushed by the falling timber* A roa4 trORM IN THE FOREST . 105 crossing ours was entirely stopped by the fallen trees ; and along our course they were lying great in ruin . This variety in the scene has a surprising effect upon you ixi such circumstances . In travelling through these dense and elevated forests , jou are awed by a deep sense of their power and majesty ; but here was a Power , to which their resistance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the ground . Like Niagara , it puts you surprisingly near to Deity . The storm in the forest is not only awful ; it is very dangerous . Eyen in a full wind there is considerable danger . A great portion of the trees are always in differt stages of decay . They creak and groan in the wind , and with every gust they come dashing , like the avalanche to the earth . About noon we arrived at a little town , and stopped at an inn , which was announced as the dining-place . My very early breakfast , ' and mj violent exercise , had not indisposed me for dinner . But en I inquired for it , J was told that none was prepared , as it was not often wanted . This was modified by an offer to " get something ready , " which I willingly accepted . It took some time but it was a very poor affair . The chief dish was ham fried in butter - originally hard , and the harder for frying ; I tried te @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained bread , cheese , and cranberries ; and of these I made my repast . While here , a German woman , one of the recent settlers , passed by on her way home . Her husband had taken the fever and died . She had come to buy a coffin for him , and other articles of domestic use at the same time . She was now walking home beside the man who bore the coffin ; and with her other purchases under her arm . This was a sad specimen either of German phlegm , or of the hardening eiSect of poverty . Here also was a set of Mormonites , passing through to the " Far West . " They are among the most deluded fanatics ; and profess to be obeying a prophecy , in quitting the East , and seeking their millennium beyond the /z/ Mississippi . A gentleman inquired of one of them , why they left their own country ? " O , " he said , " there it ruin coming on it , " - " How do you know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " How was it revealed to you ? " - ** I saw five letters in the sky . " - " Indeed ! what were they 1 " - " F A M I N , " was the reply ; a reply which created much ridicule , and some profanity . We now took in three persons- who were going on to Marion . I had the benefit of a- better balanced coach ; but this was all the advantage arising from the change . One was a colonel ; though in mind , mannerd , and appearance , among the plainest of men . Another was a lawyer and magistrate ; and the third was -a considerable farmer . All of them , by their staljon and avocations , ought to have been gentlemen ; but , if just terms are to be applied to them , they must be the opposite of . this . To " me , they were always civil ; but among thefnselves they were evidently accustomed to blasphemous and corrupt conversation . The colonel , who had admitted himself to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose restraints on himself and companions ; but he gained very little credit for them . I was much grieved and disappointed , for I had met with nothing so bad . What I had witnessed at Sandusky was firom a different and lower class of persons ; but here were the first three men in respectable Ufe with whom I had met in this State ; and these put promiscuously before me - and all bad . It w &s; necessary to guard against a hasfty " and prejudiced conclusion . On reaching Marion I was released from my unpleasant companions . I had to travel through most of the night , but no refreshment was provided . I joined ina meal , that was nearly closed by another party , and prepared to go forward at the . call of the driver . I soon found I was to be in different circumstances . We were nine persons , and a child , within . Of course , - after having been tossed about in an empty coach all day , like a boat on the ocean , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my corner ; but when I /q/ got fairly pinned in - sides , knees , and feet - the hard &#9632; eat and the harder ribs of the coach , began to search out my bruises , and I was still a sufferer . However , there were now some qualifying considerations . The road wa improving , and with it the scenery . I had come for fifty miles over a 4ead flat , with only one inclination , and that not greater than the pitch of Ludgate*-hil ; the land was now finely undulated . My company , toO ) though there was something too much of it , was not objectionable ; some of it was pleasing . There were among themy the lady of a judge and her daughter . The mother was affable and fond of conversation . She was glad we had such agreeable society in the stage , as " that did not always happen . " She talked freely on many subjects , and sometimes , as became a judges lady , of refinement and education ; but she did it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken . As the night shut in , and her daughter appeared to be getting drowsy , she challenged her to sing . Mary was not disposed to comply . It made little difference to mamma ; for she , without the least embarrassment , struck up and sang off , very fairly , " Home , sweet home . " This was all unasked , and before strangers ; yet none were surprised but myself . I name this merely as a point of manners . The lady herself was unquestionably modest , intelUgent , and , as I think , pious . At nelrly one o'clock , we arrived at Delaware . Here I was promised a night 's rest . You shall judge whether that promise was kept or broken . There was no refreshment of any kind prepared or offered , so we demanded our lights to retire . The judge 's lady and daughtfer were- shown into a closet , called a room . There was no fastening to the door , and she protested that she would not use it . I insisted that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gained was a proposition " to fetch a nail , and she could nail herself in , and be snug enough . " I was shown into a sinul$ur closet . There were no dxesaing accommodations . I repaired them , and was /z/ told that those things were in common below . I refiifted to use them ; and at length , by showing a little firmness and a little kindness , obtained soap , bowl , and towel . I dressed . By this time it was nearly two oclock . I was to be called at half past two ; and I threw myself on the bed to try to leep , with the soothing impression that I must awake in half an hour . At half past two I was summoned ; and having put myself in readiness , and paid for a nights lodging , I was again on my way . The day broke on us pleasantly , and the country was very beautiful . We forded the Whetstone , a lively river , which ornamented the ride ; e passed through Worthington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good college ; and arrived at Columbus , the capita , at nine o'clock . /z/ My dear Friknd , Columbus has a good location in the heart of the State ; it contains about 4,000 persons , and is in a very advancing condition . This indeed is true of all the settlements in this State ; and you will hardly think it can be otherwise , when I inform you , that forty years ago there were only 500 persons in the whole territory , and that now there are above a million . The inn at which we stopped is the rendezvous of the stages . Among others there were two ready to start for Cincinnati . Our coach , by arriving at nine instead of eight , deprived me of the hour which should have been given to dressing and breakfast . If I went on , I must of necessity go on immediately . Time was precious , and I resolved on going . On seeking to engage my place , the inquiry was , * Which will you go bj air ; /z/ the fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slow line , I exclaimed , . " 0 , the fast line , certainly ! I quickly found myself enclosed in a good coach , carrying the mail , and only six persons inside . In this journey we had hut three . In demanding to go by the fast line , I was not aware of all the effects of my choice . It is certainly a delightful thing to move with some rapidity over a good road , but on a bad road , with stubborn springs , it is really ter* rible Fair many miles out of Columbus the road iar shamefully bad ; and as our horses were kept on a trot however slow , I was not only tumbled and shaken as on the previous day , but so jarred and jolted as to threaten serious mischief . Instead , therefore , of finding a lounge , or sleep , as I had hoped , in this comfortable coach , I was obliged to be on the alert for every jerk ; and after all I could do , my teeth were jarred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all my bruises bruised over again . It was really an amusement to see us la- bouring to keep our places . About noon we paused at the town called Jefferson . We were to wait half an hour ; there would be no other chance of dinner ; but there were no signs of dinner here However , I had been on very short supplies for the last twenty-four hours , and considered it my duty to eat if I could . I applied to the good woman of the inn ; and in a very short time , she placed venison , fruit-tarts , and tea , before me ; all very clean , and the venison excellent . It was a refreshing repast , and the demand on my purse was only twenty-five cents . " How long have you been here V I said to my hostess , who stood by me fanning the dishes to keep off the flies . " Only came last fall , sir . " * ' How old is this town. ? " " Twenty-three months , sir ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 600 persons settled here ; and there are three good hotels . There is something very striking in these rapid movements of life and civilization in the heart of the forest . On leaving Jefferson , we plunged again into the /z/ forert ; and lawards evening we got on the greenawardf or natural road . Iliis was mostlj good and uncut ; and we bowled along in serpentine linea , so as to clear the Btumps with much freedom . The tceneij now , even for &#9632; the foreEl , was becoming unusually grand . It lepeated ' ly broke away from you , so as lo accumulate the objects in the picture , and to fiirnish ail the beauties of light , shade , and perspective . The trees , loo , were moslty oak , and of the finest gronth . Their noble sterna ran up some hundred feet above you , and were beautilully feathered With verdant foliage . There , they ran off in the distance , park-like , but grander far , in admirable grouping , forming avenues , galleries , and recesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you like the thousand pillars of one vast imperishable temple for the worship of the Great Invisible . Well might our stout forefathers choose the primitive forests for their sanctuaries . All that art has done in our finest Gothic structures is bui a poot , poor imiiaiion ' . I passed , in this day 's ride , the Ycltew Springs , and Spnngfield . The former is a watering-place . Thne is a fine apring ' tf chalybeate waters ; and an estatdisUraent capable of receiving from 150 to 200 visiters ; it Ja resorted to for the purposes of health , hunting , and fishing . Springfield is a flourishing town , built among the handsome hills that abound in this victty . A - ie one of the cleanest , brightest , and most innling that 1 have seen . Bnt all the habitations of man were as nothing compared with the forest . I had been travelling through it for two diys and nights , and still it was the same . Now you came to a woodman 's kot in the soUludcs ; now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy called a town or n city ; but it was still riia forest . You drove on fur miles through it unbroken ; then you came to a small clearance and a young settlement ; anil then again you plunged into the wide , everlasting forest , to be wiA nature and with God . This night I had also lo travel , and , weary as I vim , I was kepi quite on the alert . I had longed to ivitnesB i /z/ a storm in the forest , and this was to happen earlier Ihan my aniicipationa . The day had been hoi , but fine ; the night came on sultry , close , and silent . The beautiful firefly appeared in abundance ; summer lightning began to Hash acroas the heavens . All this time clouds were moving from every part of the circumference to the centre the sky . At length they formed a heavy , dense , binck canopy over our heads , leaving the horizon clear and bright . The lightnings , which at first seemed to have no centre , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were playing round its whole circle with great magnificence and biilhancy . Continually ihe prodigious cloud was gelting larger and darker , and descending nearer to us , so as powerfully to awaken ejpectatioQ . The splendid coruscations which p ! ayed round its margin now ceased , and alt was still . In an instant the forked lighttiing broke from the very centre of the cloud ; the thunder , deep and loud , shook the earth , and rolled and pealed through the heavens ; the heavy rain dashed in unbroken chmmels to the ground ; and the mighty winds liuis fonh i their futy , and roared and groaned among the rginl Iraes of the wood . There were we , in the deep forest and in the deep night , and in the midst of a storm , such as I had never witnessed . O it was grand ' . Ood 's own vOMie in God 's own temple ! Never did I see TO-Oiuch of ( he poetic truth and beauty of that admirable ode , " The voice of the Lord , " &c.; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which bore the cloud away , left all behind calm ; and the lirefly , which had been eclipsed or afTrighted , reappeared , and sparkled over ua on the profound darkness ; and presently the stars of a higher sphere looked forth benignantly on the lower elements , and all was peace . The early morning found me still travelling , and getting seriously unwell . I Ihoughl I must have remained at Lebanon , a town about twenty miles from Cincinnati , to sicken and suffer without a friend ; and then all the loneliness of my situation came over me . Tlie stage ba. wd here te hour ; this allowed me some tim /z/ covet ; and I reaolved , if it was possible , lo go forward to what I might regard as a re Bling- place . Happily , every thing was now ijnptoving . The road was not unworthy of M'Adajn ; and we bowled over it at the rate of nine miles an hour . The country was covered with hills , finely wooded , ajic ( , all about them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cultivation . Many ornamental cottages now appeared , and the whole suburbs put on a choerful and beautiful asfect ; 80 that , when you were expecting to reach the extremity of civiliied life , every thing was rising into higher civilization . At last we drove into the western metropolis . I had travelled three days and , nights ; and was so wearied , bruised , and hurt , that I could not , with comfort , sit , lie , or walk . The remainder of this day I spent in my chamber . Cincinnati is really worthy to be styled a city ; and it is a city " born in a day , and in the wilderness . " It has a population of 30,000 persons , and is not more than thirty-six years old . Its streets are composed of transverse lines , and are named a good deal after the manner of Pluladelphia , but it has none of its formal aspect . The straight lines are broken by the undulating surface of the ground ; the surrounding hills stand up beautifully at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs off finely at its feel . There are several good sireeta ; some enlivened by business , and others ornamenied by comfortable dwellings and the spreading acacia ; ' but there are Qo very striking objects . Some of the churches are good , but ncil rematiable , Bxcapl the old Presbyterian Church in Ihft main street , which is large and Dutch-built , with a bn face , with two brick towers projecting on it , whiofa towers have turrets as heavy as themselves , and which turrets are chjelly remarkable for two dials which e ) ; aclly agree . When I saw them they both wanted three n linules to six , end I doubt not if 1 could see them now tliey still want just three minutes to six . Besides this , thnre is , as it is called , " Trollope 's Folly , " an erecuon io. which ladyi thus complimeinted , exlmusied her ni tainly did not show her taste . I was struck by tha nimibeT of barbers ' ahopB and gtoceiius , or grogshops ; il should aeem Ih &t; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notjct fulfilled its comraiasion . I believe there are not his than 300 grogetores in Cincinnati . While 1 was seeking for my friend , Mr. Brainard , I fell in with Dr. Beecher , whu insisted on my being at his disposal , and immediately found for rae a very friendly reception in a family resident in the town ; but considering that I should have a better chance of health , he proposed that 1 should go with him tu the Wahiut HiUs , two miles distant . For the reason kindly named , as well as for the pleasure of enjoying his society , I availed myself of the proposal , and became , during my stay , the guest of his family . It happened that I was here on the 4lh ot 3'uly , the anniversary of the Independence ; almost the only holyday kept in America : and I was glad to jiave a good opportunity of witnessing its observance . The previous evening gave note of preparation by the continued report of firearms and small guns . In the early morning the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luiniatuie what their fathers were to perform on a larger platform . There was an Ode , and the Declaration , and an Oration , and Yankee Doodle , The grand f6le came afterward . All the trades were to meet , and go in procession to the Fourth Church , to join in a semi-religioos service . The question of precedence , however , here as elsewhere , is found to be of no easy solution ; and some of the eompanies , in dudgeon on this subject , had refused to take the place assigned to them . There were the butchers , and the carpenters , and the coopers , and few besides . The coopers had a temporary stage , and as they were drawn along they wrought at their business . The butchers , who could not well be BO employed , were at liberty to display themselves , and thny made the moat of il in their way . They were full sixty in numbar , and were all mounted on good steefl i /z/ Sdidb decorations were given to tliid lioisc , but many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see these r drCBBed oal in. purple and fine linen . They all had fine frpcka an , some muslm ; ornamented by silk sash , and scarf , and rosetlHs . These , with thie usual accompaniments of a band of lausic , and showy colours waving in the ail , with the insignia of the company on them , togelhai with the holy day dresses of ( he specltors who lined the pathway , composed the exhibition , and gave it a cheerful character . As the service Was to be at Dr. Beecher'a church , he was the chaftkin for the occasion . I went with him to secure a good sitting ; but declined going into the pulpit , or engaging in the exctcise , for pbTioua reasons . The &#9632; peclacle was singular for a place o worship . There , were te the pulpit , the chaplain , the reader of the Declaration ill a fustian jacket , and the orator . On their right and'leil were seated the ensigns , bearing the national cotouis ; ai ) d beyond these were resting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large portion of the area , and ihii hand posiesaed the gallery . The church was quite fuU . A national air was played by the band . An ode was then sung by the choir , sustained by instruments . Dr. Beecher offered prayer . Then came the Declaration . It was read by a tradesman , who looked intelligent ; but he read badly , and what was worse , rather bitterly ; and in trying to give those terms which hit the Father Land a hard and anjry expression , he contorted his face so as to be very ridiculous . Another ode followed . Then the Oration . It was written ; but freely dehverad . Il showed good partfl manly thinking , and was , on the whole , composed in good taste . There was a reference U the past ; a tribute to our common fathers ; a eulogy on the conalitution ; a warning on the danger of disunion , on the one hand , and consolidation on the other ; and , finally , an apostrophe to La Fayette . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seldom , on these occasions , had any thing so good . Ths i Ode , " Glory lo God on high , " &c.,; the music by Moxait , foUotved , and the exercises closed by a short prayer . There waa in the novelt ; of this semce some gratifr cation ; andinils aubslance , ! found no cause of offence . For the DAclaraliOD , 1 knew its contents , and prepared my nerreB for invectives which were , perhaps , natural at the time they were written ; and for my good fciend , Mr. Churchman , the reader , I could not smile and be unkind I confess , 10 Speak seriously , and to give you , as 1 always seek to do , first itnpressions , I mas somewhat startled at the extraordinary mixture of the secular and the Bpiritual ; and it was a quealioB whether the tendency was not to make religion woriily , rather than the worldly religious . But when I reflect on the improved character given to these occasions by not abandoning them to the irreligious , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion are acting- a wise part in employing that degree of influence which they can legitimately exert in its favour . Nor if one could hate all ' one wished , would I desire , as some do , to make ibe exercises of such a day purely religious . Our true wisdom , in consulting the good of the people , lies , not in excluding their secular concerns and pleasures from religion , but in diffusing religion through the whole of them . There is one thing , however , that may justly claim the calm considsiation of a great and generous people . Now that half a century has passed away , is it necessary to the pleasurss of this day to revive feelings in the children wliich , if they were found in the parent , were to be excused only by the extremities to which Ihey were pressed 1 Is it generous , now that they have achieved the victory , not to forgive the adversary 1 la it manly , now that they have nothing to fear from Britain , to indulge in expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear ! Would there he less patriotism because there was more chanty T Amorica should feel that her destinies are high and peculiar .

She should carry out her sympathy to all meiiy and become the resolved and noble advocate of universal freedom and universal peace . O , how would the birthday of her own liberties be hallowed and blessed if it were devoted with wisdom and ardour to ch an issue ! On the day succeeding the anniversary I was taken unwell , and confined to the house for three days . My journey might have accounted for this ; but I ascribe it also , in a measure , to the atmosphere . This city , from all appearances , ought to be very healthy ; there is reason , however , to think that the immense forest prepares for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year especially , is dangerous to strangers , and trying to alL Dr. Beecher and all his family had the fever on arriving here . For me , my indisposition was light , and it was made the lighter by the kind attentions of the family which had received me to its bosom , and of Dr. Drake , an excellent physician of the place , who obligingly insisted on my acceptance of his services . On the Monday I was so far better that I could go to town and attend an Association of Ministers . I had some interesting conversation with them . The subject of slavery came under discussion , and I trust not unprofitably . I afterward had considerable communications with Dr. Beecher on that subject ; and we agreed to renew it , and with others , when we should meet in NewEngland . In the evening of this day I was to attend a concert for prayer , and to address the congregation ; but a thunder-storm came on , and prevented the service altogether . The thunder here , you must still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightning " our hghtning ; " and it is not less frequent than it is awful . I had been ten days in Ohio , and this was the seventh storm . The next day I was to proceed on my way . In the morning I visited the Lane Seminary , and at the request of the professors , addressed the students . We had a pleasant devotional exercise . There were about sixty itudeilta and several visiters present . The college will e hundred , and ii l3 neatly full . It in h manual labour institution , and I shall refer to it in this cbaiacter hereafter . Before I quit this place , let rae throw a few particulars together . You may have concluded , from what I have said , that reEgion is in a low state hera . it is ; but , when you consider the rapid increase of the people , and the character of that increase , it is in a remarltably advanced stale . The population has grown at about 1,000 per year ; and Ais great influi has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-one places of worship , and they are of good size and well attended . When it is said tliat of 30,000 , 4,000 are Catholics , mostly Irish Catholics , it may be thought , without a breach of charity , to account for the existence of many low groceries . There la a great spirit of enterprise in this town ; and , with an ardent pursuit of business , there is a desire for domestic comfort , and a thirst for scientific improvement , not equalled in such circumstances . Thoy have libraries , and good reading societies ; they have lectures on art and science , which are well attended . They sustain a " Scientific Quarterly and a Monthly Magazine , " with a circulation of 4,000 ; and they have newspapers without end . Education is general here ; the young people , and even the children , appear to appreciate it . They regard it as the certain and necessary means of advancement . I overheard two fine children , in the street , remark as follows . The younger one , about nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with concern , " Do you know , Caroline says she will not go to school any more ! " " Silly giri I " replied the elder , about thirteen ; " she will live to repent of that ! " It must bo admitted that this in a very wholesome state of feeUng. /z/ **25;58;TOOLONG ce in the st le of society here , and throughuut this regio , it is undo ubtedly to be found in the want of good serv anis . The class of servants as there is n Europe . If any giva i /z/ themtelres to it , they consider it is only for a short time ; all this short time they are disposed to scorn the duties of their vocation , and are eagerly looking to something better . Hence it is that there are few servants ; that they demand high wages ; that they afford but little ' ' help , " and give less satisfaction . Two dollars a week are commonly given here for a female help ; and a lady of this city told me that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not uncommon for them to disappear from the family either in the early morning or the evening , without the least notice . On these accounts , the mistress of the family does more than with UR ; and establishments that would seem to require three servants , are often found only with one . Much has been said , and with some ill-nature , on the circumstances of the servants claiming to sit at the same table with the family . It should be observed , in the first place , that this is no more true of the principal towns and cities of America , where wealth and occupation have created distinctions of classes , than it is with ourselves ; and that it should occur in the newly-settled and farming districts , where all are of one class , can not be deemed remarkable , unless we unwisely judge of it through the prejudiced medium of our own conventional habits . If a young woman engages herself to heip a tradesman 's wife , she is the daughter of a man who Uves on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tradesman . The only difference is , the one has land , and the other ready money ; and the girl seeks to obtain some money , either to improve her education or her dress , or , as she hopes , perhaps , to prepare for her wedding . If a youth engages to work at a farm , he is most likely the son of a neighbouring farmer , who has more children than the one who engages him , and he is equal with the family he enters , both in rank and in employment . Would it not be absurd , in such a state of society , when equality prevails in every other particular , to create , at the social board , an invidious and artificial distinction 1 We all rempobex the time when , with real distinctioQs betwpcia /q/ master and man , the servants on our farms claimed their place in the comman hall , and at the common table ; and we may well question whether the interests or happiness of either party have been advanced since the alteration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the State , I may as well set down any closing observations that occur to me . There are in Ohio , notwithstanding its rapid progress , not less than 500 ministers ; excepting those who may , in different places , advocate heretical or anti-Protestant opinions . The people , in many parts , are so desirous of the means of religion , that they have erected the little church , and have to wait for the pastor . There are , at least , twenty places now in this predicament . Some of the new-made towns present a dehghtfully religious aspect . Of these I might name Columbus , Zanesville , and Granville . The first has 3,000 persons , , and it has three churches and five ministers . The second has 3,200 persons , and six churches . And Granville is a small town , which , I believe , is wholly religious . As a settlement , it deserves notice . It was made by a party of ninety persons from New-England . On arriving at this spot , they gave themselves to prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness , and enjoy the blessing ' of God . At first , . they rested with their little ones in the wagons ; and the first permanent building they erected was a church for divine worship . The people retain the simple and pious manners of their fathers . They all go to church , and there are 400 in a state of communion . They give 1,000 dollars a year to religious institutions . One plain man , who has never allowed himself the luxury of a set of fire-irons , besides what he does at home , gives 100 dollars a year to religious objects . The present pastor is a devoted man , and very prosperous in the care of his fiock . Some of his little methods are peculiar , and might be either objectionable or impracticable elsewhere . He meets his people in districts , once a week , in turn , for instruction . He keeps an alphabetical , list of the /z/ . members ; and places each name opposite a day of the lit month throughout the year ; - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that member . He has overseers in the districts , who are to make an entry of all points of conduct , under separate heads , during the year ; and * ' to fimiish a full report to him at its close . This report , and the names of the parties , he reads from the pulpit , . , with rebuke or commendation , and the year begins V afresh . Every one knows , therefore , that he is subject i J ' to report ; and , in a small community , where there is * neither power nor will to resist , it must act as a strong nstraint . Of course , the drunkard , the fornicator , the Sabbath-breaker , are not found here ; and , what is yet better , on the last report there was only one family that had not domestic worship . i . LETTER Xn . Mt dear Friend , After . meeting the students and professors of Lane Seminary , on the morning of the 8th of July , I went to . - town with Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are usually ten or twelve steamboats lying off the quay ; and there was one that would start in the afternoon . I caught a dinner at a hospitable table , took leave of my idnd friends , and went on board . These vessels are well adapted to thtf livers they have to navigate ; and mostly offev more tfwommodations to the passenger than can be granted " vAen exposed to more troubled waters . The cabins being erected above the hulk of the vessel , a decided advantage in light and ventilation ; and especially valuable in the hot seasons as no places are so hot as the bosoms of these rivers . I tad a nice little state-room to myself , with lock and key ; and our company was small , and none of it /z/ qwq I had now a fair sight of the Ohio ; and it is worthy , fully worthy , of its French name , Ia Belle Riviere . It has a quick current , and is subject to great variations . It will rise and fall from forty to sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near view , its precipitous and aigged banks , its turbid waters , its abundant driftwood , its uprooted trees , and its dark , over-hanging forests , give to i ' an air of desolate grandeur . But , more frequently here , it runs in serpentine lines ; appears to the sight a suocession of beautiful small lakes ; spreads open before you the distant prospects , and ofifers to your admiratioa most exquisite hill and river scenery , dwelling in the brightest and softest colours . It is certainly the " finest river of America . The Mississippi has more hold on = the imagination , but not half so much on the eye . About noon on the following day we reached Louisville , having made a trip of 160 miles . I instantly found , on landing , that we had indeed entered a. slave State . A man of colour had offered himself to take my luggage and guide me to the inif . He was running his light barrow before me on a rough pathway . " Remember , Jacob , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you - twenty-one stripes , Jacob ! " I asked an explanation . He said he was liable to punishment for wheeling on the path . The person who threatened him was a colonel , and I believe a magistrate ; and poor Jacob was evidently concerned at bei detected by him , /z/ ibr , he said , he owed him a grudge . I do not answer for the correctness of Jacob 's statement ; I Aierely report what occurred . On arriving at my hotel , I found its mastef , Mr. Throckmorton , who is- a colonel as well as a tavernke'eper , busily engaged in making and distributing his , miht-julap . It is a favourite mixture of spirits , mint , sugar , and water , and he has a high character for the just incorporation of the ingredients . Others were making a free and dangerous use of iced water , a luxury which is provided in great abundance throughout the States . Indeed , the disposition to drink now became intense - we had only to consider how we might safely gratify it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perspiration were intolerable . I was compelled to relieve myself of my upper garments ; to throw myself on a naked mattress ; and with the windows open , and remaining perfectly still , the perspiration rose on my skin in globes , collected in my hair , and coursed down my face and hands . The discomfort is unspeakable . Every thing you have on feels wet ; and if you clge your cravat and shirt , they become quickly lijii ; i wet rags hanging about you . You wonder , at first , to see the men and boys without cravats , and without either waistcoat or coat , and wearing mostly white linen ; njtt when you really get at this temperature you understand it all . This was the hottest week we had ; many persons were said to have died on the pubUc ways , and twenty-five persons died at New- York from drinking cold water . I used heroi for the first time , the mdscheto bar , as it is called ; and it was not before it was needed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sid* of the bed . I thought it would produce , in hot weather , the sense of sufibcation , but this is not the effect . On the contrary , when you really know what the bite of this insect is , and hear it singing about your bed , while it is unable to reach you , you have a grateful sense of security from your enemy . On the whole , I suffered but lit- /z/ SLAVES . ISd /z/ tie from ftrisSQurce of annoyance ; the common fly was a much greater evil , it is in such abundance , and is so much more obtrusive . It frequently bites and settles on your person and food in a very tormenting way . The refectories , in consequence , are provided with large fans , which are hung over the tables on pivots , and are connected by cords and pulleys , so that they may be worked by a little slave during the period of meals . The accommodations given to the slaves now came under my notice . Where the family is of any consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling . At our hotely they had at the end of the courtyard a large house , for they were numerous . The house , however , had but few rooms , and there were several beds in each room , so as to show that they were crowded , and that their habits of life were not very favourable to its decencies . I was struck too , perhaps the more , because I had just travelled through Ohio , with the attentions these people offer you . They are trained to do more for you than others , and they mostly do it . with a readiness which shows kindness of heart . This iHainly affords you personal gratification , and it is only . iy checked when it is remembered that it is the price of * liberty , or when it approaches to the tameness of subseiviency . It became necessary for me now to determine on my course . My considerate friends at Cincinnati had required a promise that I would not go farther by water . I found that to go to St. Louis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tiiAe , which was more than I could spaire . ' Besides this , I was stiU much indisposed , and disease was prevailing in these regions . I determined , therefore , to quit the vicinage of the rivers , and make my way across Kentucky , in an easterly direction ; towards Virginia . On the following morning I left for Lexington . I inquired when the stage would start . " 0 , between daybreak and sunrise , " was the reply . ' *And when is that r ' - rr " 0 , between four and five o'clock . " So that I /z/ was obliged to be ready at four , and we did not start ffl half past five . The morning was cool , though the pre vious day had been so hot : I was refreshed by the air , and got ready for breakfast . Accommodations were made for us in a very primitive cabin , and in a very primitive style . We had , however , a large supply - milk , eggs , coffee , and hot corn-bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife presided at each extremity of the table , making us welcome , not indeed with kind words and smiling faces , but with a considerate regard to our wants . Soon after breakfast we passed through Selbjrville , a stirring , busy village , at which there had recently been a considerable revival . We took in here a Mr. Franklin , who was much disposed to conversation , and who really had much to communicate . He had been the longest settled in that region . His father came with him when a child , and was employed by Government to survey and let the . land . He was shot by . the Indians in the very act of surveying ; they could bear any thing better than to see the lands . enclosed . He referred me also to- an old man in the village , who had killed six Indians in one afifray . One would think he had killed them all ; for llMty have all disappeared , and the land is all settled and generally in good keeping . It is worth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he remarked , it is cheaper now than when it was bought at two dollars , considering the labour , and blood , and hazard which it had cost . The change was very great to his mind , and he delighted to dwell on it ; but it was not always with congratulation . Even of these primitive and rude settlers around him , he was disposed to take up the old complaint of degeneracy . **0 , sir ! " he would exclaim , " the men are nothing , women nothing now to what they used to be . I can recollect when the women would do more in the men do now . Every Saturday they devoted to firing at a mark ; and they could handle a musket with the best of us . " We dined at a tavern , which is also a posthouse , and &#9632; &#9632; jK /z/ ti kept by " a *squire . " The ' squire , however , was not much of the gentleman ; he made a very sorry provision for his passengers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion took occasion to remark , that he had been put in for the purpose , and that post houses had been needlessly ' multiplied with this intention . Certainly the number is enormous ; and he remarked , that between Louisville and Orleans there are no less than 126 : you must not connect in your ideas the ' post-horse with the posthouse , for here they have no connexion . By-the-by , there is no such thing as posting throughout the States . Early in the afternoon we arrived at Frankfort , and were told that we . should go no further till ten the next morning . We had come fifty miles , and this was deemed excellent work . Of course I had no choice ; and I might have been called to give up a few hours to a less interesting place , Frankfort is indeed a pretty town , situated on the banks of the river Kentucky , and surrounded by handsome hills . The erections are scattered over the small plain which is the site of the town , and are relieved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural and pastoral appearance . This is greatly increased by the quantity of fine cows which are found here , and whJEBh really seem to be a part of the family . Most families have one or two , and towards evening they move about the streets like human beings , perfume the air with their sweet breath , and find their way to their resting-place , frequently through the entries of the houses , in company with the children . All the sights were not quite so rural as these . In moving about the town , I observed a fair supply of accommodation for religious services . There were also two schools . One was large , and for common purposes . The boys were , at the time , making a little use of their American liberties ; they were coursing , not only over the desks , a very English trick , but over the roof also . &#9632; There were fiva windows on this side of the stmctuiey /z/ is8 ' scHooL-Horse. /z/ ; i and there was not one pane of glass unsmashed : bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the present ; and what have boys to do with the future ? ' Of the other school I had rather a curious notice . The shades of the evening were coming on , and as I suddenly turned the angle of a street , I saw a dark ob* ' . ct projecting on my path from a window at a little distance . I soon perceived that it was the booted leg of a human being ; and on coming nearer , I found it belonged to a pedagogue in class with some dozen youths , ' #ho , if not learning manners , were digesting Latin syntax as they could . This sort of trick is so peculiar , and so Common , as to be almost an Americanism . I certainly never saw legs so strangely used as by many men in this country . To be on the fender , the jambs of the stove , the chair , the mantelpiece , is nothing ; it is , perhaps , European . These aspirants seem never satisfied till their heels are on a level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attained to the height of the doorway , and it is a point of seriouS . ambition with young Xaen to see who shall score the highest mark . This is certainly turning the world upside down , and inventing a new field of aspiration . The old strife among men has been to sei who should carry his head the highest : it now to be seen what distinction a man 's heels may bring him ; and this experim0nt , for aught I can see , is to b#'i. ' made in America . qwq /z/ All windows were suitably kept from the portico ; but then the single door was miserably small ; and over the portico was placed a cupola in lantern fashion ! I learned that this evening there was to be , in apartments adjoining my inn , what is called a squeeze . Now a Kentucky squeeze is meant to correspond with a London rout ; and though not desirous to be of the party , I had some desire to know how it would be managed . Seveial rooms were put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her daughter , who were staying at the inn , were gliding about to direct the ceremonial . Articles of furniture were borrowed or hired from all quarters for the occasion ; and , in the end , there was certainly a strange medley of the new and the old , the best and the wcnrst . Over all the many lights sfted their brilliancy , and the potted flowers shed their beauty ; and the party providing were so satisfied with these arrangements , as told- you that they had nothing to fear from the fastidious tastes of the visiters . The company began to assemble as I was retiring to my chamber . There were about sixty ladies and forty gentlemen present . They came with little noise , for the doors were open to receive them , and carriafffb they had Hone ; nor attendants , except the firefly , wmi &; sparkled tleautifully about their path and their persons . The foU . lowing morning , I inquired of my friend Franklin if he ' had been . " O yes , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did you do ? " I continued . " Dancing , cards , and music , 1 suppose 1 " - " O dear no ! it was quite a Presbyterian meeting , I assure you . It was all cnversations and such like , as sober as possible - quite religious . It would not have suited me once - but now it does well enough - things are gfektiy altered now , and perhaps for the better . Dancing ! Why , at SelbrVille you could not get a couple of girls in all the place who would run down a dance - they are all converted ! " This Presbyterian meeting , however , kept rather late hours , , as I learned ixom the return of two or three young men , who had en- /z/ gaged the room next to mine . , Their noisy conversatiofif also told me that they had come into town to attend it and undoubtedly with no religious intentions . I proceeded , at the time specified , on my journey . " We went by way of Versailles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , however , was interesting ; the farms large and park-like , and many of them showihg good cultivation . The fine clear grazing land beneath the forest-tree is a ( ) eculiarity here , and is very grateful to the eye . Generally , the best farms , in comparison with ours , want exceedingly the animation of stock . Our passengers also supplied some entertainment . They were mostly plain persons , but of good sense and behaviour ; several of them were , evidently professors of religion , and were free to converse on the subject . You meet frequently , however , with persons in these districts , who , with circumstances all against them , pique themselves on fashionable display . A lady of this class was to go on - with us , and complete the number . She wore silks , with hooped sleeves and petticoat . The difficulty was to get her ijjto her seat ; and when in , she was hterally pressed into half her original dimension , with the exception of a large bonnet , which still projected on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief was not seen till she alighted , and she then presented truly a most ludicrous figure . The wire hoops in the sleeves had been flattened and bent upwards , and looked ' like two broken wings ; the lower hoops had undergone a similar process , and the petticoat stood out before her a ? though it did not belong to her . She was confused , and tried to adjust her dress , but could not ; while the spectators were not concerned to conceal their diversion . Lexington is a good town of 6,000 persons , and for situation and promise , worthy to be the metropolis of this i &ne; State . It must , one would think , be very healthy ; it is nrrounded by inviting country , and abounds in com ( bits to its inhabitants ; yet it suffered fearfully by cholera /z/ No less than 500 persons were cut off by it ; and what was painfully remarkable is , that a family , consisting of nineteen members , actually lost seventeen . The streets o ( this town are laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their width is at present overgrown with grass from the want of adequate use . The main street offers a nice promenade to the inhabitants ; and the churcfes . Court-house , and University , decorate the whole , while the acacia , with its abundant fohage , softens the outline , and gives to it the appearance of a city in a woOd . Many of the residents here are evidently wealthy ; the people generally are bland in their manners , and have warm and generous feelings . It is not uncommon for a stranger to meet with a friendly and smiling inclination of the head as he passes , and to the heart of a stranger it is grateful . At sundown , as it is called , a bell began to toll . I concluded that there was to be a meeting of some sort and somewhere ; and as my object was to mingle with the people , I followed its voice , and soon found myself at the Court-house . It was a meeting of the friends of Temperance . There was a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were nearly a hundred persons assembled ; they were all men . An individual moved to the chair . He had no speaking powers , and simply called on the Secretary to read the minutes . It appeared from these that monthly meetings had been resolved on , at which questions should be discussed ; and that this was the fifst meeting . The question before them was , " Wh6ther , in the last one hundred years , intemperance had not done more harm to the human race than murder , disease , war , and all other evils 1 " When the subject was thus announced , there was a pause . The chairman solicited remark . Still there was a pause ; and nothing to relieve it . The lights were few ; the room looked heavy and dull ; and those who occified it looked heavy also and dull . All was sombre and silent ; except that spitting was engaging the interval , and was so continuous as to be like rain pattering from /z/ rv /z/ the roof , and so uniyersal as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a man sitting next to me who kept me constantly on the look-out ; but while he often made me jump , he did me no harm . These men have surprising cleverness in spirting their tobacco-juice ; and , like good . drivers , they seem to have pride in showing how opar they can run to an object without touching it . But to return to my company . By this time you are to understand that a worthy clergyman arose , and had the boldness to take the affirmative of the question . Another pause occurred , with the same interlude . At length a person advanced , who , by his rough paanner and bad expression , I took for a mechanic of the town , delivering himself honestly , but unused to the exercise . However , he showed that he was an agent , and he made in the end a very indiscreet speech , in a . most un winning style . His statements relative to Lexington provoked some remarks . He hailed them - he hoped that he should be opposed - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repute at the bar , spoke , but so Sjtrangely , that none could tell whether he wats friend or foe . Some one expiressed a fear that they should do no good without opposition ; and proposed that they should adjourn to get up . an opposition ; he really feared that nobody would come again without h . And so it ended . It reminded me forcibly of a manoeuvre played by one of our minor theatres lately . It had failed to get . attention by other means ; so it gave notice , by large placards , of A Row at the Co* bourgi trusting in this as a last remedy for an empty house . A principal object with me in visiting Lexington was to become acquainted with Mr. Hall of this place , who had seen much of revivals in his own connexions , and who had lately contributed by his labours to those which had recently occurred in Cincinnati . He very kindly communicated with freedom on the subject . The most considerable which he had witnessed was at Lexington about six yearn sinoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low state , and infidehty and Unitarianism were becoming fearfully predopunant among the people . Hi /q/ AS a faithful pastor , felt it deeply . It happened that h% and some other clergymen met in the . street , and what was most on his mind became , very naturally , the ject of remark . They had similar feeling , and joined in the admissions and lamentations . What was bet to bo done ? A camp-meeting was proposed . It was too late in the season for this . Mr. Hall advised a protracted meeting of four days . They fell in with his views . He took the sense of his people on it , and they were like minded . Steps were taken in the town arid the surrounding country to give it publicity and importance . It was the first of the kind in that region , and great ex- ' citement was created ; and on the day of meeting there was a large influx of people . * v On the first day , they began at eleven o'clock , with the usual- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion . The afternoon and evening were occupied in a similar way , and with good effect . On the second day , a prayet-meeting was held at sunrise . At nine o'clock there was an inquiry-meeting , which was well attended . The usual services were sustained at eleven and three o'clock . The third day , much the saine engagements , with improved effect . The fourth day , the Sabbath , was a remarkably solenm day . Many sinners , haidened in infideUty or worldliness fell under the power of conviction , and great fear came on the whole jassembly . The exercises closed by an inquiry-meeting on the Monday morning , which was of a very affecting nature The brethren had this week to attend the Synod , and they went under the impressions of the recent services . Their temper was communicated to others , and every thing was delightfully interesting . The pastors renewed their affection to each other , and thfeir covenant with God ; and exchanged pledges to retire at a given time , to pray for the revived state of their churchesi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and those of other congregations the subjects not of less , but of far greater religious anxiety than before he left them . They were earnestly desirous of anothef /z/ protracted meeting , and he thought the peculiar state of the people would justify it . Within three weeks of the time , therefore , they held another meeting . It was con. - ducted in the same manner , aid by the same minister ; as on the earlier occasion ; and , as might be expected , from the existing disposition of the people with greater benefit . The total result of these meetings was , that about 500 persons made profession of religion , and were admitted , at their expiration , to different fellowships , according to their place of residence . The general effect on the town was very good . " From that time , " Mr. Hall emphatically remarked , " infidelity and Umitarianism broke down . " He adimtted , hovyever , that some , and perhaps not a few , who had thus professed religion , afterward fell away ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor any thing , had touched them . " Perhaps I had better , add to this account , for the purpose of legulftting your opinion of this revival , and of the general state of rehgion , a sketch of congregations in figures . There are two Presbyterian places , with about 1,200 attendants and 300 communicants . Mr. Hall 's is one of these , and by far the largest . Two Baptist , with about 1,000 attendants , and 200 communicants ; two Methodist , about 1,100 attendants , and 400 conununicants ; two African , Methodist and Baptist , 1,000 attendants ; one Episcopalian , about 500 attendants . I found the people al this time und some uneasiness in relation to the spread of Romanism . The partisans of that system are greatly assisted from Europe by supplies of money and teachers . The teachers haveusually more acquired competency than the native instructersf and this is a temptation to parents who are seeking accomplishments for their children , and who have a high opinion of European refinements . It appeared that out of four schools provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of Catholics . I heard a sermon by a young ' clergyman ca thiii subject . It showed a. good acquaintance with the subject , and a pious dnd aflbctioill ' ate regard for the welfare of his flock ; but it cBfttlMlt /z/ /q/ awaken much attention . There was too much of Jove , and Minerva , and Penelope in it , and too little of pointed appeal and Christian obligation . I had many attentions here from kind friends , and thejr would have been increased had I been able to tarry and receive them . IETTER Xin . My dear Frhnd , On renewing my journey , I had again to sacrifice my rost ; the coach by which I was to travel left at ten oclock at night . But as we got on higher ground , my health was beginning to improve , and I was mon able to contend with fatigue than I had been . Towards daybreak we drew near Owensville . The forest , which had lately stood off in the distance , gathered round me , and demanded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirati6n . Like ourselves , it was the same , and ydt not the same . Every region present you with its favourite species ; and at they approach the line of separation , . the species run into each other , and place before you every variety of combination , grolvth , and beauty . It is one of the wonders of the fore that with such simple elements it supplies you with such endless variety . yhe kinds most prevalent now were the maple , the sugartree , the vine , the hickory , the beech , and the oak , in all its varieties . The first two are very abundant , and they . jield large supplies of sugar to the inhabitants . Everywhe you see the sugar-tree subjected to the process of tapping. , Tlus is of course done when the sap is rising iii UieMimi the saAuilJpie then oozes out , and ' k lisqpl%oalien trough , made to project RiJM tree , it into a vessel below , lb receitiB it . These molasses are very /z/ fine , and are much preferred by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we reached it , was full of life . It was market-day . Th people from the country far round were present , and were busy chapping , chatting , eatings drinking . It was a picture of its kind . We paused at the inn , and I alighted for the of seeing the persons assembled . Those in the bar-room were men from the country , with stick or whip in hand , swinging on their chairs , or driving their bargains . A couple of pedlers , too , had found entrance , and were trying to obtain customers for some pictures and showy books of a very vile edition . The day was hot , and it was an excuse for drinking ; and most of them were availing themselves of this excuse by the use of some of the many mixtures which are prepared at these bars . Here , as everywheipD , mint-julap was the favourite draught ; iand two of them had certainly drunk too freely . You would have been chiefly surprised to find yourself among such very plain persons ; most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , by sounditig titles . Here was Captain Gray , and Colonel Bail , and Colonel - his name has slipped me - dressed in fustian , and dwelling in log-houses . But the Americans , while they repudiate titles , are certainly fond of them . Nowhere do you meet with so many ; in some districts , every sixth man seems to be either captain , or colonel , or judge , or doctor . In this instance , the captain , an aged man , determined that I should not hear all and say nothing . He drew his chair nearer to mine , twirled his sticfi about his boot and looking inquisitively , but with good-humour , Baid , ; * Well , squire ! you have travelled far , I guess 1 " - " Yes , pretty far , " I said . *. * You are ' a stranger , maybe V - " I came , " I said , " from New- York . " - " Ay , a Yorker , or a New-Englatid man , I took ye for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clever men they , " he continued ; " I knew ye could not be of these parts . And where be ye- going ? " - am goings ' ' . I repUed /q/ " Into Virginia ; I shall afterward return to ; and I really do not know exactly where I shall go afterward . " I said so much , on Franklin 's principle , hoping to get rid of my catechist . . But I did not , as I suppose Franklin did not , wholly succeed .. It is said of him , that when travellmg , he would often anticipate the inquisitiveness of the people , by answering all they might wish to know , thus - " My name is Benjamin Franklin - * I am going to Boston - I came from Philadelphia - My business is so and so - My wife is with me , and three children - their names are so and so , and their ages so and As we advanced on our journey , we came into solitary ways ; and the land rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that we were getting away from human habitation , and among mountain scenery . We alrrived at about seven o'clock at a lone house , and were told that we were to go on at eleven . This wa# very provoking ; but there was no remedy . I took , therefore , my tea , which is both tea and supper here , and dressed myself , and laid down on a clean bed , to slumber till half past ten . When summoned I was some time before I could get my eyes fairly open , and persuade myself to leav6 a comfortable bed , at an hour when most persons were looking towards it ; but nece sity was on me , and I wub more refreshed than I ex* pected to be . In fact , we were ascending among the mountains ; and I doubt not that the air of the higher ground was imparting renovation . By eleven at night , en , we quitted f ) ur comfortable , cabin , and began to the gorges of the mountains . We were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man , who iAm connected with this line of stage . I had regretted tnat I had not daylight , to see and admire the wild and noble scenery around me ; but the night had its charms . The dark forms of the hills gathering about you ; the forest-treee doubling their immense size by their local elevation , and casting their heavy shadows on you ; the Utter absence of aU signs of life and cultivation ; thfi /z/ perfect silence which reigned unbroken , except by the rumbling of the coach and the barking of the wolves ; and the obscurity and indefiniteness of every object on which the " eye fell ; acted together as powerfully on the mind as any thing I have known , and frequently left it difficult to decide between the actual and the imaginary . While I was indulging my imagination , and had tainly no sense ofjanger , I found that my companions in travel were under real alarm for the safety of the mail . It appeared from the driver 's statement , - that , twice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was threatened with attack . On one occasion , his wheel AB locked by some unknown hand ; and the second time % saw two mn , who had concealed themselves , behind a plane-tree , which projected on the passage of the coach . This , of course , gave additional zest to oiur midnight adventure ; and I began to fear that my luggage , which was lashed behind , might disappear before ' morning . As we drew near to the spot where the coachman had seen the men , he lyas evidently much excited ; he put his horses at better speed , and made us , by exclamations , understand where and hon : they had appeared . We gazed earnestly on the immens tree , and tried to penetrate into the dark copse-wood beyond it ; but no robbers were to be seen . However , we had.Btill the benefit of thinking that they might appear , and this gave the last touch of interest to this wild and romantic region , and kept us effectually from slumber and ennui . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , which was used as an Inn . Here I broke my fast , after travaUing twelve hours and fasting sixteen . These was a small settlement here , connected with some iron- works . I found the cholera had made its way into these fastnesses of nature . Two persons had died , and one was dying . I saw a man who was I'eported to have it i and who was avoided by every one from terror . But , in his case , the ruinour was the mere effect of ignorant fear ; he had the sciatica , and no sign of the cholera . lie was very grateful that I had confidence to enter his /z/ /q/ room and speak with him . He was one of those many persons who , livings or dying , must chew and spit ; sick as he was , he had a mound of sand raised on the floor , on which he might indulge his propensity . The remainder of the ride to Guiandot was highly interesting ; but mostly such as I have described . The last stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine piece of road ; and it presented us with a oLange of scenery highly % ' . " r* beautiful . The wild vine became . iliere a prominent * ' feature . In the thicker forests , it frequently shows a dozen or a score of large naked stems , running up into the tallest trees , and quite detached from the trunk , and stranghng it in its growth , leaving you to wonder how it could ever get there , and presenting rather a ourioojj than a beautiful object of sight . But here it grew on the margin of the forest , and luxuriated in light and air ; and the effect was often most pleasing . It ran shorter trees ; used them as a mere skeleton ; covered their heads with its luxuriant foliage ; and threw out its dishevelled , arms and tendrils to the ground , so as to form the most inviting canopies and alcoves . Guiandot is a small but advancing town , placed at the confluence of two rivers , and forming a poiiit of communication between three States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in Virginia ; and before we enter on a new State , it may be desirable to offmr a few general remarks on that which we are quitting . From what h &s; already been delineated , you will deeia this to be an interesting and beautiful State , with many attractions to settlement . But it suffers as a slave-State ; many leave it for Ohio on this account ; and that State , though more remote , and of much more recent settlement , exceeds thin in population by 300,000 persons . The population of Kentucky is 700,000 . There are about 100 Presbyterian congregations ; about 300 Methodist clergymen , including local preachers ; about fifty Catholic priests ; about twelve Episcopalian ; a few Shakers ; and some other sects which , in numbers , however , are very insignificant . Besides these , the Baptists are very numerous* /z/ They are spoken of as having the largest numbed of any in this State ; but it is exceedingly difficult to ascertain their strength ; and it is yet more so to determine on the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder , and deacon , are made to run XBttp each other , so as to confound distinction . Their edttcated teachers are very few ; their uneducated and self-constituted teachers are surprisingly numerous . In this disorganized state , Mr. Campbell came among them with his new lights ; and now nothing is heard of but Camelism , as it is called . The people of this denomination , and especially the teachers , had made too much of their peculiarities as Baptists . Campbell came among them and made evey thing of them , and has succeeded to an alarming extent . He denounces everybody ; he unsettles every thing , and settles nothing ; and there is great present distraction and scandal . But his ministrations , I beUeve , will be overruled for good . They are of the nature of fire : they will try and consume the hay , wood , and stubble , and there was much to be consumed . The pious of the people will see their error , and rectify it ; and those of the denomination elsewhere will perceive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges of public inlstruction in this State bear a good proportion to those of other States . Besides these , so far as the ministry is concerned , something considerable is done . It is not uncommon , I found , for the pastors to receive and train young men for pastoral labour ; one minister I met with had prepared twelve ; and it was generally admitted that those who were thus prepared were among the most pious and successful . The University , too , which had languished in infidel hands , was renewing its strength , and promising to become a valuable focus of Ught , truth , and moral energy . The Medical School is now spoken of in the highest terms . /q/ /z/ My DI4R Friend , On reaching Guiandot , I determined to rest a day or two , that I might get some refreshment after my fatigue , and have time to look around me , and preserve the images of the things I had seen . But what we determine , and what others determine for us , are oiien different things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should leave at three oclock the following morning ; that none other should start for three days to come ; and that then those who came on in the line would have the preference . There was literally no other mode of conveyance , so that I had no choice ; and when I found that , - from the arrival of company , it was doubtful whether I could secure a place , I hastened with desire to obtain what I had deemed very objectionable . Of course , ray rest , though I soujjht it early , was short and imperfect ; and by candle-light I found myself , half asleep , packed most tightly in the heavy vehicle , making one of ten persons . One of these persons was indeed an infant ; it had a female slave for its wet-nurse . It was the first time I had seen a woman of colour act in this capacity , and I confess it shook a little my philosophy . Our company was made up of the- better class ; fashionables from the south who were on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a merchant ; he had come out to Orleans twenty years ago , with fifteen others , and he was the only surviver . Then there were a captain ; a major ; a consumptive in chase of life , which was fleeting from him ; and a reclaimed rake with his young wife , child , and servant . They supplied a good study ; but I must not detain you . On stopping to breakfast , we found our repast prepared out of doors ' , but in the shade , and bedeath a veranda . 140 BALT-WdlKS . It had a light and rural effect . Our ablutions , too , wer to be performed under the same ciroumstances , and with utensil in common ; though you might generally have , if you claimed it , your own towel . It was considered quite enough if exceptions were made to this course in favour of ladies . Our dining station was Charleston ; a thriving and pleasant town on the banks of the Kenhawa . It depends chiefly on the salt-works which abound in this neighbourhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its broad and thick foliage to the cottages . The scenery was evidently improving ; after dinner I took my seat outside for the sake of commanding it ; and not less to relieve myself from the heat and pressure within . We now passed the salt-works . There are not less than one hundred ; and sixty of them are in work . They bore for the water , and usually get a large supply , rising above the surface from a depth of 200 feet . It is said that as much as a million and a half of barrels are manufactured here annually . The works stretch about two miles along this beautiful valley , and greatly disfigure it . But you soon get clear of them , and the slip of land in a line with them , and along the river , is verdant with grass and com . Every thing continues to improve . The little plain below you disappear ; the banks of the river become sharp and bold , and are ornamented by pendent woods ; the hills get up into mountainous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture ; and as you pass them in succession , they reveal to your separate admiration the sweetest dells imaginable . Still , as evening came on , every thing was changed and improving . The river was becoming more animated ; its sides more abrupt . The hills opposite you still rose , hill after hill , in soft and lovely forms ; while those on this side of the river split away in the centre ; stood on your path ; almost refused you passage ; rose in massive , , broken forms above you ; and hunfg beetling over your head , presenting to the eye some of the finest rock-work , for shape aod /q/ colour , that was ever* beheld . All this was taken , for it continued long , in the last lights of day , and under the more fascinating lights of the rising moon . I must leave you to judge of the effect .. I had not expected it , and I was quite refreshed and elevated by it . It doeth good like a medicine . We reackied the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is near to the Kenhawa Falls- ; and from the beauty of the neighbourhood , has many visiters . I took a hasty cup of coffee , apd weary , as I was , went with another gentleman fo see the Falls . We could hear them in the distance ; but we had to go round in order to reach them . The chief of our way was ovar shattered rock , offering a good access by day , but requiring care at night , from the sharp pitches of some parts , and from the numerous circular holes bored in them by the eddies of the water . They are not to be spoken of with Niagara , or even with Shauffausen , but the whole scene was striking and interesting , the more so , undoubtedly , in the still hour of night . I seated myself on a shelf of rock whence the waters made their principal leap . Darknese had spread its curtain on the sleeping objects in the distance . . The pale moOn had run her race , and was just falling behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the head of waters , but left the precipices and pojols below me in heavy shadows . At my feet the river was dashing down , and lifting up its voice from the deeps beneath to Him who holds the waters in the hollow of his hand . It had done so for ages past ; it lyould do so for ages to come . Here the poor Indian had stood , but will never stand again , thinking he heard in those waters the Voice of Deity , and gazing on the face of that orb with wonder , till the spirit of worship was stirred within him . Here also I stood , and shall never stand wistfully looking through the visible and audible to the unseen but present object of adoration and praise . ' We returned to the inn . I had an houir and a half of rest ; and was found with my companions on the way , /z/ 142 THE bawk 's nest . Boon after three o'clock . Most of the company showed that they had only been awakened , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their heads were nodding about in all directions . About seven o'clock , however , we approached a spot which is of great reputed beauty , and we pledged the coachman to stop that we might have a fair sight of it . You leave the road by ' a little by-path , and after pursuing it for a short distance , the whole ; scene suddenly breaks upon you . But how shall I describe it ? The great charm of the whole is greatly connected with the point of sight , which is the finest imaginable . You come suddenly to a spot which is called the Hawk 's Nest . It prefects on the scene and is so small as to give standing to only some half dozen persons . It has on its head an old picturesque pine , and it breaks away at your feet abruptly and in perpendicular lines , to a depth of more than 300 feet . On this standing , which , by its elevated and detached character , affects you like the Monument , the forest rises above and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley . A peaceful river glides down it , reflecting , like a mirror , all the lights of heaven ; washes the foot of the rocks on Which you are standing ; and then winds away into another valley at your right . The trees of the wood , in all their variety , stand out on the verdant bottoms , with their heads in the sun , and casting their shadows at their feet ; but so diminished , as to look more like the picture of the things than the things themselves . The green hills rise on either hand and all around , and give completeness and beauty to the scene ; and beyond these appears the gray outline of the more distant mountains , bestowing grandeur to what was supremely beautiful . It is exquisite . It conveys to you the idea of perfect solitude . The hand of man , the foot of man , seem never to have touched that valley . To you , though placed in the midst of it , it seems ' " altogether inaccessible . You long to stroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the shadows of those beautiful trees ; but it looks impossible . It . ' % solitude , but of a most soothing - not of an appalUilg /z/ /q/ character where sorrow might learn to forget her griefct , and folly begin to be wise and happy . Most of my companions , I am sorry to say , though eager to see this sight , had no taste for it when seen Happily for me , they did not clioose to remain at so dizzy a point of sight as I had chosen , and so they employed themselves at a distance . Their employ was to throw stones across the river , and their astonishment was to find that no stone they could cast would reach it ! All excepting oUr merchant : he remained with me ; and we grasped the stunted pine , and in deep silence enjoyed the scene . The early sight of the Hawk 's Nest was only a good introduction to the ride of this day . It was spent in cross-* ing the Allegany mountains , and others in aUiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took my station on the roof of the coach , that I might enjoy the exhibition without disturbance ; and seldom have I had a day of Such perfect and healthful exhilaration . To attempt a description of scene after scene , would only be to speak as I have done , of rocks , and hills , and rivers , and trees and dells , and vaeys ; the elements were the same ; the combination was different - was endless . The mountains here do not offer you that one manding view which may be obtained elsewhere ; but they present you with continued pictures , which charm the eye and regale the spirits . It is not , indeed , as if you saw one human face divine , which appears , and is gone , but will never be forgotten ; but it is as if you had interviews in succession with a multitude of faces , intel ligent , noble , and- smiling , which , by their kind and iriendly aspect , made the day among the most pleasant of your life . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that is wild , and dark , and soUtary ; and at the fall of day you may hear the baying of the wolf , and see the rude huntsman go forth to encounter the bear ; still , this is not the character of these regions . It is - that of elevated cheerfulness . I attribute this principally to two causes . First , that the - forest is nowjbere on 4 /z/ level ; it runs along the sides of the mountains in galleries bathed in the light of heaven , and while it towers over you on the one side , it leaves the more distant prospect on the other side always open to the eye . The second is , that at the feet of these majestic trees , the oak , the pine , the cedar , the beech , and the tulip , you find such an astonishing supply of the finest shrubs* and flowers . The laurel , the sumach , the dog-wood , the rhododendron , the cranberry , the whortleberry , and the strawberry ; the rose , the marigold ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were all . here , and gave a wonderful freshness and sweetness to the scene . It has all the grandeur of the forest , with all the beauty of the garden . This dehghtful day 's ride had not the most pleasant close . We arrived at Lewisburg late in the evening , and as all were more or less weary , we were eager in our inquiries after beds . It sOon appeared that the court was in session here ; and this gave us some alarm . On going into the bar-room of our inn , I saw two men fast asleep in a large box , and undisturbed by all the noise of our arrival ; this was still more ominous . I hastened to require , as I always did , a single-bedded room , hardly hoping to objtain it . T , he landlord assured me he could not accommodate me . I begged to see what accommodation he could offer . He took me to a room with ve or six beds in it ; there was one bed unoccupied , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already an occupant each , and they were liable , . if necessary , to have another person introduced to them . This kind of room is deemed common ; and the guest who can not find a bed to himself , seeks to participate with some other party ; so that it is not very uncommon for the man who. went quietly to sleep in sole possession of his couch , to find , on waking , that he has acquired a companion . I turned away from the spectacle , and expressed my resolution to sit up till the coach started . My landlord , seeing me firm , disappeared to make some . Jirangements , and then returned to say that he was able /q/ to let me have a double-ledded room , if I would not ject that one of my compamons bj the stage- should oc ' ctipy the second bed ; I might rely on it we should have it quite to ourselves . I consented to this ; but as the good landlord was evidently much pressed , I chose to place my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . To such an arrangement I had been obliged to yield twice before ; but generally , even in these unfrequented regionSf you may procure the luxury of a private chamber . If inconveniences arose at these bouses , they were , as we travelled , of very brief , duration . We started again at daylight on our way to Lexington ) in Virginia . Most of our company , however were to part from the conveyance at the White Sulphur Springs , and it was still , this early morning when we - reached them . These springs are finely situated , and are among the most popular in the States . The accommodations here are all provided by one-person , and are chiefly composed of one erectioiL The rooma and refectories , which are in common , are large and insing , but every thing else - is on a most confined scale . Rumour had saidj as we came alongf that the place was over full ; and our party , after coming so many hundred miles , were anxious lest they should be rejected . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favour , he might be one of five to sWe a small sleeping chamber* While many were so eager to enter this temple of health and hsqppiness , those who had established them-* selves did not impress you . with the value of their acquisition . . There were about sixty men under the verandas picking their teeth , crossing their legs , scratching their heads , yawning , spitting ; deep in. the blues , if appearances did not wholly deceive me . There is a gqod deal of gambjiyig and dissipation here ; and dissipation , vrYukU ever may be its buoyancy . and brilliancy at night , is a meager , and cadaverous , and chapfallen thing in fhe light of morning . hiBi too , was aggravated , for the momii was wet ; and i place devoted to gayety has , of Jjf Vol . I. - G is Jf46 JOURNEY .. places , an air of sadness in bad weather . ' I was not sorry'tht I was going forward . I tasted the wafers ; saw Mr. Clay ; and then joitaed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not improve by the exchange ; they were young men , and all of them , I fear , deeply Versed in sin . One , a disappointed lover , " and seeking his cure in dissipation* ; the others , of good connexions and better taught , but fli ) pant in infidelity , . disrespectful of others , ana shameless for themselves . All were pursuing pleasure in the gratification of their passions , and were mortified to find themselves still displeased and miserable . Two of them , I ; ould learn , were a living sorrow to their parents . I made the best of my situation ; and received , at parting , an apology from one of them , who , in the midst of his freedoms , still wished to have the reputation of a gentleman . My attention , however , was still engaged with the delightful scenery ; and had the weather allowed , I shou ) d have suiSered no deduction on the part of my company . We were still among the mountains , and quickly , on leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe , strictly of the Allegany family ; but they are not so considerable as the SeWell mountains which we had passed , he scenery was very similar to that of yesterday ; if any thing , it is even more picturesque , and is greatly assisted n its effect by the Jackson river . The lover of nature might spend weeks here , and still lament that he had not weeks and months to spend . Early in the evening we came to a cottage which , because it receives the few persons who travel this road , is called an inn . It has the appearance of a private dwelling , which is so little used , that no pathway is worn to it across the verdant sod ; and you are received into the bosom of the family with a pleassmt confidence . The dwelling was respectable and clean ; its fore-court made cheerfiil by the beautiful althea and other flowers . I secufdd a parlour , which had a very comfortable bed m it ; and was gratified with the prospect of sometfaiog like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper , as you choose to- call it , was prepared for us . The husband and wife took the ends of the table , and the daughter waited as occasion relquired . All was plain ; but all was od , and there was an abundance of it ; fowl , bacon , corn-bread , hot wheaten bread , bilberry-tart , honey , milk , and coffee . But the young men had a quarrel with it . It was a temperance house , and there was no mint-julap , nor spirits , nor wine of any kind , to be had ; nor , in fact , any chance of sport or nipchief . I judged from , the manners of these people that they were rehgious , anfl was not de'ceivlsd . I had some pleasant conversation with the father ; and , on retiring to my room , found several good books in the case which adorned it ; and among them Scott 's Family Bible .. With a good bed , a weary body , a room to myself , and the key turned on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was to be again disappointed . Just as I was sinking into unconsciousness , I was assailed . by all sorts of scratching , tumbling , squeaking noises ; which were renewed from time to time , till my summons came to join the coach . I soon found tha the disturbance was in the chimney ; and afterward discovered , that the whole of it , from the floor upwards , was sacred to the house-swallow , and that many hundreds had made a lodgment in it . Some of these lodgings must have ) een insecure , arid have given way , , to have created all tlis annoyance . I did not wish the innocent thmgs to be dispossessed ; . but perhaps I had a passing wish that their dwellings had been more lasting - were it only by a single day . We had not more thn about twenty miles to reach Lexington ; but still , as the custom is , we started very early . This distance was to be filled in mostly by the ascent and descent of the North mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Yifginia . I was led to expect that the scenery was first-rate ; and I took my seat with a civil driver in order to command it . &#9632; Every ing ifl the approach to this mountain is beautiful ; as you.BSCeud it , it becomes grand ; and when you come to /z/ the highest parts of the passage , you have indeed a most commanling station . The morning would have been deemed un &vourable; ; yet it assisted you with such a picture as you can seldom see , and as you most desire to see . . The atmosphere was heavy and humid , tand threatened rain ; but ihe eye could reach oyer the whole mountain scenery . thick mists of the night found no 8un to exhale them ; and they lay on all the valleys like a sea of sleeping waters . The breasts of the mountains rose above these mists , and appeared like so many rocky islands ; while the lighter mists , attenuated by the mountain breeze , floated gracefully about their heads . It was very peculiar and fiuoinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Snowden , which at break of day was in a similar condition . I had wished that before we began our descent the sun might rise on this world of vapours , and present to one all those bewitching forms of unearthly , aerial , and ever-changing beauty , which entranced us in Wales ; but instead of this , the mists thickened into rain , and hid much of what we had seen from our sight . Let me observe , however , that I had - aAerward an opportunity of seeing this noble picture in an opposite condition ; illustrated by the presence of a poweiful and glorious sun . Now every thing was to be seen , and wan worth seeing . The great point of sight is called the Grand Turn . It is an angular pspjeotion from the side of the mountain , and is supplied with a low parapet of . loose stones , to protect you fiiom the precipice below . The old jagged pine of the forest , which has braved the tempest age after age , stands up in its clustered grandeur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over your head inseaio ) i of prey . The broken rockwork falls away abruptlyt'some eighty feet immediately beneath your standing , uid-then runs down in softer linte to the glens below . You look to the left , and there d stand , in all their majesty , the everlasting mountains which you have traversed one by one , and sketching on tho blue sky one of the finest outlines you ever beheld . /z/ Tou look to the right , d there lies expanded before you one of the richest and most lovely valleys which this vast country boasts . You look opposite to you , and the great and prominent mountains just break away so as to form the foreground to a yet more distant prospect , which is bathed in sunlight and in mist , promising to be equal to any thing you see . Everywhere , above , around , beneath , was the great , the beautiful , * the interminable forest . Nothing impressed me so much as this . The forest had often surrounded and overwhelmed me ; I had never before such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled , I had expected to see omjparatively little of it ; but there it was , spreading itself all around like a dark green ocean , and on which the spots that were cleared and cultivated only stood out like sunny islets which adorned its bosom . On the whole , I had , as you will see , been travelling for three days over most delightful country . For 160 miles yv ) u pass through a gallery of pictures most exquisite , most varied , most beautiful . The ride will not suffer in comparison with a run . along the finest portions of the Rhine , or our own drive from Shrewsbury to Bangor . It is often indeed compared with Switzerland ; but that is foolish ; the best scenery in . that land is of another and a higher class . I was not at all aware that I should be thus gratified ; and therefore perhaps had the more gratification . I am thankful that I have seen it ; and for the same reasons that I am thankful to have seen something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptions of America . Before I dismiss this portion of my excursion , let me observe , that there is an excellent road recently cut over this mountain , and into Lexington . It . embraces altogether an extent of forty miles , and is no small achievement ; and the praise of it is due to the ; spirited inhabitants of the town . Perhaps I should not say this without referring to the share the Government takes in it . If generally , s. plan for o6al improvement is acceptable to the Goveniment , it agrees to'tike two fifths of the respon- /z/ sibility , while the residents take the remaining three fifths . The Government also receives its proportion of the profits ; and these profits replenish a fimd for general , improve* ment . I have frequently referred to the roads , and with complaint ; but let me not be misunderstood . It is true that many of them are very and bring much sufifenng to the traveller ; but the leal wonder is , that , under all circumstances , they are so good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there so much done in so short a period . Rail-rosids and steamboats are now come to their help , and perhaps to their salvan ; for certainly it has not been sufficiently considered , that it is a source of national weakness , and not of strength , to have a spare population scattered over an injimense tenitory . About eleven o'clock in the day we drove into Lex* xton . Mr. Carruthers , whom I had known at the General Assembly , saw me as we passed , and kindly followed the stage to the inn , to request that I would consider his house my home . I had travelled a week without a fux night 's rest . Tbam is the great source of exhaustion here , and it is whoUy the of the stage proprietors . With the same roads , and with the same cattle , you might go the same distance in the same time , and save ' all 3rour nights ; and , of course , most of your fatigue . /z/ Mt Friend , I HAD no sooner arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Douglas , called on me. fie was pastor of the Presbyterian Church here , and had formed a fiittdship when he visited England as an invalid , and spent some time in my fkmily . I now expected pleamire and information in his society for a short peiiod* As onsoing daj was the Sabbaib , ha Tifj iS /q/ considerately excused my preaching , on condition that I would , on a following day , allow myself to be announced for an extra service . I was the more obliged for this , as it would supply me with an opportunity of hearing , which I always coveted . On the morning ' of the Sabbath , I jattended an interesting service at my friend 's chioch . It wm placed at the head of the town , on elevated ground , commanding a pretty view of it , and of the fine blue mountains in the distance . It had a paddock attached to it for the use of the horses during the time of worship , and there were from forty to fifty now occupying it . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseback i and the horses are nearly as numerous as the people of these parts . The church has five doors , and these and all the windows were open in consequence of the heat of ths weather . This created some distraction to the congre* gation . Besides , there were fans in motion everywhere , and small kegs'full of water , with ladles , were placed in the window-seats and Ineath the pulpit , which were used by the children , not only before , but during the aeiw vice , and this caught the attention of a stranger , but did not seem much to discompose the people . The galleries were mostly occupied by blacks . The general attend-* ance was good ; the congregation wore a setious oomplexion ; but there were not wanting some instances of negligent and irreverent manners . A recent attempt to produce a revival here had been made by an itinerant revivalist ; but it had failed . I took pains to acquaint myself with it . My conclusion was , that it was a harsh and indiscreet affair ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disadvantage of religion , both with its friends and enemies . This was certainly Mr. Douglas 's opinion . I learned that in the afternoon there would be worship at the Afirican Church , and , I resolved to go . . My obliging friend , Mr. Carruthers , attended me . The " ' building , called a church , is without the town , and placed in a hollow , so as to be out of sight ; it is , in the fiiUiit vi# // sep9e , " without the gate . " It is a poor log-house , built by the hands of the negroes , and so placed as to show that they must worship by stealth . It is , perhaps , 20 by 25 ; with boarding and breast-high , run round three sides , so as to form galleries . To this is aiidcid a lean-to , to take the overplus , when the . fine elither should admit of larger numbers . There were three small Openings , besides the door and the chinks in ' the building , to adnit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women and men were arranged on opposite sides ; and although on a cold or rainy day there might have " been much discomfort , the impression now was very pleasing . In the presence- of a powerful sun , the whole body were in strong shadow ; and the light streaming through the warped ahd broken shingle on the glistening black faces of the people , filled th spectacle with animation . I had taken my place by the door , and was Waiting the commencement . By the law of the State , nolourad persons are permitted to assemble for worshippfailj a white person be present and preside . On this acpotnt the elders of ' Mr. Douglases church attend in turn , that the poor people may not lose the privileges thy prize . At this time , two whites and two blacks were in the pulpit . One* of the blacks , addressing me as their * ' Strange master , " begged that I would take charge of the service . I declined doing so . He gave out Dr. Watts 's beautiful Psalm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " &c.; They all rose immediately . They had no books , for they could not read ; but it was printed on their mepiory , and they sang it oflf with freedom and feeling . Tbore is much melody in their voice ; and when they enjoy a hymn , there is a raised expression of the face , and an undulating motion oif the body , keeping time with the music , which is very touching . One of the elders then prayed ; and the other followed him , by reading and exposition of Scripture . The passage was on relative and social duties ; and I could not avoid pbserving how it reflected on the conduct of the /q/ white , and pleaded for the poor slave . They sang again , " Come , we thatloTe the , Lord , " and with equal freedom and pleasure . The senior black , who was a preacher among them , then offered prayer , and preached . His was humble and.dcvotional . In one portion of it , hip diade an affecting allusion to their wrongs. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broken voice , " our state - *that it is the meanest - that we are as mean and low y men can be . But we have sinned - we have forfeited all our rights to Thee - and we would submit before Thee to these marks of thy displeasure . ' ' He took for the text of his sermon those words , ' The Spirit saith , come , ** &c.; He spoke with connexion of our original distance ; of the means provided for our approach and redemption- - of the invitation as founded on these - and closed by an earnest and wellsustained appeal to them to act on the gracious Invitation . Ah , sirs ! " he exclaimed , * ' do you ask , what it is to comet Oh , it is to know your own weakness ; it is to know your ' oim-4kworthiness ; it is to know that you are sinnersaild ready to fall into hell for your sins ; ' j it is to fly to Jesus Christ as your help and your Saviour ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' - To come ! Oh , it is to fall down at his feet - to receive him as your new Master - to become new creatures - and to live a new.f ; life of faith and obedience , " &c.; - " O , sirs ! " he 4 tinned , ' * ' that you would come ! How can I persuade you to come ! I have seen the good and the evil . I have seen the Christian dying , and I have seen the sinner dying . " He spoke of both ; and then referred to his own experience - the change rehgion had made in him - the happiness he had had since he knew it - the desire he haid that they should be happy likewise . It was indeed a very earnest and efficient appeal . Mr. Camithers kindly reminded me , as he paused , , ; that it was time ta leave , if I fulfilled my intention of ' ' ' &#9632; going to the Presbyterian Church . But I felt I could not leave before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droumstances ; but t could not bring myself to do any /z/ thing that might seem disrespectful to this and ol despised and oppressed Christians . .. - The other man of colour followed with a sponttaeons dress , meant to sustain the impression. - He had some conceit and forwardness in his manner , . but much point in what he said . - He concluded by noticing what had been doing among them lately ; and by caUing on those who were really concerned to come to ' the 3aviour , to show it by occupying the anxious seat . ' Qiey sang again ; and , while singing , some forms before the pulpit were cleared , and about twelve persons knelt dbWn at them with great seriousness of manner . There was no confusion , and the act of coming out does perhaps less violence to their as they are a small body , and are on an equality elders n9w took the matter into his haiiiADd offered prayer . Had *h0 I ' sought to cool down the statp'of feeling , it could not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for there was no extravagance : - jMy then rose , eod I sang , and separated . This ' ' , 3 worshipped with an assemblr ofavea and I shall r ' &#9632; * / . " &#9632; never forget it . I was certainly by sympathy bound &#9632; * ' * V with thos who were bound ; while I rejoiced , on their account , afresh in that divine truth , which makes us Iree ' V ' ! indeed , which lifts the soul on high , unconscious of a r , chain . ' L Much fan been said , and is still said , about the essen- f tial inequitlity of the races . That is a question which I must be settled by experiment . Here the experiment was undoubtedly in favour of the blacks . In sense and I ki feeling , both in prayer apd address , they were equal 1 to the whites ; and in free and pointed expressioi much superior . Indeed , I know not that while I was in Amer- ica , I listened to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have briefly noted to you . On leaving , we found we were too late for our first purpose ; but as the Methodists were just assembling for service , I expressed a wish to unite with them . There were few persons ppisent : not more than 150 . A gen- /z/ /q/ . tleMn , one of their local preachers , took the duties of fhe 4ulit . The services in his hands were very unintereiting . . He had much conceit , poor wit , and many words ; and all he . said was gabbled and uttered seemingly by rote . His address abounded with such plumed and wise expressions as - " I put it to your rationahty - white-robed angels of light - ; your spirit shall flutter before God in nevpr-ending bhss " - and " when you hear the clqds of the valley tumbling on your coffin . ' ' It was a sorry affair , and in contrast with what I had just witnessed . This , however , is no specimen of the average means possessed by this people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been qwq The town , as a settlement , has many attractions . It is surrounded by beauty , and stands at the head of a valley , flowing with mlk and honey . House rent is low ; provisions are cheap , v abundant , and of the best quality . Flowers and gudenfr aa more prized here /z/ qwq over the horse 's back , and into the carriage , so that oof feet and luggage were standing in water . We urged the horse to the utmost , and we succeeded ; but , with a tired animal and a heavy carriage , the experimM was full ' of hazard . In our wet condition , and in the dark night , we came to Captain Hall 's to solicit hospitality . It was not asked in vain . The captain is a farmer ; and , as he was expecting no one , his principal room was converted into a carpenter 's shop ; but we were offered the best that circumstances allowed . I retired early to rest . My attendant was a little slave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly encouraged by a kind word or look . He was very anxious to explore my dressings I case , and to get the names of things . The watch was familiar to him ; but he could not understand what the compass was , and seemed afraid of it . He was inquis- ' f itive to know , but very careful in touching things . I found him t my bedsidfl in the early morning , still seeking to obtain information , and to show some attei tions . My rest would , I doubt not , have been fair , but for one source of ' interruption . I had left my window * open for the sake of air , expecting no evil ; but the eats ipust have used it for their gambols , for they were coursing about my chamber all night most disagreeably . If in no other way haunted , it was Certainly a strange , and I suppose , accustomed haunt of the cats . Once out of the path , how difficult it is to return ! We started again very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to arrive at tiie Cave , after all our pains , too late for the spectacle . We reached the spot about one o'clock . The party of visiters had been , and werd just sitting down to dinner . But the lights were burn- * ; ing , and the guides ivere willing ; and this was , to my taste , the very time to see it , firee from the noiBe and confusion of two hundred visiters . So , turning our back on the dinner , away we went . The cave is found in a ridge of limestone hills , run* ning parallel with the Blue Ridge . In going to it , you /z/ *f k- 168 weyer 's cave* pass by Madison 's Cave , which was once an object of much interest , but is now neglected* from the greater attractions of the one we are about to explore . You ascend the side of the hill by a zigzag path of about 150 yards long , and then find yourself opposite a wooden door , which is the entrance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get cool , or to prepare otherwise ioj : ingress . Having passed the door , you find yourself ii# small ca ' , which may be regarded as a lobby to the whole apartments . With raised expectations , you look about you , by the aid of the daylight , which is struggling to enter , for some openings more considerable . All that you see , however , is the mouth of what appears a dark recess &bout; four feet square ; and you are told this is your passage onward . You have no adternative , but to double yourself up into the smallest possible dimensipns , and move along , after the lights of your guides , as well as you may , by the assistance of your hands . Having scrambled along for about twenty-five feet , you come into some larger openings , which allow you the free use of your person . You look upward and around you , and find yourself surrounded by the most grotesque figures , formed , through ages , by the percolation of the waters through the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , glancing onward , catches the dim and distant glimmer of the Ughts - some in the deeps below , and some in the galleries above . On quitting these smaller rooms and galleries , you enter an ascending passage , of easy access ; and on coming to its extremity , you see the opening of a large cavern spread before you , and the commencement of some steps by which you are to . descend . Your care is engaged in getting safely down ; but when you have obtained your standing on the floor , you are deUghted to find yourself in a large cavern , of irregular formation , and full of wild beauty . It is about thirty by fifty feet , and is called Solomon 's Temple . The incrustations become finer here . At your right hand , they hang just like a sheet of water that had been firozen as it fell . There they rise before you in a beau- /z/ /q/ tifiil Btalactitic pillar ; and yonder they compose an elevated seat , surrounded by sparry pinnacles , which sparkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Throne , and the other his Pillar . On leaving the Temple , you enter another room more irregular , but more beautiful . Besides having ornaments in eommon , it spreads over you a roof of most admirable and singular formation . It is entirely covered with stalactites , which are suspended from it like inverted pinnacles . They are of the finest material , and are most beautifully shaped and embossed . Tou now make an ascent ' of several feet , and move along a passage , and through two or three lobbies , and come to what is called the Twin-room , and find your way is just on the verge of a dark cavern , which is yawning at your feet , and is named the Devil 's Oven . A descent is now made of some difficulty , and from an elevation of about forty feet ; and you enter a large room , which is called the Tanyard . This , like some of the . restj is an absurd name ; but it has been adopted from the force of association . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavities , which may be thought to resemble the tanpits ; and from the ceiling are suspended large sheets of beautiful ' stalactites , which resemble the tanner 's hides . You advance to an upper floor in this room , which has chiefly one ornament , and that ' is sufficient . There is , extending along the room , and from roof to floor , an immense sheet of the finest stalactite . When it is struck with the hand , it emits deep and mellow sounds , like those of a muffled drum , and is called the Drum-room . You now rise by some natural steps to a platform , which you have again to descend , and then find yourself in what is named the Ball-room . It is a handsome and large apartment , about 100 feet lotig , 36 wide , and 26 high . Its floor ih so level as to admit of dancing , and it has been ns for this purpose . There is in the centre of it a large calcareous deposite , which has received the name of* Paganini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concretions ; and the efifect of the lights /z/ hurning at #Tery elevation , and leaving hidden more than they leyfitij is exceedingly fine . From the Badl-rdom you make an ascent of 40 feet . This is named Frenchman 's Hill ; from the circumstance that a visiter from France , with his guide , had their lights extinguished at this spot . Happily , the guide had such an accurate lolbwledge of the locality , that , , after much difficulty , they got safely back , a distance of more than 500 Ifeet . You wind your way through passages , and make a descent of nearly . 30 feet , hy what is known as Jacob 's liadder , with pits and caverns opening about you , and come into the Senate Chamber , and afterward to Con. gross Hall . The last is a fine room , very like the Ballroom , but with an uneven floor . As you leave it , an immense cavern spreads itself before you , with the lim lights gleaming over its mouth , so as to make its unfathomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instinctivy long to pass on , lest it should drink you up . *It has received the name of ** Infernal Regions . " By another lobby , and another descent , you enter Washington Hall . This is the most wonderful opening of the whole . It is 250 feet lohg , and 33 feet high . There is a fine sheet of rock-work running up the centre of this room , and giving , it the aspect of two separate and noble galleries , till you look above , where you observe the partition rises only 20 feet towards the roof , and leaves the fine arch expanding over your head untouched . There is a beautiful concretioll here standing out in the room , which certainly has ihb form and drapery of a gigantic statue ; it bears the name of the Nation 's Hero , and the whole place is filled with those projections , appearances which excite the imagination by suggesting resemblances , and leaving them unfinished . The general effect , too , was perhaps indescribable . The fine perspective of this room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous tMvs , when near you , so encumbered by deep shadowi to give only a dim religious light ; and when at a diitance , appearing in their various attitudes like twinkling start on A. deep f /z/ /q/ dark heaven ; the . amazing vaulted roof spread over yon , with its carved and knotted surface , to which ihm stream* ing lights below in vain endeavoured to convey their radiance ; together with the impression that you had made so deep an entrance , and were so entirely cut off from the living world and ordinary things ; produces an effect which , perhaps , the mind can receive but once , and will retain for ever . On leaving these striking apartments , you pass through a passage in which is standing some grand formations , named Cleopatra 's Needle and the Pyramids ; and then enter a room called the Church . The appearances in this instance suggest the name . It has about the dimensions of a church , and has an elevation of about 50 feet . There is at one ' end an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery . At the back of this gallery there are a number of pendent stalactites , of an unusual size and beauty . They are as large as the pipes of a full-sized organ , and arei ranged similarly . They emit , when struck , mellow sounds of various keys ; and if a stick is run over them , as we run the finger over musical glasses , they make pleasant music . There is nothing forced in giving this instrument the appellation of organ ; it is one of the best that nature ever made ; and the most remarkable that I ever beheld . At the other extremity there rises the ground ( not stuck on a roof , as we frequently see ) a beautiful spire of considerable height ; and this is the steeple . You pass by the steeple , and come into an apartment which has the name of e Dining-room . It has similar dimensions to the Church ; and on its left side there is a continued elevation , resembling a table . You now enter an immense gallery , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from 80 to 100 feet high . You turn aside to visit a small apartment , but of exquisite beauty . Here the most singolar sparry concretions hang pendent from the roof , whildTai equal number are growing up from the ground in sevel degrees of progress , many of them meeting in the centre , and becoming one . Winding pas- /z/ k /z/ BSgas axe lefl Uaoog them , which make a sort of labyiinlh ; and as Haj me a e mi-pell uc id , the passing of the lights through the several alleys had a. very singular effect . This hB9 the name of the Garden of Eden . You return to the Uining-raoia , and pass by a dark t your fee r , which is the mouth of a cavern , . which tha foot oC man has never been . Il can only red by rope ladders ; and it is supposed , though I think without sutlicient reason , to be charged with mephitic gases , fatal ta life . You may now make an ascent of some 50 feet , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your pains . You must clirab over the face of the rock , which has , nearly a perpandic ular pitch , and you will then find yourself on an elevated platform , and surrounded by loopholes and striking fipires . You may now look down from your eminence , which is the Giant 's Causeway , into the large illuminated rooms you have left , and perhaps see a small party mO ' ving over the floors in misty shadow . Here stands out in relief before you , and on the very verge of the platform , a fine group of Stalagmites , white as alabaster , and suggesting to the foncy the figures of a smaU party of horse moving overhigh and dMigerous precipices . Thoy I Bonaparte and his Guards . There is a fine arch below ; you may , its head , and by this means gain . V of the objects so far beneatli ecpandmg before you i with caution , ascend on a more commanding vit But we must hasten on . When you have made your descent to the ordinary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous and most beautiful concretion . It is a lower , about 30 feel each way at the base , and risiag in diminished squares to the height of 30 feet , ft is a stalagmite ; nearly as white and clear as alabaster , and dazzles you by its capacity to reflect hghts . You pass , also , some fine springs , at which you Hiay refcesh yourself on the way . Thete is one I must distinguish before we leave . You ascend , in getting to it , /z/ a steep of 19 feet , by a ladder , and them by a liiUe hard climbing , attain to the end of the recesB , and stand bet'nre what is named the Source or the Nile . It Is a fine transparent spring , and is very rema.rkablc for beil covered with a thin pellicle of stalagmite . It ia- ( liuig enough to bear you ; and has a hols cut in dig ceotie , which gives you access to the water . 1 hope you will not think you have been detained too long on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only described one half of what it unfolds , and that with hagle and imperfection . Il is , in ray judgment , one of the great natural wonders of this new wotid ; and for its eminence in its own class , deserves to be ranked with the Natural Bridge and Niagara , while it is far less known than either . Its dimensions , by the most direct ciJUrBe , are more than 1,600 feet ; and by the more winding paths , twice that itgih ; and its objects are remarkable foe their Tariety , fotmation , and beauty . In both respects , it wiU , T think , compare , without injury to itself , with the celebrated Grotto of Antiparos . For myself , 1 acknowledge the spectacle to have been most interesting ; but , to be so , it must be illuminated , U nn this occasion . 1 had thought thai this circumstance might give to the whole a toyish effect ; but the influence of 3,000 or 3,0l ) O lights on these immense caveniB is only such as to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sleeps on every thing . Scarcely any scenes can awaken so many p &ssions; at once , and so deeply . Curiosity , apprehen* sion , terror , surprise , admiratian , and delight , by turns and together , arrest and possess you . I have had before , from other objects , one simple impression made with gMater power ; but I never bad so many impressions made , and with so much power , before . If the interesting and the awful are the elements of the subiune , here sublimity reigns , as in her own domain , in darkness , silence , and deeps profound . On emerging froBi this subterrene world , our first concern was to perform our ablutions and rectify our dresses . /z/ This done , we hastened to the inn in search of refreshments . Here we were presented with a singular contrast to the scenes just contemplated . The innkeeper had advertised his show over all the welkin ; and his invitation had been fairly responded to ; but he had not provided adequate accommodation . His inn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small family ; and had the day been wet , the company had been in a wretched condition . The two upper rooms were crowded with females , who were waiting in succession to enjoy the use of a single looking-glass , that they . might : arrange their dresses , and put themselves above ridicule . Below , the two rooms were equally thronged who were making way to the bar for their potop of mint-julap , and other - favourite mixtures . Many prfexred rather to rely on the pure spirit , than on mixtures ef any kind . All , perhaps , thought that the occasion , whicK is one of much fatigue and of exposure to great difference of 2emperature ( not less than 30 ) would justify the use of some portion ; but many were not contented with a little ; I never saw , at any other time , so many persons the worse . for the use of spirituous liquors . In front of the house , on the greensward , a table was prepared , with a wooden awning , which would receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded , and mostly by ladies , who were certainly discussing the matters before them with great earnestness ; while their friends , lovers , and servants , - young farmers , smart collegians , and blacks , - were in bustling attendance behind , supplpng their plates , fanning their persons , and passing the merry joke and joyous laugh around . Apart from these were a multitude who had already partaken of the feast , reposixig on chairs , or expanding themselves on the turf , talking , smoking , or listening to the squeaking fiddle of an old merry slave , who was doing his best to gather up the loose halfpence of the company . It offered to one an interesting specimen of the people for thirty miles round . It was composed chiefly of the young ; and most'bf them seemed taiiave come rather to /z/ /q/ enjoy a frolic than to gratify an intelligent curiosity . One of their greatest faults was that of doing so much wanton mischief to the more delicate ornaments of the cave . All who went to the cave paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to get at , and not very tempting whiki obtained , we partook of our sandwiches , and , admonished by approaching evening , prepared to leave . The black , who had attended our horses , and who had been recompensed by Mr. Douglas , thinking that I was AoC aware of this , came up to me , and taking hold of my stirrup , said , in a plaintive voice and look , " Massa , it 's been bad day to me ! It ' most breaks my heart , to do so much and get so little . Massa ! " I have no doubt that Massa made a very good day of it ; but these men are &#9660; erjT insinuating ; and bondage and cunning go together . . We endeavoured to return by a nearer and better cOtirse . From the advancing state of the day , and the wearied state of oiurselves and horses , it was necessary that w* should accept the first accommodations on the road . A : ji distance of five miles from the cave , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a tavern with the sign of " Plain Dealing Hotel . " Now , as I have no relish for terms of cant , either in civil or religious life , I thought this sign somewhat ominous . On a nearer survey , some of i maintained that it could not contain us ; but Mr. D. thought its capacities greater than its appearance ; and so we alighted . The sleeping-rooms , as they were called , were in the angles of the roof , and were more like dovecots than bed-chambers ; moreover , others were to have access to them . We determined , therefore , to have the beds down stairs , and to sleep on the floor of the sitting and eating-r6om . When the time for this arrangement came , I was consulted by my hostess on my preference for a straw-mattress or feather-bed . Now , unused as I was to sleep on the boards , and harbouring , as I did , from my weary and bruised state , a special dislike to all hard sounds , I hastily resolved on ithe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My MluSthud the mattrees , and , therefore /z/ presenred between themselves and the floor c substance of some elasticity ; but M for me and my feather-bed , whenever I thought to place myself upon it , and however softly , away went the feathers on either side , and left me just to the blank and knotted boards . It was a weary night , relieved only by two circumstances . The first was , that my friends were sleeping fairly ; and the second was , that at midnight , some one opened the window , entered the room , and passed away to his place of slumber without ceremony . We had secured our door to prevent such intrusion ; but this was done in simplicity . Boots are the only mode of entrance to some ; they are only one of many to others . However , the people of this house , though of the plainest , gave us all the accommodation in their power ; and plain dealing with them seems to have piovpered , for they are carrying up a much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose iM the sun , and hastened on out way before the heat of the day . We paused at the " Tinkling Springs , " where we found a church , a school-house , and a burial-ground , in the heart of the woods ; at Granvilley where we left Mr. Douglas , at the dwelling of his mother ; and at Colonel M'DowelPs , as yre promised , where we had the same kindnesses repeated ; and at length reached Lexington , after an excursion which was very gratifying at the timjB ' , and which will , I doubt not , be pleasant to recollection always . I had only half a day remaining to see the Natural Bridge ; and to have left Lexington without seeing it , would have been a piece of Vandalism which the good people would not have forgiven . Colonel Reid , and to other gentlemen , accompanied me ; ' Mr. Carruthers had become unwell by the heat of the weather in our previous trip . On this occasion it was worse ; the glass was at and we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I perspired ahnost equally to what I had done at Louisville . But the eight leaves you neither weariness nor regret This famous bridge is on the head- of a fine limestoxiA /z/ hill , which has the tppearance oHuiving been rent asunder by some terrible convukioii in nature . * The fissure thus made is aboot ninety feet ; and over it the bridge runs , s6 needful to the spot , and so unlikely to have survived the great fracture , as to seem the work of man ; so simple , so gtand , so great , as to assure you that it is only the work of God . The span of the arch runs from 46 to 60 feet wide ; and its height , to the under Une , is about 200 feet , and to the head about 340 ! The form of the arch approachee to the elliptical ; and it is carried over on a diagonal line , the very Une of all others so difficult to the architect to ledixl ; and yet so calculated to enhance the picturesque beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of sight . Tou naturally make your way to the head of the bridge first ; and at it is a continuation of the common road , with ite eides covered with fine shrubs and trees , you may be cm it before you are aWare : But the moment you apftoach through the foliage to the side , you are filled with apprehension . It has , indeed , a Natural parapet ; but . few persons can stand forward and look over . You instinctively seek to reduce your height , that you may gaze on what you'edmire with security . Even then it agitates you wiUi diuy sensations . You then make your way some fifty feet down the bosom of the hill , and are supplied with some admirable standings on the projecting rock-work , to see the bridge and all its rich accompaniments . Tpre is , 300 feet below you , the Cedar river , apparently motionlessi except where it flashes with light , as it cuts its the broken rocks . Mark the trees , of every vaxiety , but especially the fir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its bed and how they ascend , step by step , on the noble ipck-work , till they overshadow you ; still pre : : serving such deUcacy of form and growth , as if they would not do an in ) tty , while they lend k grace . Observe those hills , gatheiing all axoiuid you in their fairest ' forms and ribiest verdure , Mif to do honour to a scene of surpassing excellence . Now look at the bridge itself , /z/ springing from this bed of verdant loveliness , distinct , one complete ! It is before you in its most picturesque form . You just see through the arch , and the internal face of the farther pier is perfectly revealed . . Did you ever see such a pier - such an atch % Is it . not most illusive ! Look at that masonry . Is it not most like the perfection of art ; and yet what art could never reach % Look at that colouring . Does if not appear like the painter 's highest skill , and yet unspeakably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no just conception of this masterpiece until you get below . You go some little distance for this purpose , as in the vicinity of the bridge the rocks are far too prpitous . A'hot and brilliant day is , of all others , the time to enjoy this object . To escape from a sun which scorches you , into thee verdant and cool bottoms , is a luxury of itself , which jdis* poses you to relish every thing else . When down , I was very careful of the first impression , and did ilot venture to look steadily on the objects about me till I had selected my station . At length I placed myself about 100 feet from , the bridge , on some masses of rock , which were washed by the running waters , and ornamented by the slender trees which were springing from its fissures . At my feet was the soothing melody of the rippling , gushing waters . Behind me , and in the distance , the river and the hills were expanding themselves to the light and splendour of day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reposing in tht most delightful shade , set off by the streaming rays of the sun , which shot across the head of the picture Ikr above you , and sweetened the solitude below . On the right and left , the majestic rocks arose , with the decision of a wall , but without its uniformity , massive , broken , beautiful , and supplying a most admirable foreground ; and , everywhere , the most delicate stems were planted in their crevices , and waving their heads in the soft breeze , Which occasionally came over them . The eye now ran tfaxot the bridge , and was gratified with a lovely Tisttt . The blue mountains stood out in the background ; beneathihem , the hills and woods /z/ /q/ gathered together , so as to enclose the dell below ; while the river , which was coursing away from them , seemed to have its well-head hidden in their recesses . Then there is the arch , distinct from every thing , and above every thing ! Massive as it is , it is light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem now only like a garland of evergreens ; and , elevated as it is , its apparent elevation is wonderfully increased by the narrowness of its piers , and by its outline being drawn on the blue sky , which appears beneath and above it ! Oh , it is sublime - so strong , and yet so elegant - springing from earth ' , and bathing its head in heaven ! But it is the sublime not allied to the terrific , as at Niagara ; it is the sublime associated with ' the pleasing . I sat , and gazed in wonder and astonishment . That afternoon was the shortest I ever remembered . I had quickly , too quickly , to leave the spot for ever ; but the music of those waters , the luxury of those shades , the form and colours of those rocks , and that arch - that arch - rising oYef all , and seeming to offer a passage to the skies -- O , they will never leave me ! ' /z/ ff Mt dear Friend , At four the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having made it one of my few resting- places . My intention was to join Mr. Douglas at a fourday sacramental meeting , at which he was attending . The congregation in which it occurred was in a state of revival , and it was among the most prosperous of this country . I had a strong desire to commune with the assembled Christians on the solemn occasion , and to make myself acquainted with the appearances of religion among them . Vol . I. - H 16 /z/ Wa had about fifteen miles to go , and partly from the heaviness of the roads , and partly from the heat of the day , we did not arrive til after the morning service had begun . The first indication of our approach to the church was in the appearance of an immense number of saddle-horses , from 300 to 400 lasned to the trees ; and , as we continued to wind our way along , we presently saw portions of the building through the clustering tfuiilts aud foliage . On reaching the place , we found it crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand ing in the open doorways , sitting on the steps , or reposing on the grass , where they might have the chance of hearing ; apd , in many instances , charged with the care of young Sod happy children , too gay to be quiet in ij state of confinement . The associations were interesting ; here was a large congregation , proper to a city , ( convened in the depths of the forest . The circumatances were striking ; the day was exceedingly hot , but here people , cattle , church , and all , were thrown into most delightful shade by the overtopping trees , except where me sun shot down through an opening before the sanctuary , like a pillar of light and glory . We managed to gain admittance . It was the sacramental service . Messrs . Morrison , Douglas , and Armstrong , were officiating . The pastor admitted twelve persons to the church , and three of them were baptized previously . The other services were in the usual order of the Presbyterian Church . The members qune successively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There must have been 600 persons communicating . There was the appearance of true seriousness on the whole assembly ; and every thing was as quiet and solemn as it could be with a house so crowded , and the exchange of places which this method makes necessary . I gratefully united with them ; we ate of one bread and drank of one cup , and were , I trust , of one spirit . In such circumstances , there was great power and sweetness in at promise , " I will be to them as a little sanctuary in the wilderness. ' /z/ SACRAMENTAL MEETING . . tl ' /z/ At noon a pause was made for half an hour , as a period of refreshment . Then you might have seen the-r family and friendly groups , in all directions , seated at the feet of the gigantic trees , partaking of their simple past , and welcoming all t ( t partake who were provided with less than themselves . The afternoon service was renewed and sustained in like spirit . The birds , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitation , flew in and out by the open windows , seeming to excite no observation except to myself , so rural were the habits of this people ! At the close of the engagements- , I went with Mr. Morrison . His dwelling is about two miles distaat It was really a beautiful sight to see this people - men , women , and children , - all mounted on their fine horses , and starting away , as to be found . In . our own line , we had quite a cavalcade , such as old Chaucer nught have celebrated . As we advanced over glade , and broek , and dingle , our path forked , and we broke off to the right and left ; and again it forked , and again we were scattered . My eye long rested on them . Nowou might see a single horseman take his solitary path through the woods ; now a family cluster , parent , child , and grandchild ; and now an aged pair , who told you that they were closiug life as they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickening forest ; now tiiey disappear in the dingle : now you see them again , but indistinctly , and far away ; and now they vanish altogether . My eye searched for them in vain . Why should it have searched at all ? I did not know these people - I had not spoken to them . Why , then , did a sentiment of regret steal over me , as they vanished , one by One , perhaps to be seen no more for ever ? Tou can understand this . The ' following day was the last of the four , and nothing would satisfy my brethren but that I should preach in the morning . There was an excellent attendance , and /z/ the people evidently heard with attention and seriousness . One circumstance gave me some surprise at the moment . Towards the close of the sermon , some twenty or thirty men rose , after each other , and went out , and in the course of three or four minutes returned to their places . It was evidently not the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern to disturb the hearing of others as little as possible . I could not imagine the cause ; but it was afterward explained , that some rain had fallen , and they had gone out to cover the saddles , that they might not get wet . Apart from the unpleasantness and hazard of a wet saddle , the young people here are very chary of their horses and their accoutrements , as , more than any thing , these mark the respectability of the party . I took my leave of the people , while yet assembled , and waiting other services , as I had to hasten on to Staunton that day . My esteemed friend also excused himself to his people , and " kindly insisted that he would convey me so far on my journey . I was greatly obliged by this mark of friendship , especially as it allowed me an opportunity of free intercourse with him on subjects touching his charge . I learned that this neighbourhood had been long settled , though the population was so concealed ; and that the present church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first was a mere log erection . The inhabitants were till a late period much annoyed by the Indians . There was a fort on the plantation Where my friend resides ; and most of the houses were fortified , and the people obliged to bring their rifles to church , to protect themselves from attack . My friend had been settled here since the year 1819 , and it was his maiden charge . When he came , he thought there was a good impression on the minds of the people , from the sudden death of a beloved minister . The church was comparatively small , but there was a large body of hopeful young persons who had not yet professed the Saviour . His labours for the first five years STAUNTOIf. 178 were very successful . After this , there was a pause in his usefulness , which gave him much distress . He could not , avoid connecting this very much with the abundant production and use of distilled liquors throughout his parish . They had all , as farmers , fallen into the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , of course , was a great temptation . He made it the subject of consideration and prayer . He determined to press the claims of the Temperance cause on their consciences . He did it with firmness , but with equal prudence and temper . It had nearly unsettled him with his charge for a time ; for some of the leading farmers resisted , and became adverse to him . However , some yielded , and others followed ; and this was succeeded by a revived state of religion such as they have ilot known ; and it has continued for the last four years . Before this effort , no less than 150,000 barrels of spirits were produced , and each family had a still ; now not 5,000 are . made , and but one person holds a still . The farmers , too , have found a better market for their surplus produce , and are every way more prosperous . To assist your judgment on this interesting case , I will supply you with the additions to this church through a course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1819 , the year of his settlement , fourteen persons wre added ; in 1820 , thirty ; in 183 1 , eighteen ; in 1829 , sixty-eight ; in 1823 , forty-.four ; in 1824 , five ; in 1825 , six ; in 1826 , nine ; in 1827 , six ; in 1828 , nine ; in 1829 , three ; in 1830 , six ; in 1831 , one hundred , and four ; in 1832 , forty ; in 1833 , two hundred and seventyfour ; and in the year 1834 , up to August , twentyrfife were added . In the first revival no means were used except preaching , and meetings for prayer . In the . second , which includes the last four years , similar means were used with more firequency ; and in a few instances , the serious were separated from the rest of the congregation . The persons impressed and converted on these occasions were , with very few exceptions , from fifteen te thirty years of age , inclining to the younger pexiod. /z/ Those in respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second revival , the work begali in the more wealthy families , and passed downward to the poor and the servants . There was in neither case , nor at any time , the least noise or disorder ; and the most useful seasons have always been characterized by deep stillness and solemnity . The first and chief sign for good , in every case , Mr. Morrison remarked with emphasis , has been an increased spirit of prayer . The effects were very exhilarating . Tliere are now about 600 nembers of the churqh , and nearly 200 of them are under twenty-five years of age , though scarcely any under fifteen . The family composing this church cover a district of land about ten miles square . There is scarcely one that has not domestic worship . They have no poor to receive charity from the sacrament , and only one person needing help , who receives it through private channels ; and they contributed 1,000 dollars last year to foreign religious objects . The pastor 's salary , I think , is 800 dollars ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interesting conversations whiled the time away . We halted to refresh , and to take leave of our friends , the Douglases ; and then drove on to Staunton . We alighted at the principal hotel . It was kept by a religious family , and Mr. Morrison was known and esteemed by tdem . We were entertained in their private roapis . They had read of the Deputation in the papers , and soon learned that I must be a member of it ; and were eager to show , as to 3 Christian and an Englishman , the utmost attentions . We had a room full to social worship , and had the sensation of being members of a private house hold rather than of guests at a tavern . In the morning I was up with the day , for t had to leave- by the ittge at four o'clock . My beloved friend ( such I must now call him ) had also risen to continue his kindness to the last moment . We spoke ; we were silent ; we separated . I had , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /q/ quickly roused from my musings on the past , by hearing that we were about to make the ascent . It was full four miles , and consumes much time ; but this was no matter of complaint under such circumstances . I must not , however , hold your attejition with renewed descriptions of mountain scenery . . Let me merely remark , that while , in the ascent , * the nearer objects greatly resembled - some things that have been described , there is considerable difference on attaining the full* eflevation . No single object stands out with prominence ; but all that you have ' seen , and greatly more , is spread before you at once in grand , expanded , and . mellowed harmony . There is before you a field of mountain heads , like to wha ( may be seen in Wales or Scotland , beautifully coloured and bloomed by a blue mist which rests on them . And behind you is the valley you have left , now blended with other valleys , which together form only the raised foreground to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , till it is lost in the horizon , and which might receive all the inhabitants of Europe , and ask for more . I knew not in which direction to I00 &; with most eagemesr and continuity . Sometimes I preferred the mountain , and then the valley picture ; and the enjoyment of either , I knew , must be very short . I gazed and admired again and again , so long as our driver would allow ; and when we began to descend , I felt that I was about to separate from another friend , and to separate fer ever . My intention in crossing the Blue Ridge was to make Charlottesville in my way to Richmond . The University of that place is considered foremost in the hterary institutions of this people , and it was desirable that it should not be overlooked . The site for the town and university could not have been better chosen . It is composed of fine swells of land ; is surrounded of ' beautiful opdn country ; and this blue hills lie in the distance delightfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be highly salubrious . The town is small , and has aa un &uahed; appearance . /z/ The inhabitants , however , are respectable , and have a measure of refinement not frequently met with in towns of this class ; but literature has a tendency to humanize and refine all things where it comes . The only deduction on this impression is , that the stocks and the pillory stand in the courtyard , as a means of correction for the poor blacks . The religious character of this place is too remarkable to be unnoticed . It will be understood that the university was promoted chiefly by Jefiferson , and on avowedly skeptical and infidel principles . This gave the character to the town . It had no religious means ; and the evil was increased from time , to time , by the settlement . of such , persons only as were at least indifferent to means which it did not supply . This was the state of thingstill twenty-five years since , when Jady Was brought , by her husbands engagements at the University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of piety , and of course lamented greatly the moral and spiritual condition of the people . What she lamented , she sought to remove . Sh6 determined to commence , in her own house , a Sabbath school , for the rehgious instruction of the young . She persevered through many difficulties , ' and found re- , ward in her work . The influence of her benevolent exertions , as well as of her excellent character , touched her husband ; and he learned to honour the religion he had thoughtlessly despised . Strengthened by his concurrence , she proposed that their dwelling should be opened once on the Sabbath for divine worship , that the people might have some t ) opportunity of separating that day from their common time . The work of faith and love was crowned with success . Various ministers gave their services. ; and the people attended , listened , were impressed , and converted from worldliness and ungodliness . There are now , in this town , of about 1,000 in population , four places of worship - Presbyterian , Episcopalian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend them , and there are about 150 children in the Sabbathsckools . The excellent lady who made the first /q/ &#9632; Krrement in this change , still lives - a mother in Israel ; and the contrast of the former with the present times , in the history of this community , must often supply her with pleasiCnt and- grateful recollections . From the town let us make a transition to the University . It was the favourite object of Jefferson . He gave it great pains , and was disposed to rest his reputation with posterity upon - it . So far as morality and religion were concerned , his intention was to found it , not merely on liberal , but on infidel principles . His opinions had been mostly formed in the French school of that day ; and into his views of education , there entered something of the acuteness and malignity of Voltaire , with a portion of the speciousness and extravagance of Rousseau . This was styled philosophy ; * and this philosophy was to govern the establishment , or rather , it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bdw to no authority ; they were to be controlled by no law , but were to be left to their own honour as a sufficient principle of action . The fact was , however , that when the young men were fairly left to their honour , their honour left ' em . Disorder , dissipation , and folly , became predominant . The better class of pupils was withdrawn . The professors took disgust , and looked around them for stations where order and conscience were still regarded ; and the whole frame of this University was threatened with dissolution . So far , then , as this was an experiment in favour of infidelity , like every other experiment , it has failed - completely failed . What , then , you are ready to ask , is its condition now t For the sake of the cause of letters , I am happy to state , that it is one of renovation and great promise . All the professors saw and felt the evil which had come over this noble institution , and threatened its destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted a decided and vigorous system of discipline ; they honoured the name and institutions of religion ; they subscribed at their own expense to support ministers , who should , in turn , conduct pablic worship within the University , and /z/ fiure now raising a subscription to builj % daaxdk'nS ' M very purpose ! The is , that ordmiB re aljl A R and with it public conence ; and youth of jwapeotatii . and pious connexions are flocking to it from the ftqirounding States . The professorships . are again sought by men of the first attainment ; and it is likely to 46 honour to the . expectations of an aspiring people . It is now an experiment in favour of education , still conducted on liberal principles , but with religious sanctions ; and if it is steadily sustained , with a fixe4 regard to this issue , it will succeed ! The Rev. Mr. Bowman , Presbyterian minister of this place , though unwell , kindljr attended me to the University , and introduced me to Professor Patteson . It was the vacation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils were away . He conducted me over the principal buildings , and took great and obliging pains to satisfy my inquiries . There is here an observatory , an excellent library , a good philosophical apparatus , and a rising collection of minerals . Externally , the mass of erections have an imposing and grand effect , and they are much assisted to this by the ground which they occupy . With some slight variations since , the plan is wholly Jefferson 's . He gave it very deep and close attention ; and obtained , by hit extraordinary influence , large grants from the State in it i favour . But these grants were not well applied , nor these painS ' skilfully directed . The erection , as a whole , will not endiire the touch of rigid criticism . He saw that diversity of line , figure , and position , often contribute to striking effect , but he saw no more . The principal figure is the Rotunda ; answering to its name , while every thing else . is as square as square can be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red bricks , with a dome on its and with windows perforated round it . It stands naked and alone at the head of the picture . Running down from this , on either hand are the dwellings for the professors , and the lecture-rooms , forming two sides of a handsome area . They are detached errections , with large /z/ /q/ fjftlqynna riling thair whole height ; and they are united of , a colcmnade running over the ground story , so Uiat a Ikie'of columns , that is meant to be one to the eye , sup plies you , at intervals , with pillars fifteen and thirty feet ( dgh ! The accommodations for the pupils are in the biiokgiound , and are not meant to appear in the principal sdene . Jefferson was proud of his success as an architect ; so proud that , notwithstanding the glare of his red bricks , and of a scorching sun , he would ilot allow any trees to be planted , lest they should hide ' the work of his hands ! Now that he is gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , are beginning to screen his defects , and to give a grace and a keeping to ' ' the scene which gratifies te 6ye , and harmonizes with the quiet pursuits of the place . In quitting the University , let me , while I have spoken freely of tfefiferson , do him justice in this particular . He was not an architect , and , unhappily , he was not a Christian ; but he was a great man , and he sought with much pains to confi honour and benefit on his country , by the . establishment of a great literary institution . When the evils of his system shall have been removed , his name will still be identified with it , and will command the respect of his - countrymen . On the same day I had to leave , by the stage , for Richmond . We had a r nights rest at a comfortable inn on our way . The following morning we broke down , and were detaihed some Incurs without breakfast . Delay was also promoted by the heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall and expire on the road during the week . It was late in the day , therefore , before we arrived at the capital . Richmond is afinecity , withapopulationof about 15,000 persons . It has a commanding situation on the margin of the James river , from which it rises on the slopes of two fine hills . The main street is wide , handsome , and indicative of business ; and the retired streets are occu- . pied by genteel and commodious residences , agreeably ' shaded and oraamented by the althea , the honeysuckle , * 4 180 jLieamoKp. /z/ the locust , the Jvide of China , and the Taheitan mulberry. ; ttigjr ipt0 the town , from Charlottesville over the dewQgt ftttrilting ; and the distant view across the river n not 109 " . The buildings and streets are seen running up the sides of the hills , reheved and softened by the abundant and spreading foliage . The more important erections cluster round its sammit ; and on its head stands , above every thing , the StateHouse , spreading its noble portico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a city . 1 had designed to remain here over the Sabbath ; but , on learning that a camp-meeting was about to be held on the Northern Neck , I resolved at once to move forward , as I might not find another opportunity . This left me only one clear day at Richmond ; and I am indebted to many kind friends , especially to Mr. Burr , and- the Rev. Mr : Taylor , for assisting me - to make- the best use of my time here . ' , This place , like Charlottesville , has undergone a great change in the last thirty years . At that time there were only one or two neglected Episcopal places of worship . The people were all given up to worldliness or infidelity . The influence pf Jefferson was felt also here , and it was felt as a bhght on all religious sentiment . Slavery had , however , done a greater mischief . Now there are thirteen places of worship , and 1,000 children in the . Sabbath schools . The blacks are not allowed their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mostly composed of them . A number of Jews reside here . They are not persecuted , nor any way disquahfied on account of their rehgious persuasion ; and the consequence is , that they forget their faith , intermarry , and are losing their personal distinctions . I attended a prayermeeting at the church where my late esteemed friend aud correspondent , Br . Rice , laboured successfully for many years . It was now without a pastor . The last minister , excellent as I know him to be , had pressed , in his great anxiety for usefulness , the subject of revivals too far ; and it produced a rtoction unfaTotatble to his comfort and contimiaiice. qwq /z/ /z/ scriber by Hiram Chiles , I shall proceed to sell for cash at the Auction Store of J. &; S. Cosby &; Co. , on Monday , the 4th fif August next , the following property , to wit : - Eliza , Henry , Nancy , Monarchy , Tom , and Edward , and six feather-beds and bedsteads , with furniture . " Joseph Mato , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auctioneers . I had a desire to stay and witness this sale ; but as I must have sacrificed the greater to the less in doing so , I kept by my determination . to go forward . I left , therefore , at two o'clpck on the Friday for Fredericksburg . The road was flat and uninteresting ; the weather very hot , and we had to travel all night . Moreover , the coach was quite full , and not supplied with the most agreeable company . One of them was proud of telUng us that he was an unlucky dog , and had lost 30,0l ) 0 . dollars by bad debts . Another was exclaiming against the brutes who would not be accommodating in a coach , that he might engross the accommodation to himself . There was a young woman with us , of decent but independent habits , and they had pleasure in bantering her . She , however , was a match for them . They thought , in one instance , they had got the laugh against her ; and she exclaimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should like to know what you are laughing at , for then I could laugh too . " They were very desirous of knowing what I was ; ' ' and at length they proposed that they should guess what each one was , and whence , with the hope of getting round to me . The guessing went round till all were disposed of except me . I was prepared for the attack , but it was not made . They looked at each other , and at me , but no one ventured on the question . In the morning a most heavy thunder-storm came on , and attended us into the town . We had had several of these , and of wind-storms , lately . One of them , near a spot I passed , must have been a tremendous hurricane . .. ii /q/ It tore down numerous buildings , prostrated the trees in its course , and killed sixteen or twenty persons . So soon as the storm permitted , I made my way to the house of Mr. Wilson , the esteemed Presbyterian minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of Washingtoxl lived in and her remains lie in the garden attached . Here a bed , and every other domestic accommodation , were immediately placed at my use . My friend was very desirous that I should stay over tle Sabbath , but when he found that my mind was otherwise , he was equally ready to help me on my way , except that he thought the direction in which I was going was at the time very unhealthy ; and he would only part with me on a promise that I would , by writing , assure him of my welfare . We spent a very pleasant , and to me profitable , evening together , and I have seldom parted with a friend in such haste , and with such ifegset LETTER Xvn . Mt dear Friend , I hAd thought thafl should be a'ble to pass to the camp-ground at pleasure ; but I found that if I wnt all , I must ledve by a boat that started thenett iomin I had also concluded that I should arrive by it in time for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. this also disappointed . Early in the morning I w0nt on boaird the steamer to pass down the Rappahannoc . It is what is called a reHgious boat . There are Bibles strewed in the men 's cabin , and a subscription-box for the Episcopal Tract Society ; and in the ladies ' cabin there are fancy articles on sale for missions . But this religious boat had not ceased to run on ' the Sunday , nor had the captain wholly broken himself of swearing . ' He had wished , " he /z/ said , " to avoid the Sunday ; he had tried all days , and none would suit so well ; and it saved a day to men of bushieflis ; " - a sort of reasoning miliar in more countxies than one . ' The day was fine and , tranquil , and the atmosphere was lighter and cooler in consequence of the stormv There were but few persons on board , and they employed themselves in reading , singing , and conversation , while I sat mostly apart , enjoying the quiet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the river was beautifuL The stream was narrower than is usualand winds in its course ; the land swells and falls prettily , while the iUim kablt forest runs over its whole surface . We were liowever , frequently stopping at different points of this ibrest to take in passengers , which assured us that was habitation though there were no appearances of it . Those , on this occasion , who were taken in , were rell-s gious persons ; and at noon most of them left us . J afterward found that they had left for the canground and by a nearer course . As I was quite a stranger , and as wherever I landed I should still require to be conveyed to the interior , I judged it safest to adhere to my direc tions , even if they should not have been the best . As we went onward , the Rappahannoc expanded beautifully before us , offering to our admiration a variety creeks and bays , reposing in the glawing lights of the sun and the cool shades of the forest ; whUe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porpoises joined and for miles amused themselves by darting and jplunging before the head of our vessel , with amazing Telocity . At length we came to Merry Point , th place t &; which I had been directed , and which is occupied by tit , Jesse , of whoyi I was assured I should readily receive any aid I xwght require . The dwellings and twa or three merry negroes , were aU that appeared . The captain , in my behalf , addressed the principal of them .

" Notwithstanding this assurance , I was much perplexed . On the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no other house to which I could apply ; and I could not get over to the camp-ground that evening . On the other hand , I shrunk from making firee with a residence on the mere concurrence of the servants , and in the absence of the head of the family . However , I thought of Virginian hospitality , and reconciled myself to going on shore . I was quickly met by a man , a relative of the family , who gave me welcome , and contntniCod to assure me in accepting ihfi accommodations of the house . When I had leisure to look around me , I feH interested in my place of sojourn . The dwelling was a neat cottage , having about six rooms , and kept nicely painted , with a few ornaments in the best room , such as sideboard and timepiece , imported from Baltimore , which indicated property , and a taste for . improvement on the part of the possessor . Behind it wasa small clearance , redeemed from the forest , and under good cultivation ; before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ althea . On the one side was a cabin for the . use of the slaves ; and on the other a handsome walnut , overshadowing the Wanner aspect of the cottage . The land fell away in slopes to the river , and was adorned by the oak , the acacia , the catalpa , and the woodbine ; and the river here wound round the point , and formed a lovely creek , which ran into land , and was ' lost in the woo4s . On die opposite banks of the creek was another cotta surmounted by poplars , and surrounded by " fruit-trees and corn-fields , which ran down the verdant banks , and dipped their feet in the placid waters . These were all the signs of human habitation ; and all around you stood , in awful silence and majesty , the eternal forest . The declining sun gleamed athwart the scene , giving depth to the shadows of the woods , and illuminating the bosom /z/ 160 nasTiTjLUTT. of the waften . But all was still - perfectlj still ; etcispt where the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a ripple behind . I was called frm this lovely picture hj the of supper or tea . A small clean napkin was f laced on the tableland there were spread over it coffee , hot bread , butter , bacon , molasses , and a bowl of curds and whey* ' A female slave attended , to fan you , and to supply your wants . On retiring , to bed , I was introduced to a small roomr m the robf of the cottage , but very nicely provided with all I could want . My attendaEut was a little black girl . She glced a qimck eye on every thing , to ascertain that all was right , and then stood in silence ) looking to me for commands . She seemed surprised , and did not at first understand me when I dismissed her ; from the circumstance , I suppose , that they are accustomed to render small aettentions which we do not expect . My Httle slave ws also the first thing that met my eye in the early morning . I had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter , and when I awoke she was creeping , with shoeless foot , over the floor . Her duty then was to sujly you with finesh water ; as by standing through the nixt , it becomes disagreeably hot . My young fiiend had met my wishes , in providing for a movement towards the canq in the morning ; and by six o'clock we had breakfasted , and had vaulted into our saddles . We were , however , scarcely on our way beforer we fell in with Mr. Jesse himself . He had Jieard of my arrival ; had feared I rtK ) uld not be able to get over ; kod had left , at break of day , to fetch me . This was , mdeed , very kind ; it put me at my ease , and made the ufay plain- ai pleasant to mis . But how it could have Ittppened that they should hear of my coming , greatly surprised me . Mr. Jesse explained , that some person at the camp had been in Richmond when I was there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough to awaken attention ; and I foaad that they /q/ had been expecting me daily ; that the ministers had held an exercise of prayer , that my arrival might be an occasion of profit , and my judgment of their meeting without prejudice . So soon as my kind friend had refreshed himself and his horse , we started again . We were now on the Northern Neck , an isthmus of Tarious width , and some 150 miles long , which is separated from the mainland of Virginia by the Rappahahnoc . We had twelve miles to travel , and chiefly through pine barrens ; reaches of land that are so denominated , because they will only bear pine . The morning was bright and elastic ; I had an interesting companion , and my expectations were raised with the prospects before me . As we advanced , the land undulated pleasantly , the soil improved , and other timber of loftier growth appeared . When evidently approaching the spot , my eye pierced through the forest in search of some indications . We got at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clustering trees and opposing stumps , and then came to what I regarded as the signs of the object sought . There were , under some trees , pens for the safety of horses ; then there were carriages of all descriptions , appearing with horses and oxen , secured and at rest , and occasionally a negro in attendance on them . Then you passed by a large log-house , which was erected for the time , to supply lodging and food to such as needed them . Now you saw , in several directions , the parts of cabins , made of the pine-tree , and of the same colour , and only distinguished from it by the hprizontal lines in which it ran ; and presently you found yourself at the entrance of all you wished to see . There were in lines , intersected by the trees , a number of tents composed of log-wood , forming a quadrangle ' of about 180 feet . In the centre of the further line , in this square , ' there was a stand for the accommodation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Befimd this were . stems of ees laid down as seats for the negroes , running off in radiating /z/ lines , and closed by some tents for their use , and foiii* ing tiie segment of a circle . Belfore the stand , or pulpit , ft nil was carried round the first five or six seats , which we called the altar ; and seats , composed of tree-stems , filled op the centre of the square . Within , without , ever3rwhere , the oak , the chestnut , and the fir appeared , and of finest growth ; only those within the quadrangle were cleared of underwood , and trimmed up to aid the sight , so that they resembled the beautiful pillars of a cathedral ; while their lofty heads , unpruned by the hand of man , united , and made a foliated ceiling , such as no cathedral could approach , and through which the blue sky and bright sun were glancing . It was now the hour of morning worship . Thi pulpit was full ; the seats were covered with waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the brethren . We rose , and united in a hymn of praise . I had never , in such circumstances , joined in offering such worship . I could scarcely tell what sensations possessed me . I hope I was not void of those which are devotional , but I was chiefly filled for 0ie moment with those of wonder . When I looked round on the scene which had broken so suddenly upon me , every thing was so novel , so striking , and so interesting , as to appear like the work of enchantment , and to require time fully to realize . But I must endeavour to give you some of the services in detiCil , as you will desire , exact information . The singing to which I have referred , was followed by prayer and a sermon . The text was , " If God spared not his own Son , ' ' &c.; - The preacher was a plain man , and without education ; and he had small regard either to logic or graauiuur . He had , however , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms and sentiments , which stood in strange opposition to the general poverty and incorrectness of his expressions . The proposition , for instance , raised on his text was tills : - Tliat tbB gift of Christ to sinners is tiie thing set forth with most life , animation , and eloquence , of any /q/ /z/ thing in the world . Such a proposition , though badly propounded , was of course above such a man ; but though what he said did but httle for his propoution , it was said with earnestness and pious feeling , and it told on the plain and serious portions of his audience . He was followed by a brother of higher qualifications , who took up the close of his subject , and addressed it to the conscience with skill and effect . The exhortation was terminated by an invitation to come and take a seat within the altar . These seats were , when wanted , in other words , the anxious seats ; two of them were cleared , and a suitable hymn was sung , that persons might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motiber with her boy , who had previously seemed to court notice . The lad had indulgcul in noisy crying and exclamation ; he was in the hand of an indiscreet parent , and had not been sufiSciently discouraged by the ministers . . The exhortations , and then the singing , were renewed ; but still with small effect , as to the use of the prepared seats ; and so this service closed . Whatever may be the claims of the anxious seat , it was a hazardous experiment , where it was evident the previous services had produced no deep and controlling impression . The afiemoon service was very sixnilar in arrangement and in effect . The text was , " Let the wicked man forsake his way , " &c.; ; but the preacher certainly made a feeble use of a powerful passage . It was interrupted , too , by a noisy and intemperate man , who had found his way hither ; yet it was followed by exhortation superior to itself , and an urgent appeal to the people to come for ward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only apology for thus pressing under unfavourable circumstances was , that the meetings had been held now for three days ; that the solemn service ! of the Sabbath had just passed over the people ; and the worthy ministers were anxious for visible fruit , not only as arising from the present appeal , but from past impressions . ' These were the more public and regular services ; but /z/ // ether engagements were always fiilfilling. were inviied by Iheir fiienda to the several tents , to exhort , and amg , and pray , so that when they ceased in one place , the ; were renewed in another . And at al times ihose who liked to gather within the altar , and sing , weie allowed to do so and as , when they were weaiy , oth era came up and supplied their places , the singing was without ceasing . What you can not escape wearies you . The serricea had been long , and not very interesting ; and still the singing was continued . After getting some lefreshmentB with kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fbi- 1 , and 10 ruminate on what I had seen and heard . Now i. ihn I had leisure lo admire , it was a lovely CTaoing , Through many a green alley I wandered ; and oftol md I stop and gaze on those exquisite combinations of light , shade , and picture , which forest scenery supplies on a fair summer evening . In all my wanderings , the singing followed me , and was a clew to my return ; but it now formed a pleasing accompaniment lo my solitary walk , for it did not fores itself on the ear , but rose and fell softly , sweetly , on the evening breeze . Soon , however , the hoarse notes of the horn vibrated through the air , and summoned me to return . It was the notice for worship at sundown ; and as there is little twilight here , the nightfall comes on suddenly . I hastened to obey the call , and took my place with the brethren on the preachers ' stand . The day had now eipired , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic , and il was certainly very impresaive . On the stand were about a dozen miruaters , and over their heads were suspended several ihree-pronged lamps , pouring down their radiance on theii heads , and surrounding them with such lights and shadows as Rembrandt would love to copy . Behind the stand were clustered about 300 negroes , who , with their black faces and while dresses thrown into partial Ughts , were a striking object . Before us was a fullsized congregation collected , more or less revealed , as tbejr hipened lo be near or distant from the points of /z/ illumination . Over the people veie suspended from the Ireea a number of Email lamps , which , in ( he diatance , seemed like stars sparkling between their branches . Around the congregation , and within the line of the tents , were placed some elevated tripods , on which large fires of pine wood were burning , cracking , ttlkzing ; andahooting upward like sacrificial flames to heaven . They gave amaxing power to the picture , by casting a flood of waving Ught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing'eWin comparative obscurity . SiiU at greater dislace. might be seen , in several directions , the dull flickering flame of the now neglected domestic fire ; and the eparltt emitted from it , together with the filefly , and shot actoss the scene like meteors , and then dropped into darkness . Never was darkness made more visible , more present . All the lights that were enkindled appeared only to have this effect ; as everywhere more was hidden than seen . If the eye sought for the tents , it was only here and there that the dark face of one coulcf be dimly Eeen ; the rest was wrapped in darkness ; and ' if it rose with the trees around you , the fine verdant and vaulted roof which they spread over you was mostly concealed by the mysterious and thickening shadows which dwelt there . Then , of you would pierce beyond these limits , there lay around you and over you , and over the unbounded forest that enclosed you , a world of darkness , to which yout little illuminated spot was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike the imagination and the heart . But to the exercises . The singing , which had been sustained in all the interval by some younger persons , now showed its results . Two or three young women were fcinting under the exhaustion and excitement ; and one , wifp was reported to me as a Methodist , was in hysterical ecstasy , raising her hands , rolling her eyes , and smiling and muttering . It appeared that she courted this sort of excitement as many do a dram , and was frequent at meetings of this character , for the sake of enjoying it . However , after disposing of this slight interruption , the regalar aeirice begsn . It was to be composed of exhortation smd prayer ; and it was excellently conducted . The Isading ministers , who had been wearied by the claims of the Sabbath , had evidently reserved themselves for ttlis period . The lrst address referred to the past ; ' efTort which had been made : the results which ought to follow , but which had not foLowed , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an affectionate expression of concern that they would now show that it had not been in vain . The next exhortation was on conversion . Some skilful and orthodox distinctions were established on the subject , as it involves the agency of the Spirit and the agency of man , ll waa discriminative , but it was plain and pungent ; and threw all the responsibiUly of perversity and refusal on the sinner . It made a strong impression . The tliird exhortation was on indifference and despondency . The subject was well limed and well treated . The speaker combated these evils as likely to be a preventive in most persons in coming to a decision ; and Jw made a wise use of evangelical truth for this poiprae . He supported the other addresses by an earnest appeal to separate themselves , and show that they were resolved to rank on the Lord ' ' s aide . The people were evidently much more interested than they had been ; and the preachers were desirous of bringing them to an issue . Exhortation and singing were renewed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass among the people , for the purpose of conversing with them , and inducing them to come forward . By these personal apphcations and persuasions , a considerable number were induced to come forward ; and fervent prayer of a suitable character was offered in their behalf . It waa already late , and here , at leaal , the service should have stopped . Tia was the opinion of the wiser and elder brethren , but they did not press it ; and those of weaker mind and stronger nerve thought that the work had only jusl begun . It was wished that I should retire , but 1 was desirous of witneasing the scene . Othei sjfiorta- caMp-m /z/ vions and prayers , of iloirei but more noisy character , were made , with endleai singing ; favourite couplets would be taken-up and repeated without end . The effect was vanoua , but it was not good ; aorae , with their ftelr ingB worn out , had passed the crisis , and it was in TUBto seek to impress them ; while others were unduly and tinprofilably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They separated themselves from the general service , and sought their own preachef and aniious seat . A stand was presently filed between two trees ; a preacher was seen appeatlBg and disappearing between them , as hi* violent gesticulation caused him to Isan backwards of foraafda . The tracks had now things to their mind , and they pressed round the speaker , on their feel or their knees , with extended hands , open has , and ghsleningeyes : while the strong lights of a tripod , close to which they had assembled , fell across the scene , and gave it great interest and - the scenes on either aide the stand were not dumb tit/rr , the evil was , that the voices of the parties speaking met each other , and made confusion ; and as either party raised his voice , to remedy the evil , it Became worse . To placed at the cenWe of observation , this had a neutjaiizing , and sometimes ahutnorous effects but to the two congregations , which were now reduced in numbers , it produced no disttaction : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their particular feelings . It was now considerably past eleven oWook ; 1 thought I had seen all the forms which the subject was likely to take ; and T doleniliiied to answer the ruest of my friends , and retire . I had been assured that a bed was reserved for me at the preachers ' tent , and I now went in searchof it . The tent is constructed like the rest , and is about eighteen fept by fourteen . As the ministers are expected to take their meals at the other tent ? , this is prepared as a lodging-room . An inclined ah ? Ii about six feet wide and four high , runs alonj ; the of it , and it is sup- VoL . I. - I 17 /z/ plied with six beds . I chose the one in the &rther; corner , in the hope of escaping interruption ; as the bed next to me was already occupied by a person asleep . I relieved myself of my upper garments , and laid myself down in my weariness to rest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming to seek accommodation . One of them crept up by the side of tiie person next to me ; and as the bed would only suit one , he really lay on the margin of his and mine . Thus dis , composed , my resolution was immediately taken not to . sleep at all . There was , however , no need of this proud resolution , for that night there was to be no sleep for me . There were still other parties to come , and beds to be provided . After this there was the singing renewed , and still renewed , till youth and enthusiasm were faint and weary , and then it died away . Still there remained the barking of the watch-dogs , the sawing of the kat-e-dids and locusts , and the snoring of my more favoured companions , and these were incessant . Sometimes I found diversion in listening to them , as they mingled in the ear , and in deciding which was most musical , most melancholy ; and frequently I turned away in weariness , and fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for the first approach of day ; and , in my impatience , as often mistaking for it the gleaming lights ofthe pine fires . When the sun actually rose , the horn blew for prayers . To me , all restless as I had been , it was a joyHd somuL I waited till others had dressed , that I might do so with greater quiet . I stole away into the forest , and wu much refreshed by the morning breeze and fresh air . It was a very pletsing and unexpected sight to observe , as you wandered in supposed sohtariness , here and there an individual half concealed , with raised countenance and hands worshipping the God of heaven , and occasionally two or three assembled for the same purpose , and agreeing to ask the same blessings from the same Father . This was , indeed , to people the forest with sacred things and associations . On my return , the ministers renewed their kind appli* /q/ cation to me to preach on the morning of this day . I begged to le excused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken cold , and was not prepared to commit myself to the peculiarities of their service , and which they might deem essential . They met again : and unanimously agreed to press it on me ; * ' it should be the ordinary service , and nothing more ; and as an expectation had been created by my presence , many would come , under its influence , and it would place any other minister at great disadvantage/ ' My heart was with this people anid the leading pastors , and I consented to preach . The usual prayer-meeting was held at eight o'clock . It was conducted by Mr. Jeter . Prayers were offered for several classes , and with good effect . To me it was a happy introduction to the more public service to come . I wandered away again into my beloved forest , to preserve my impressions , and to collect my thoughts . At eleven o'clock the service began . I took my place on the stand ; it was quite full . The seats , and all the avenues to them , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of being within hoaxing , were contented to stand . It was evident that rumour had gone abroad , and that an expectation had been created , that a stranger would preach this morning , for there was a great influx of people , and of the most respectable class which this country furnishes . There were not less than 1,500 persons assembled . Mr. Taylor offered fervent and suitable prayer . It remained for me to preach . I can only say that I did so with earnestness and freedom . I aoon felt that I had the attention and confidence of the conegation , and this gave me confidence . I took care , in passing , as my subject allowed , to withdraw my sanction from any thing noisy and exclamatory ; and there was , through the discourse , nothing of the kind ; but there was a growing attention and stillness over the people . The closing statements and appeals were evidently falling on the conscience and heart , with still advancing power . The people generally leaned- forward , to catch what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Id /z/ atiireclwiih giiuiunk down , a.s if to hidQ Ihcmselres ftom obaeivQlion ; tut all was perfectly still . Silently tlte teai fell ; and silently the sinner shuddered . ceased . Nobody moved . J looked louud to the QiiaisJei9 lot some one to give out a hymn . No one looked . at me - no one moved . Every moment , the silence , the stillness , became rooie solemn and oierpuwering . Now , bere and there , might be heard Buppiessed sobbiag arising on the silence . Jtut it coul be Buppifissed oo longer - the fountftins of leJ wet &; burst open , and one universal wail spiung from tTie people apl ministers , while the whole mags sunk down on then knees , as if imploring Bume one to piay . I stuutj resting on the desk , overwhelmed like the people . . The presiding pastor arose , and . thrDwidj ; his axras round pij nedt , exclaimed , " Pray , brother , ptay ! I feai mviy. of ny charge will be found at t ! ie left-hand- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray for U3 1 " ' and dicn he cast buuself on the floor witb'hts brethren , to join in ike prayer , ut I could not prky ! I iiuist been moVe.er less tlian nun ta , Jve uttered prayer at that momerrt ! , JIoj was it ncceSiSHryi- . All , in that hour , were intercessors with God , witli and fries , and groans unierable . So soon as I could comaiand hjy slata of feeling , 1 tried to ofTer prayer . Ny . broken vqiac rose gradiMlly on Ilia troubled crius of tile paoplts and gradually they subsided , so liiat they could hea-ftid concur in the commojl suppUcalions . It . and the people rose . We seojn a changed people to each otlier . No one appeared disposed to luove &om-the; spot , and yet no one Memed disposed for otdinaty exercises . Elder Taylor moved forward . and remarked - " That it was evident nothing but prayer suited them at this time . And as sa manybad been impressed by the truth , wko had not befoiei he wished , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of prayer . " liq therefore proposed that.if such persona wished to acknowledge the impression received , at ' a prayer for their personal sal vabon , they should show It y kneeling down , and he would pray AiiJi thbm . Camp-meetihg. 197 In an insfant , us if instinct with one spirit , the whoe oongregation sunk itnffn - ta the gcimnd . It in much , but not too much , to say , Attt the pixjet met the oocBBjnn . Whan the people again roaa , one of tfae biethren was about to address them ; but I thought noibtog could be BO salutary to theili bs their own Tedeclion* and prayera , and I ventured to rftquost that he would dismiss the meeting . Thus closed the most icmarkable service I have ever Ti'itnesse4- It has been my privilege to see more of the solemn and ' powerful effect of divilie truth on largo bodies of people than many ; but I never saw any thing equal to this ; so deep , so oveTpowermr , lo univenal . And this extraordinary effect was produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other were used , and one third of the people had been present at none other . I shall never forget that lime - that place ; and as often as I recur to it , the tear is still ready to start from its retirement . The immediate effect was as good as it was conspicuous . Al'first thefe was such tenderness on the people that they looked , silently on each other , and could hardly do it without weeping ; and afterward , when they had obtained more self-possession , there was such meekness , such gentleness , such humility , suc kiiilneSB , such a desire to serre one another by love , and such calm and holy joy silting on the ! r countenances , as I had nevec seen in one place , and by so many persons . It realized ) more than any thing I had known , the historical description of the primitive saints ; and there was much in the present circumstances which assisted the impression . It was indeed beautifully true - " that fear came on every soul f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things common ; and they continued with one accord , breaking bread from house to house ; and did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart , praising God t " Besides this happy effect on those who had already beLeved , there were many in an awakened and inquiring mA 17* /z/ Btate which demanded attention . Among them was a rep resentative of the State Government , who acknowledged that he had always resisted the truth till then , but hoped it had overcome him at last . Some of these cases , of coarse , came under my own knowledge ; and all the ministers showed them , as , indeed , they had uniformly done , great attiantion and solicitude . Among other expressions of kind and gentle feeling to myself , it was deemed impossible to let me remain another night in the tents , since I had not been able to procure rest . Many were eager that I should be received at their dwelling ; but in the end I engaged to go with Beacon Norris , as it was at no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety and warm heart of this aged and venerable man had previously won my confidence . I had agreed to go after the evening service ; but my considerate friend endeavoured to persuade me to go before , by representing that I must need rest , and that it would not be so safe to track their way through the dsirk woods after sundown . I felt that it would be less suitable to his age to be exposed so late and in the dark , and so consented to do as he should suggest . So , after taking repast , and joining in prayer with a cluster of our friends beneath a leafy alcove at the back of one of the tents , we started for Deacon Norris 's residence . His tad drove me in a chaise , while he rode beside with a parentis care , to see that all was done well . He exchanged pleasant words with me as occasion allowed , and ever and anon was giving his cautions to the driver : - " Now , boy , mind those stumps - take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - and the whole was done in evident and unaffected reference to me . When we alighted , he received me to his house with that simphcity and kindness which are the essence of all true politeness . He took my hand , and with a beaming face and tearful eye , he said , Now , sir , this is your home while you stay , and the longer you stay the more I shall be honoured . A plain place , but aU of it , servants . /q/ house , garden , is yours . Only make me happy by letting me know what you want . " I had small reply to offer . All this was said in the deep and wild forest , and the manner and expression would not have dishonoured St , James 's ; it affected me with tenderness and surprise . While this occurred , we were standing on the verdant sod which surrounded the cottage , and was not worn off even by the passage to the door . The day had been hot , and we had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze . My friend 's cottage was a frame-building , whitened , well suited to the occupant , and to the spot where it stood . It had neither bolt nor lock to any one of its doors that I could find . About 100 yards on the descent stood a hut , in which his slaves were accommodated , and the interval was covered with short grass , kept cool and verdant by the fine separated trees which overshadowed most of it . On the other side of the cottage was a garden abounding in fruits for the little family . The ground fell off very pleasantly from the spot where you stood , so as to give you the command of the scene , and to compose a beautiful prospect . Most of the land in one direetion was the domain of my friend ; the portion near you being adorned with Indian com , and ' the distant parts clothed with the dark and solemn pine . When I had explored the garden and fields , my friend arranged a little table and stools at the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect , for our accommodation . Here we were supplied with plates , and a fine melon from the garden for our repast ; and it was not till the last hngering lights of a glowing day had faded away behind the pine barrens that we ceased ' to commune with Nature and with each other . In this communion my friend was the chief contributor . He spoke in the fulness of his heart ; and the impression will , I trust , long remain with me . He told me of his early days , of his conversion , and of the many years he had been as a pilgrim and a stranger on the earth . He had been married twice ; he lost his last wife seven years since ; and his children were settled far from him i /z/ " Many eipected , " he said , " as I was living alone , that I Bhoidd mirry again . But no , sir ; at my lime of life I Uiink it not good . The husband carelh for the things of the wife ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord . My great concern is , that I may do the will of the Lord , and look to my latter end with peace and pleasure . I would desire to die and to ba with Christ 33 far better ; but if he should say , Here , I have a little more for you to do on earth , then I would willingly stay and do it . " Then , " he continued , after musing , " I am old , but I , satTer nothing , and I have many comforts , audi thank God ' 1 can enjoy them . But , " with a Beiene imile , " I am looking for something better ; - earth Will not do - this is not heaven ! 1 am far from God hers ; and I have sin ajways with me here to distress and expose me ; but when He shall appear , I shall be like him , for t shall see him as he is ! " So he continued , and so was I privileged and lefteahed . Wa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated st as his children , were called in , and we had family - worship . I pressed him to engage as usual ; and was richly repaid . It was prayer winged with love and thankfulness , and rising to heaven . It brought us closer to each other . After our devotions , rest was thought of ; for these children of Nature retire and rise with the day . He had provided for my accommodation in his own room ; and when every thing had been done as he directed , he went to see with his own eyes that all waa right . He attended me to it , and again inquired , and looked about to know if mora could be done for my comfort . He had not been long out , when he craved permission to come in again . He hid an siRFectionate manner , and said , " Well , now there is still one thing which I was charged to say to jou , and which I must say to you before I can sleep . " - " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I have been now in the way forty-seven years - I have seen many poweiJiil meetings in my time - but never toy m. /z/ tiling like this morning - all , ministers and all - weeping like children - and - now do n't aay no - and we all want yofl to preach again to-morrow .

" He drew ' * neajer to tOA and oliecking me as he would his son , tie said , " WeSi iiow , my child , do n't say you will not - and we 'll trust to have you well and willing by to-morrow morning . Is there any thing more I can do for you V and then lis retired and drew to the door . This was not the last visit that evemng from my devoted friehd . When ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he drew together a window which was slightly open , and which he thought better shut , he ' crept to my side , and thought me asleep ; and with the ; afiectionate attentions of a woman , lucked me in , and whispered the words , " Bless him ! " as he left me . At least , he wa6 blessed that night in the generous and holy sentiments which possessed him . 1 slept peacefully and soundly that night , till I was r wakened by the foot-tread of the slave who waited on me . We took breakfast early , and worshipped together , and then went to the camp-ground . Here the subject of preaching was renewed , as it had been by my kind host on our way . But as Dr. Rice had just arrived , and was expectgd to preach , I was strengthened in my resolution to remam silent . I attended the service , but did not again opcupy the stand . 1 felt as if I could not look as that people for the last time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some confidential conversations with Mr. Jeter . As the hoor of my departure pressed , I took hasty refreshments ; and begged to meet with the brethren in a final act of prayer . We all knt - joined in one prayer - in one spirit - a prayer often too big for utterance , but always apprehended by syinpatljy . It is not for description . The carriage waited for ua . I entered it . Still wa jfiav/ not how to go on ; and ihe friends clustered rotmd /z/ My /z/ it as though they would ptevent it . There were many spectators whom I did not know , but who were all interested . There were the brethren with- whom I had had sweet fellowship . And there , nearest of all , was niy freind , Deacon Norris , true to the last . His first office was , to deposite two fine melons in the carriage ; and his next , to discharge the painfiil one of saying " Farewell . ' * . He took my hand in both his ; looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word - while the big * " ' ' tear started in his ey , and coursed down his furrowed cheeks . And so we left him - and so we left them - still gazing on us to the end . For myself , I left the plce as a place whore God had been ; and the people , as a people which God had blessed ! LETTER XVin . Mt dear IPriend , The interest which , I doubt not , you have felt in the previous account of the meeting , will dispose you to inquire kow it terminated . I am happy to be able , by a subsequent communication , to satisfy your wfthes . Mjc esteemed fnend , Mr. Jeter , assures m that th iriopaness and tenderness of the people remained to the last ; and disclosed themselves in very affecting forms pn parting . He thus writes : - " Oi Thursday morning our meeting closed . Eternity alqpe can disclose the resulta . We have ascertained that between sity and seventy professed conversion . With man of these I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be furnished to regard them as sincere lovers of our Saviour Jesus Christ . The influence of the meeting on the community is regarded as of the most delightful and elevated kind . Infidelity has been compelled to shut her mouth ; and vile blasphemers to . acknowledge the hand of God ! " RSMAIUiSc 20d Thus , then , I was supplied , at once , with a specimen of the three great religious peculiarities of this country ; a camp-meeting , a protracted meeting , and a revival ; for they were all included in this meeting . Of what it has in fiQmon with other special meetings J shall speak elsewhere ; but of what was peculiar to it , it may 8ita61e to offer a few remarks . From all I haie earned of camptmeetings , I may pronounce this to have been vcpry welL conducted . The ex* istingalrangenMlits were such as to contribute to this . The land on which it was held was purchased as a permanent station ; and the lands around were held by peraom friendly object j so'thftt they could control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tenti remained from dpeon to season , and cost the own ' about ten dollarp each ; and if it happened that the possessor could not attend , he lent his . tent to a friend* The pooler or lev interestoa persons came in carriges or tilted light wagons , which they used as beds . Sep* arate committees were appointed to preserve order ; tot superintend the lights and fires ; to regulate the use of the water-springs ; and to arrange for thtfeligious servi- ces . For the last purpose , the ministers present were the standing committee . By these means , and means such as these , strict order was kept on the premises ; and the temptation for the disofderly was cut off . I saw nothing Uofi wh%l time of indecent and lewd behaviour , though many persons came evidently more from curiosity than from higher jnotives . With the single exception I have nabitfd , I saw not an intempQte person ; nor did I see eithlHF wine or spirits oq the ground . ' There was a man about half a*mile fUstant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrels of distilled liquor ; but it must have been a bad speculsttion , for I never observed a single person near Mm . Spirit , ual intemperance , too , whiclf is often a far greater evil on theseoccasions , wa kept down by the good sense and right feeling ctjb# leading ministers .. On the mer- ' its of the particular pnethods I do not mfw speak : but , /z/ if their were to be adopted , I know not that they could have been used with more moderation or better effect . That the anxious seat was too often tried ; that there was a disposition sometimes to press it as a test ; that the act of passing among the people for the purpose of personal persuasion had better have been avoided ; and that the ministers had done well if they had limited the servides and especially the continued singing , by which many young persons were doing themselves a double mischief ; - are opinions which I shall appear ta have adopted in the preceding statement , and opinions which ought to be expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , I never expect to- laset with three men who in such circumstances are inqtet wisely disposed to pursue the good , and to avoid the Incidentsil ' evil , than " were those on whom rested , the chief responsibility of the meeting . None of their appeals were to blind or selfish passion . They assailed the heart , indeed ; but it was always through the understanding . They relied not on manoeuvre nor on sympathy for success ; they trusted in the light of Truth , clothed by the power of the Spirit , to set the people free , that they might be free indeed ! ' It is a question often propounded in America , as well as here , - Of what use are camp-meetings ? This is one of- those questions which must te answered in submis* sion to circumstances . There may be a state of things in which I should consider them as not only among the things useful , but the things necessary . ' In the newlysettled parts , where the inhabitants are so few , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worship and instruction can for a time hardly be enjoyed ; . and , in this interval , the camp-meeting seems an excellent device for the gathering of the people . Under such circumstances , the very fact of their being brought together , though it were not for religious purposes , would be a decided benefit ; and if it ; ihould be connected with some expressions of extravagance which we could not approve , it is nevertheless not to be hastily condemned . /z/ /q/ We can not conceive the effect of being immured in the deep and solemn forest , month after month , with little or no intercour with our brethren , nor of the powerful movement of those social sympathies which have been long pent up in the breast , and denied exercise . But we can understand , that it is better that they should be called into exercise occasionally , though violently , than that they should be allowed to pine away and die out ; since , in the one can man would become a barbarous , gloomy ) and selfish misanthrope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept among social beings , and would be in readiim &r; better things . Mlki4i'vjb9 than this is done where the sympathies are 4 4 ' weddetexeUgious objects ; and the good effects bear even mptt on the future than the present . Where the camp-mefting is rea ! Uy wanted and redlly useful , it in* terests a careless people in their own moral and religious Wants ; and is the natural and general forerunner , as the population thickens , of the school-house , the churchy and all the appliances of civil life . You will now , perhaps , be prepared to quit the forest , and attend me on my journey . A missionary student , who was about to go to the Burmese empire , and my original friend , Mr. Jesse , whose kind offices had been unremitted , attended me to the boat : the former with the design of going on to Baltimore . We were just in time , and parted in haste . I was to remain in this conveyance through the night , and most of the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good accommoda* tibns , we were exposed to no inconvenience . The river how expanded into grandeur , and the lovely scenes formed by the fine creeks opening into land are still ent with me , though I must not detain you on their account . Waking or sleeping however , the scenes which chiefly possessed me were those which I had lately witnessed . The next day we eqlipred the Bay ; and still new beauties were before us It . is among the finest waters of this country . The weather- was very favourable ; but is /z/ the temperature continued high . It ranged , as it had done for the last week , from 86 to As we passed onwardf we took in several pasfiengers who were making their way to the city ; and they supplied some varieties of character and manner . As I sat writing at a small table , part of a melon stood before me , of which I had been partaking. en I laid the knife down , a young man , of genteel but assuming appeanmce , came up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any movement towards me , he had been welcome ; as it was , I remarked , that the melon was not for public use ; and he laid the knife down and walked way . Another person , of rougher aspect , had some suspicions that I had been at the camp-ground ; and he puzzled himself to know how he copld best ascertain this . He came nearer and nearer to me by degrees , till his confidence brought him to the table . , There were two or three small books lying oait . He . took up one . It was a hymn-book given me at the meeting , and the minister who gave it had written in it both his name find mine . This he thought a famous clew ; and he began his insnaring guesses . " This is yours V he said . " Yes , " was the answer . " A present , I guess ? " - " It has that appearance , " I said . " Then you know Mr. , and have been to the ground V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudely , did he contrive to get little chat about the camp-meeting , which , in this region , constituted the principal news of the day . He ' was , notwithstanding , a well-meaning and religious man .
