txt NONE of the elegant republications of the day have given us greater pleasure than this ; the rather , as it is not a monument to the memory of its eminent author , but has been undertaken by himself , at the beginning of his old age , as a suitable close of his long literary life . " At the age of sixtythree , " he says , " I have undertaken to collect and revise my poetical works . " Of those sixty-three years , he has passed forty-four in the public presence , as an active and voluminous author . His literary life thus covers more than a complete generation of men , and has witnessed the beginning and the ending of more than one of those distinguished lives , which have made the nineteenth century famous . IDuring this period , Byron and Mrs. Hemans , to name no more , achieved their whole work of immortality , and even Walter Scott ran his entire race , having made his first publication some years after Southey 's reputation was established . // So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens , while stars and meteors have risen and fallen around him . The older and the younger are gone , and he still lives , with a smooth brow and untremulous hand , not an old man though an old author , to set his works in order by a leisurely revision , and bring his poetical existence to a dignified conclusion . It is a sj ) ectacle of peculiar interest . Excepting Scott , Southey has been the most prolific of the distinguished writers of his time , and , perhaps without exception , the author who has written successfully on the greatest diversity of subjects , from the most trivial to the most important , from the lightest to the most grave . Equally at home in literature , theology , and politics ; an historian , biographer , critic , poet , essayist , and polemic ; allowed on all hands to be one of the few masters of English prose , and second to few of the great names of modern English poetry ; often offending in matters of taste , but never untrue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a theologian , in both which characters he had forsaken the opinions and connexions of his youth , but liberal as a man , notwithstanding his violence as a partisan ; always before the public eye as an author , but living in beautiful retirement from the world , in his own domestic and scholarly retreat ; he is a man whom , in some features of his character , we could wish other than he is , but whose intrinsic worth commands respect . We can not refuse to see that he is unequal , inconsistent , often puerile , sometimes absurd ; but he is always conscientious , never forgetful of moral obligation , and occasionally great . If it were inquired who , among the distinguished men of modern letters , has written the silliest things , we should ansxver , with little hesitation , Southey ; if asked , who among them has written the greatest , it would not be without a pause and a struggle , that we should prevail on ourselves to dismiss his claim . We are confident , that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due . In the crowd of admirable works , which , during his career , have jostled each other in their claims for regard , the reading public have allowed their impatience at the littlenesses and the vexatious violations of good taste , which annoyed them in the self-complacent volumes of the bard of Keswick , to divert their attention from his sterling merits . Yet he has not wanted readers and admirers . // Some of his writings have been extensively popular ; and we are confident , that this complete collection of his poetical works will find a hearty welcome , and will increase the number of his readers . We should have been better satisfied with an edition of his poems , from which were excluded all the questionable trivialities of his earlier as well as his later days . But he republishes the whole , insisting , in one of his prefaces , that there is not a line which dying he should be ashamed of , and wish to blot ; and , in another , acknowledging that some of the pieces might more fitly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for any disgrace which could be reflected upon him by the crude compositions of his youth , nor for any harm which they could possibly do the reader ; but , merely , that they might not cumber the collection . " He retains them in this edition , simply because , having been once published , " pirated editions would hold out as a recommendation , that they contained what he had chosen to suppress , " and it was prudent to forestall that evil by reprinting them himself . Agreeing with him , that the poems to which he refers had better been " consigned to the flames , " we think , too , that he has done right in not excluding them from the present collection ; but we are not so easily satisfied with his course in regard to the correction of his earlier works . His method is , to arrange the pieces , as far as possible , in the order in which they were written , for the reason , that " such order is useful to those who read critically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind in his writings ; " yet he adopts a rule in the revision of his juvenile works , which contradicts this purpose . " From these , " he says , " the faults of diction have been weeded , wherever it could be done without more trouble than the composition originally cost , and than the piece itself was worth . " And , as regards one of them , " Joan of Arc , " he tells us , that it has now been corrected throughout , " for the purpose of making it more consistent with itself in diction , and less inconsistent in other things with the wellweighed opinions of my maturer years . The faults of effort , which may generally be regarded as hopeful indications in a juvenile writer , have been mostly left as they were . The faults // of language , which remained from the first edition , have been removed , so that in this respect the whole is sufficiently in keeping . And for those which expressed the political prejudices of a young man , who had too little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been expunged , or altered , or such substitutions have been made for them as harmonize with the pervading spirit of the poem , and are nevertheless in accord with those opinions which the author has maintained for thirty years , through good and evil report , in the maturity of his judgment as well as in the sincerity of his heart . " We certainly do not perceive how such thorough correction as this , extending both to " diction and opinions , " can leave the work in a condition " to aid those who read critically , and desire to trace the progress of the author 's mind . " We have not been at the pains to collate the present with the earlier editions , and therefore can not say , how far changes have been made ; * but it is clear , that the author has deliberately adopted a course , which deprives the chronological arrangement of his works of a large portion of its usefulness . How are we to judge of " the progress of an author 's mind , " if his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to conform to the opinions which he then holds ? It is not , however , to all his juvenile pieces that this correcting process has been applied . The most celebrated , perhaps we should say notorious , of them , " Wat Tyler , " composed at the age of nineteen , when his blood was hot with republican principles , and , after he had renounced them , freely used as a weapon of annoyance by his political adversaries , is here reprinted , partly in the spirit of bravado , just as it was written . The publication of this " notable drama " was at first made surreptitiously , twenty years after it was written . It obtained a far greater notoriety , through incidental circumstances , than its intrinsic merit or demerit could warrant ; and posterity will wonder at the extreme acrimony exhibited in the writings of the parties , who waged a warfare of petty personal annoyance and spite , on account of so ordinary a performance . The secret is found in the fact , that * They may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have just now accidentally noticed , of this line ; " La Fayette , name that Freedom still shall love . " // the deadliest enmity is that of a party , which seeks to revenge apostasy ; as Southey says , " gentlemen thought proper to revile me , not for having entertained democratic opinions , hut for having outgrown them . " And he faces down the shame which they attempt to fix upon him , by printing the obnoxious thing , " just as it was written in the course of three mornings , in 1794 ; the stolen copy , which was committed to the press twenty-three years afterwards , not having undergone the slightest correction of any kind ; " and this be does , " that it may not be supposed I think it any reproach to have written it , or that I am more ashamed of having been a republican , than of having been a boy . " This is capitally said ; but the tetchiness and virulence of his political feelings give sometimes an apparent contradiction to this cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious with " Wat Tyler , " though in a different way , makes its appearance under very different treatment , and in a manner somewhat instructive as to one side of our author 's character . Everybody has read " The Devil 's Walk , " which has been printed and reprinted , times without number , as Professor Porson 's . The pith and piquancy of some of the stanzas are sufficient to account for its popularity . It seems , however , that there was blunder or mystification in the affair . Coleridge printed the verses among his works , under the title of " The Devil 's Thoughts ; " * assigning five of the stanzas to Southey , and claiming for himself the remaining twelve . But the authorship was still obstinately attributed to Porson , until declared to be Southey 's , in a newspaper correspondence , which is quoted in these volumes and adopted as the truth . The lines , it is said , " were written by Mr. Southey one morning before breakfast , the idea having struck him while shaving ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe , pointed some of the stanzas , and perhaps added one or two . " This account is clearly irreconcilable with that of Coleridge , and leaves us entirely puzzled as to what is the fact . Is it possible , that both of these great men deceived themselves , and misremembered ? At any rate , here it appears with our author 's mark on it ; but in such a questionable shape , that we are disposed to address it in the words // used of old to one of the Devil 's companions , " If thou beest he ! but oh , how changed ! " For the worthy author , tickled with the popularity of the piece , and apparently supposing that there can not be too much of a good thing , has extended it to about four times its original length . The added stanzas are so little germain to the rest , that they ruin the quaint felicity of the primitive piece , and turn a pleasant jeu d'esprit , which made everybody laugh , into heavy and tiresome doggrel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in " sportive mood " ; but one rarely xvitnesses such melancholy merrymaking . And besides , the original portions of the piece are not left in their original state . Whoever the author may have been , of the whole or of any part , Southey uses the freedom of altering any part at his pleasure . A large proportion of the stanzas are somewhat altered , some of them essentially , and all , we think , without exception , are made worse . The spirit is taken out of them , and the point blunted . Let this be judged of by the two following instances . " He saw a lawyer killing a viper , On a duaghill hard by his own stable ; And the Devil smiled , for it put him in mind Of Cain and his brother Abel . " Altered thus " Ho , quoth he , thou putt'st me in mind Of the story of Cain and Abel . The sting in the word brother is extracted . Again ; He saw a cottage with a double coach-house , A cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling sin Is pride that apes humility . " Altered thus " And he owned with a grin that his favorite sin Is pride that apes humility . " And so on , and much worse . Three stanzas are omitted ; one poor one of Southey 's own , and two of Coleridge 's which were worth keeping . Perhaps this matter hardly deserves the room we have given to it . But we do not like explanations which // 357 clear up nothing ; and we think there is nothing in these volumes which casts so strong a light on a certain infirmity of the author 's nature , - namely , an inability to discern the difference between good and poor humor , so that he confounds the laughable and the ridiculous , and an equal inability to perceive that any thing can be ridiculous , which concerns himself or is done by him . This explains the character of that large portion of his minor poems , which are intended to be humorous . Many of them are undoubtedly of that character ; their humor is rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overflowing good nature of a happy and self-complacent temper . But it unluckily happened , that Mr. Edgeworth once said to him , " Take my word for it , Sir , the bent of your genius is for comedy . " We would not attribute too much to the influence of such a remark ; but Mr. Southey himself quotes it , as having made an impression on his mind , and we can not doubt that it was one of the influences which prompted him to try to be facetious , and to manufacture , in cold blood , tales and descriptions , and forms of expression , which should sustain his character , as having a genius for comedy . The strained and awkward doings of his pen , in these attempts , are of so unhappy effect on his readers , that they are likely to forget the passages of natural , easy , quiet fun , which else would have been delightful . Some of his specimens of the heroi-cornic are quite equal to any of that class that are to be met with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his works with auto-biographical prefaces , has been pleasantly followed in the present case . Each volume has its preface , narrating the circumstances under which its contents were written ; and some of the more important pieces have their own separate notices prefixed . Much interesting information respecting the author , and his works , and his friends , is thus furnished , from which it is easy to gather a connected history of his life and labors . It is that of a man , " dipped in ink " from his very earliest boyhood . The love of story and of verse seems to have been a sort of instinct with him , and to have filled his soul with visions of romance and fame . bole 's translations of Tasso and Ariosto nourished in the boy a taste for the stirring and the marvellous , // and introduced him , at a very early period , to Spenser , whom he tells us he " took for his master . " As he lisped in numbers , he caught something , as he thinks , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His schoolboy verses " savoured of Gray , Mason , and Warton " ; his manner was affected by Akenside ; he derived much benefit from Cowper , and more from Bowles ; and from Dr. Sayers he learned to appreciate the rhythmical capacities of the irregular blank verse , which he used afterward in " Thalaba " and some of his minor poems . Thus imbued and heated with the poetic temper , it is not strange , that he longed to give it vent by the press as well as by the pen ; and accordingly , in 1794 , when he was only nineteen , and had just left school , he published at Bristol a little volume with the title , " Poems , containing the Retrospect , &amp;c. by Robert Lovell and Robert Southey . " These were a few of the productions of his juvenile pen , the larger part of which he at different times consumed in the fire , " piles upon piles . " His industrious habits , and his extraordinary facility in composition , must have caused them to grow as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a retirement of six weeks , the preceding year , an epic poem on the story of Joan of Arc it had been corrected and copied , and was now advertised as ready for publication . We find nothing in the prefaces on which he dwells with so much fondness as this poem . He relates the whole story of its composition and printing with most affectionate minuteness , and treats it , in all respects , as a doting father his first-born child . He is so solicitous for its honor and reputation , that now , when it has been fortyfour years in the world , he employs himself in revising and altering it , as if still his own character depended on its good appearance . Some may smile at this ; but it is natural and amiable . It was a great achievement for an Oxford scholar , in a summer vacation ; be never afterward did any thing of which it was possible to feel so proud , or which was to have so important a bearing on his destiny . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , or at least used to be , as ambitious of producing an epic poem , as stage-stricken youths of figuring in Romeo or Hamlet . It had been the earliest of my day-dreams . I had begun many such ; but this was the first which had been completed , // and I was too young and too ardent to perceive or suspect that the execution was as crude as the design . " - Vol. i. p. xvii . The poem thus " crudely conceived , rashly prefaced , and prematurely hurried into the world , " was received with great favor , and subsequently passed through five editions . Much of its popularity was owing to its political tone , which favored the liberal tendencies of the day , and caused it to be immediately reprinted in this country . It was not without merit in itself ; and , in comparison with the other new works of the same period , it had an attraction incomparably beyond any it could possess if published at this time , " when a work of the same class would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arc " went to press , the author had begun to discharge himself of another epic poem , on the discovery of America , by the Welsh prince , Madoc ; a subject which he had fixed upon , and talked about , when a boy . The composition of this he renewed at Westbury , in 1798 . This year he speaks of , as one of the happiest portions of his life . He was full of invention and activity . The smaller poems , as he wrote them , were sent off to Charles Lamb , and the portions of " Madoc , " as they were composed , were read to Davy , with whom Southey was then in habits of intimate intercourse . " We were within an easy walk of each other , over some of the most beautiful ground in that beautiful part of England . When I went to the Pneumatic Institution , he had to tell me of some new experiment or discovery , and of the views which it opened for him ; and when he came to Westbury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bearing . Davy encouraged me with his hearty approbation during its progress ; and the bag of nitrous oxide , with which he generally regaled me upon my visits to him , was not required for raising my spirits to the degree of settled fair , and keeping them at that elevation . " Vol. iv . p. x . " Madoc " was finished on the 12th of July , 1799 , and the next day " Thalaba " was begun . The subject for this poem had been in the author 's mind for four years , and the materials for it bad been gathering during that time . The writing was interrupted by ill health , and he went to the south of Europe for its recovery the next spring . " Change of circumstances and of climate effected an immediate cure of what proved to be not an organic disease . A // week after our landing at Lisbon , I resumed my favorite work , and I completed it at Cintra , a year and six days after the day of its commencement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was published before the author 's return , the press being corrected by his friends , Davy and Danvers . It was less favorably received than " Joan of Arc " had been , though an immeasurably finer work . It was so wholly strange and original in its plan and style , that the critics and the readers were at fault ; they had no rules or precedents to judge by , and found it much easier to laugh at what was puerile and seemed affected , than to enter into the spirit of the author 's design and boldly allow the excellence of his novelties . His name was now coupled with that of Wordsworth , by those who looked only at the superficial resemblances to be found in the extreme simplicity of diction which each affected , and who did not care to observe their essential differences . But it is not always by essential differences that a classification is made ; and Mr. Southey should not complain or wonder , that a set of writers , all of them departing from the settled models , and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be , for convenience or for wit 's sake , put together under a common name . As to the justice with which , having been so classed , they were described and treated , that is another affair ; and it certainly required no little forbearance in them to stand by for twenty years , " while every tyro in criticism who could smatter and sneer , tried his prentice hand ' upon the Lake Poets ; and every young sportsman who carried a popgun in the field of satire , considered them as fair game . " " Thalaba " being published , the author returned to the revision of " Madoc , " which he pursued with great care and deliberation , " thinking that it probably would be the greatest poem he should ever produce . " With this view he travelled through Wales in the autumn of 1801 , in order to perfect himself in the localities and scenery of that picturesque country . In 1803 , he took up his abode at Keswick , where he has ever since resided . There , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work was resumed , " and twelve months were diligently employed in reconstructing it . " The work , thus studiously prepared , was printed in 1805 ; was immediately reprinted in two elegant octavo volumes in // 361 America ; * was pronounced , by some of the critics , the greatest poem since " Paradise Lost , " and enjoyed a deserved reputation in spite of some ill-natured criticisms . While these larger works were in progress , the author had been amusing himself , by way of recreation in his more leisure hours , with the composition of a great variety of minor poems . Of these , three volumes were published , one in each of the years 1797 , 1799 , and 1805 . Some of them were works of considerable pretension ; some , very slight and insignificant ; a few had the good fortune to be popular , and to become extensively known . Southey himself wished them to be considered " as the desultory productions of a man , sedulously employed upon better things . " These aie reprinted , we presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the contents of another little volume , published in 1815 , and his various compositions as Poet Laureate . As he has advanced in life , he has written less and less of occasional and fugitive poetry , being absorbed in works of greater extent and of a different character . Indeed , he tells us , that the poetical impulse has ceased , and that " latterly the inclination has been so seldom felt , that it required an effort to call it forth . " " Madoc " being thus disposed of in 1805 , he the next year resumed and finished another large poem , " The Curse of Kehama , " which had been begun in 1801 . Concerning this , he says , No poem could have been more deliberately planned , or more carefully composed . It was commenced at Lisbon , on the 1st of May , 1801 , and recommenced in the summer of the same year , at Kingstown , in which Madoc ' had been finished and Thalaba ' begun . A little was added , during the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Kingstown , in the summer of 1802 , and then laid aside till 1806 , during which interval Madoc ' was reconstructed and published . Resuming it then once more , all that had been written was recast at Keswick ; there I proceeded with it leisurely , and finished it on the 25th of November , 1809 . It is the only one of my long poems of which detached parts were written to be afterwards inserted in their proper places . " We presume , that this disclosure of laborious diligence and // 362 April , painful revision will surprise many readers , who have been unable to account for the frequency and multitude of our author 's large works , except on the supposition of hasty and even precipitate publication . It seems , however , that he was accustomed to exercise a scrupulous fidelity in this respect and that , wherever he may have failed , it has been with thoughtful deliberation and mature reflection . A proper criticism of his works would suggest the same conclusion . There is another interesting fact , disclosed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of series , each being one part of a plan , which is completed by the union of the whole . " While a schoolboy at Westminster , I had formed an intention of exhibiting the most remarkable forms of Mythology , which have at any time obtained among mankind , by making each the groundwork of a narrative poem . " The plan upon which I proceeded in Madoc , ' was to produce the effect of machinery , as far as was consistent with the character of the poem , by representing the most remarkable religion of the New World such as it was , a system of atrocious priestcraft . It was not here , as in Thalaba , ' the foundation of the poem , but , as usual in what are called epic poems , only incidentally connected with it . " When I took up , for my next subject , that mythology which Sir William Jones had been the first to introduce into English poetry , I soon perceived that the best way of treating it would be to construct a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to be determined . No such question had arisen concerning any of my former poems . I should never , for a moment , have thought of any other measure than blank verse for ' Joan of Arc , ' and for Madoc , ' and afterwards for Roderick . ' The reason why the irregular rhymeless lyrics of Dr. Sayers were preferred for Thalaba was , that the freedom and variety of such verse were suited to the story . " It appeared to me , that here neither the tone of morals , nor the strain of poetry , could be pitched too high ; that nothing but moral sublimity could compensate for the extravagance of the fictions , and that all the skill I might possess in the art of poetry , was required to counterbalance the disadvantage of a mythology with which few readers were likely to be well acquainted , and which would appear monstrous , if its deformities were not kept out of sight . I endeavoured , therefore , to combine the utmost richness of versification with the greatest freedom . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing Oriental in the style . " " The Curse of Kehama " having been finished , on the 25th of November , 1809 , he , the next week , December 2d , began " Roderick , the Last of the Goths " ; and finished it , July 14 , 1814 , - an interval of four years and seven months . Of the history of the composition of this noble work , no particulars are given ; but a letter from Hogg , " the Ettrick Shepherd , " is quoted , which is well worth reading . " I have read Roderick over and over again , and am more and more convinced , that it is the noblest epic poem of the age . I have had some correspondence , and a good deal of conversation , with Mr. Jeffrey about it , though he does not agree with me in every particular . He says , it is too long , and wants elasticity , and will not , he fears , be generally read , though much may be said in its favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , on account , as I said , that he could not appreciate its merits . I copy one sentence of the letter he sent in answer to mine - For Southey I have , as well as you , great respect , and , when he will let me , great admiration ; but he is a most provoking fellow , and at least as conceited as his neighbour Wordsworth . I can not just trust you with his Roderick ' ; but I shall be extremely happy to talk over that and other kindred subjects with you ; for I am every way disposed to give Southey a lavish allowance of praise , and few things would give me greater pleasure than to find he had afforded me a fair opportunity . But I must do my duty , according to my own apprehensions of it . ' " I supped with him last night , but there was so many people that I got but little conversation with him , but what we had was solely about you and Wordsworth . I suppose you have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still found him persisting in his first asseveration , that it was heavy ; but what was my pleasure to find that he had only got to the seventeenth division , I assured him he had the marrow of the thing to come at as yet , and in that I was joined by Mr. Alison . There was , at the same time , a Lady M- joined us at the instant ; short as her remark was , it seemed to make more impression on Jeffrey than all our arguments ; - 0 , I do love Southey ' ! that was all . I have no room to tell you more . But I beg that you will not do any thing , nor publish any thing , that will nettle Jeffrey for the present , knowing as you do , how omnipotent he is with // the fashionable world , and seemingly so well disposed towards you. , , Mr. Southey did not receive very graciously this proposal to propitiate the northern censor , and answered Hogg , as if he thought him a little officious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " tell him he might as easily crush Skiddaw . " Since the completion of " Roderick , " Mr. Southey has produced very little that is worthy of his fame . His muse seems to have fallen into her dotage . Whether the bays of the Laureateship , which he condescended to wear , are really mixed with poppy leaves or not , it is certain , that something stupefying has been mingled with all that he has done officially . Just at this date the tremendous wars of the French revolution came to a close with the fight at Waterloo , and Europe was witness to scenes , such as for grandeur and effect the world has rarely beheld . The overthrow of a terrible dynasty , the release of the civilized nations , the incarceration of the imperial prisoner at St. Helena , the assemblies of the crowned heads of all the great kingdoms at Paris and London , and a thousand more incidents of thrilling and sublime effect , would seem to offer to a poet capable of enthusiasm , such inviting and grateful themes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Southey was maddened by the eagerness with which he entered into the times , his madness had no poetry in it . He wrote an ode on the visit of the Allied Sovereigns to London , in blank verse , from which all enthusiasm as well as jingle was absent . He visited the field of Waterloo three months after the battle , and came home and wrote a long account in rhyme of his " Pilgrimage " thither , which would have been tolerable prose , if it had not been intolerable verse , - wordy and cold . He wrote on the marriage of the Princess Charlotte in a very similar strain . And when George the Third died , he finished the climax of all the fatuities of the official muse , by his " Vision of Judgment " ; which was not " blasphemous , " as it was declared to be , but simply puerile ; being the failure of another attempt to introduce the ancient hexameter verse into our language , and still more signally a failure to produce an impressive and sublime description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately after death . One would not have believed beforehand , that so complete a failure was possible . // After this , we are not aware that any royal verses have been attempted by our author . We suppose that King William and his times have been too democratic for his sympathy or his eulogy ; and , even if the vein of poetic adulation had not been exhausted on her grandfather , the accession of the youthful queen had too little of hope for the conservative bard , to induce him to take down his harp from the willows . There let it hang , never again to palsy the hand of genius with its torpedo wires , or turn to mockery the great events of national and royal fortune . We have only to add the publication of the " Tale of Paraguay , " in four cantos of Spenserian verse , in 1825 , and two long ballads , called " All for Love , " and " The Pilgrim to Coinpostella , " in 1829 , and we have completed the enumeration of the principal works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to judge fairly of a writer so copious and various , it is necessary to separate his works into classes , and form an opinion of each by itself . He may have failed in one direction and been successful in another ; non omnia possumus omnes . In the case before us , it is especially a duty to do this . If judged of by some of these volumes , the author would sink into insignificance ; while the due appreciation of others would assign him an exalted place . If he had written nothing but " Roderick " and " Thalaba , " there would be no doubt in any mind that he is a poet of the first order , for none other could produce those extraordinary works . But the same judgment could not be l ) assed upon the perusal of his innumerable ballads , epitaphs , eclogues , songs , sonnets , dramas , and what he calls " non-descripts . " This varied assortment can not be characterized in any general terms . Each parcel must be taken up by itself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any one sort must do nothing to prejudice the claims of another . But for such an investigation we have here no time or room . We can only say , that the reputation of the author rests on his larger works . A few of his smaller pieces are worthy of all praise , but a great proportion of them have little merit . They were chiefly written when he was very young , and bear the marks of an eager but unripe mind , easily excited and rapidly throwing off its excitement in a poetical form . A considerable number of them are ballads , founded on some ter // rific or grotesque legend of vulgar superstition or the Catholic faith , in which witches and magicians , and especially the Devil , are the actors . It would have been hard to say , in regard to these , whether they were written in earnest or in jest , if the author had not expressed severe displeasure at one of them being styled mock-heroic . Undoubtedly , some of them are conceived in the true ballad vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have secured their popularity . But others are mere doggerel , which we can just put up with , if allowed to regard them as extravaganzas ; and perfectly insufferable , if the author insists on their being taken as specimens of the legitimate art . What especially surprises us , is , that he should have retained a taste for this sort of composition , even to his later years ; the volume already noticed as printed in 1829 , having for its contents nothing but certain long-winded ballads of his poorest manufacture , limping along in lame verses and still lamer prodigies , to the mere disgust of the impatient reader . We do not marvel , that his wife looked grave , as he tells us she did , with " more of reproof than of praise in her smile , " when she found him , at the manly age of fifty-four , dealing out such trash for the amusement of his children ; though the piece to which she especially objected , " The Young Dragon , " is less obnoxious to censure than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tells the story with an air of sly humor , which makes us enjoy it , childish as it is . The major part of the marvellous stories , which he has collected from the stores of monkish tradition , are too senseless to be read with any feeling but that of wonder that any man , to whom it was not assigned as a penance , could submit to versify them so poorly , or to versify them at all . None of his minor pieces seem to us so good on the whole as his " English Eclogues . " They are conceived with great truth , and are expressed in a style of manliness and simplicity , with many touches of unaffected pathos , and in a tone of high philanthropic morality . Similar praise may be given to some of the " Inscriptions " and " Occasional Pieces . " Most of these are in the blank heroic verse . Blank also are many of his " Lyric Poems , " even those which he wrote as poet laureate , on occasions of state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an error . The English accent does not form itself into lyric measures without // the aid of rhyme to mark its movement , and decide its rhythm for the ear . Without rhyme , it can not be distinguished from ordinary blank verse . It is thus that " Thalaba " is written ; the reader , aided by his eye , may observe the verse , but its peculiarity is for the most part undiscernible by the ear . And in short lyric pieces , in which the ex* pression of tenderness or ardor , of pathos or triumph , is so much dependent on the palpable march of the verse , the whole artifice of the structure is in danger of being thrown away , when not made to tell by the recurrence of the rhyme . It is only by his rhyme , that the lyrist can beat time to his music . Great praise has been bestowed on Collins 's " Ode to Evening , " for the sweet and graceful melody of its stanza . Allowing it to be deserved , the piece has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments seems to be , that l ) Tric poetry in blank stanzas is little consistent with the genius of the language . The larger poems of Southey , which make pretension to something of epic dignity , are five in number , occupying each a volume in the present edition . He disclaims for them the title of epic , because , as he avers , it has been " degraded . " This , however , is little to the purpose . If they belong to the class , they should be named accordingly . But the truth is , that the epic , strictly defined , is an obsolete form of the poetic art . It would not be acceptable at the present day . The change of manners , philosophy , and taste , demands a different representation ; and it is because Southey has adapted himself to this change , not because the ancient form is " degraded , " that his poems should not be called epic . But , without elevating this into a question of importance , it is observable , that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other as if they had proceeded from the most opposite schools of art . " Joan of Arc , " " Madoc , " and " Roderick , " are written in regular blank verse ; their scenes lie within the limits of credible history , and they treat of human fortune , character , and passion , in accordance with the most moderate laws of poetic probability . " Thalaba " and " The Curse of Kehama , " on the other hand , are tales of magic and supernatural life ; the actors genii , sorcerers , and gods , as well as men ; the incidents impossible , the dirtouement incredible ; the verse irregular , lawless , and strange , to correspond to the subject . It can not be denied , that in each // class he has been eminently successful ; so much so , unlike as they are , that it is not easy to decide in which of the two his master-piece is to be found . " Roderick " and " Thalaba " undoubtedly stand at the head of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be bard to determine . In remarking on the poems of the first class , we may observe , that they approach as nearly to the epic model as modern taste will allow . They are written in heroic blank verse , and a sustained tone of grave dignity . They treat historical subjects and personages . They are tales of national struggles and welfare , and of the achievements and fortunes of princes and brave men , intermingled with pictures of more private suffering , and the personal fate of distinguished and obscure individuals . The supernatural machinery , thought essential to the epic poem , finds a substitute in the religious sentiment , as existing among the personages who appear in the story , and forms a natural and effective ingredient ; - in " Joan of Arc , " the excited enthusiasm of the heroine , and the devout chivalry of that wild era ; in " Madoc , " the superstitious forms and rites of the savage Mexicans ; in " Roderick , " all that is beautiful , picturesque , and pathetic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan of Arc , " as it was first in the order of time , so was never to be properly regarded as any thing more than a splendid promise , and has not been reared into any thing higher by all the careful emendation of its author in his riper years . In " Madoc " he made a great advancement . The story is various , fertile in cl*aracter and incident , lying partly in the old world and partly in the new , rich in all the contrasts presented by sea and land , civilization and barbarism , Christianity and idolatry . It conducts the Welsh prince from the troubles of his native country , through his voyage over the ocean , to his happy settlement in America . It describes the struggles and wars of the young colony , the fortunes and superstitions of the aboriginal tribes , and the erection of the homes and altars of the new people in faith and peace . It may be said , that there is some lack of vigor in the conduct of the poem , and not sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone is too equably placid and gentle , without sufficient appeal to the more stirring emotions , or admixture of the powerful and grand . But such is the truth // 369 of its pictures of nature and of man , such the vividness of descriptions , such the interest and probability of its incidents and the deep pathos of its suhsidiary narrations , and , in a word , such the purity and sweetness of the whole , that the reader is led along , hy a gentle hut irresistible charm , from page to page , and comes to the end as if he had been listening to the true story of an old friend . From " Madoc " to " Roderick , " the advance is greater still . It is an amazing leap , from a poem simply good to one of the highest order . The author has attained a boldness and vigor , both in plan and in execution , of which the previous works contain few indications . As a specimen of versification , alone , it is deserving of all admiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all the attributes of metrical composition , far above the tone of " Madoc . " The writer has acquired a new sense of the affluence of the English tongue and the movement of English verse . Possibly , his manner may still be objected to as somewhat diffuse , and as needing an occasional terseness to give it variety and nerve . But the want is scarcely deserving of notice , and it is hardly just to name it as detracting from the merit of one of the most admirable pieces of sustained poetic diction in the language . To the structure and order of the poem , the conduct of the story and the proportion of its parts , we give equal commendation . One does not know where to turn to find a plot more felicitous in its conception , or carried on with a more natural and satisfactory developement . It is simple in the extreme , with no perplexing involutions , no startling discoveries , no stage trick of unexpected surprises , no cutting of knots by an extravagant device for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dignified order , one event following another without confusion , and all tending to unfold the characters of the actors , and promote the progress of the story , which , without a moment 's delay or pause , advances with a gradual but uniform increase of interest , without hurry , or bustle , or digression , till it ends in a natural and satisfying close . It is one of the neatest and cleverest specimens of the art of arranging a story , so as to put every thing precisely in its place , give every thing its proper proportions , and exclude every thing irrelevant , which the his- // 370 April , tory of letters can furnish . This is great praise ; and we do not believe it can be gainsaid . We are inclined to estimate no less highly the skill displayed in the more arduous tales of the second class of his larger poems , " Thalaba " and " The Curse of Kehama . " In these there was a difficulty , almost insurmountable , lying at the very threshold . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reception of the grossest absurdities and the most violent impossibilities , to familiarize them to monstrous and odious forms of superstition , and excite a sympathy with the most revolting scenes . How serious this preliminary difficulty was , * may be seen in the fact , that multitudes of readers have been deterred by it from the perusal of these poems , and assign the extravagance of the fictions as sufficient cause for turning away from them . Sometimes indeed , perhaps frequently , the strangeness of the measure , and the occasional peculiarities of the diction , are complained of ; but we suspect , that no one ever became familiar with either poem without being ready to say , with Henry Kirke White , that he would not , on any account , have had it written in any other verse , and becoming ready to excuse , if he could not approve , the passages of questionable taste . Nothing is easier , as Scott intimates in one of his letters , than to make these poems the subject of ridicule , burlesque , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface , ready for the handling of all ; but whoever will go beneath the surface , and enter enough into the purpose and plan of the author to read him aright , will soon cease to feel annoyance from those superficial faults , and will be filled with admiration , ever increasing , at the proofs of power and genius which pervade the entire structure . We are willing to delay a little on this part of our subject , because here it is that the real greatness of Southey is to he found , and yet precisely here it is also that he is likely to be always prejudged and misunderstood . It is likely to be taken for granted , as it has been , without adequate examination , that he has overstepped the legitimate boundaries of Thalaba ' consists of the most wild arid extravagant fictions , and openly sets nature and probability at defiance . In its action it is not an imitation of any thing , and excludes all rational criticism as to the choice and succession of its incidents . " Here the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses the difficulty we refer to , and confirms the prejudice in the minds of its readers . // fiction , and substituted extravagance for romance . But it should be kept in mind , that the degree of probability belonging to a fictitious narrative may oftentimes more depend on the skill of the narrator , than on the intrinsic character of the incidents ; and it is a proof of high genius in a poet , to reconcile us to events and scenes which we would not listen to in another narration . Is it not thus , that Shakspenre leads us through the " Tempest , " and the " Midsummer 's Night 's Dream , " - ay , and " Lear " too , and " Hamlet " ? It is the province and the test of genius to do this successfully and , instead of complaining that one has been so bold as to attempt it , we should simply ask , if he has succeeded in it . His very calling lies " In scenes like these , which , daring to depart From sober Truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assertion , that magic , and sorcery , and fairies , and ghosts were once objects of the popular faith , and therefore rightfully used by the poets , but may be so no longer , because those superstitions have died out of the minds of men , - it appears to us to be nothing to the purpose . Are Homer , Ariosto , Shakspeare , and other ancient masters , any the less admirable to us , because the superstitions of which they treat are not now in being ? It is what those bards have done , not what we in our every-day life believe , that gives interest to those old poems . And , in point of fact , the supernatural personages and the strange traditions of " Thalaba " and " The Curse of Kehama , " are just as much objects of our faith , as those of the " iEneid " and " Jerusalem Delivered " - that is to say , not at all so in our common life , but , while submitting to the power of the poet , altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and men never depart from it . The poet live9 in it ; when he speaks as a poet , he speaks of it ; and if he speak consistently , as one simply telling what his fancy beholds , then it is the same thing as regards his merit , and ought to be the same thing in our judgment , whether he wrote at a period when the vulgar mind held that imaginary world to be a real world , or whether he writes now , when everybody knows it is not real , and yet loves it not the less . it is still the home of the poet ; the domains of magic and superstition are still parts of his empire ; and the question is not whether Southey , or any other , has a right to // enter them , but whether he can exercise any power in them ; not whether he is at liberty " to call spirits from the vasty deep , " but whether " they will come when he doth call for them . " Now we hold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Southey in the poems before us . So dexterously has he contrived the whole machinery , and arranged , and described , and employed the personages , that he makes every thing appear to the fair-minded reader perfectly natural , if not credible and probable . So remarkable is his power of throwing himself into the most impossible situations , that the reader , seeing him actually in them , ceases to think them impossible . So successfully does he invest the most impossible personages with the sentiments and feelings belonging to the place he assigns them , that the reader forgets , that such persons can not be ; he indeed sees that they are , and why should he doubt his eyes ? And so he dwells on the story of their lot with the same interest that he gives to the beings of every-day life . Now this is a wonderful power ; it is that of genius , and genius of no mean order . It excellently realizes the description given by Coleridge , when , having spoken of poems of two sorts , he adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be , in part at least , supernatural ; and the excellence aimed at , was to consist in the interesting of the affections by the ( Iramatic truth of such emotions as would naturally accompany such situations supposing them to be real . " It is to precisely this class that the poems in question belong ; and we doubt if any can be named which more thoroughly fulfil the condition laid down by the critic in the sentence just cited . In all the wonders through which they pass , and the extreme demand they make on the imagination , among scenes unfamiliar , and actors unhuman and superhuman , the dramatic consistency and propriety are never violated ; but every creature is true to the affections and principles which belong to his place , and which would command sympathy if it were real . As examples of what we mean , we appeal to that most exquisite episode in " Thalaba , " of Laila and her father in the region of snow ; to the repentance and death of Maimuna ; and to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kehama , " - so impossible and horrible , and yet made so probable and credible by the glorious loveliness of // that sweet union of parent and child , that we go with them through all vicissitudes on earth and in heaven and in hell , participate in their anxieties and trials , and burst into tears at their final triumph , no more doubting that it is all a solemn reality , than the story of our own lives . It is vain to talk of extravagance , impossibility , or bad taste ; the poet has conquered ; and it is the victory of a great genius . In closing this cursory survey of the works before us , we are disposed to state , a little distinctly , the impression which is left on our mind of the characteristic traits of their voluminous and various author . And we would say , that as we have now turned over these ten volumes of his collected poems , we have been struck with the originality which belongs to them . They are his own , borrowed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good , bad , and indifferent , they stand by themselves , unrelated , of no school , ancient or modern . It was an objection , brought against him at the beginning of his course by some of the critics , that he departed from the approved classical models , that " he followed in the footsteps of no predecessor , " that he ventured on un* tried methods and on unauthorized subjects . At the present day , we perceive no force in an objection , which was of weight only with those who were then standing on the border line between the old and the new era . Their habits and tastes had been formed on the staid mediocrity of the preceding half century , and they were alarmed at the prospect of a revolution . We are now rather disposed to give honor to Southey for his independence , in being so early to perceive and help forward a change which the state of letters demanded . We praise him for adopting a manner of his own , fettering himself by no model , inventing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It came to pass , indeed , that he committed errors , confounded deformities with beauties , and set an equal value on whatever was his own . Like most bold men who start a new method , he indulged a pleasant self-complacency , took no pains to conceal his contempt of those who did not like his novelties , and allowed himself no misgiving in his appeal to the judgment of posterity . This we may lawfully smile at ; there can be no doubt , notwithstanding , that to this spirit he largely owed his success . The fertility of his invention is to be next observed , proof of which is to be seen in the great number and variety of his // works . No man repeats himself less . No man has sent forth a succession of works more different from each other . If " Madoc " had been anonymous , who would have referred it to the author of " Thalaba " ? or if " Roderick , " who would have ventured to call it an imitation of " Madoc " ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be of the same parentage with either ? It is not easy to conceive of a more determined diversity ; and this establishes his claim to the title of an inventor , or poet , - this variety of incident , character , plot , style , so easily and successfully maintained as to appear the result of a spontaneous act of the mind rather than of express effort or studious art . As to his style , which , as the great instrument of the poet , demands to be especially considered , its characteristics are mainly simplicity , melody , diffuseness , and the sweetness and grace , with an occasional languor , which belong to or result from those qualities . The higher and bolder qualities of concise strength , nervousness , and splendor , are rarely exhibited . Sometimes , indeed , there is a display of magnificence and of almost gorgeous amplification , as no one can deny who remembers the descriptions of Baly and of Padalon , in the " Curse of Kehama " but its usual character is that of calm and wordy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatiently wish for a pithy and abrupt expression , to break in upon the luxurious monotony of the " linked sweetness long drawn out . " We say this with special allusion to his blank verse ; and yet , when we remember the power of his description and narrative , we are almost tempted to recall our remark , and to say , that the diffuseness we refer to , is only an elegant and expressive copiousness . At any rate , we speak of it as observers , rather than as fault-finders . And we must add , that his diction is far more exalted , picturesque , and expressive in his later than in his early works ; as any one may see , by comparing " Roderick " with " Madoc , " and " The Curse of Kehama " with " Thalaba. " it is a natural consequence of this copiousness of style , that be possesses little of the curious felicity of phrase , so valued in the poet , the happy combination of choice and pregnant terms , conveying a pointed thought in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as precious . This is that exquisite gift which makes a poet live in the memory of his readers , by attaching to their minds a thousand precious gems of expression . Snatches of // 375 Shakspeare there are , which make part of the language of conversation ; and scarcely a book is printed , but draws its most apt and illustrious mottos from his pages . In everybody 's mouth , too , are phrases and maxims from Milton , Pope , Gray , and other and later bards . But of all this Southey furnishes hardly any thing . His thoughts do not clothe themselves in burning words . They are expanded , not compressed ; diffused , not concentrated ; no diamond , though ample store of gold ; and this not in bars or ingots , but beaten , sometimes too thin . One is frequently struck with a fine thought or a noble image , but never in such guise that it haunts him afterward like a strain of delicious music , and will not be gone ; and if he seek to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to which the poet has attached it are unessential , it readily escapes from them , and is pontent to carry away the sense and forget the expression . If one , therefore , were making up a collection of the " Beauties of Southey , " it is to passages of extended description and sentiment that he would have recourse ; and of these he might find abundance , unsurpassed in their kind for elegance and sweetness . Some of them are familiar to all readers ; as that beautiful passage beginning , " They sin who tell us love can die . " Many such may be selected from these volumes ; to name no other , we do not know that there can be found any thing more graceful , than the manner in which a scene of passionate emotion melts away into tranquillity at the close of the twenty-first book of " Roderick . " " Soothed by the strain Of such discourse , Julian was silent then , And sate contemplating . Florinda too Was calmed . If sore experience may be thought To teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who better learned than I In that sad school ! Methinks if ye would know How visitations of calamity Affect the pious soul , t is shown ye there Look yonder at that cloud , which through the sky Sailing alone , doth cross in her career The rolling moon ! I watched it as it came , And deemed the deep opake would blot her beams But , melting like a wreath of snow , it hangs In folds of wavy silver round , and clothes // The orb with richer beauties than her own , Then , passing , leaves her in her light serene . Thus having said , the pious sufferer sate , Beholding with fixed eyes that lovely orb , Till quiet tears confused in dizzy light The broken moonbeams . They too by the toil Of spirit , as by travail of the day , Subdued , were silent , yielding to the hour . The silver cloud diffusing slowly past , And now into its airy elements Resolved is gone ; while through the azure depth Alone in heaven the glorious Moon pursues Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills around , And the dark tents of that unholy host , Who , all unconscious of impending fate , Take their last slumber there .

And now the nightingale , not distant far , Began her solitary song ; and poured To the cold moon a richer , stronger strain Than that with which the lyric lark salutes The new-born day . Her deep and thrilling song Seemed with its piercing melody to reach The soul , and in mysterious unison Blend with all thoughts of gentleness and love .

He greatly excels in the vivid , graphic delineation of scenes and persons . His descriptions are pictures . As one of his early reviewers remarked , " he describes with all the apparent truth of ocular testimony . " * Our memory of the scenes which he has depicted is like our recollection of those at which * General Repository and Review , Vol . I. Cambridge , 1812. // we have been personally present ; we look back to the story of Oneiza , Laila , Adosinda , more as if we had been with them , than as if we had only read of them . Moath 's tent is a real place to us , and we can not rid ourselves of the impression that we were in the crowd at Arvalan 's funeral . From this cause the writings of Southey are singularly adapted for illustration by the painter and engraver ; situations and attitudes are conceived with such vividness , and portrayed with such force , that it is to the artist almost as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed this in the case of " Thalaba , " saying , that " no poem has a greater number of lively images , or would afford so many subjects for the pencil . " The spirit of the remark may be extended to all his poems ; and we can not but wonder that they have not been seized upon by the artists as treasurehouses of beautiful and magnificent design . For instance , to take the first example out of fifty which occur to us , what a capital picture would Allston make of Roderick , kneeling before the old monk : C* Then Roderick knelt Before the holy man , and strove to speak . Thou seest , he cried , . . thou seest , . . but memory And suffocating thoughts represt the word , And shudderings , like an ague fit , from head To foot convulsed him ; till at length , subduing His nature to the effort , he exclaimed , Spreading his hands and lifting up his face , As if resolved in penitence to bear A human eye upon his shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name would have sufficed To tell the whole abhorr*d history He not the less pursued , . . the ravisher , The cause of all this ruin !

" Thus while the hero spake , Witiza stood Listening in agony , with open mouth , And head , half-raised , toward his sentence turned His eyelids stiffened and pursed up , . . his eyes // Rigid , and wild , and wide ; and when the King Had ceased , amid the silence which ensued , The dastard 's chains were heard , link against link Clinking . At length upon his knees he fell , And lifting up his trembling hands , outstretched In supplication , .. Mercy he exclaimed , .. Chains , dungeons , darkness , . . any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of the most observable traits in the works of this author , is his delight in illustrating the gentler affections , and the sober pleasures of domestic life . He does not avoid the vehement , harsh , and bold ; but he turns , with preference , to the mild and humble . He loves the fireside . He is best satisfied when depicting the amiable relations of brother and sister , parent and child . This has been made a ground of complaint and disparagement with some of the critics ; and it might be regarded as a defect , if he had proved himself equal to nothing else . But , after being excited by his scenes of violence and wrath , by his pictures of magic and revenge , of jealousy , remorse , and war , we esteem it matter of congratulation , that the author is disposed to retreat , with evident delight , into the sanctuary of home , and give his feelings refuge amid the sacred affections of domestic privacy . There are poets enough for the hero and the prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is public , tumultuous , and ostentatious , will always find pens ready to commemorate and adorn it . Let there be one , at least , to appreciate the holiness of the fraternal bond , as in Thalaba ; the beauty and worth of the filial affection , as in Laila and Kaylyal ; to celebrate the loveliness and power of maternal influence , as in Rusilla and Roderick , and the charm of the complete domestic ring , as in the family of Pelayo . The world will lose nothing by turning its sympathies away from kingdoms and ambition , to families and childhood ; and the poet who knows how to do this , is to be esteemed a benefactor . Mr. Southey does not stop here . There is a close connexion between this class of affections and the religious sentiment , and he passes . constantly into the latter . He writes like a man whose habitual devoutness of temper associates all scenes with spiritual thoughts , discerns the moral uses of whatever occurs , and interprets all by a reference to some // providential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent and pure , but directly and persuasively religious . The tendency , the very moral , of each of his greater works is expressly favorable to faith and piety ; three of them might , with no impropriety , be styled religious allegories ; and rarely are the highest virtues more affectingly taught . A distinguished critic , apparently incapable of sympathy with any expression of religious sentiment , speaks of his poetry as " outrageously religious and fanatical . " We may pardoii his injustice in pity for his ignorance . He who knows what faith and devotion are , would rather esteem it as beautifully illustrative of that deep and glowing , but calm and steadfast principle of rational trust and filial piety , which especially becomes a creature like man . He would see in it nothing overwrought , nothing unduly enthusiastic , but a just delineation of that spirit which is equally distant from coldness and excess . With this spirit his best works are imbued ; it sheds light and beauty over their pages ; it clothes them with peculiar tenderness , purity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth , in distinct and prominent expression , as if the spontaneous breath of the author , who could not but utter the language familiar to his heart . Without making any comparison between this poet and his distinguished contemporaries , without wishing that they had received less honor , or attempting to decide his relative rank among them , we yet can not refrain from declaring our wonder , that a higher place in the public estimation has not been assigned to Southey . It would avail nothing to prophesy , that so gifted an author can not be kept for ever in undeserved neglect , for we do not believe that the present celebrity of writers is a fair test of their absolute or relative merit ; but we may express a strong hope that less injustice . may be done in time to come , and that some of the altention now wasted on frivolous and demoralizing publications , may be given to the principal works of this equally entertaining and never corrupting writer . It is mortifying , that , amid the infinity of reprints from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is time that it were otherwise.
