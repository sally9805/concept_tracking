txt Tiiis holiday of our colleges having just passed , we can not forbear dwelling a moment upon the interesting associations and emotions which its return is calculated to awaken . These are peculiar , and often almost indescribable . They do not partake of the national character of some or the domestic character of others of our few days of relaxation from the pursuits of life . And , although our seminaries of learning are so intimately connected with our national respectability and prosperity , as being the nurseries of the future men upon whom these are to depend , that no one can feel indifferent on an occasion , when so many young men leave the pupilage of academic halls , to go into the world , and to take their places in the arena of life ; yet it is to him who has himself gone out from one of these seminaries , with the fresh hopes and spirit of youth , and who returns to visit his alma // mater with the experience of years upon his head , that Commencements have an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The associations awakened in such minds are mingled with pleasure and pain . It is painfully pleasant to visit scenes of former happiness , and be conscious that we can never enjoy them again . The heart will throb when the eye gazes on familiar and long-cherished objects which are consecrated by early joys , when we see around these object.s the strange changes that time brings over all things , and find these spots profaned , as it were , by the foot of the stranger , that heeds not our emotions when we come to what was once our hearts ' home , and find but an echo to respond to our greeting . There are few moments in this dull journey of life more sacred than those when long-severed friends meet and recall the feelings that bound them together in former days ; and yet there is a pang which the tongue can not utter , awakened in the breast of a class-mate , by the bleached locks and the tottering step of age , or even the manly vigor of middle life , which have taken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with whom he has recently parted , on the threshold of that world , on whose stage they have been performing their parts . We do not believe that any one ever revisited the scenes of his college life , after a lapse of years , on Commencement Day , without many if not all the associations to which we have alluded . Nor are the reflections of an ingenuous mind scarcely less painfully interesting , when they reach beyond its own emotions , and rest upon the future destinies of the principal actors on these occasions-the young men who are leaving college with the high hopes and aspirations peculiar to their period of life . The memory irresistibly goes back to the day when we ourselves bid adieu to collegiate restraints and discipline . We recall the hopes which we then cherished , the promises that awaited us in our career , the bright sun that was over us , and the brilliant flowers that decked our pathway , and a spirit like that of prophecy comes over us . We i'ead in our own fates the ( lestiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloud gathering , which is to obscure the bright heaven above him , we feel for him the chilling frost that is to nip the fair flowers around him , and we see his brow overcast , and his heart sinking at the fading away of his fondest hopes , and the crushing of his noblest aspirations . We see him living in a fancied world of his own creation , and mourn to think how soon this frost-work of the imagination will dissolve , how soon he must encounter the rough passages of life that are now hid from his vision , and grapple with difficulties where he least expects them . There is an influence in these holidays , which does not exhaust itself in the individual recollections and associations which they thus awaken , and which gives them a decided importance in regulating our national character . The incentives which are offered to the student to deserve and win the honors and applause , which merit , on these occasions , is sure to command , have no small influence upon his habits of industry arid al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation for his future usefulness and respectability . We will not stop to discuss the question , how far competition is a proper means of promoting application and effort on the part of the student ; but while // we are constituted as we are , we should regret to see collegiate honors and rewards discontinued , or the approbation of the most intelligent portion of the community cease to excite a laudable emulation in the minds of the young . But it is not alone upon the students of our colleges that these annual holidays possess a salutary influence . Few are so obtuse as not to be affected by associations , which they are calculated to awaken . Who , for instance , can visit the venerable seat of our University , on a commencement day , without recalling the names and virtues of those worthies , who have illustrated that institution , the age in which they lived , and their country . Who can be unmindful that men , whose names they have learned to reverence , once started from the same goal , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are now about to go out into the world ? and who can fail thereby more fully to appreciate the institutions of a country , which open to genius and industry a sure avenue to distinction , however humble their origin or feeble its patronage . These holidays are , moreover , calculated to produce a more immediate and salutary effect upon the literature and literary men of our country , than even upon the general mass of the community ; and , if they were more generally resorted to , the effect would be more obviously felt . The truth is , there is little , if any , of xvhat may be called literary spirit , diffused in the community . There is far too little of that esprit de corps , which ought to distinguish our literary and scientific men . They are all too much engaged in the business and politics and controversies of the day , to have time to cherish this feeling , or to have opportunities to indulge it . In the strife of contending parties , in the prosecution of rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic of letters , of which they ought to claim and exercise the rights of citizenship ; and something is wanted to draw them away from the jarring and absorbing scenes of the world 's business , to the quiet walks of literature , or the peaceful and soothing pursuits of science . They want the sympathy of kindred souls , to draw them hither . It requires more than the ordinary effort of human judgement to withdra*v from that in which all around us are engaged as the chief good , and there are few , if any , occasions in our country , where the kindred sympathies of literary men can be awakened or revived , if they be not the literary festivals of our colleges . If they would come together there more generally than they now do , society would feel its effect in a most sensible degree . They would forget , for the time being , the animosities of political or polemical strife . Like the citizens of Greece , at their games , they would come together in pe*ce and as friends ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians . We all know how much the public feeling is controled by the often silent influence of our literary men through the press and popular assemblies , and if by any means , the asperities of feeling which are now too often allowed to escape in the disputes and discussions in which such men engage , could be softened down or obliterated , we repeat , society would feel its effect most sensibly in all its relations . Literary men owe a duty to themselves on this subject , which they can easily appreciate upon a moment 's reflection ; but they owe a duty // to their country in relation to it , which they should never disregard , though it may not be so obvious to the mind . To the descendants of the pilgrims , we need not say , that our system of government , our happiness as men , and our prosperity as a nation , is based upon the intelligence of the people . Nor need we labor to show how far this depends upon the condition of our schools and colleges . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment . If this becomes mis-directed , consequences the most disastrous may ensue , and , if we might allude to the present administration of our government , we might add , have ensued already . Something more is necessary in order to any institution of society having its proper influence here , than that it should be good . To produce its desired effect , it requires the aid and support of the public will in its favor . In many of our towns , our system of common schools , the most perfect of any that has ever yet been devised , is almost inoperative , because the public attention is not properly awakened to the subject . And so it would be with our colleges , if their friends were to cease to manifest an interest in their prosperity . Fashion , in our country , holds too sovereign a sway over the destinies of the nation , and nothing would sooner or more effectually strike a fatal blow at the prosperity of an institution , than to let it sink into disregard . If , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they should not only be properly endowed , but no friend of literature should treat them with indifference or neglect . They need not only the public money , but the public countenance . Those , who have never had the opportunity of a collegiate education , should see by the conduct of those who have been thus educated , that they esteem these institutions useful and valuable . If , when the collegiate course of a class has been completed , and they bring before the public an exhihition of their proficiency in the pursuits of college life , our literary men manifest an indifference to the occasion , the public will feel the same . The people will hold in less esteem , what those , best qualified to judge , treat with neglect ; and vain would be the effort of the managers of such an institution to sustain it , with the public sentiment in a state of apathy towards it . We are not aware that there is any occasion at present for these remarks , on account of any want of interest manifested towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We apprehend , however , that the importance of these holidays is not sufficiently appreciated even by those who attend them ; and we have feared , too , lest in the spirit of prostrating reform which is so much encouraged in our day , men might grow indifferent to our literary institutions , the influence of whose opinions would be seriously felt and- lamented . While men love to cherish the memory of their early days , or revisit with pleasure the scenes of their childhood , we do not fear that the alumni of any college will cease to regard their alma mater with interest ; but it is by no means unnecessary to remind the literary man of business , how essential to the public welfare is that system of education which has done so much in his own case to soften and refine the feelings , elevate his purposes , and correct the heart , and in no connexion did it seem to us , that this could be better done than when recalling the associations which are connected with the only literary holidays that we enjoy-our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenets are frequently and familiarly referred to , Epicurus is least understood in his moral doctrines , and most unjustly reproached in his life and character . Throughout Christendom he is not only denounced as a sensualist himseW but as a professed teacher of sensuality in the school he established . It is even believed of him that he neither practised nor inculcated any thing else . He is therefore placed , by a majority of perhaps a thousand to one , at the head of libertinism both in sentiment and practice . Yet never was a decision more unfounded , nor a sentence of condemnation less deserved . He did as little to merit such imputations , as Socrates did to deserve death , or Aristides banishment . Fortunate would it be , both for the world and themselves if one in ten thousand of those who calumniate him , would conform to the model of virtue which he presented in his example , and reach the standard of morality he erected in his lectures . In these remarks I am amply sustained , as well by his public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as have survived the wreck of Grecian literature . True , the virtue of Epicurus was neither that of the ancient Stoics or Cynics , nor of the modern Puritans . It was , however , greatly preferable to either ; because it was much more conformable to the constitution of human nature . It was neither flinty and intractable in its texture , nor repulsive in its aspect . It could be so tempered and moulded as to fit man , and afford him protection from his moral enemies , without rendering him awkward and inflexible , or deforming him by unsightly angles and offensive points . It did not metamorphose him externally into a formal being of art , or internally of affectation ; but left him in both respects natural and easy . But if it had in its character somewhat of the ductility of gold , it had still more of its purity and preciousness , and never lost its value by any change of form . Eminently beautiful itself it was calculated to bestow on human nature equal beauty , and to make it lovely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunts of vice . In this consisted no little of its worth ; for that human nature should be attractive , is highly desirable , as a circumstance improving its general character . A scheme of virtue thus accommodated to the constitution of man , and harmoniziisg with his relations to all things around him , indicated , in its illustrious teacher and pattern , a more correct and profound knowledge on those points , than was possessed by any other philosopher of Greece . It was the real rirtue of nature , the only model and source of every thinir in man that is sound in principle , and destined to be permanent in its existence , and beneficial in its effects . Or , if the expression be more acceptable , it was the virtue of nature and reason united ; because the former was its foundation , and the latter approved of it . Without this sanction it would have been but // 354 a name  --  or something worse-inasmuch as it would have countenanced error and its effects . Thus derived and constituted , the virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attributes ; to render him more amiable , purer , and more useful . In other words , it fitted him more perfectly for the rank he holds in earthly creation , and the duties required of him , as standing at the head of it . Is any one inclined to propose to me the question , " If the tenets and example of the Philosopher of the Garden were so pure and invaluable at first , why did they become sources of sensuality and vice ? " I reply , that his example never became a source of vice to any one who conformed to it ; and if his precepts did , it was because they were misunderstood and abused . They were perverted in their meaning , and misapplied in their end , by sensualists who falsely professed to be his followers . It is well known that , in after times , those who called themselves by his name , instead of adopting either the spirit of his philosophy , or the practice of his life , surrendered themselves to their own unbridled desires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same true of the tenets of Christianity and the example of its Founder ? Is not the latter a perfect model of virtue ahd piety , while the former , equally spotless , are grossly misinterpreted , and wantonly applied to nefarious purposes ? often made to pander to secret turpitude and open crime ? In both cases , the propensities of faithless partizans are in fault ; not the unimpeachable doctrines they have polluted . The tempest of the human passions , like that of the winds , converts occasionally good into evil . Does the latter not only overthrow and dash to pieces the choicest monuments of genius and taste , but lift them from their bases , and bear them along with it , as engines of destruction ? Of all that is most valuable in morals and religion the former often makes similar havoc , and renders it instrumental in still deeper desolation . The entire history of the Inquisition , and every other form of persecution " for conscience ' sake , " testify to the truth of this . It is thus that the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst of ends . And the perversion is much more frequently effected under the garb of specious morality and masquerade sanctity , than under that of undisguised libertinism . In the number and amount of the enormities they commit , the latter is immeasurably surpassed by either of the two former . As already intimated , the entire character of Epicurus was in beautiful keeping with the doctrines he taught . In the capacity of a moralist his theory and practice were in unison.5 Of but few of his condemners would I affirm the same . They too generally substitute words for actions , recommending one course , and pursuing another . To him the fine compliment was no less applicable than to the prince of critics , for whom the poet designed it He was himself the great sublime he drew . " He illustrated and enforced , by his example , what he inculcated in his precepts ; and from that consideration was much of his weight and influence derived . Although youn* , er than either of them , lie was contemporary in Athens with Xenocrates , Aristotle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cynic , and Peripatetic schools . Nor did he suffer in comparison with the most distinguished of them . Neither could their splendors eclipse him , their opposition and authority exclude him from public favor , nor their arguments subvert the doctrines he promulgated . His followers were as numerous and respectable as theirs ; at times , more so . He resisted successfully every expedient devised for his overthrow . Did the Stoics attack his morals and reputation ? He refuted their calumnies by the whole tenor of his life , and even put the authors of them to shame by its superior purity . Instead of piercing the armor his virtues threw around him , their poisoned shafts recoiled on themselves . Was he assailed by the Cynics on account of his personal neatness and elegance ? He disarmed them by his mildness and courtesy , and almost infused good humor into them by his amenity and cheerfulness . Did the Peripatetics , or others , attempt to expose the fallacy of his opinions ? They found him an antagonist of great resources ; not only rich in knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pur * As if in contradiction of this statement , Epicurns is charged with having squandered a large patrimonial estate . I am not sure ttiat the charge is correct . B Ut admitting it to he so , the cause is to he looked for , not in any vicious and discreditable practices , to which he was addicted-because none such existed-hut to his neglect of his private affairs , his giving away of money , and his indiscreet indulgence of his taste in the Fine Arts , and other elegancies of great cost . If these he immoralities , some of the most worthy and distingtmished men of every age and civilized country have heen guilty of them . // 355 poses of illustration and proof . Peaceful and tolerant in his disposition , delighting in social intercourse , and desirous of maintaining harmony and exchanging the kindnesses and courtesies of life with cultivated men of every description , he was never the assailant in a war of opinion . But , occupying impregnable ground , and prepared for every form of attack , he defended himself successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his competitors for fame . Nor did the weight of his character and the general effect of his labors arise from this alone . His force and perspicuity in lecturing and discussion did not contribute snore to his renown as a teacher , than the familiar suavity and friendliness of his deportment toward his classes did to his influence as a companion , and his popularity as a man . I need scarcely add , that such a union of attractive and commanding qualities drew around him followers , many of them of high standing , from all parts of Greece , as well as from Italy , Sicily , and other countries , and rendered him eminently successful in the rapid and extensi *e diffusion of his doctrines . As already mentioned , his classes were , at times , the largest in Athens , when that seat of science and letters was in its zenith . These facts prove conclusively , not only that his teaching and example did not scandalize the public morals , or offend the taste of the most refined people then on earth , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period so remote from that in which he lived , that the dews of more than twenty centuries have distilled on his grave , it is delightful to look hack on the model he exhibited , as a public teacher , and the founder of a sect . In such a retrospect he presents himself to us in the semblance of an indulgent and accomplished father at the head of a family equally attached to him by veneration and love . All things around him are in beautiful accordance with the elegance of his mind , the purity of his sentiments , and the refinement of his taste . Leaving to Aristotle his Lyceum , to Plato his Academy , and to Zeno his Porch , he selected , as the theatre of his instruction , his own magnificent GARDLN , on the margin of the Illissus . There , in the midst of flowers and fragrance , choice statuary , and marble fountains , and beneath the branches of embowering trees , we behold him , graceful in his attitudes and becoming in his attire , surrounded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . In fancy 's account the ear is more exquisitely regaled than the eye . In a strain of eloquence , whose sweetnii.ss is equalled only , if equalled at all , by that of Plato , tbe . /lthenien Bee , his lips are dropping wisdom as rich and balmy as the fruits of bis garden , and uttering precepts of moralify as pure as the azure of his native sky . Except his own mellifluous voice , not a breath interrupts the silence of the assembly ; and , the beauties of the place being forgotten , he alone is the object of regard . And when the lecture is ended , there is an instinctive press of his pupils toward his person , to grasp his hand , enjoy his conversation , and share his fellowship . Such was the Philosopher of the Garden , in the midst of his followerseultivating their taste , improving their affections , purifying their morals , and enriching their intellects . And yet , so fickle is fortune , and so perishable fame ; I should rather say , so blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his name has been pronounced but as a synonyme of sensuality , and his doctrines reprobated as the leaven of corruption . To prove conclusively the injustice of this decision , nothing is requisite but a brief exposition of the principles he taught . The principal object of his research , like that of other contemporary sages , was the summum boaum in terris ; the chief good of man on earth ; by which was meant the highest degree of human felicity ; or rather that which produced it . This he pronounced to be PLEAsOIIE ; and enjoined on his pupils , as a paramount duty , to seek and enjoy it . But not pleasure , in the usual acceptation of the term ; not , I mean , the gross pleasures of animality , whether they consisted in sating the appetite with costly food , in bacchanalian revels , or in the criminal or irregular gratification of the other propensities . To all indulgences of this kind he was as inflexibly opposed , in his principles and practice , as the Stoics and Cynics of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as free from intemperance as Zeno , and more so than Diogenes . The pleasures he recommended and partook of were those of refined taste , as related to things ornamental in the arts ; social and friendly intercourse ; wedded and domestic affectiomi ; elegant hospitality ; pure and practical virtue ; the contemplation of the beauties , sublimities , and harmonies of creation ; and profound meditation on the obligations and ends of human duty . They were the pleasures arising from the exercise of the higher and nobler faculties of man , freed as much as possible from all alloy , and never indulged in to excess . Under this restriction they neither wasted the body with die a e , no*r // tortured the mind with remorse . On the contrary , they rendered the former healthful and vigorous , and the latter peaceful and serene . True , our philosopher did not shun or censure legitimate and regulated pleasure , from whatever quarter it presented itself . He only shunned excess , and condemned whatever was low and degrading . Regarding all inferior enjoyments as intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , he endeavored faithfully to render them so , and relied on the latter for usefulness in life , dignity of character , and personal happiness . Who will venture to criminate him for this , mark out a scheme of life in stricter accordance with morality and virtue , or recommend a foundation on which he could have more securely relied , for the achievement of all that is most desirable ? I think I may answer , no one . It is the only foundation which nature furnishes and reason sanctions . All experience , moreover , testifies in its favor . Every thing in opposition to it , or apart from it , is hut the craving of animal desire , the result of unsound education and prejudice , or the creation of fancy . It includes the elements of religion , as the highest attribute of our moral nature , and thus completes the groundwork of happiness . That we may understand it the more clearly , and be better prepared to set a correct estimate on it , let us subject Epicurism to a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his lectures , and exemplified it in his life . The doctrine of Epicurus was , that man , in a cultivated and refined condition , which it was both his duty and in his power to attain , ought to gratify the desires of his nature , under the sanction of reason and experience . In other words , that he should partake of pleasure according to his constitution , and in obedience to its laws , giving a preference to that which results from the exercise and indulgence of his highest faculties . In attempting to elucidate this view of the subject , and prove its correctness , it is requisite that I take Nature for my guide , as far as the lights I possess may enable me to do so . I shall therefore divide the faculties of man , as she has done , into animal , moral , and intellectual . Although , strictly speaking , some of them are of a mixed character , this classification is sufficiently correct for my present purpose . The position to be maintained then is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets of faculties , and our happiness in the enjoyment which that exercise affords . That I may be enabled to execute the task on which I am about to enter , if not with more satisfaction to others , at least with greater facility to myself , it is necessary for me to specify some of the most important of the faculties referred to . Here I am compelled to become the Phrenologist ; because in no other capacity can I analyze human nature , or speak rationally of it as relates to mind . To man 's animal character belongs his love of existence , with the appetites subservient to it . Of these the most conspicuous are , a desire to breathe and to take food and exercise , and a propensity to preserve life by flight or resistance , in case of its being endangered . This resistance may extend to the destruction of the enemy . These are exclusively selfish . They belong , I mean to the individual , as an insulated being , and have no necessary connexion with the social state . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in society , possess them in as high a degree as those that do . To the same class belong the Attachment of the sexes to each other ; the Love of offspring ; general Adhesiveness , embracing friendship and making a part of Philanthropy ; Constructiveness or a propensity to build or fashion things ; Acquisitiveness or a desire to amass property ; Combativeness , and a few others . Whether these faculties are the functions of certain specific organs or portions of the brain , is not now the question to be considered . They make a part of the mental constitution of man , and that is sufficient for the end I have in view . The faculties last enumerated , being less exclusively selfish than those previously recited , are of a higher order . For , other things being equal , the wider the sphere of any human feeling is , and the greater the number of our race it embraces , the nobler is its nature . To the class of moral faculties belong the following , which are called sentiments . Self-esteem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope , Ideality , ( or a sentiment of beauty and sublimity , ) Conscientiousness , ( or a sense of justice , ) and Firmness of purpose . These are of a still higher rank and more ennobling cast than any included in the animal class . They belong more to man , and less to the beings that are inferior to him . The intellectual faculties are subdivided into the knowing and the reftectin* , , or those of simple perception . and the perception of relations . To the former belong Individuality or the Perception of objects and events as they are in themselves , independently of their connexions , Form , Size , Weight , Locality , Color , Order , // $57 Time , Number , Tune , and Language ; to the latter , Comparison , Causality , Wit or Gaiety , and Imitation . Such are the leading faculties of man ; and , as already mentioned , his duty and happiness consist in a well-regulated exercise of the whol* of them . The truth of this may be satisfactorily established by a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraced in the discussion , that circumstances , which I can not control , will compel me to be too brief in my remarks for a full illustration of them . I can but indicate the course to be pursued in tracing each separate inquiry to its termination . That a reasonable indulgence in eating and drinking is a duty will not be denied , because it is essential to health as well as life . That it is a source of pleasure is equally true , because it gratifies a native appetite , which is always pleasurable , and was intended to be so , in order that its summons might not be neglected . Nor is this all . The taste being unperverted , there are many reasons why it is much better to eat a grateful than an insipid or an offensive meal ; and no reason can be given for the reverse . It is more favorable to health . All other things being alike , pleasant food is more easily digested and turned to wholesome nourishment than that which is unpleasant . This is a truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion to discuss it . Food that is at war with natural taste is never in amity with a sound stomach . But , strict temperance being always observed , the moral effect of a pleasant repast is much better than that of a disagreeable one . All its associations are of a higher and more useful cast . The temper of the mind is improved by it . It is not only rendered more placid and disposed to good and beneficent actions , but better fitted to ngage in them , and perform the labor they require . The energy of the whole mind is increased by the gratification enjoyed . The individual , being comfortable in himself , is more inclined to promote the comfort and happiness of others , and will therefore bestow favors which he would have withheld before his meal . This is a truth known to those who have boons to crave from their superiors , and is often successfully practised on by them . It is a court maxim , that such requests are most readily granted after dinner . Nor is this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude to the GIVER of all good , for his bounty and beneficence , is heightened , and thus is even piety strengthened . The food of the body becomes balm to the spirit . Let any individual among us , even a Puritan , or an Ascetic , if he can be found , breakfast to-morrow morning on good bread , well-prepared butter , a fresh egg , and excellent coffee , and the next day on sour bread , grown musty from age , rancid bacon , a spoiled egg , and hoarhound tea , and measure his gratitude , piety , and other moral and social feelings after each meal . I hazard nothing in saying , that he will find himself the better husband , father , citizen , and Christian , on the first trial . The latter meal will be wormwood to the whole man . It will operate on him as a bleak and rainy day in November does on a merchant , when his credit is low , his pockets empty , and his duns clamorous . It will attune his temper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points and degrees of difference , in enjoyment and moral effect , between a meal taken by Diogenes , crouching like a pauper in his tub , and Epicurus , seated like a gentleman , at his table . But they do not constitute the entire difference , nor even the greatest , that existed . The latter philosopher dined and supped with his friends , and the chief enjoyment of his table was that of sentiment and intellect . The gratification of the palate was a matter of inferior regard . The corporeal fare* though well prepared and pleasant to the senses , was plain , and moderately indulged in ; that of the mind , rich and elegant , and enjoyed in abundance . If the choicest wines did occasionally sparkle on the board , they were exceeded by the flashes of wit and the flow of pleasantry which the occasion called forth ; and if the fruit or other articles of desert were well flavored and delicious , they were less so than the sentiment and philosophy. , by which the enjoyment of them was accompanied , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party lingered at table , the hours were not mis-spent . The end they had in view , was neither boisterous carousal , nor any sort of ordinary convivial enjoyment . It was to enlighten the intellect , improve moral feeling , cultivate the social affections , mature existing friendships or contract new ones , and confirm high and benevolent resolves , as to future measures for the diffusion of knowledge , and the doing of good . And when they separated , each was conscious of being in a better mood than when they met ; brighter in his thoughts , more virtuous in his purposes , and happier in his feelings . This is the true Epicuris* of the table ; and it is that which alone the philosopher practised . If those professing to be his followers degrad d it aftemwards , under the sanction // Thoughts on True Epicurism. of his name , to animal grossness , and bacchanalian riot , he is no more answerable for the issue , in his reputation and standing , than the AuTison of the Christian religion is , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the priesthood , or the horrors of the inquisition . The next subject of my attention , is the attachment between the sexes . What shall I say of this affection when virtuous and honorable ? What , indeed , can I say worthy of a sentiment , which , through all ages , has constituted a theme of universal praise ? which has been compared to all that is beauteous and exquisite in nature , and had homage done to it by the choicest productions of art ; but whose currect representation human genius has never executed ? If all the rare and fascinating imagery of poetry , accompanied by the melody of numbers , and expressed in the happiest language of the muse , be incompetent to do it justice , well may I decline the effort in despair . Instead of attempting , therefore , to portray it by metaphors , or to embellish my view of it by any of the creations of an excited fancy , I shall speak of it as I would of any other attribute of our race , in the strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbid me to pronounce it a feeling replete with high-wrought individual happiness , and tending directly to public good . It even permits me to add , that it ennobles human nature , lifts it above its ordinary level , and bestows on it a loftier and a better character . Because it is an element of Epicurism , will the Stoic and the Puritan denounce it also ? To a certain extent they have virtually done so . But let them rail on ! Their denunciation is impotent , and their labor fruitless , because they are unnatural ; and all that is so , is destined to fail . Whatever strictly follows nature , in all points , is sure to triumph . And nature is so harmonious and consistent with herself that to follow her in any one respect is perfectly compatible with following her in all . I repeat , then , that an honorable attachment between the sexes is a source not only of true happiness , but of an incalculable amount of practical good . It amends the feelings , by lifting them above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces and confirms resolutions tending to useful purposes , and invigorates exertions to accomplish them . All times testify to the improvement it produces in man . It renders the brave more brave , and heightens the tone of honor in the honorable . Into patriotism it infuses an intenser ardor , and makes philanthropy itself more vivid and expansive . It has even reclaimed the malefactor from his vices , and breathed into the coward a spirit of manliness . It is a foe to all that is low and degrading , whether in action or thought . It affords the most perfect example , that earth can produce , of happiness reflected between kindred spirits doubling the enjoyment of each . By thus proving such a balm to life , and shed ding such a glow of sunshine through the heart , it gives to creation superadded charms , and awakens conceptions more worthy of its AUTHOR . Piety , therefore , becomes its debtor . The story so inimitably told by Moore , in his Epicurean , of a gay and licentious young Greek being reformed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Egyptian girl , is no fiction . Before his acquaintance with that faultless and fascinating being , Alciphron was the boast of libertinism ; afterwards the mirror of saintship . Nor is the influence of this passion confined to the feelings and sentiments . That the taste is refined and the intellect strengthened by it , is a truth which makes a part of the philosophy of our nature . In fine , after having been to the sexes the bliss of life it erects to them , in an interminable line of descendants , the must glorious monument , and thus bestows on them , an earthly immortality . We are virtually assured that , without it , Paradise itself was but a comfortless abode ; and I verily believe it . " It is not good for man to be alone , ' are the words , in which the truth is announced . Such is virtuous love , in its delights and importance ; and yet , I repeat , it is an element of Epicurism , and found an advocate in the Philosopher of the Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illicit way , he was inflexibly opposed , and cautioned youth against it , as a degrading practice , and a great evil . The bard of Scotland might have derived from his lectures the fine sentiment of the following stanza " The sacred glow of well-placed love , L , ixuriantly indulge it ; But never tempt the illicit rove , Though nothing should divulge it ; I wave the greatness of the sin The danger of concealing ; But oh ! it hardens all within , And petrifies the feeling . " // 359 The indulgence of the love of offspring is another ingredient in the system of Epicurus . To consume time in the commendation of it would be superfluous . Nature has put her seal on parental affection , as one of the choicest attributes of our race . Of all feelings belonging e clusively to earth , it best perhaps deserves to be called holy . Without it mankind would soon be extinct . A living poet has well described it in the following lines " Some feelings are to mortals given , With less of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human tear From passion 's dross refined and clear , A tear so limpid and so meek , It would not stain an angel 's cheek , T is that which pious fathers shed Upon a duteous daughter 's head . " And a mother 's love has in it something still more celestial . It is a symbol of all that is pure and tender , beneficient and inextinguishable . It survives the love of life and all other earthly things . Hence the mother so often deliberately sacrifices herself for her child . Danger is around them , and all others , the father not excepted , fly for safety . But she clings to the helpless infant , and , rather than live without it , perishes with it . This , I say , is an act of pure Epicurism , on which Heaven smiles , and Puritans might frown for the same reason ; because it is an instance of intense devotion to nature . Friendship , although a less ardent , is not a less noble and important attachment . It operates on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive effects . If parental and filial attachment holds individual families together , that of general Adhesiveness holds together communities and nations , and gives a feeling of family connexion to the whole human race . It is the true bond of civil and social life , without which , existence would be not only joyless , but a state of wretchedness . Of all descriptions of misery , that of absolute and hopeless seclusion is the most fearful . Yet it is nothing but the final dissevering of the tie of adhesiveness , followed by years of living annihilation . Man has not always an object to love , nor one on which to bestow parental fondness . He can exist , therefore , without either affection , although not so happily . But to be cut ofF from all feeling and fellowship with his race ; to regard no one , and be by no one regarded or remembered ; to feel not a pulse but what beats inwardly on self announcing that hope and joy and communion are extinct , and all creation turned to a blank ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without a name . But if the e tinction of friendship and social intercourse produces such wretchedness , the cultivation and indulgence of them must be a source of enjoyment correspondingly great . This follows by the law of contrast . But I am presenting only an abstract view of my subject . Something more definite will better illustrate it ; and examples to my purpose , had 1 leisure to recite them , are sufficiently numerous . The happiness arising from individual friendships , and the many noble acts performed through their influence , have been recorded by historians , and celebrated by poets , since the commencement of letters . Few themes have been more fertile in touching anecdotes and fine writing . The stories of the friendships of David and Jonathan , Achilles and Patroclus , and Damon and Pythias , and the beautiful episode on that of Nisus and Euryalus , with many others of a similar character , are transmitted to us by the ancients . Nor are modern times less productive of them . During the havoc of the French revolution , personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of danger and threatened death , saved the lives of thousands of individuals , many of them distinguished no less by rank , than by talents and worth . Some of the most affecting narratives I have ever listened to , were recitals of those generous and heroic acts , uttered in the eloquence of deep emotion , by persons who had been the objects of them . And , to the honor of the sex be it recorded , in a very great majority of instances , it was woman , true to her affections , and regardless of consequences , that performed the deed . I intend no compliment , therefore , beyond what truth sanctions , and history recognizes , when I say , that friendship personified , should always appear in female form . And such is the figure , which fancy , faithful to nature , uniformly bestows on it . But time permits me only to refer , in general terms , to the aggregate of good which this sentiment produces . Communities and nations have been rescued from calamity , and even protected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for much of its prosperity . To cultivate it , therefore , and conform to its dictates , is no less a duty , than a source of gratification . To this effect were the doctrines and exam- // Thoughts on True Epicurism. pie of the accomplished teacher , whose philosophy I am considering . The consequence was , that he took a stronger hold of the affections of his pupils , and held with them much more of the communion of the heart , than any other founder of a school in Athens . Of Combativeness the true end of which is resentment and resistance of aggression and wrong , I shall not dwell , because time will not permit me . Yet it is a subject full of interest . The regulated indulgence of it , on proper occasions , is an element of both virtue and happiness . Duty requires of us to cherish just indignation against vice , and to defend our country , our friends , and ourselves , against lawless violence and premeditated injury . In such cases indifference and disobedience would be faulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call is manly and laudable . Hence the latter is not only pleasing in the act , but grateful in recollection . No man has ever made an honest and judicious effort to suppress or repel vice , or benefit his friends or country , without experiencing , as the fruit of it , self-approbation , which is an indispensable ingredient in the constitution of happiness . The hero , who , in a righteous cause , expires on the field of battle , enjoys , in his last moments , a greater amount of virtuous delight , than the coward who flies does , during a future protracted life of inglorious prosperity . Of the pleasures and usefulness of the exercise of Constructiveness it would not be easy to speak in terms of extravagant praise . The range of that faculty is almost boundless , and its products are in a corresponding degree diversified and important . It is the source of architecture in its several departments , and in every form that genius and taste have bestowed on it , whether for ornament or use . Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headstone to the column , from the tomb to the mausoleum , and from the tumulus to the pyramid . Does it relate to human dwellings ? Its varieties reach from the cottage to the palace . To edifices intended for purposes of devotion ? They extend from the monastic cell to the gorgeous minaret , and the wonders of St. Peter 's . To places of military defence ? They embrace equally the rude stockade and the finished citadel . In naval architecture it is the source of every thing that floats in the form of a vessel . Nor is a twentieth part of its sphere , as relates to variety , yet unfolded . It includes sculpture , carving , modeling , engraving , type-making , and designing . All household furniture , whether useful , or ornamental , belongs to its products . So do jewelry , cutlery , philosophical and astronomical instruments , printing-presses , the entire enginery of war , and all the implements and machinery of agriculture and the arts . In fine , it is the source , directly or indirectly , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the artisan . The duty then of obeying the impulses of Constructiveness will not be questioned . Nor is the pleasure arising from the pursuits it prompts so inferior to the benefits they bestow on our race . Ask the distinguished mechanician or artist , and he will tell you that he delights in his occupation ; that he leaves it with reluctance and returns to it with avidity ; and that the hours he devotes to it are among the happiest of his life . Nor can the case be otherwise . While employed in a favorite pursuit , he is indulging his taste and following . one of the mastercurrents of his nature ; and that is always a fountain of delight . Hence , in this element of Epicurism , pleasure and duty are indissolubly associated . The exercise of Acquisitiveness is , in like manner , commendable and necessary . To accumulate property , by laudable measures , is a moral duty which ought not to he neglected ; at least a moral result may be deduced from it . Wealth may be rendered subservient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little to the power of doing good on an extensive scale . When properly applied , it is the means of intellectual cultivation and refinement , elegant hospitality , and all the higher embellishments ef life . It moreover prompts to acts of public spiritedness , which would not otherwise be thought of , and is itself the chiefresource for accomplishing them , and supplies the hand of benevolence , when engaged in the work of , charity . In fact , when duly administered , it becomes one of the most powerful instruments of good that man can employ . It may be made to operate on indigence and distress , like the descending dew on the drobping flower , or the balm-shaded fountain on the pilgrim of the desert . The clamorous invectives. which we hear occasionally uttered against it , are but the rant of enthusiasts , or the cant of hypocrites . In their noise and emptiness they resemble the roar of the liberated steam , when the safety-valve is raised , which offends the ear , but moves not the machinery , because it wastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ever pronounced them ; nor was any sensible man ever moved by them ; except to hold them in derision . To speak of the pleasure of acquiring riches might be deemed superfluous . It is known to all who observe or think . The miserly enjoy it from their love of gain , the benevolent from the happiness which wealth enables them to diffuse around them , and every one from the independence and comfort it bestows . In the exercise of Acquisitiveness , then , pleasure and duty are inseparably connected . Thus do all the animal faculties , when properly employed , minister alike to virtue and happiness ; and such , as relates to them , was the doctrine of Epicurus . He did not , therefore , inculcate their licentious gratification . Let us pass to an examination of the moral sentiments , and ascertain their bearing in reference to the same end . That the regulated indulgence of Self-esteem , constituting laudable pride , is a source of gratification can not be doubted . Both the nature of the sentiment and the name bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no small degree useful , from the dignity of deportment and character it confers , and the strict avoidance of meanness it enjoins . It is one of the best preventives of low associations and groveling vice . The man who is correctly proud , can not mingle in coarse riot or degrading revelry ; nor can he , in any way , sink to the level of vulgarity . He observes decorum even in his faults . Due obedience , then , to the promptings of this instinct is both a duty and a source of pleasure . Of the Love of Approbation the same is true . The indulgence of it is peculiarly gratifying ; and , although , by a wrong direction it sometimes renders the possessor of it an object of ridicule , and at other times of detestation , it often urges him to great actions , and thus ministers to good . According to its modification and the objects on which it is fixed , it is the dandy 's personal vanity , or the hero 's love of fame . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that true ambition is but the love of approbation properly directed and restrained . It is what has been called , by a modern writer , " the infirmity ofgreat minds ; " and , by a distinguished Roman , " vitium pro *imum virtuti . " But , in the abstract , both authors are wrong . Unless when carried to excess , it is neither an infirmity nor a vice . If not itself a virtue , it is the source , as already mentioned , of many high and virtuuus achievements . It is one of the chief springs of action in every powerful and cultivated mind . Without it , human efforts to do good on an extensive scale , and rise to glory by incessant and arduous labors to that effect , would be abandoned . Thus would the improvement of the world be not only retarded , but stopped and rendered hopeless . I ought rather to say , it would never have had an existence . Every one acknowledges that the love of glory is the chief incentive of the hero to dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it of the scholar and the philosopher in their toils . It glows in their bosoms with intenseness and perpetuity , and is as steady in its impulse as the cynosure in its station . Nor can aught extinguish it but the damps of the grave . It forms also the day dreams of the neglected poet , and weaves delightful visions for his pillow ; and , thus encouraged , he surrenders up his life in his devotion to the Muses , that his name may survive in posthumous remembrance . Let any truly illustrious man , whether living or dead , be named to me , and I will show that he was both ambitious and euthusiastic in the line of his greatness . In their own way , Cato and Brutus were as ambitious as Cresar ; and Cicero was much more so than Cataline . Rather than suffer his name to perish , Eratostratus set fire to the temple of Diana . So repulsive is forgetfulness to the love of distinction . Nor is the " Great Unknown " less ambitious now , than was Napoleon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Louis , or when he crossed the Vistula at the head of his legions . Am I asked whether Washington was ambitious ? 1 answer yes ; else he would never have become Washington . His love of fame was as strong and ardent as his love of virtue . His true glory consisted in giving it the right direction . Of Franklin , Hamilton , Jefferson , and Adams , the same is true . The love of distinction was one of their strongest motives to action , and public good was their end . Hence they became great . Away , then , with the denunciations we so often hear thundered forth against a " thirst for worldly honors , " as if it belonged to the catalogue of vices . There is in it much more of virtue than there is in the spirit and temper which calumniate it ; and to indulge in it is a mark of much more good sense . In its nature and tendency it is a source of good , and becomes faulty and reprehensible only when st runs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonest means are resorted to for its gratification . When not abused , but honorably exercised , it ex voi*. mis. 46 // cites to vigorous action all the powers of the intellect , to erect a monument of personal renown , on the basis of public good , and thus contributes to the glory of nations ; for that is composed of the glory of individuals . In a word , fame , resulting from high and praiseworthy achievement is its legitimate object , and , without it , would be neither attained nor sought for . Hence , when man yields obedience to it , well directed and under due restraint , he not only consults his pleasure , but strengthens bis intellect , brightens his virtues , and augments his usefulness , and is so far a true disciple of Epicurus . In proving that the exercise of the sentiment of Benevolence is both a pleasure and a duty , there is no difficulty . Even those who delight in railing at human nature , as a symbol of depravity , will concur with me in this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When engaged in the full and regulated indulgence of it , man appears in his most attractive capacity . He is then a philanthropist , and need not covet higher fame . Howard will be remembered , and his name will float on the breath of praise , when many who have worn the purple will he forgotten , or " will live only in memory 's curse . " This , Howard knew , and was doubtless influenced by it . He was not all benevolence . That , indeed , was his ruling passion . But , formed on the model of humanity , he felt , like other men , the desire of f me , and was urged by it to deeds of philanthropy which he would have otherwise declined . Visions of glory brightened his course and strewed it with flowers . The same is true even of the adventurer in Africa , bent on tracing the course of the Niger . One of his objects is to benefit his race ; and thus far he is a philanthropist : another , to confer honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patriot : but a third is to acquire fame ; and he is still , even in this , a legitimate son of human nature , and entitled to praise . He follows , in each , a laudable instinct ; and , therefore , his toils are trebly gratifying to him . The end of Benevolence is not alone to give alms and relieve actual distress . That interpretation would narrow it . It is to dispense happiness of every description , on a scale as extensive as possible , from motives of kindness and good will to man . The person who gives to his fellow-men the result of his intellectual labors , with a view to enlighten and assist them on points in which their interests and welfare are concerned , is as much of a philanthropist in feeling , and far more in fact , than he who only distributes his income in charity . The latter but relieves existing distress ; the former prevents it , and perpetuates comfort . The one manifests benevolence alone the other , benevolence and wisdom united . I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cause of distress , is a much more efficient and valuable philanthropist , than he who merely mitigates the evil when he finds it . The hero who only drags one tyrant from his throne to make room for another , is a less effective patriot , than he who revolutionizes the government , and gives freedom to the people .. But whatever may be the form which benevolence assumes , or the direction it takes , its exercise is always gratifying and virtuous . It is one of the choicest ingredients that mingles in the cup of human pleasure . On the appetite of those in whom it is a leading instinct , it never paIls . To all such , the gratification arising from a benevolent action is the richest reward for toil encountered , or danger incurred . As far as it is concerned , they are led to " follow virtue , even for virtue 's sake . " Hence the practice of benevolence is an important element in the composition of epicurism , and was enjoined in the precepts , and exemplified in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another sentiment whose indulgence all will acknowledge to he a duty . Nor will they question the pure and elevated gratification by which it is accompanied . The sentiment consists in a profound and reverential regard for beings that are exalted and beneficent , and things that are deemed sacred . Its exercises are various , and all of them are praiseworthy and delightful , although in different degrees . In its loftiest aim and greatest purity , its object is the Deity ; and it is then that it assumes most appropriately the name of Piety , and then only that it leads to adoration . In its relation to parents , and ancestors more remote , it is likewise called Piety , and is then , also , an intense feeling . When it points to men advanced in years , and distinguished by virtue , and to temples and tombs , and other monuments of the illustrious dead , cases in which it is less powerfully exercised , it takes the humbler name of Veneration . But it is always a solemn and delightful feeling , disposing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a higher condition of being . It is the sentiment which , in its nature , as well as in respect to its purest and loftiest object , best deserves the epithet holy . It savors least of earth , and is there fore a powerful preventive of // excess in any kind of animal indulgence . Those , in whom the instinct is strong , never become sensualists , unless under temptations peculiarly seductive . Yet , I repeat , that the sentiment belongs to the constitution of man ; and that , when he obeys its impulse , he follows his nature . Its indulgence is therefore as essential an ingredient in true Epicurism as that of the appetite in taking food and drink . Hope . This sentiment is in a high degree delightful , and no less important as a primitive faculty of the human mind . A well-regulated indulgence of it is therefore a duty ; because it is equally essential to individual happiness and efficiency , and to the public good . It is beautifully depicted in the following stanza , where , added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happily selected , as to render the sound an " echo to the sense . " " But thou , 0 ! Hope , with eyes so fair , What was thy delighted measure ? Still it whispered promised pleasure , And bade the lovely scenes at distance , Hail ! Still would her touch the strain prolong , And from the rocks , the woods , the vale , She called on Echo still through all her song ; And where her sweetest theme she mie , A soft responsive voice was heard at every close , And Hope enchanted , smiled , and waved her golden hair . " While Hope , taking no concern in the present or the past , dwells solely on the future , its object there is an amended condition of things . And for this , at some period that is approaching , the sentiment not only longs , but anticipates its attainment . The time may be distant ; hut no matter . It is coming , accomp anied by the looked-for boon of fortune . Hope , therefore , instinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is exhilerating and bright . The dark side of every picture , being repulsive to it , is never dwelt on . Its view is forward , and is fixed irrevocably on promised good . Present adversity can neither subdue nor discourage it . Better times are advancing . From amidst the rigors and desolation of winter , it looks to the bloom and balminess of spring . Is it cloudy and cheerless today ? it will be sunny and charming tomorrow . Does the storm rage destructively at night ? it will be hushed by morning to the innocent zephyr . Even in sorrow and suffering , difficulty and danger , hope clings to her anchor , and tastes , in anticipation , prosperity and joy . In whatever desert she may be compelled to roam , whether physical or moral , no matter how dreary and disheartening the surrounding scenery , or how fearful the privations she is fated to endure , she dwells , in vision , on shady trees and fountains by the way , and a paradise awaiting her at some distance ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , it is to be succeeded by the notes of the nightingale and the lark , or the more fascinating voice of friendship and love . And when all that is earthly has promised but to disappoint , and excited confidence only to betray , she still moves onward with elastic step , gay mien , and unabated cheerfulness , and looks for *happiness beyond the gray Thus does she become " The Divinity that stirs within n 's , And intimates eternily to man . " But Hope is a practical as well as an inspiring sentiment , and ' operates to ( he production of extensive good . It sustains the spirit and energy of our race , encourages them in thei'r labors , and thus enables them to vanquish difficulties , and accomplish schemes of public usefulness , which , without its aid , would fail and be abandoned . It bears no inconsiderable part , therefore , in the execution of every great and arduous enterprise . No mountain was ever levelled or valley filled up without it . It contributed not a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the erection of the massiest piles of the Eternal City , and to ( he excavation of a highway through the granite of the Alps . It whispered success to Bruce and Alfred , Washington and Bolivar , and led them , through their conflicts and toils , to achieve independence for ( heir countries , and glory to themselves . It is also a star in the horizon of the scholar , ( he philosopher , and the poet , cheering them by its light , and encouraging them to perseverance in their midnight labors . In fine , it is a great source of moral sunshine , producing much not only of the mental leaf and blossom of spring , but also of the rich and salutary fruits of summer and autumn . Hence it is no less an element of true Epicurism , than a prop of virtue . To indulge in it , therefore , to a reason&amp;ble extent , is equally the dictate of pleasure and duty . // Thoughts on True Epicurism . Ideality , or a sense of beauty and sublimity , is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure and elevated , as creation can afford , or our nature receive . Like the fabled bird of the east , which bathes itself in moonbeams , banquets on the fragrance of flowers , and quenches its thirst in the spicy dew-drop , this faculty subsists chiefly on elegance and refinement . But for these its appetite is intense , and the gratification it derives from them , similar in degree . Nature and art unite in preparing and furnishing the store-house of its delights , and they place them abundantly in each department of it . As relates to matter of every description , whether living or dead , provided it be beautiful or magnificent , it ministers directly to the enjoyment of Ideality . In other words , that sentiment has the materiel of poetry for its object , and its range is as wide as the poetry of creation . When it looks into the heavens , by day or by night , it is enraptured with the beauty and glory of the scene . Are they lucid and serene ? Their bright blue arch , radiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stars , is a source of deligbt . Are they obscured by the thunder-cloud ? The majesty of the spectacle is scarcely less attractive . Nor must the beauties of the rainbow or of the morning and evening skies be passed unnoticed . Is the atmosphere agitated by the zephyrs of spring ? The mildness of the air , united to the gentleness of gs motion , is pleasing . is it convulsed by the whirlwind , or rent by the tempest ? The pleasures of the awful and sublime are enjoyed . Does Ideality turn from the heavens to contemplate the ocean , reposing in a calm , or in conflict with the hurricane ? In either case , the impressions are deep and delightful . Is the solid earth the object of contemplation ? the precipice and the mountain , the gloomy forest and the boundless prairie , vie with each other in ministering to pleasure . Nor do the various bodies of fresh water , from the fountain to the lake , and from the crystal nIl to the mighty river , withhold their tribute to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year are rich in gratification as various as themselves . So is the kingdom of animated nature , including the human race as a portion of it . It is from the poetry of man that the sentiment derives its highest enjoyment . It is from that source , also , that the finest illustrations of it may be drawn . But before citing any of these , it is necessary to make a few further remarks on the character of the faculty . Ideality , as already intimated , is peculiarly the instinct of the poet . I have called it the sentiment of beauty and sublimity ; and it is so . Its native appetency is for objects and scenes in which those qualities predominate . Hence it leads the votary of the Muses to shady walks , deep and tangled forests , perfumed gardens , and flowery lawns , or seats him on an ocean-cliff , to meditate in solitude , listen to the tempest , and emujoy the strife of the elements ; or it conveys him to the wreck of a former world , conceals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him " on high , above the storm 's career , " and bids him gaze on mountain grandour . It does for him yet more . When no such scenes are accessible , it creates them , by transferring the beauty and sublimity of other objects to those that do not possess them . And , in every instance , it heightens the beautiful and sublime where they exist . Subsisting only on the charms of nature and art , it thus transfers them from place to place , when wanting , and adds to them , where they already prevail , all that is requisite to render them perfect . To prove that ideality thus subserves the purposes and pleasures of the poet , innumerable passages in the productions of the Muse might be referred to . Milton , Pope , and Byron abound in them . But , in that respect , the writings of Shakspeare are unrivaled . They derive much of their witchery from the sentiment I am considering , which enabled their author to create , beyond any other writer , a world of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I remember no portion of poetry superior to some parts of the scene between Hamlet and his mother . The contrast , drawn between the Queen 's first and second husbands , is perhaps unequaled , in vividness and intensity , by any production of the English muse . Unable to find an earthly model sufficiently glorious to figure forth the image of his father , the impassioned prince snatches portions of the finest forms and attributes from several of the celestial inhabitants , and unites them with the skill of a Phidias or a Praxiteles . Still dissatisfied with the beau ideal he had thus composed , he invests it , at a single dash , with all the perfections that heaven had iu* store . " Look here , upon this picture , and on this ; The counterfeit presentment of two brothers . See , what a grace was seated on this brow ; ilypenion 's curls , the front of Jove himself ; An eye like Mars , to threaten and command 4 statiomi like the herald Mercury , // 365 New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every god did seem to set his seal , To give the world assurance of a man . This was your husband-Look you now what follows ; This is your husband , like a mill-dewed ear Blasting his wholesome brother . Have you eyes ? Could you on this fair mountain , leave to feed , And batten on this moor ? - Sense , sure , you have , Else you could not have motion ; but sure that sense Is apoplexed , for madness would not err ; Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thralled , But it reserved some quantity of choice To serve in such a differenceEyes without feeling , feeling without sight , Ears without bands or eyes , smelling sans all , Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope . " But having already too far protracted my remarks on this delightful faculty , I must leave it , and pass on to others ; not , however , without first observing , that the exercise of it contributes as directly to virtue and usefulness as to pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgence consists ? I answer , in purifying and strengthening the mind , refining the taste , cherishing a love of creation and its AUTHOR , and lifting the thoughts far above all that is groveling and sensual . To pass immediately from its pleasures to those of the mere animal , would be a descent as extraordinary and degrading , as Hamlet 's mother made , in transfering her passion from his father to his uncle . The exercise of the instinct , therefore , is as much a duty , as a source of gratification . Hence it is justly claimed by Epicurism . On the exercise of Conscientiousness , or a sense of justice , I need say hut little . No one will deny that it is a duty , or question the pleasure of which it is productive . Its dictate is to deal justly , and prevent or suppress wrong , and its high reward , the approbation of conscience . The latter constitutes a degree of happiness beyond all price . It is a consciousness of applause , unutterable in words , for correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the poet calls the " God within the mind . " It was this that rendered Aristides happier in his exile , than any of those who had procured his banishment ; and gave to Cato an exile in Utica , a mental serenity which was denied to Cnsar , though master of the world . This faculty is , or ought to be , the foundation of law . Its due exercise is the cause of immeasurable good , by maintaining the harmony of society , and preventing the powerful and rapacious from invading the rights , and doing violence to the persons and possessions of the feeble . Indeed , no small share of the pleasure accompanying it arises from a consciousness of the benefits conferred and the happiness produced by it . The remembrance , moreover , of having always endeavored to act justly , never fluctuates in its effect , but constitutes an unfailing fountain of pleasure . No reverse of fortune , or other change of circumstances , can poison or embitter its waters , or dry them up . Under the deepest adversity they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broken spirits like dew on the grass , when the clouds deny their rain . The exercise of this faculty , then , results alike in pleasure enjoyed and duty performed . Firmness , whose function is perseverance and fortitude , is another sentiment of peculiar value . In scenes of difficulty and suffering , it is the anchor of the mind , and fortifies even hope . Nothing great could be achieved by man without it ; hecause nothing of the kind can be done easily , or by a single act . The accomplishment of every arduous undertaking , is the result of inflexible resolution , and persevering action . And firmness , as already mentioned , ministers to both . No great reformation , or salutary revolution in state , church , or science , has ever been affected without its aid . Nor have tyranny and oppression ever been successfully resisted without it . Let its influence be extinguished , or for a time suspended , and confidence will be destroyed , all human affairs deranged , and civil society will fall to pieces under perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that its exercise is a duty . Nor is it less certainly a source of pleas-ore . Itis a principle in the constitution of human nature , that the gratification of every instinct is pleasurable . The man who possesses that of firmness , therefore , is gratified in the exercise of it , on a proper occasion , precisely as a benevolent man is delighted by the performance of a kind action . Each is obeying the impulse of a natural feeling , which , by a law of his being , is as necessarily pleasing to him , as the fracture of a bone , or the laceration of his // flesh would be painful . Nor is this all . The well-timed and well-regulated exercise of firmness , constitute a source of gratifying reflection . Something useful has been performed , or something hurtful prevented , the remembrance of which is a ground of delight , merely on account of the good effected . The individual , moreover , whose firmness has been manifested , receives , as a further reward , the applause and admiration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be insensible . This affords him additional pleasure . It is evident , therefore , that the opportune and well-directed exercise of this sentiment , is at once a duty , and a cause of gratification . Thus does it appear , from such analysis of the subject as circumstances have permitted me to give , that the temperate indulgence of all the animal propensities and moral sentiments is virtuous and pleasurable , and yet constitutes a portion of real Epicurism . I shall now endeavor to show that the same is true of the intellectual faculties . On these , my remarks must necessarily be brief . Nor is it requisite , that they should be otherwise . My views of the nature , exercise , and end of them can be succinctly exhibited . The object of all the intellectual faculties , is the attainment of knowledge , each one acting on that subject only , which is suited to his character ; and to each , for reasons already mentioned , such action is always pleasing ; in some cases , delightful . An intellectual faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral one . I mean that it is an original attribute of human nature , possessing a peculiar appetency or desire ; and the gratification of that desire affords pleasure . It is also laudable , because it leads to the attainment of knowledge , a result which duty calls for , and which it is culpable to neglect . The design of the intellectual faculties collectively , is to give man a correct acquaintance with the external world , which consists of objects and their relations ; and such is the perfection of the scheme of nature , that he has a faculty accommodated to every thing which it is useful for him to know . Thus is the harmony between him , and all that is around him , complete . Individuality , as the term imports , has , for its ends , objects and events , in their individual capacity . It gives a propensity to inquire after these ; and , by its exercise , an acquaintance with them is formed , and thus it is gratified . Some persons possess it in a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they exert it with greater effect , and derive from it greater pleasure . Through the exercise of the faculty of Form , we acquire a knowledge of the figures of things . This is not only indispensable to us , to qualify us for our situation , and enable us to do our duty ; it is a1so a source of peculiar gratification . Few things afford us more pleasure than the fine figures of men and women , animals and plants , and their representations in statuary , modeling , carving , painting , and engraving . Some persons seem to live only in such enjoyment . The form of the rainbow , and the figures , real or fancied , which , we perceive in clouds , are also delightful to us . Add the gratification derived from architecture , and all kinds of monumental and fancy forms and structures , and the amount will be great . I shall pass over the faculties of Size and Weight , with the single remark , that the knowledge attained by them is essential to us , and ought not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other kind of natural excitement , is pleasing . It is by means of the faculty of Weight , which , in reference to the point I have now in view , may be denominated the sense of gravztateon , that we are enabled to maintain ourselves in an erect position , and to perform every action that is any way connected with balancing . Without it we could neither stand , walk , nor ride . A high degree of it is requisite to make dextrous equestrians , tumblers , and rope-dancers . The faculty of Color , like that of Form , is peculiarly important , and a source of great enjoyment . Both nature and art contribute to its gratification . The heavens , with their blue and gold , are rich in delights for it . So are the deeper cerulean of the ocean , and the many-colored glories of the rainbow , as well as of the morning and evening skies . So are the lustre of the diamond , and the multiplied tints of the ruby , the emerald , the topaz , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful shades of color and their mixtures , presented by vegetables and animals , the same is true . They constitute an inexhaustible source of delight . The arts of painting , dying , enameling , and gilding , are also rich in pleasures of the same description , in speaking of the objects peculiarly gratifying to this faculty , I might well be deemed wanting , not only in gallantry and taste , but also in justice , were I to pass unnoticed the female com // 367 plexion , that inimitable mixture of nature 's finest tints , the rose , the ruby , and the lily . To this must be added the sapphire or jet of the eye , the ebony of the brows and hair , or the auburn or amber hue of the latter . Locality , or the faculty of Place . The taste of this faculty is for topography , geography , landscape scenery , and all that concerns the composition of place . The exercise of it , in acquiring a knowledge of these points , is highly gratifying . The inordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , visiting foreign countries , reading books of travels , and embarking in voyages of discovery , arises from the unusual strength of it , and the delight experienced in the indulgence of it . The knowledge sought for and acquired by the exercise of this faculty does not embrace particular spots or tracts of country in an insulated capacity alone , but in their connexion with other places , and their various relations to them . It is highly useful , therefore , to surveyors , engineers , commanders of armies , and all who attempt to give descriptions of territory , or to attain an accurate knowledge of it for practical purposes . It is essential that the faculty be strong and active in great astronomers , and all who excel in landscape painting . The taste of the faculty of Order is for neatness , accuracy , and method . Respecting these it is peculiarly sensitive . It has a quick and delicate perception of them , and derives much gratification from witnessing them . Slovenliness , and all sorts of negligence and confusion are offensive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . I need scarcely add , that its due cultivation and exercise are as useful as they are pleasing . Method in the disposition of time and the transaction of affairs , and neatness and accuracy in every thing , if they do not actually produce good , at least prevent much mischief . To neglect them , therefore , is to violate duty . Time . The function of this faculty is a lively and accurate perception of the lapse of time . It gives a memory for dates , and measures passing time with correctness and precision . Hence it is concerned in the study of chronology and music ; the latter science embracing time as well as tune . Much of the enjoyment of music depends on it . The exercise of it is therefore pleasant . The knowledge of chronology is important , and it is therefore useful . Number . The function of this faculty , appears from its name . It gives the power and love of calculation . Without it such attributes would have no existence . Those who possess it , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the use of them . It is essential to the mathematician , the astronomer , and the man of business . But to dilate on ita importance is needless . The world is familiar with it . In some way almost every process requires its aid . Without it man would be defective , and even the common affairs of life could not be transacted . To cultivate it , therefore , is equally a duty and a source of pleasure . Tune . The name of this faculty also indicates its function and use . Its taste and the capacity it confers are for music . The delight arising from the cultivation and influence of it is much more intense than that afforded by any other intellectual faculty . Nor is its importance inferior to the pleasure it produces . Poets have celebrated it in more rapturous strains than any other art . Because it is a kindred art to their own , and instrumental in elevating it and increasing its effects ; perhaps their praises are extravagant . But , in sober truth , the power and influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the affections and controls the actions of individual men , but of men in masses , inflaming , softening , and moulding them at pleasure . Battles , on which hung the fate of empires , have been lost *nd won through its agency ; and it is capable of imprinting itself on the character of nations . It was a knowledge of this latter fact that induced a profound judge of human nature to say , " Let me make the popular songs of a country , and I care not who makes its laws . " Popular eloquence excepted , nothing sways the feelings like music . It can not only awaken a single passion , and make it for a time the predominant spring of action , but by exciting , in quick succession , several strong passions , such as love , pity , grief , hatred , rage , and revenge , it can form a mental whirlwind , and madden the individual . Of this truth Alexander 's Feast , by Dryden , is an exemplification , as natural and impressive , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infuriated monarch and his followers , that the scene can scarcely be considered a fiction . On all public occasions where music is introduced , its character is suited to the end in view , and , by preparing the minds of the multitude for action , facilitates its attainment . Is the object of the meeting religious worship ? The // Thoughts on True Epicurism. influence of solemn music in suppressing levity of thought and conduct , assimilating the tone of the affections to itself ; raising the mind to the contemplation of heavenly things , and attuning it to adoration , is stronger than any language of mine can express . Is the meeting called to attend the funeral solemnities at the sepulture of a great benefactor , or to testify tt the existence of public grief for any other calamity ? The mournful elegy issues from the choir , and the softened multitude are melted into tears . Is the occasion warlike ? The throng is fired by martial airs . Is it festive ? The music , sprightly and enlivening , is suited to it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dancing , and merriment prevail . But the impression of these public pageants , however deep and engrossing at the time , is transient and comparatively unproductive . It is in private life , domestic and social , that music produces its greatest effect . Itis there that it takes a firm hold of the feelings , and moulds the character into a permanent shape . It is by the domestic fire-side , or in the social circle , where it is daily heard , that it modifies the nature of man , and , according to its spirit and tendency , cultivates in him a mild and peaceful , or a fierce and warlike disposition . Considering the power of this fascinating art , we can not be surprised , that , in the age of Grecian fable , its invention was attributed to the most accomplished of the gods ; nor that it was represented to have moved rocks and woods , and so far propitiated even " Infernal Natures , " as to have " half-redeemed the lost Eurydice . " Stronger still ; leaving the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , we can scarcely withhold our assent from the sentiment of a modern poet , when he exclaims , Music the fiercest griefs can charm , And fate 's severest rage disarm ; Music can soften pain to ease , And make despair and madness please ; Our joys helow it can improve , And antedate the bliss above ; " nor fro , n that of another poet to the following effect ; " Music exalts each joy , allays each grief , Expels diseases , softens every pain , Subdues the rage of poison and the plague ; And hence the wise of ancient days adored One power of physic , melody , and song . " Finally , the pure delights and ameliorating influence of music afford the best reason that can be assigned for considering it a part of the practice and enjoyment of the inhabitants of heaven . In cultivating it , therefore , to a reasonable extent , man consults his pleasure and performs his duty , and is so far a true Epicurean . Language . The function of this faculty is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , need be said in illustration and proof of either its great importance , or the gratification attending the exercise of it . Speech , written and oral , is the powerftil instrument under the control of man , for good or evil , according to its application . It may be addressed to every faculty of the intellect , and made the means of governing the whole of them . It is the true medium for conveying , diffusing , and perpetuating all knowledge , and of developing much . Even the knowledge of itself is thus alone rendered general and permanent . Empires and religions have risen and fallen by its influence . We have recently seen a monarch ejected from his throne by it , as a bubble is tossed on the bosom of the deep . For , by spreading through France a correct knowledge of freedom and right , and awakening in7the people corresponding feelings , it prepared the way for the late revolution . It is , moreover , the chief means of education , as relates to intellectual and moral improvement . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nullities . But to refer to all its uses would be to write volunies . It is one of the principal ties that hold human society together , as well as a means of supplying it with most of its comforts , and giving it power . Nor are the pleasures of speech inferior to its usefulness . Being the chief medium of intercourse between mind and mind , the charms of social life are principally derived from it . So are the delights of vocal music , as far as they depend on a distinct expression of sentiment and thought . Of those of  |p6etry  and eloquence , as already intimated , the same is true . Add to these the gratification arising from the knowledge and study of language , which to many persons is intense , and the amount will be great . From the mere knowing or perceptive faculties , I proceed to speak of those of relation . // Of these the first is Comparison , whose function is highly important , and the pleasure arising from it , conformable in degree . Its concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it does not compare objects and their qualities with other objects and qualities , so much as objects with relations , or one relation with another , detecting their various similitudes and contrasts . Hence it is the faculty of analogy , which is indispensable as a source of illustration and metaphor . Allegories , parables , and fables , are its products . So is all figurative language , together with every form of expression , founded on the comparison of relations . In poetry , oratory , and polite literature generally , its use is extensive , and it contributes greatly to their richness and beauty . A few examples may render my meaning more obvious . This faculty is the source of such phraseology as the following . " Virgin snow ; * the analogy being between virgin purity and that of new-fallen snow . " The ermine of justice ; " expressive of the spotlessness of justice . The warrior of the " lion-heart ; " a warrior as bold as a lion . A beautiful young lady is called a " being or essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lustre , and refinement . A foul , unsightly , and malignant wretch is denounced as a " toad , a " spider , " or a " scorpion , " from his repulsive aspect and envenomed disposition . I have said that this faculty may be employed with fine effect in popular oratory . Lord Chatham gave a beautiful illustration of this , when , in the British House of Peers , he invoked the bishops , by " the purity of their lawn , " and the occupant of the woolsack , by " the spotlessness of his ermine , " to frown on certain sentiments , which he sternly denou'uced as " inhuman and unchristian . " Nor was Patrick Henry less happy in the exercise of the same faculty , in one of his speeches against the adoption of the Federal Constitution . Being asked , by an opponent , whether he had deliberately examined the " features of the constitution , " his reply was , " I have , and discovered in it an awful squinting toward monarchy . " I have remarked that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps the writings of Moore furnish fine examples , in proof of this , in greater abundance than any others in the English language . There is no difficulty in finding them in any of the productions of that author 's pen . Let a volume of his poetic works be opened , and they present themselves on every page . The only difficulty to be encountered consists in making a particular selection from clustering specimens which are all select . The following two or three are quoted from memory " As abeam o'er the face of the waters may glow , While the tide runs in darkness and coldness below - So the cheek may be tinged with a warm sunny smile , Though the cold heart to ruin runs darkly the while . " 0 this thought in the midst of enjoyment will stay , Like a dead leafless branch in the summer 's bright ray The beams of the warm sun play round it in vain ; It may smile in his light , but it blooms not again . " " Oh breathe not his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and unhonored , his relics are laid ; Sad , silent , and dark , be the tears that we shed , As the night-de*v that falls on the grass o'er his head . " But the night-dew that falls , though in silence it weeps , Shall brighten with verdure the grave where he sleeps ; And the tear that we shed , though in secret it rolls , Shall long keep his memory gceen in our souls . " " Let Fate do her worst , there are relics of joy , Bci*ht beams of the past , which she can not destroy ; And they come in the night-time of sorrow and care , To bring back the features that joy used to wear . " Long , long be my heart with such memories filled ! Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled ; You may break , you may ruin the rose , if you will , But the scent of the roses will hang round it still . " I shall only add that the matter and language of this faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constitute the ornament of some of their finest passages . Causality . It is especially the possession and exercise of this that entitle us to the name of rational beings . Its function is to perceive the relation of cause and effect . It is therefore the chief faculty concerned in the process of reasoning , and is essential in all philosophical pursuits . It is also principally operative in // Thoughts on True Epicurism. the process of generalization and abstraction . It travels with the same faculty , either up or down the chain of causation , tracing causes from their effects , and effects from their causes . It is therefore a mirror of both the past and the future , giving history in the former case , and prophecy in the latter . Its range is wide and diversified , including , in particular , natural philosophy in its several departments , the higher branches of mathematics and astronomy , political economy , metaphysics , and the philosophy of natural history . Its most sublime and delightful effort is to ascend the chain of causation to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nature 's God . " That to cultivate it is a duty , and , at the same time , a source of pleasure , will not be denied . Its exercise , therefore , belongs to Epicurism . Wit . This faculty has been defined a vivid perception and ready command of certain remote analogies and contrasts , which , when exhibited , produce pleasure and gaiety . Although this definition is not correct to the letter , it is sufficiently so in substance for my present purpose . The product of wit , like every thing else that is brilliant and beautiful , excites the mind and invigoratesit in action . it gives a zest to conversation , point and lustre to poetry , and a cutting keenness to public debate . It is a powerful weapon in the hand of the satirist , and often scourges and withers vice and error , which argument and persuasion would assail in vain . Its usefulness can not be doubted . In the true epicurism of the table it is a chief ingredient . The last faculty to be noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a large amount of our pleasures and benefits . It is , if trot the source , an essential auxiliary of all the fine arts , including painting , statuary , carving , engraving , modeling , and all the ornamental parts of architecture ; for every thing beautiful , as well as all that is useful , is hut an imitation of nature . Even oratory , poetry , and music , being improved by a conformity to existing models , are deeply indebted to it . To a certain extent , education itself , especially in its refinements and polish , is the result of imitation : add scenic representations , which are the product of the same faculty , and its range , as a source of pleasure and advantage , is shown to be extensive . Fexv of our powers contribute more to our comfort , and to elevate civil over savage life . Besides the gratification it affords , therefore , its cultivation and exercise constitute a duty not to be dispensed with . Such are the chief elements which enter into the composition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recommended the whole of them . If he did not do it in detail , he did it in principle . He was , as heretofore stated , a great moral teacher , whose scheme of improvement derived an ascendency over the schemes of his contemporaries and others , from its possessing a stricter conformity to the constitutional laws of human nature . His sagacity , as well as his feelings , taught him that man could not , by measures offensive to all his native instincts , or in direct opposition to them , be induced to become either enlightened or virtuous . He knew that as soon shall the stream run upward by the power of gravitation . And this is a lesson , all-hnportant in moral education , which too many modern teachers have yet to learn . Their practice liroves them ignorant of the simple truth , which the occurrences of every day ' demonstrate , that nothing is willingly and cordially embraced by man , unless it be lovely and attractive . To this , neither morality nor religion constitutes an exception . Render them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ,  --  in other words , put them out of harmony with his nature , and , disregarding if not actually disliking them ,  --  he will attach himself to something more agreeable , as certainly , and as much in obedience to a law of creation , as the needle points to the pole , or the planets gravitate toward the sun . Man was made to be led , not driven ; and he carl be led only by what is pleasing to him . lie rebels against compulsion , by an instinct of his nature ; and , by another instinct equally strong , shuns what is disagreeable to him . If he is to occupy a place in the Elysiumn of virtue , and be satisfied with it be must be drawn to it by silken cords , and retained there by the delights of the place . Compel him to enter it by force or fear , and let him find it bleak or barren , or in any way repulsive , and he will escape from it . But let me not be misunderstood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Calypso 's island . Neither are voyagers seduced into it by the songs of Sirens , or the allurements of wantons , nor retained there by sensual indulgences . They are directed to it by the light of wisdom , and enticed by their moral instincts ; and the gratification chiefly of the same faculties induces them to remain . True , their animal instincts are not neglected ; nor ought they to be . But , occupying an inferior station , they are kept in due subordination to the higher , and rendered // subservient to them . If fruits of the garden are delicious , they are gratified by them ; if the breeze is balmy , they enjoy it ; if the walks are shady and the woodland scenery beautiful , they admire them , and often resort to them for amusement and pleasure ; if the groves are musical , from the songs of birds , they are delighted with them ; and they enjoy the fresh turf and the grassy lawn impearled by dew-drops and silvered by moon-beams , as well as the azure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor are they insensible to the pleasures of love , friendship , and social intercourse . But these things are so enjoyed as not to be abused . The sweets are neither by misuse converted into bitterness , nor the salutary cup into poison . They are each of them so employed as to minister to health and true enjoyment , and , above all , to strengthen and improve the mind , and foster in it sentiments of gratitude and piety towards HIM who gave them . Such , I say , are the motives which lead man into the paths of virtue , and tile pleasures which must hold him there . None else are suited to the purpose . He was not made to thread his way through briers and thorns , if , by turning to the right or left , he can move at ease amidst clustering roses and bowers of jasmine . Nor will aught but compulsion , folly , or madness , induce him to do so . Neither will any thing short of such causes make him turn from the linnet or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop these figures , and conclude with a few inductions expressed in sober language . According to the general tenor of the preceding remarks , true Epicurism coneists in the enjoyment of pleasure , under the sanction of a sense of duty . This is real happiness ; for , apart from a consciousness of duty performed , that state has no existence . The more permanent and valuable portion of it arises from the possession of knowledge , and the regulated indulgence of the moral instinctsThat man 's business on earth is to seek happiness , as here defined , will , I think , not be denied by any one , who has a just conception of the fitness of things , or of the benevolence of the Deity . The great question then is , how is he to attain it ? To this the answer is plain , provided the views contended for , in this paper , are correct . lie can be happy only by following the desires of his nature duly disciplined , and under salutary restraint . I mean , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his entire nature , always giving to his higher instincts the ascendency they deserve , and never gratifying the lower in opposition to their dictates . Thus schooled and regulated , his wishes will be always in accord with virtue . In conforming to them , therefore , in his conduct , his moral feelinbs will be gratified , without being tainted , his intellect strengthened by the requisite exercise on suitable subjects , and his enjoyment , being as varied as his faculties are numerous , will be abundant in its amount . Under a life thus governed , not only will harmony subsist between his animal , intellectual , and moral instincts ; those instincts will contribute directly to the gratification no less than the benefit of each other . Such will be the happy condition of the human mind , when the work of education shall be complete . A millennium will prevail in it . Like the lion and the lamb reposing under the shadow of the same bough , on which the eagle and the dove are perched in amity , resentment and benevolence will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all the other faculties will unite in the work . It is not true , then , as too many contend , that happiness can be attained , or duty performed , by either attempting to extinguish a single instinct we possess , or by obstinately refusing to obey its impulses . Let its desires be duly tempered , and suitable occasions of indulgence be selected , and its gratification has the sanction of Hue who bestowed it . If this be not true , human nature is a compound of contradictions ,  --  a riddle , which no existin , , intelligence can solve . But a position so irreverent toward the Deity is inadmissible . Human nature is neither enigmatical nor self-contradictory . It is as perfectly intelligible as any thing else . It is , moreover , in harmony with itself and all things around it , and no more rebelious against a single law of creation , than a tempest , or an earthquake , or any other physical event . Does any one doubt the possibility of man 's attaining , by education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ln such scepticism I may not concur . My view of the wise and beneficent dispensation , under which we live , forbids it . I can not believe in irremediable imnperfection in any of the products of the Auvnoa of creation . Such belief imputes imperfection to the C aATOR himself . Man , as already mentioned , is in harmony with himself and with all things around him . In other words , he is placed imm a situation adapted to hiM nature , and // The Dead Set . all his faculties are adapted to each other . The higher can be made to control the lower , and employ them in virtuous purposes , as duty requires . I say this ca be done , because in many instances it has been done . Inflexible resolution , with corresponding exertions to that effect , will never fail to accomplish the work . Man possesses , moreover , the precise number and kinds of faculties requisite to him . Give him one more , it will be superfluous ; take one from him , he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station will be marred . All this could be easily demonstrated , were there time for the analysis . Has he a faculty of any kind to be exercised , gratified , and improved ? These purposes it is in his power to obtain simultaneously . Is it adhesiveness ? there are objects around him , on which to exercise it ; and the exercise at once both gratifies and improves it . Is it benevolence , veneration , or conscientiousness ? of these the same is true . Is it form , tune , comparison , or causality ? here again , I have already shown , that sources of gratification and improvement are at hand . Of all his other faculties , the same may be affirmed . He has only to will their exercise and improvement , and the end is attained . By proper discipline , therefore , they may be reduced to the harmony of which I have spoken . Where then , I ask , is the imperfection of our race , beyond that of other existences ? and where its dislocation and unsuitableness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be found not in the realities of the creation of Heaven ; but in the fancies of mortals , who have created for themselves . Hence it appears , from his constitution and the laws which govern it , that man offers no exception to the scheme of optimism ; that he is virtuous and useful only when he seeks pleasure in conformity to the calls of his several instincts cultivated and balanced ; and that , therefore , in him , true Epicurism and a compliance with duty are the Lame.
