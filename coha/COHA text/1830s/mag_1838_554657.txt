txt THE subjects treated in this volume are the following ; the Moral Laws of Trade ; the Moral Law of Contracts the Uses of Labor , and a Passion for a Fortune ; the Moral // Limits of Accumulation ; the Natural and Artificial Relations of Society ; the Moral Evils , to which American Society is exposed ; Associations ; Social Ambition ; the Place which Education and Religion must have in the Improvement of Society ; War ; Political Morality ; and the Blessing of Freedom . A glance at this list shows the subjects to be out of the usual range of pulpit discussion . Adverting to this fact in his Preface , Mr. Dewey says " The question then is , What is the proper range of the pulpit ? What is the appropriate business of preaching ? The answer is plain ; To address the public mind on its moral and religious duties and dangers . But what are its duties and dangers , and where are they to be found ? Are they not to be found wherever men are acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to any one sphere of action , to the church or to the domestic circle , or to the range of the gross and sensual passions ? Are not men daily making shipwreck of their consciences in trade and politics ? And wheresoever conscience goes to work out its perilous problem , shall not the preacher follow it ? It is not very material , whether a man 's integrity forsakes him at the polls in an election , or at the board of merchandise , or at the house of rioting , or the gates whose way leadeth to destruction . Outwardly it may be different , but inwardly it is the same . In either case , the fall of the victim is the most deplorable of all things on earth ; and most fit , therefore , for the consideration of the pulpit . I must confess , I can not understand by what process of enlightened reasoning arid conscience , the preacher can come to the conclusion , that there are wide regions of moral action and peril around him , into which he may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society , Politics , are written over the threshold . " - pp. vi . vii . We heartily assent to the justness of these remarks . If preaching is to do any considerable good , it must be through a reference and application to the circumstances of condition , and the habits of thinking and feeling , of the minds which it addresses . Like other speech , it will make an impression in some degree proportioned to the attention and interest with which it is met ; and a speaker is sure of being heedfully listened to , who makes intelligent suggestions upon subjects , which they whom he addresses have to consider from day to day . If the business of preaching is to keep men from growing // worse , and help them to grow better , nothing can be more undeniably its proper sphere , - however different the view , which from any cause may have been taken of it , - than the consideration of those dangers and duties which specially concern those whom it undertakes to improve . Certainly , we would by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to peculiar circumstances of social relation , in which he understands his hearers to be placed ; or even rules of conduct , of any kind . His task is by no means so limited , nor is the inculcation of special rules so much as its chief office . But , with his expositions of the relation of the human being to the divine being , and to the eternal world , and his more general enforcements of the obligation of the principle and spirit of obedience , we confess , that we would have him blend largely his counsels , cautions , and encouragements , having reference to the particular wants of individual consciences . If you would help a man to be a good Christian , in short , show him what are the duties of that character in the particular place in society which he fills , and how , from any circumstances of that condition , he is e*xposed to the danger of becoming otherwise . Help him to some guidance in his daily perplexities ; some insight into his daily temptations ; some intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be a somewhat different thing from what it has been elsewhere ; and the American preacher should beware of keeping himself too closely to the foreign models of his art . Society , among us , is undoubtedly in some respects in an unsettled condition ; and , in many more , in an extremely novel one . One whole important department of virtuous or vicious action is here opened to every citizen , with which the mass of other communities have nothing to do . Every citizen here is , in a material sense , a public man ; needing , therefore , for his own and the common good , to be acquainted with the obligations of public virtue . In the different relations which a condition of political equality brings about , the duties of social intercourse take a new modification . And , though it might not he safe to trace the intenseness of the commercial spirit among us to any peculiarity of our institutions , yet , since that spirit , in that excited degree , is , from whatever cause , a marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for appropriate moral treatment . // We hold , therefore , that the American preacher is executing his office suitably , profitably , and honorably , when he finds a place in his public instructions , for such as relate to obligations and dangers especially belonging to the place and time . We would not , of course , have every preacher undertake such a task as that , which Mr. Dewey has so well performed . Questions of casuistry , of the kind of some which he has treated , demand a grasp of mind by no means possessed by every useful and respectable clergyman . A style of animadversion , which be has sometimes used , could only be borne out by much knowledge of mankind , skill and force in the methods of address , and acknowledged weight of character . And not a few of his speculations on the aspects of society , and the tendencies of opinions and institutions , are of a sort to be beyond the capacity of any , who , in addition to high mental endowments , had not enjoyed advantages for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , of what he has done could be done , or should be attempted , by many ministers of religion , who yet fill their place with credit and dignity . But it must be owned , that a religious congregation is greatly privileged , which may command the fruits of the meditation of a profound and original mind upon practical questions of such high interest , which only such a mind is competent to treat ; and Mr. Dewey has made the public his debtor by extending to them the benefit of his reflections in this volume . Mr. Dewey 's earlier works , particularly his previous volume of Sermons , and his account of a tour in Europe , under the title of " The Old World and the New , " are so well known to the American reading community , that it would be scarcely worth while , - even had we space for it , which we have not , - to go into any consideration of the excellences and defects of his genius and manner . It would , no doubt , be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a personal reference , under such forms of expression as " I persuade myself , " " I think , " " I deny , " which is perhaps altogether too frequent to be consistent with good taste ; and there is often a cumbrous , careless , and colloquial construction of sentences , which offends the cool reader , however , in the excitement of listening , it might pass unobserved . But it is ill complaining of such // peccadillos as these , when one sees a full and earnest mind pouring itself out in forms of utterance , which to itself are the most natural and true . Perhaps , even if we could correct them , we ought not to wish it ; for it may well be , that a man 's habits of thought and of expression shall so belong to each other , that , in altering what does not please us in the latter , we should part with that in the former , which we could hardly consent to lose . At all events , such blemishes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fervor and copiousness of thought , and , in the happiest passages , by a glow , beauty , and vigor of expression , which forbid them to impair the reader 's satisfaction , to any extent worth considering . The views which he presents , on subjects so various , and singly of such wide relations , it is to be supposed will be found , in different places , more or less striking and weighty . But this is apparent throughout , that he is speaking his own observations and convictions ; that he is uttering himself ; that , however he may have been indebted to books for excitements and illustrations , he owes to them none of his processes of inquiry , and none of his conclusions . Often his views , while they are novel , are sagacious and satisfactory his appeals are often strongly exciting . But this charm is never absent from what he writes , that it is evidently fresh from the author 's own mind . And , as to style , there is often a grace and gorgeousness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amends for the somewhat characteristic infelicities , to which we have referred . It would require an ethical treatise to follow Mr. Dewey in a discussion of the questions which he has so ably handled . We are free to say , that the first four discourses , relating to the objects and the rules of trade , are those from which we have derived the least satisfaction . In particular , we do not find the light , which we seek , shed upon the exceedingly critical question of the degree to which one of the parties in a contract of sale may honestly avail himself of the ignorance of the other . The principle , which lies at the basis of a solution of this problem is plain enough ; viz , that in a fair contract one party can not take an advantage which he does not understand that the other party expects him to take , if he can . But , when the conscience of one party is to dictate to him what view is taken by the other of the implied conditions of a bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xLvII. - No. ci . 60 // tudinarian construction of this principle . When , endeavouring to arrive at something more definite , Mr. Dewey maintains , that the market price of an article is to be taken for its just price , we fear that his scheme is liable to this objection among others , that , since the market price is itself the result of single bargains , it can not be made to serve for their rule and when , premising that " the case of general information and opinion which it is lawful to use , " is to " be separated from the case of particular knowledge , " he affirms , that a buyer or seller is bound to avow what he knows , but not what he believes , of the article in which he proposes to traffic , after all the ingenuity and extent of view with which Mr. Dewey has defended his theory , we remain at a loss for some principle by which a difference in the degree of conviction in the trafficker 's mind , respecting a material fact , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in concealing that conviction . Though a fast friend to our political institutions , Mr. Dewey uses no reserve in the castigation of what he conceives to be some of their unfortunate influences . In his " Discourse on the Moral Exposures of American Society , " having remarked , that " every man in this country is dependent for his position upon public opinion , " he proceeds in the following eloquent strain of expostulation against a demoralizing tendency of this state of things . " The greatest of all dangers here , as I conceive , is that of general pusillanimity , of moral cowardice , of losing a proper and manly independence of character . I think that I see something of this in our very manners , in the hesitation , the indirectness , the cautious and circuitous modes of speech , the eye asking assent before the tongue can finish its sentence . I think , that , in other countries , you oftener meet with men , who stand manfully and boldly up , and deliver their opinion without asking or caring what you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rough and harsh ; but , at any rate , it is independent . Observe , too , in how many relations , political , religious , and social , a man is liable to find bondage instead of freedom . If he wants office , he must attach himself to a party , and then his eyes must be sealed in blindness , and his lips in silence , towards all the faults of his party . He may have his eyes open , and he may see much to condemn , but he must say nothing . If he edits a newspaper , his choice is often between bondage and beggary . That may actually be the choice , // though he does not know it . He may be so complete a slave , that he does not feel the chain . I-us passions may be so enlisted in the cause of his party , as to blind his discrimination , and destroy all comprehension and capability of independence . So it may be with the religious partisan . He knows , perhaps , that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fanaticism and extravagance in some of its measures . See if you get him to speak of them . See if you can get him to breathe a whisper of doubt . No , he is always believing . He has a convenient phrase that covers up all difficulties in his creed . He believes it " for substance of doctrine . " Or , if he is a layman , perhaps he does not believe it at all . What , then , is his conclusion ? Why , he has friends who do believe it ; and he does not wish to offend them . And so he goes on , listening to what he does not believe ; outwardly acquiescing , inwardly remonstrating ; the slave of fear or fashion , never daring , not once in his life daring , to speak out and openly the thought that is in him . Nay , he sees men suffering under the weight of public reprobation , for the open espousal of the very opinions he holds , and he has never the generosity or manliness to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; by the course he pursues he is made to cast his stone , or he holds it in his hand , at least , and lets another arm apply the force necessary to cast it , at the very men , who are suffering a sort of martyrdomfor his oisn faith ! " I am not now advocating any particular opinions . I am only advocating a manly freedom in the expression of those opinions which a man does entertain . And if those opinions are unpopular , I hold , that , in this country , there is so much the more need of an open and independent expression of them . Look at the case most seriously , I beseech you . What is ever to correct the faults of society , if nobody lifts his voice against them ; if everybody goes on openly doing what everybody privately complains of ; if all shrink behind the fainthearted apology , that it would be over-bold in them to attempt any reform ? What is to rebuke political time-serving , religious fanaticism , or social folly , if no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it in a larger view . What barrier is there against the universal despotism of public opinion in this country , but individual freedom ? Who is to stand up against it here , but the possessor of that lofty independence ? There is no king , no sultan , no noble , no privileged class ; nobody else , to stand against it . If you yield this point , if you are for ever making compromises , if all men do this , if the entire policy of private life here , is to escape opposition and reproach , every thing will be swept beneath // the popular wave . There will he no individuality , no hardihood , no high and stern resolve , no self-subsistence , no fearless dignity , no glorious manhood of mind , left among us . The holy heritage of our fathers ' virtues will be trodden under foot by their unworthy children . They feared not to stand up against kings and nobles , and parliament and people . Better did they account it , that their lonely bark should sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when their sail swelled to the storm of winter , than to be slaves in palaces of ease . Sweeter to their ear was the music of the gale , that shrieked in their broken cordage , than the voice at home that said , " Submit , and you shall have rest . " And , when they reached this wild shore , and built their altar , and knelt upon the frozen snow and the flinty rock to *vorship , they built that altar to freedom , to individual freedom , to freedom of conscience and opinion ; and their noble prayer was , that their children might be thus free . Let their sons remember the prayer of their extremity , and the great bequest which their magnanimity has left us . Let them beware how they become entangled again in the yoke of bondage . Let the ministers at God 's altar , let the guardians of the press , let all sober and thinking men , speak the thought that is in them . It is better to speak honest error than to suppress conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames and burns out . But do I speak of danger ? I know of but one thing safe in the universe , and that is truth . And I know of but one way to truth for an individual mind , and that is , unfettered thought . And I know but one path for the multitude to truth , and that is , thought , freely expressed . Make of truth itself an altar of slavery , and guard it about with a mysterious shrine ; bind thought as a victim upon it ; and let the passions of the prejudiced multitude minister fuel ; and you sacrifice upon that accursed altar the hopes of the world ! * - pp. 164 - 167 . Mr. Dewey is a discriminating republican . I maintain , that our democratic principle is not that the people are always right . It is this rather ; that , although the people may sometimes be wrong , yet that they are not so likely to be wrong and to do wrong , as irresponsible , hereditary magistrates and legislators ; that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own interests , than it is to trust the few to keep those interests for them . The people are not always right ; they are often wrong . They must be so , from the very magnitude , difficulty , and complication of the questions that are submitted to them . I am amazed , that thinking men , conver // sant with these questions , should address such gross flattery and monstrous absurdity to the people , as to be constantly telling them , that they will put all these questions right at the ballot-box . And I am no less amazed , that a sensible people should suffer such folly to be spoken to them . Is it possible that the people believe it ? Is it possible that the majority itself of any people can be so infatuated as to hold , that , in virtue of its being a majority , it is always right ? Alas ! for truth , if it is to depend on votes ! Has the majority always been right in religion or in philosophy ? But the science of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these questions , there are grave and solemn decisions to be made by the people ; great State problems are submitted to them ; such , for instance , as concerning internal improvements , the tariff , the currency , banking , and the nicest points of construction ; which cost even the wisest men much study ; and what the people require , for the solution of these questions , is not rash haste , boastful confidence , furious anger , and mad strife , but sobriety , calmness , modesty , - qualities , indeed , that would go far to abate the violence of our parties , and to hush the brawls of our elections . I do not deny , that questions of deep national concern may justly awaken great zeal and earnestness ; but I do deny , that the public mind should be bolstered up with the pride of supposing itself to possess any complete , much less , any suddenly acquired knowledge of them . I am willing to take my fellow-citizens for my governors , with all their errors ; I prefer their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to say or imply , that they do not err , and often err , is a doctrine alike preposterous in general theory , and pernicious in its effects upon themselves . " - pp. 282-284 . But if his attachment to popular institutions is discriminating , it is not the less ardent and true . I should not exhaust the subject , even in this most general view of it , if I did not add one further consideration in behalf of freedom ; a consideration that is higher and stronger than any reason ; I mean the intrinsic desirableness of this condition to every human being . In this respect , freedom is like virtue , like happiness ; we value it for its own sake . God has stamped upon our very humanity this impress of freedom . It is the unchartered prerogative of human nature . A soul ceases to be a soul , in proportion as it ceases to be free . Strip it of this , and you strip it of one of its essential and characteristic attributes . It is this , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boundless desert-paths , and makes him // prefer them to the gay saloons and soft carpets of sumptuous palaces . It is this that makes it so difficult to bring him within the pale of artificial civilization . Our roving tribes are perishing , - a sad and solemn sacrifice upon the altar of their wild freedom . They come among us , and look with childish wonder upon the perfection of our arts , and the splendor of our habitations ; they submit with ennui and weariness , for a few days , to our burdensome forms and restraints ; and then turn their faces to their forest homes , and resolve to push those homes onward till they sink in the Pacific waves , rather than not be free . " It is thus that every people is attached to its country , just in proportion as it is free . No matter if that country be in the rocky fastnesses of Switzerland , amidst the snows of Tartary , or on the most barren and lonely island shore ; no matter if that country be so poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richer lands , for employment and sustenance ; yet , when the songs of those free homes chance to fall upon the exile 's ear , no soft and ravishing airs that wait upon the timid feastings of Asiatic opulence , ever thrilled the heart with such mingled rapture and agony , as those simple tones . Sad mementoes might they be of poverty and want , and toil ; yet it was enough that they were meinentoes of happy freedom . And more than once has it been necessary to forbid by military orders , in the armies of the Swiss mercenaries , the singing of their native songs . " And such an attachment , do I believe , is found in our own people , to their native country . It is the country of the free ; and that single consideration compensates for the want of many advantages , which other countries possess over us . And glad am I , that it opens wide its hospitable gates to many a noble but persecuted citizen , from the dungeons of Austria and Italy , and the imprisoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , as they surely find sympathy , though it is saddened with many bitter remembrances " Yes , let me be free ; let me go and come at my own will ; let me do business and make journeys , without a vexatious police or insolent soldiery to watch my steps ; let me think , and do , and speak , what I please , subject to no limit but that which is set by the common weal ; subject to no law but that which conscience binds upon me ; and I will bless my country , and love its most rugged rocks and its most barren soil . " I have seen my countrymen , and have been with them a fellow wanderer , in other lands ; and little did I see or feel to warrant the apprehension , sometimes expressed , that foreign traveJ would weaken our patriotic attachments . One sigh for // home , - home , arose from all hearts . And why , from palaces and courts , - why , from galleries of the arts , where the marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of beauty around it , - why , from the mountain 's awful brow , and the lovely valleys and lakes touched with the sunset hues of old romance , - why , from those venerable and touching ruins to which our very heart grows , - why , from all these scenes , were they looking beyond the swellings of the Atlantic wave , to a dearer and holier spot of earth , - their own , own country ? Doubtless , it was in part , because it is their country . But it was also , as every one 's experience will testify , because they knew that there was no oppression , no pitiful exaction of petty tyranny ; because that there , they knew , was no accredited and irresistible religious domination ; because that there they knew , they should not meet the odious soldier at every corner , nor swarms of imploring beggars , the victims of misrule ; that there no curse causeless did fall , and no blight , worse than plague and pestilence , did descend amidst the pure dews of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew , was liberty , - upon all the green hills , and amidst all the peaceful valleys , - liberty , the wall of fire around the humblest home ; the crown of glory , studded with her ever blazing stars , upon the proudest mansion My friends , upon our own homes that blessing rests , that guardian care and glorious crown ; and , when we return to those homes , and so long as we dwell in them , - so long as no oppressor 's foot invades their thresholds , let us bless them , and hallow them as the homes of freedom ! Let us make them , too , the homes of a nobler freedom , - of freedom from vice , from evil , from passion , - from every corrupting bondage of the soul . " - pp. 297 - 300 . Mr. Dewey writes in New York , a centre of commercial , social , and political operations , which affords him the best opportunities for observations relating to the subjects which he treats . We mention the fact , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work , since the imprint and notice of the copy-right might have been what they are , though it had been produced in some village of the interior . It is not the first time that we have had occasion to wish , that writers would observe the homely old fashion of giving some brief account of themselves on their title-page . In the case of authors so well known to fame as Mr. Dewey , the omission may produce little inconvenience . But others of less consideration will of course use their method ; aw.l // we receive not a few books with the naked name of the writer prefixed , when that name is of so little notoriety , that , for any use which it serves to the distant reader , the publication might just as well have been anonymous.
