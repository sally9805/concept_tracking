txt Wu have been agreeably disappointed in this work . We feared , that the general familiarity with its subject , at least on the part of its American readers , would take from it all the interest of novelty , and that , from the nature of the case , it must want that of variety . We have found , on trial , that , in both respects , our apprehension was ill-founded . Although we certainly watched the progress of the nation 's guest through the country , with the most willing and unabated attention , yet we find , that the details of his progress , in the remote sections of the union , were not , as it was not to be expected they should be , transferred to the public journals in this quarter . A corresponding remark , no doubt , would hold true of any other district of the United States ; and we are well persuaded , that wherever the work is taken up , a good portion of the contents will be substantially new to the reader . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those parts of the two volumes which relate to matters of a character not to come before the public at the time , or not from any other source than the General himself , or some person directly connected with him ; - // everything strictly personal in its nature . Then as to variety , it is not the least astonishing fact connected with this extraordinary visit ,  --  an event , taken in all its parts , unparalleled in the history of man ,  --  that its narrative exhibits an unbounded variety of incident , circumstance , and adventure . The arrival of this great and good person in the country , the reappearance of this friendly genius in the sphere of his youthful and beneficent visitations , seemed to call up the whole population of the country in array to welcome him ; but not in the stiff uniform of a parade , not in the court dress of a heartless ceremony . Society presented itself before him in all its shades and gradations , of which more are to be found co*xisting in the United States than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea-coast , the newborn abundance of the West ; the fashion of the town , the cordiality of the country ; the authorities , municipal , national , and state ; the living relics of the revolution , honored in the honors paid to their comrade in arms ; the scientific and learned bodies , the children at the schools , the members of the associations of active life and of charity ; the exiles of Spain , France , and Switzerland ; banished monarchs ; patriots of whom Europe was not worthy ; the African and the indian ; - all took an active and an appropriate part in this auspicious drama of real life . Had the deputed representatives of these various interests and conditions been assembled at some grand ceremonial of reception , in honor of the illustrious stranger , it would have itself , even as the pageant of an hour , have constituted an august spectacle . it would then have borne a worthy and proud comparison with those illustrious triumphs of heroic Rome , where conquered nations and captive princes followed in the train , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frail mortal , to whom they were conceded , above the earth over which he was borne . But when we consider , that this glorious and purer triumph was co*xtensive with the Union ; that it swept from state to state , and from section to section , one long , unbroken career of rapturous welcome ,  --  banishing feuds , appeasing dissensions , and hushing all tumults but the acclamations of joy ,  --  uniting in one great act of public salutation a fierce and free people , on the eve of a furious contest , with the aura epileptica of the canvass already rushing over the body politic ; that it was continued near a twelvemonth , an annus mirabilis of rejoicing , auspiciously commenced , successfully pursued , and happily and // gracefully accomplished , we have in it the elements and substance of a great chapter in the fate of nations , nowhere else to be found ; and which , to be realized and relished , must have been witnessed . The fate of nations , we say , for it was nothing less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  and of this there was enough to furnish out a liberal assignment of merit to a dozen great men of the common sort ,  --  it was necessary that numerous high associations should have linked his name with all the great political convulsions of the day . Having performed an arduous , dangerous , honorable , and successful part in that crisis in the fate of our own country , which is of itself unexampled in human things , it was necessary , that , pursuing the path of immortal renown , on which his feet had laid hold in America , he should have engaged among the foremost in that stupendous revolution of his own country , where he stood serene amidst the madness of an empire ; wielding , without abusing , a military force as far greater than that of the Emperor Napoleon , as the spontaneous rush of a whole race of men is more formidable than the march of a class of the conscription . It was necessary to the feeling with which Lafayette was received in America , that he should have nobly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the emperors of the earth , in mockery of the long-suffering of Providence , should have immured him in their dungeons for having protected their crowned daughters from the midnight assassin . It was necessary , when another stupendous reaction of things had seated the man of destiny on the throne of France , and , as it seemed , of Europe , that Lafayette alone , not by a convulsive effort of fanatical hardihood , but in the calm consciousness of a weight of character that would bear him out in the step , should deliberately , and in writing , refuse to acknowledge the power , before which the whole contemporary generation quailed . When again the wheel of empire had turned , and when this dreadful colossus had been crushed beneath the weight of Europe ( mustered against him more in desperation than in self-assured power ) , and in falling had dragged down to the dust the honor and the strength of France , it was necessary , when the dust and smoke of the contest had blown off , that the faithful sentinel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to stake his life and his reputation , in another of those fearful and critical junctures , when the stoutest hearts are apt to re // treat , and leave the field to desperate men ,  --  the forlorn hope of affairs ,  --  whom some inevitable necessity crowds up to the breach . To refute every imputation of a selfish policy , of a wish to restore himsell ' in the good graces of restored royalty , it was necessary that he , the only individual of continental Europe , who , within the reach of Napoleon 's sceptre , had refused to acknowledge his title , should be coldly viewed by the reappearing dynasty , and that he should be seen and heard , not in the court or the cabinet , but at the tribune , the calm , rational , ever consistent champion of freedom , a representative of the people in constitutional France . These were the titles of Lafayette to the respect , the love , the passionate admiration of the people , to whom he had consecrated the bloom of his youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We might have added , that , in order to give even to common minds a topic of delightful and mysterious admiration , when strong minds were tasked to do justice to the theme ,  --  in order to make a character , in which even the ingredients of romance were mingled up with the purest , loftiest , and sternest virtues , these just and authentic titles to respect were united in an individual who had been placed by birth , education , and fortune , in the foremost circle of the gay chivalry of France ; who sacrificed all that a false ambition could covet , before he aspired to all that a pure and noble ambition could reach ; and thus began life , by trampling under foot the glittering baubles , which Chathain accepted , and Burke did not refuse , and for which the mass of eminent men in Europe barter health , comfort , and conscience . Such was the man whom the Congress of the United States invited to our shores , and who came to gather in the rich harvest of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had sown it in weakness ; should he not reap it in power ? He had come to us , a poor and struggling colony , and periled his life in our cause ; was he not entitled to the gratitude of the flourishing state ? When he embarked in our cause , it was the utmost he could have promised himself , in the ordinary calculation of human things , and in the almost desperate event of a successful issue to the struggle , that some far distant posterity would illustrate , by the growth and prosperity of the country , the value of those services which he bad contributed to her freedom . It was just , that he should himself come to witness and enjoy its rapid , its miraculous growth and elevation . We pity the hearts , quite as much as // we do the heads of those , who have seen and proclaimed in his brilliant reception , nothing but an ostentatious love of parade . ' There never was a simpler , juster movement of a people . The triumph of Lafayette through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due to the husbandman , who has planted the seed and tilled the soil . His services , his character , his history , his life were fairly and richly entitled to it ; and though , most manifestly , nothing more unpremeditated and unexpected ever took place in the affairs of a nation , yet , had the most rigid deliberation on what was decent and proper preceded his visit , not a shout of welcome would have been retrenched . He deserved it all for himself ; and it was also due to the principles which had guided him , and the great cause which , in both hemispheres , he had served . In cbmmon cases , nations must necessarily act and speak through the organs of their government , and less directly through that of the press . But it can not often happen , that either channel of communication does justice to the intense and hearty concert of opinion and feeling which takes possession of a free people in reference to some great exciting subjects . Occasionally this opinion and this feeling will find another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; usually by means of primary assemblies throughout the country . The advent of Lafayette furnished an occasion singularly well adapted for such a testimony , on the part of the American people , to the great cause of liberty . The revolutions in Spanish America had appealed strongly to the sympathy of the people of the United States , and the unanimous recognition of their independence was a fine burst of legislative feeling ; the excitement in favor of reviving Greece was widely felt , and warmly expressed , and liberally manifested ; but neither of these subjects was in its nature so susceptible of the cordial codperation of the American people , nor so free from all alloy of doubt and human imperfection . There was positively nothing to qualify the good will and heartiness , with which the people of America rose up to welcome the great champion of human right , and , in recognising his merit , to reassert the principles to which his life had been consecrated . Never perhaps did so fine an occasion for bearing this testimony present itself . In the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often disastrous battle , has been the theatre on which a whole people , struggling to be free , has proclaimed its love of liberty . There is scarce any other oc // casion , that can naturally draw them forth . Here was a scene of peace and love ; comprehending , from its nature , a whole people , uniting all parties , and all men who loved their country , with all the animation derived from the actual presence of a living object of respect and affection . The very commencement and conclusion of the voyage of Lafayette ,  --  we mean those portions of it , which were performed on the soil of France ,  --  will furnish the best illustration of the distinction we would draw between the militant and the triumphant testimony of the friends of liberty . In the first chapter of the work before us we find the following paragraph . The patriotism of the citizens of Havre had prepared for Lafayette a reception in that city of a nature well calculated to touch his feelings . But the preposterous jealousy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been less discreet , would have changed it into a scene of disorder and perhaps of blood . Ageiits of the police , gendarmes , and Swiss guards emulated each other , in their zeal to repress the noble sentiments of the people , during the short time that General Lafayette remained among them . It was , however , in presence of the whole population , and under the liveliest manifestations of the public feeling , that he embarked on the thirteenth of May . ' Vol. i. p. 4 . This scene , to the credit of the municipality of Havre for the succeeding year , or of those , from whom that municipality received its instructions , was reversed when the General returned to France . As to the authorities of the city , ' says Colonel Levasseur , they were this year all that they ought to have been the last year , and gave free scope to the manifesta. tion of public opinion . In his passage from the port to the A*ouse of M. de Laroche , where he took up his quarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened by the sabre of gendarmes , or insulted by the presence of foreign troops . ' Far different was the scene at Rouen . On arriving at Rouen , we took lodgings with M. Cabanon , a respectable merchant , wLo continued to represent the department in the Chamber of Deputies , as long as his fellow citizens were untrammeled in the exercise of the right of suffrage . The colleague and friend of General Lafayette , he had claimed the privilege of receiving at his table the guest of America ; and had procured him the pleasure of meeting there with the members of his family and a large number of the most respectable citizens of the ancient capital of Normandy . Toward the conclusion of the // dinner , the General was informed , that a numerous assemblage was collected in the street , attended by a band of musicians , and desirous to salute him . He hastened to the balcony , to acknowledge this mark of the regard of the people of Rouen . But scarcely had the first acclamations been heard , when detachments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each extremity of the street , in which M. Cabanon 's house stood , who , without previous warning , proceeded to disperse the throng . The discretion with which the guards executed the orders received from an imprudent and blinded authority , proved how repugnant this service was to their feelings ; but the gendarmerie , solicitous no doubt to show itself the worthy instrument of the power by which it was employed , made a valiant charge upon the defenceless citizen , and , without allowing themselves to be impeded by the cries of the women and children , who were trampled under their horses ' feet , a manufacturer from Bolbec , an old man of Rouen , and several other persons , were severely wounded . Many others were illegally and brutally arrested . After these glorious exploits , the gendarmes , left masters of the field , awaited the departure of General Lafayette , sword in hand , and accompanied his carriage to the hotel where he was to lodge , abusing him as they went . ' Vol. ii . pp. 620 , 621 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hotel was filled by young men on horseback , determined to escort the General to the first post . Their looks and some expressions which fell from them persuaded me , that their feelings still dwelt on the scene of the preceding evening , and that they had resolved that it should not be renewed with impunity . The posts of infantry and gendarmerie had been doubled during the night , as if great events were expected the following day ; but happily the authorities sto* ) ped short , with these ridiculous demonstrations , and General Lafayette departed unmolested from the city , receiving on his way frequent manifestations of the good will of the people . ' p. 623 . It is pleasing , however , to reflect , that the tone of authority has , since this period , been lowered in France , and that the voice of popular feeling is daily gathering strength and decision . And here again , amidst the ferment which agitates the anxious friends of liberty , our beloved General is the central point to which their thoughts and hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire change of ministry has recently taken place in France , by which the administration has been thrown back into the hands of the Ultra-royal party . The burst of public indignation has been tremendous , and while we write , the news of the overthrow of this strange new combination , is // expected by the first arrivals from Europe . Meantime , General Lafayette , on an occasion of private business , has been led to traverse a part of the South of France , and to visit the city of Lyons . Wherever he moves he is received with demonstrations of joy , scarcely less unanimous than those which hailed him in America ; and restrained by the arm of arbitrary power from a more direct opposition to a ministry , constituted in open defiance of the l ) eople 's will , they have gathered about the veteran champion of the cause . He has met their advances , with a vigor and a plainness worthy of the man and of the crisis ; and we recommend those , who have doubted the talent and the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him to the citizens of Lyons , on entering that city , and at the public festival given there in his honor . But it is time that we speak more particularly of Colonel Levasseur 's work . We need scarcely recall to the minds of our readers , that this gentleman accompanied General Lafayette during his tour in America , in the capacity of private secretary . It appears , that he continued to sustain that relation to the General for two or three years after the conclusion of the voyage ; and it is stated in the Preface to this work , as the reason for delaying its appearance till the present time , that its author felt himself restrained , by motives of delicacy , from publishing the account of this memorable tour , so long as he should remain in the service of the General . No part therefore of the responsibility of the work rests with Lafayette ; at the same time , that the relation subsisting between him and the author , and the confidence implied in it on the part of the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . We repeat , that , although every reader in the United States may , at first , be inclined to suppose that he derived , at the time , from the newspapers of the day , minute and adequate information on the subject of this memorable tour , there are few readers , who will not find a good portion of it recommended by substantial novelty ; and still fewer to whom this continuous narrative of an cvent ,  --  raised by its moral influence far above the character of a mere incident in the chapter of passing occurrences ,  --  may not be perused to advantage . It is especially the best record , which we can preserve and hand down to our children , of one of those portions of history we would most wish them to enjoy ; and were it only on this account , it ought to find a place in every American library . To // the foreign reader , in addition to the interest arising from its main topic , it will possess considerable value for the historical and statistical information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . Regarding the reception of the General on his landing and in the principal Atlantic cities , as those l ) ortions of the work least likely to possess the attraction of novelty , we shall not dwell upon them . We make only the following quotation , from the chapter which relates the passage from Philadelphia to Baltimore . Just as we were going on board the steam-boat , which was to take us to Baltimore , we were informed that the Secretary of State , Mr Adams , had arrived at Frenchtown , on his return to Washington , and had eagerly accepted the invitation to join the party which accompanied the General , who had the pleasure of meeting in Mr Adams an old and valued acquaintance . Many travellers , who have visited the United States , and who pretend to be acquainted with the character of the people , have maintained that the Americans , in spite of their republican institutions , are essentially aristocratic in their manners . The following occurrence , by no means a solitary one , may serve as an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed up by many others of the same character , which I shall have occasion to relate . On board the steam-boat , which was to take us down the Chesapeake bay , a small cabin had been prepared for General Lafayette ; and as the committee of arrangements had had the kindness to think , that those who had shared his fatigues ought to share his repose , they had caused two other beds to be placed in the same apartment , one for his son , and one for his secretary . We were ignorant how our fellow travellers , who were exceedingly numerous , were to pass the night , when Mr George Lafayette , having occasion to traverse the main cabin , where we had just dined , found that it had been transformed into a dormitory , covered with beds , of which the crowd of passengers took possession without ceremony . Among those thus provided for , he was surprised to see Mr Adams . He urged him to exchange beds with him . Mr Adams declined . I came up at this juncture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding that I hoped he would not give me the mortification of sleeping in a good bed , while a person of his character was stretched on the floor . He replied in obliging terms , but positively declined a compliance with our request . Finally , pressed by our renewed urgency , and by an appeal which we had made to the name of General Lafayette , he declared , that , even were he disposed to accept our proposal , he could not do it with propriety , as the committee had reserved // 226 the apartment for General Lafayette and his suite , and their are rangements ought above all things to be regarded by their fellow citizens . Mr George Lafayette repaired immediately to a member of the committee , and begged him , in the name of his father , to admit Mr Adams into our cabin , in the place of one of us . This last condition did not appear admissible to the committee , who finally determined to have a fourth bed placed in our cabin for Mr Adams , not because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to have him , as an old friend , by his side . Nor would Mr Adams leave the crowd to enter our room , till he had received a formal invitation from the committee . If the American manners are prone to aristocracy , it must be adbitted that the high officers of government do not enjoy its irnmunities . ' Vol. i. pp. 334-*36 . The fnllowiu* curiotis incident occurred during the visit of the General at Yorktown , which , though of course mentioned in the 1 ) 1 ners at the time , we do not recollect to have noticed . A circumstance somewhat curious , ' says Colonel Levasseur , gave additional zest to this patriotic and military festival . I have already observed , that on the arrival of General Lafayette at Yorktown , he had taken up hisiodgings in the same house , where Lord Coruwallis was quartered , forty years before . Some servants , in examining the cellar with a view to the deposit of the refresh meats and stores provided for the f*te , found a large box in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their notice . On opening it , they found it filled with xvax candles . The address on the cover of the box was then examined , and it proved to be a part of the stores laid in for Lord Cornwallis , during the siege . The tidings of this l ) rize spread through the house , to the tents ; the wax candles were taken possession of , and lighted in the centre of the encampment , where a ball was given by the troops to the ladies of the neighborhoad . A ball at Yorktown in 1324 , lighted by Lord Coruwallis 's candles , was a subject of no little pleasantry to the old soldiers , who attended the fete ; few of whom , notwithstandincr their age an ( l the fatigues of the day , would quit the spot , till they had seen the candles down to the socket . ' Pp. 405 , 406 . On occasion of this visit to Yorktown , which suggested the recollection of a brilliant exploit achieved by the codperation of French arms , Colonel Levasseur falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tendin* to expose the narrow grounds , on which the opponents of liberal institution have chosen to place their cause , even on occasions , when it most im1 ) orted them to give the widest range to the principle of conciliation , and where circumstances seemed to court them to // adopt a generous tone . Colonel Levasseur had the gratiflcation of receiving from an American , who is not named , details of the conduct of the French army in this campaign , alike creditable to its discipline , spirit , and bravery . I do not deny , ' he adds , that these tributes to the noble conduct of my fellow citizens penetrated my heart with delight . Why , then , at the period of the French restoration in 1815 , when its leaders were aiming to associate its banners with glorious recollections , or to obliterate the memory of the triumphs of the threecolored cockade , why did they perpetually invoke the standard of Henry the Fourth , which was never displayed but in civil wars , or that of Louis the Fourteenth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why did not they claim , a*a lawful inheritance , a part of the glory of the American revolutionary war ? Was it not beneath the drapeau blanc , that the grenadiers of Rocharnbeau marched to the storm of Yorktown ? Was it not under the colors of legitimacy , that our marine immortalized itself , by securing the deliverance of a free people , by the dispersion of the English fleets . Would they reject this glory because it was earned in the service of liberty ? I know not . But one thing is certain , that , while we were celebrating the anniversary of the takin g of Yorktown , the French squadron , commanded by Admiral - , and then lying in Hampton Roads , within hearing of the shouts with which grateful America commemorated the services of France , remained coldly aloof from a festival , which ought to have been regarded as a family fete of the two nations . For the rest , we were apprized that this inexplicable indifference or coldness was not shared either by the crews , or by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter some succeeded in leaving their vessels , and joining in a civil dress the patriotic festival , at which , could they have presented themselves in their character as French officers , the place of honor would have been cheerfully assigned them by the Americans . ' pp. 42O-4* . We must here be permitted to make a few remarks on the relations , in which the governments of Europe stand to the United States of America , considered as a power representing popular principles , in their purest form . The only leading powers of Europe , with which our relations are likely to assume a critical cast , are England , France , and Russia . Russia , although the power whose institutions would seem most at variance with our own , has ever shown the kindest disposition toward the government of the United States . Our ministers at St Petersburgh have been treated with something more than ceremonious courtesy . She offered her mediation to // bring about a peace between the United States and Great Brhain , in a manner evincing the roost cordial friendship for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the extent of her possessions on the Northwest Coast of America , and the rights of other powers in the navigation of the North Pacific , inconsistent with the claims of the United States in that quarter , instead of setting a commission of lawyers to work ,  --  as Great Britain did on the like occasion ,  --  to draw up a sophistical title to territory discovered , explored , and rightfully claimed by the United States , Russia came handsomely and promptly to a reasonable settlement of the question . For the only claims of our merchants on her for spoliations , she has long since made ample and honorable indemnity . All this is to the credit of the honor and probity of the Russian councils , and in that light we name it . But were she pursuing the most selfish course from the merest motives of calculation , she would not have done otherwise . No American statesman can rise from the survey of the foreign affairs of his country , without feelings of kindness toward Russia . And as surely as causes produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented , by the international relations of the states of Europe and America . We admit , that , as Russia was very slightly concerned , in any way , with the revolutionary politics of the United States , this friendly course , on her part , was not attended with any difficulty ; although all the prejudices of that government ( a government too , which derives its tone from the feelings of one individual , and is therefore less amenable to public sentiment ) might have been expected to run in an opposite direction in respect to the United States , as a revolutionary anti democratic government . France and England are more delicately situated . Natural enemies ( as it is called ) to each other , America is the rebellious offspring ( as it is again called ) of England ; and although our revolution was most powerfully aided by the government of France , administered by the present reigning family , yet this same revolution is regarded as having had great influence in bringing on that of France , which , in its course , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These circumstances , we admit , produce a relation of some delicacy ; and what has been the effect ? In England , generally speaking , the government party , inheriting the feelings of the year 1775 , has not only retained the soreness and irritation of that period , // but , through the literary organs under its influence , has libelled America , its institutions , its manners , and its citizens , atrociously and systematically ; and still does it . The liberal party , as such , has been disposed in England to entertain a sympathy with America ; and this circumstance gives to that party all the real strength they possess . But for the prosperous event of the American revolution , the issue of the French revolution would have made the very name of a liberal party a by-word in Etirope for five centuries to come . If the l ) atriots in America had been trampled down and put in the wrong , and an arbitrary government consolidated on their necks , arid all the fair abounding fruits of liberal institutions , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the l ) eels of this deplorable resdr , the French revolution , with its train of ghastly excesses , had crowded , we say abain , tint the cause of liberal institutions would have stood about as fair in England . as it does at l ) resent in the Celestial empire of China . So that we make use of no exaggeration , when we say , that the liberal party in England owes whatever strength it possesses to America , and their supposed sympathy with us . On the other hand , the opposite party , by persevering in a hostile disposition , by keeping its pack of venal scribblers , in full cry against us , riot only most effectually strengthens the liberal party at borne , but puts itself in the wrong on almost all questions , on which the good feelint*s of the age are strongly enlisted . If the British ministry systematically cultivated such a feeling toward us as animates the Russian government , it would not only be productive of the happiest effects between the two countries , and obviate , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a periodical war , but ( which , to be sure , is no business of ours ) it would , more than anything else in their foreign relations , strengthen them at home . This is so unquestionable , that a weak minister is comparatively well disposed to the United States , and a popular minister the reverse . The whole period since the peace of 1815 , till the last year , has been covered by the ministerial influences of Lord Castlereagh and Mr Canning . Of the two , the liberal minister , the minister who sprung from the people , and boasted of his origin , was by far the less liberal , in his official intercourse with the United States . Nor have we much doubt , that the case will continue to be illustrated by Lord Wellington , who , weak in those points in which Mr Canning felt himself strong , *-we mean the eulogies of the // liberal press ,  --  will feel no inclination to add to the other embarrassrnents of his administration , that of keeping up Mr Canning 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtures , made by the United States , for a settlement of the question of the colonial trade on terms professedly satisfactory to En*1and herself . Should this conciliatory course , however , be adopted by the Duke of Wellington , it will only be in his case , as it was in Lord Londonderry 's , the convenience of the minister , triunphing over the prejudices of the Tory . The relations of the government of France towards the United States are still more complicated , in consequence of the supposed connexion between the revolutions of the twp countries . Ther is no cordiality between the governments of England and Fiance , except as far as a government of France , unsupl ) orted by the popular feeling in that country , may lean upon the British hover umnent for support . But , in the nature of things , there is no predilection on the part of these governments for each other ; and consequently the cordiality between the French and the American governments ought to increase , as the unfriendliness of the British councils towards us or them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind was derived , no doubt , the resolution of the French government to take part in our revolutionary struggle . We speak , of course , only of the reasons of state which actuated the ministry and the king . But the close succession of the Fronch revolution upon ours seemed to identify the overthrow of the Bourbon dynasty with the event of the American contest , and engraved a horror of all revolutions on the heart of the kings of France . But th' , like all the other cruel contradictions of the French revolution , ought , for the interest of both nations , to be forgotten . France , as such , might possess , i*m the revolutionary recollections of America , a tower of strength . The same reasons of state , which prompted the ministry of Louis the Sixteenth to the very strong measure of sending his fleets , in a time of peace with England , to take the part of the revolted colonies , certainly suggest , to any administration of his successors , the expediency of cherishing and reciprocating the friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of France to follow the example , not of England , but of Russia ; and not to look with coldness on the ripe fruits of the revolutionary struggle , whose first germs she fostered and protected . We can not well conceive of anything more unnatural , // than an order given by the French ministry to the officers of a squadron of Charles the Tenth to refuse to join the Americans in 1824 , in commemorating a victory gained by the cooperation of the armies of his brother , Louis the Sixteenth , in 1781 . But we return to the work before us . The passage of General Lafayette through the territory of the Creek Indians , is a portion of this narrative among the most curious . Several of the incidents , however , through some other channel , have already appeared before the public , and we may therefore venture to forbear the quotation of them . The reception of General Lafayette , by the population of New Orleans , was , in like manner , not among the least interesting occurrences of the tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in that population , was a circumstance which could not but add much to the enthusiasm , with which this illustrious son of France was received . But there were others , besides the French and Americans , that pressed with equal earnestness about him , and we are not sure that any part of these volumes has appealed more strongly to our own feelings , t.han that which records the interview of the Spanish patriots with General Lafayette . In the course of the morning , ' says Colonel Levasseur , a deputation of Spanish settlers and refugees waited on the General , to pay their respects to him , and especially to express their gratitude to him , for the manner , in which , in the Chamber of Deputies , he had opposed the invasion of Spain , and the overthrow of the liberal constitution . The organ of the deputation thus expressed himself ; " General , the Spaniards established in this region , and those proscribed in their native land , have united to offer you their sincere congratulations on your arrival in these States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifices and your perseverance . They congratulate themselves on the opportunity , which they thus enjoy ( amidst the patriotic recollections of one portion of their company , and the distressing anxieties of the other ) , of beholding the hero , whose actions , words , and conduct justify their liberal sentiments , and the extremity to which they have gone , in withdrawing themselves from the reach of a government , which persecutes and dooms them , and expose&amp;them to the danger and vicissitudes of exile . Your esteem for the brave and unfortunate Riego ; the tribute of remembrance , which , on all occasions , you have taken pleasure in paying to this ill-fated victim of a cruel and jealous court ; the homage with which you honor the ashes of this worthy patriot , are at once the best encouragement // and reward for those , who devote themselves to the sacred cause of liberty . Spaniards , who admired his virtues and shared his opinions , now unfortunate and in exile , come to you , General , with a tranquil conscience . They dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are unfortunate .

Accept , General , the affectionate tribute of our admiration ; and let the unhappy Spanish exiles obtain from you an expression of consolation for themselves , and all others who fly before the wasting scourge of tyranny . Such an expression , General , shall be a pledge of your protection , a proof of their innocence , and an assurance of a future more auspicious and honorable to their country .

" ' Vol. ii . pp. 21*3-216 . Who needs to be reminded , that by thus boldly and eloquently asserting the cause of freedom , wherever he went in his wide tour throughout the United States , General Lal4ette turned the etiquette of a ceremonious reception into a living and abiding lesson of the highest truth ? By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such force , to what audience with such pertinency , cGuld the cause of Spanish liberty have been pleaded ? This beautiful ncident was followed up by another , if not more imposing , equally interesting and affecting . In the crowd , ' says Colonel Levasseur , I noticed some ecclesiastics , and among the rest a Capuchin , whose costume , new to me , had attracted my attention on the day of my arrival . The account which I received of him highly interested me , and will , I doubt not , interest the reader . Father Antonio is a venerable Spanish ecclesiastic of the Franciscan order , for many years residing in Louisiana . Surrounded by a population composed of different sects , he has never thought it his duty to trouble the consciences of others , by seeking recruits to his own faith . Semetimes , as a Capuchin , Father Antonio solicits charity , but it is only when he has some good action to * ) erform , and his slender means , exhausted by constant alms-giving , are inadequate of themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sickly season , the yellow-fever ( Irives the wealthy inhabitants of New Orleans to their country seats for protection from disease and death , the worth of Father Antonio is seen in all its force . In these days of terror and mourning , bow many unfortunates , abandoned by their friends and even their relations , have been indebted for health and life to his devotedness , to his cares , to his piety ! Of all whom he has thus saved ( and they are numerous ) , there is not one who can say , " Before taking me under his care , he inquired what was my religion . " When be caine to see the General , Father Antonio was clothed according to the rule of his order , in a long brown frock , tied with a rope about the body . As soon as he perceived the General , he threw himself into his arms , saying , " Oh , my son , I have found favor with the Lord , for he has granted me , before I die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He then conversed with the General , for a few moments , in the most affectionate manner , complimented him on the glorious and well deserved reception which he had received from the Americans , and modestly withdrew into a corner of the apartment . ' When // the crowd had retired and he found the General alone , he ran to him and pressing him again in his arms , exclaimed , " Adieu my son ; adieu , beloved General . Farewell ! may the Lord go before thee , and after thy glorious visit is over , may he guide thee to the bosom of thy beloved family , to enjoy in peace the recollection of thy good actions , and the friendship of the people of America . Oh , my son , perhaps thou art still reserved for great achievements ! Perhaps the Lord will yet make thee the instrument of emancipating other nations .

When we read , in the last papers from France , the accounts of the present state of things in that kingdom ; when we notice the irresistible onset made upon the ministry , and the visible purturbation of its ranks , it is impossible wholly to suppress the idea , that another great change is at hand . When we see the spontaneous movement of the people toward the person of Lafayette , the glowing zeal with which they have turned an excursion of business into another triumphant progress , strewing his way with honors such as loyal France never paid to her most cherished princes , we can not but think , that the aspiration of the venerable Spanish priest is almost prophetic . The feelings of men inspire their actions ; public sentiment governs states ; and revolutions are the outbreakings of mighty , irrepressible passions . It is in vain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happy is it , that they have concentrated themselves upon a patriot , whom prosperity has as little been able to corrupt , as adversity to subdue . The happy amalgamation of the French and American population in Louisiana was evidently one of the most agreeable spectacles , which presented itself to General Lafayette , on his tour . It is one of the most precious lessons which our history contains . XVhen Louisiana was acquired , a great problem presented itself , of which the solution could not be thrust aside ; which it was necessary for the government and the people of the United States and the inhabitap*s of Louisiana to meet . France sold the country to the United States . It is plain , that , on American principles , France could do nothing , which would bind any body but herself ; and that we could acquire no rights , under the purchase , except as against France // and other powers admitting the right of a mother country to transfer the jurisdiction of a colony . It was the opinion of Mr Jefferson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Louisiana to do some act , expressive of their willingness to join the American people , and that the constitution of the United States must be amended , to admit of this addition to the confederated family . The first measure ( which presented no practical difficulties , that we are aware of ) was superseded by the obvious good will and predisposition of the population . The second ( which in the theory of our government was necessary ) was waved under the dictation of high national convenience ; and it is not within our knowledge , that the momentous result of transferring all Louisiana ( an empire of itself ) from one jurisdiction to another , was attended with an irregular movement , which it required a sergeant 's guard to repress . While the Canadas have been haunting the British parliament , for seventy years , like a wrathful ghost , constantly harassed with a legislation that never satisfies them , overwhelmed with favors that do not propitiate , and taunted with concessions which are as grateful to a proud colony as alms-bread is to a proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate , congenial member of the confederacy . She was Catholic ; how did Protestant America deal with that fearfully sensitive interest , the Catholic faith of her newly gathered brethren ? The treaty of cession guarantied to them the undisturbed liberty of conscience , with the assurance that this is all , which any communion in the whole republic enjoys . In Canada , the British government tolerates the Catholic faith , the faith of the mass of the population , ( and next to persecution , toleration is the most odious word in the vocabulary of oppression ; for the power , that makes a merit of tolerating , claims ipso facto the right of not tolerating , that is , of persecuting ) , endows the Church of England , and even requires the professors of her colleges in Canada to subscribe to the Thirty-nine Articles. * * In the very interesting debate in the House of Commons , May 2 , 1828 , on the civil government of the Canadas , ' Sir James Mackintosh observed , In Upper Canada , the people were much dissappointed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to the Church of England , and the reserves kept for a church , which is not the religion of a majority of the people . Such endowments may he held sacred , when they have been long made , but I do not see the propriety of now // Louisiana had been both a Spanish and a French colony ; how did republican America manage the nice questions of government and law ? She guarantied to them the enjoyment of all those portions of their old law , which they themselves might choose to retain ; declared them independent , and free to adopt any modification of republican government , that they might choose ; and admitted them into the federal union , on terms of equality . In Canada , before the question can he answered , on what footing England has placed the law and the government , you must say as to what period of ten years you inquire ; for two lustrums is an old age for a British charter in Canada . There is the law of 1763 , and the law of 1774 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1791 , as each new minister chooses to make what he deems experirnentum in corpore viii . Most ardently is it- to be wished , that the happy example , which has so prosperously attached to our union , on the south , the French colony of Louisiana , could effectually point the way to an equally auspicious junction of the French colonies of the north . What privileges would it open for the Canadas ; what collisions would it obviate between Great Britain and the United States ; what a relief vould it afford to England ; what a noble accession would it constitute to our republic . Great Britain , of course , in the present improved state of political science , can claim no right to control the will of the people of Canada . When this subject was alluded to , in the House of Commons , in the debate above mentioned , all that was maintained in favor of a perpetuity of the colonial bond , was that England was bound to protect the colonies . This obligation , of co*irse , ceases at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England to protect them , if they do not wish to be protected ; and if the four British provinces in North America should to-morrow propose to renounce the government of Great Britain , and join the confederacy of the United States , as the Congress of 1774 invited them to do , making such endowments for a church which is not the religion of the people , nor do I understand the regulations , which have been made for the new college in Upper Canada . I see , with astonishment , that in a country , where the majority of the people do not belong to the Church of England , the professors must all subscribe to the Thirtynine Articles ; so that if Dr Adam Smith were alive , he could not fill the chair of political economy , and Dr Black would be excluded from the chair of chemistry .

We might specify his rencounter with a female Indian , who had been brought up in civilized , and returned to savage life , the daughter of a chief who had served under Lafayette in 1778 , and received from him a written testimonial to his character ; the interview at Nashville with the President of the United States ; the disaster on the Ohio , occasioned by a snag ; the visit to Mr Gallatin ; the whole ceremonial of Bunker 1-lill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left ourselves no space for further extracts . There are those who deny to General Lafayette the name of a great man . This is a vague phrase , hard to define , of an acceptation somewhat dependent on the circle in which it is used . Does goodness belong to greatness , and make a part of it ? Who is there , that has run through such a career with so little reproach ? Are military courage and conduct the test of greatness ? Lafayette was trusted by Washington with all kinds of service ; the laborious and the complicated , which required patience and skill ; the perilous , that demanded nerve ; and we see him keeping up a pursuit , effecting a retreat , outmanmuvring an enemy , and heading an assault , with equal reputation and success . Are the willingness to meet trernendons responsibility , and the cool and brave administration of gigantic power , proofs of greatness ? Lafayette commanded in chief the national guard of France , three millions of bayonets . Is the fortitude , required to resist the urgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trait of true greatness ? Behold Lafayette , when he might have been the chief , becoming the fugitive of the French revolution . Is the solitary and unaided opposition of a good citizen to the pretensions of // 237 wI Year in Spain . an absolute ruler , whose power was as boundless as his ambition , an effort of greatness ? Read the letter of Lafayette to Napoleon Bonaparte , refusing to vote for him as consul for life . Is a voluntary return , in advancing years , to the direction of affairs , at a moment like that when the ponderous machinery of the French empire was flying asunder , stunning , rending , crushing , annihilating thousands on every side , a mark of greatness ? Consider his calmness at the tribune , when allied Europe was at the gates of Paris , and Napoleon yet stood in his desperation and at bay . And add to all this the dignity , the propriety , the cheerfulness , the matchless discretion of his conduct , in the strange* new position , in which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man the meed of greatness , may award it , if they please , to their Alexanders and Ca*sars , their Frederics and their Wellingtons.
