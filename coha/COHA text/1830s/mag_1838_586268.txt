txt IT is a lovely morning . August is just gracefully giving place to her gentler sister . The atmosphere is stirred with cooler airs , and loaded with the rich fragrance of autumn ; and yet the earth is clothed with deep verdure , and shadowed by thick foliage still ,  - -  where the tenderest green of summer , blends in magic beauty with the brighter and more mellowed tints with which " decay 's effacing fingers " delight to supersede the softer hues of the early year . It is a delightful season , and creates a mood of mind , that I love to indulge . Such a day as this was never meant to be imprisoned between dingy rows of brick walls , or to be used as a mere drudge for the hurried despatch of the business of a city . Candle-light or torchlight has always seemed to me good enough to light men to their counting-houses , and to preside over the prosaic , though necessary , mechanism which supplies our animal wants . I have ever begrudged the blessed light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is called the business of the world is carried on , who think no more of the life-giving orb than they do of the wick-light that shows them the way to bed . The cloud that ever hangs over London is the fit canopy of a great city . The everlasting fogs , the perpetual drizzle , the thick irrespirable air , the copper luminary , which they ironically call the sun , have ever seemed to me good enough for the willing captives of that vast prison-house . The hill-side , the over-arching wood walk , the borders of the haunted stream , are the true temples of the God of Day . Gentle reader , squander not the golden minutes of morning in the solemn foolery which you fancifully call business , nor even in poring over the pages of this best of magazines ; but come away with me and waste an hour in the pleasant walks which extend themselves around the good town of Boston . Though we can not boast of a far-reaching antiquity , still the two hundred years which have swept over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight , which " may give us pause if pondered fittingly . " At all events the features of nature herself are the same as when she first smiled a welcome to the stern puritan exiles from their native land . The lovely heights which looked down upon them , the silver waves which invited their curious oar , the green plains from which they stripped the aboriginal forests , still remain unchanged . Let us stroll together among those charming scenes , // and live , at least a while , with the generations who once dwelt in their midst , and loved them well . I know that you love to dwell upon the past , and to revisit , in spirit , the daily walks and ways of the men who lived before us on the earth , and bequeathed to us almost all we have that is worth having . Had I not thought so I should not have sought your company ; so take my arm and I will guide you through the devious maze of Washington Street , and bring you soon to where fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of State Street , King Street in the " good old colonial days . " The antiquated building which , like an island in some broad stream , divides the busy tide into two equal currents , is the old Town house , where the spirit of resistance to the parent State was fostered in the Provincial Legislature for many years before it broke out into open war . It was the scene of many a stormy conflict between the royal Governors and the impracticable representatives of the people from Andross down to Hutchinson . The ungainly erection opposite stands on the site of the earliest substantial edifice raised by the fathers to the worship of God . There you may see the spot where the house of John Winthrop stoodone of the noblest spirits that have adorned the world . That brick church with the lofty spire is the Old South , which was transformed by the desecrating hands of the besieged British troops into a stable and a riding school . If you will look down Milk Street , of which the Old South Church makes the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , alas ! but the place where it once stood . The humble roof which should have been immortal has bowed itself in the dust , and in its place a thin six-storied Babel rears its front towards Heaven . I marvel that it has never toppled down upon the head of the inventor . But we must hasten on . I may not stop to show you the old Province-House , the scene of the provincial splendors of the representatives of majesty ; where they held their court and dispensed their hospitalities . The Democratic Review has already taken up its traditions , and when the " Tales of the Province-House " are narrated by the pen of Hawthorne , who would be aught else than a listener or a reader ? I only dare to indicate that dark and narrow alley , sneaking between the vulgar red-brick houses which fill up the fine old Court-yard , that leads to that once famous centre of the colonial world . These two story brick houses with attic windows in their roofs , of which you see many modestly shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial , modern neighbours , are of the beginning of the last century , and have looked forth from their windows upon many a revolutionary scene . They have witnessed many a military pomp when the besieged British troops marched before them confident of success ; and joyful eyes looked from them when the army of deliverance marched // its rude legions through the streets at the heels of the departing invaders . They saw , too , the tumultuous throngs that hurried , in the times which preceded the Revolution , to the Liberty Tree , there to inflame their zeal and mature their plans beneath its shadow . Do you see that flag-staff planted opposite the shambles of the Boylston Market ? Well , from that spot grew the Liberty Treehewn down with a malicious pleasure by the mercenary hands of the British soldiers during the siege , and consumed as firewood during the bitter winter of 1775 , 6 . Would that it might have stood and put forth its annual leaves to this day ! That tree , it its time , bore strange fruit . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of the appointment of Mr. Oliver as Stamp Distributer , there was discovered one morning , depending from its boughs , an effigy of the obnoxious officer , and also a boot ( symbolical of Lord Bute. ) with the Devil peeping out of it with the Stamp Act in his hand . Under the same shade the same unfortunate Distributer was compelled to abjure his office . And again , when the news arrived that the odious act was repealed , the Liberty Tree bore a conspicuous part in the rejoicings which that event called forth . During the day its branches streamed with flags and pennants , and at night bent beneath the weight of the variegated lanterns that illuminated it . It was the idol of our fathers-and its fame extended not only over this continent , but was familiar in men 's mouths beyond the Atlantic . And now nothing remains to mark where it stood but that bare , unsightly pole ! What associations can cluster around a smooth , barkiess stick ? How many of the thousands that daily brush past it ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose place is so unworthily filled ? How many of them even know that the tree of which they have heard their fathers tell , and which flourished in their early dreams , grew by the wayside of their daily walks ? But though the very tree no longer overshadows their path , puts out its buds in spring , or rains down its withered leaves in autumn , its memory will not the less endure for ages . Unborn generations will preserve for it the same veneration which would have been accorded to its honored age , had the " Liberty Tree " stood until centuries had shattered its branches and rived its trunk , rendering it more and more precious to their hearts . But come , we must not loiter about this scene of our father 's love* I will now show you some faint traces of yet fiercer times , when the cloud of battle had actually burst over the land . Do you see that black circle of some ten inches diameter which is described upon the rear of that white wooden house ? And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ring answering to the one behind , but somewhat higher up . Well , that indicates the passage of one of the last arguments of kings or nations , uttered by some brazen VOL . III . NO . IX. - SEPTEMBER F // mouth from the Continental lines , at Roxhury , during the siege . The proprietors of the building , from that day to this , have preserved , as an honorable ornament to their house , that vestige of those memorable days . And now we have reached the point where the British army threw up their strong entrenchments at the beginning of the siege . You may faintly trace the outline of the works which , twenty years since , were in almost perfect preservation ; but the earth was wanted to make a new street , and the general orders of Governor Gage for their erection , were not so promptly obeyed as were the counter orders of the street commissioner for their demolition . In this corner you may see the well , dug for the supply of the beleaguered troops , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bow-shot further on , was the outpost of the British . A venerable survivor of the besieging army told me , not long since , that one morning early a scapegallows of the Continental troops , with a prodigiously long gun , shot the sentinel on his post from behind the American lines , which were almost as far as you can see before you on this street . An almost incredible shot ; but one which excited as much indignation among his fellowsoldiers as it did in the ranks of the enemy . Ten minutes brisk walk brings us to the lines of the Continental army , which are as difficult to be traced as those of their English foes . You may spy out , however , some slight marks of the works which once stretched their angular length across the isthmus . One wouJd think that these monuments of our father 's deeds might have been spared to tell the tale of their dangers and hardships to their children . Had they endured to this day , I doubt not but that a religious care would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation that immediately succeeds to one that has wrought great deliverances , but too often wants that reverence for great actions which a remoter age entertains . Familiarity with the actors in the immortal dramas which thrill our souls , and an acquaintance with their petty infirmities and human frailties , take off from that keen edge of admiration which is felt by a pious posterity . This , alas ! is the almost inevitable doom of the monuments and the memorials of a former age in this working-day land . It was not so with the old Republics . Let us now direct our steps across the fields to the Southeast by this narrow private road , and I will show you the scarcely traceable vestiges of the Dorchester lines , which completed the circumvallation of the town on this side . I discovered these faint traces of a former age , by accident , a few months since . I had often moused about the neighboring hills and pastures , in search of these works which are conspicuously laid down in the plans of the siege , but could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that farm house , black with the dust of the century before the last , // moved solely by my love of all old and inconvenient constructions . An old farm house , with its roof declining towards the ground at an angle which I have not mathematics enough to describe , with its diamond panes of glass set in lead , and its second story jutting over the first , has a charm for me far beyond any of the Palladian villas which have in too many instances displaced them . It is as much more precious to the eye of taste and sentiment , than any of its more pretending successors , as an ancient well-pole is more picturesque than a patent forcing pump . Well , at that house I knocked , being sure that the door would be opened by an original . My certainty was made doubly sure by the appearance of an old man , whose dress and address smacked of times even anterior to the Revolution . He seemed not a whit discomposed by my intrusion , but , on the contrary , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitation which had been the home of his fathers for a hundred and sixty years . I soon discovered , however , that he had espoused the side of the loyalists at the time of the Revolution , and in no degree shared my enthusiasm on the subject of those days . He had been under some personal obligations to Governor Hutchinson , and had entered warmly into his benefactor 's political feelings as a part of due gratitude . He told me of the various indignities he underwent for his opinion 's sake before the war broke out , and how he sought a refuge from the persecution of his neighbors in the beleaguered town . When the town was evacuated he fled with the other loyalists to England , where he remained for several years after the peace of 1783 . His patrimonial estate had been confiscated and sold after his flight , and he had no dependance for his support but upon the bounty of the British King . After years enough had elapsed to efface in some degree his errors , as they esteemed them , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his native land , heartily sick of his residence in the fogs of London . It so chanced that at the moment of his arrival his patrimonial estate was again on sale , and by disposing of his annuity he was enabled to repossess himself of his paternal acres . Here he had lived ever since , having but little intercourse with the new generation which had grown up during his exile , but chiefly conversing in memory with the long lost companions of his former state of existence . His reverend white hairs , his snuff-colored coat of formal cut , and breeches of the same , his grey yarn stockings and silver-buckled shoes , were in keeping with his ancient habitation , and helped to carry back the imagination to elder days . The old gentleman had many and grievous complaints to make of the abuses which his beloved home had endured at the hands of the rebel soldiers who were quartered there . Many a forgotten name was carved upon the woodwork ; and many a coarsely cut // device and weary ejaculation , bore witness to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the home-sick soldier sighing for the liberty of his father 's farm , and the society of his village friends . He directed my observation to the damage done to the low ceiling of the room , by the muzzles of the muskets of the troops as they rehearsed , in game or earnest , their daily drill . Perhaps not one of those weary men now survive to recall the alteinate tedium and excitement of that busy time ; and yet here were the vestiges of their idleness , as fresh as if they were the traces of but yesterday . After I had examined the interior of his mansion , my aged friend proceeded to exhibit the domain that surrounded it . His house was encompassed by green pastures , then of the intensest verdure , sloping down to the water 's side , dotted with cattle and sprinkled with old trees . A small patch of ground behind the house formed his garden and was kept in a state of neatness which would have done honor to Holland itself . What seemed a natural mound , fenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed of a little brook , which was now dry . My attention being attracted to this object , my host informed me that it was a part of an old revolutionary entrenchment , which he had suffered to remain to mount guar ( l upon his cabbages and asparagus. rJjl**g announcement in an instant mounted me astride my hobby , and I began incontinently to frisk and caper upon it in a manner that threatened immediate peril to my good old friend 's Tory prejudices . In reply to my eager inquiries , he informed me that when he first returned to his native fields , he found them hedged in by a long zig-zag line of works , with a deep ditch on either side . Both ditch and works were grown over with grass , but the embrasures ( if that be the name ) from which the guns looked fiercely towards the town , still remained ; and there were many marks of the besieging army , such as the piled up bones of their beeves , to be seen within the verdant enclosure . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it could hardly be expected that he would show more mercy to these relics of the ivar , the memory of which he detested , than was granted to those we have just left , by men who exult in the conflict and its issue . Athis liesure hours he employed himself in filling up the fosse with the heaped up earth , and it was not long before nearly every trace of the lines , which at every moment forced upon his memory the recollection of that bitter portion of his life was effaced . I grieved over the result , but could not much blame the feeling which led to it . My host next , in compliance with my request , proceeded to point out the direction in which the works which he had demolished ran . With little more aid from the imagination than Monkbarns needed to trace the outline of the Prmetorium of the camp of Agricola , I // soon obtained a clear idea of the Dorchester lines , for which I had so often looked in vain . Here you may descry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising above the level of the verdant champaign of greensward , but which you perceive is too regularly irregular for a mere freak of nature . You can follow their eccentric course till they are lost in the ploughed field which is enclosed by yonder stone wall . Let us sit down for a moment beneath the thick branches of this old elm , which describes its sharply defined shadow upon the brilliant green of the summer turf . How sweetly the hum of the distant city rises upon the ear ! But how many discords go to make up that soothing harmony ! What fierce passions , what carping cares , what envious discontents , what bitter toil and task-work , help to swell that sleepy melody , soft as the hum of bees , or the murmurs of a distant water-fall ! The three-hilled city , with its picturesque inequalities of ground , its glittering spires , its tufts of trees ( alas ! too rare ! ) and the dome of the State-House , divested by distance of its architectural errors , crowning the whole , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , now brimming with an overflowing tide , and seen through the haze of a summer 's day , seems like a scene of fairy laud . Surely no unkindness , or self seeking , or sensuality , or coldess of heart , can find shelter within that peaceful multitude of homes ! The very spirit of tranquillity itself seems to be breathed around and about them . To your left you see the lovely heights of Dorchester , crowned with the works from which General Howe heard proclaimed in tones of thunder , that New England had passed from the Empire of the British king . You may discern a trace here and there upon the morass which encompasses the bay beneath us , of the military road , over which the rough soldiers of the Continental army dragged " The black-mouthed gun and staggering wain , " * as they stole under the shadow of the night , and the cover of a heavy cannonade to take possession of the all-important hills . On the morning of the fifth March , 1776 , the British General 's prac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of eld-of a poetic image of singular beauty , reminds me that the piece of Bryant , in the first number of the Democratic Review , from which it is taken , has already passed into our literature as one of the finest productions of his genius . After havin* gone the rounds of the papers , American and Engliab , it has become naturalized in our thoughts , and I see one or other of its many striking images or passages daily quoted in addresses , orations , and newspaper articles ; and yet the very poem , to which this highest possible homage has been thus involuntarily rendered , was sneered at on its publication , by the Whig press , as " some inferior lines by Bryant "  --  and as being " not equal to his usual strain "  --  and once the reason was gravely assigned that its mediocrity was probably occaaioned by the dulness consequent on writing for a Democratic Review . // tised eye discovered the occupation of those heights , and discerned that if maintained , it would be fatal to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislodge the rebels at daybreak the next morning , which moodily proceeded in a dark tempestuous night to effect its landing . A presentiment of another bloody Bunker 's Hill chilled the stout hearts of the veterans , and the utmost efforts of the officers were required to induce the men to proceed on their gloomy way . The storm , however , was too furious to admit of the landing of the troops , and the enterprise was abandoned . In the meantime other councils prevailed over the fierce determination of the Commander-in-chief to hold out to the last , and a few days saw the first acknowledged submission of the veteran troops of the British line , to the raw levies of the Continental army . To the right of the famous heights you see over the tops of those apple trees , the blue expanse of the ocean , which , soon after the occupation of the heights , was whitened with the departing sails of the British fleet . From the spot where we now sit , many earnest eyes were anxiously bent upon the lessening masts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last sail , hovering like a fleecy cloud upon the edge of the horizon , had melted into air , a load seemed to be taken from the heart of every beholder ; and every man drew a long breath of relieved anxiety and assured deliverance . The whole country-side covered the eminences that commanded the sea to observe the receding enemy , and to watch the cloud which had lowered over the coast as well as the town , passing majestically away to threaten with its thunders another region of the land . This first prosperity of the patriot arms seemed to be a happy presage of success , and for a time men felt as if the conflict was ended . But alas ! many a precious life and many an irreparable year was to be expended before those happy dreams became confirmed realities ! It is hard to summon to our mind 's eye , by the necromancy of the imagination , the venerable forms in which our fathers dwelt upon the earth , and to place ourselves , as it were , in bodily presence in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dim past , the mighty passions which swayed their breasts , the various* emotions which distracted their hearts when the stirring scenes of the great revolutionary tragedy absorbed and agitated their souls . It is hard to reconstruct by fancy 's aid , the abodes in which our fathers dwelt on earth , after the hand of the destroyer had passed over them , but it is harder still to recall into a realized existence the chambers of the soul , the labyrinthal mazes of the human heart , and people them with the emotions which struggled for the mastery within their secret recesses . How various were the feelings // which the spectacle of the retreating foe excited in the thousand bosoms of the crowds that watched their flight ! The sense of safety , and a triumphant feeling of success perhaps first absorbed all other emotions ; but another mood soon came over the mind5 of many a beholder , and chastened his joy . Though the triumph was brilliant and full of hope , yet there were not wanting memories , which , like the warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuked the exultation of victory . Though the feast of peace seemed to be piled anew for them , and the harpies driven far away , still the banquet which commended itself to their lips was not without its grim skeleton to damp by its ghastly presence , the exuberance of their transport . Many a household mourned the void which the cruel chances of battle had made in its magic circle . And yet more grieved over the disruption of the dearest ties of blood by the fatal discrepancies of political opinions , and over the exile of kindred hearts . Scarcely a family of any note in the province but had felt the bitter pang of domestic disunion , when the great question of submission or resistance to the parent State was brought to a bloody issue . Though the fleet which had vanished in the distance from their eyes , bore far away from them the hostile legions , which they had dreaded as the instruments of their sub jection to arbitrary power , it also wafted , perhaps forever from their eyes , the companions of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the props of declining age . Many a sigh was breathed , many a tear was shed , many a bitter pang encountered in the secret chambers of yonder city when the streets rung with shouts and blazed with illuminations in honor of the victorious troops that had wrought its deliverence . As we look back to that time , after the lapse of sixty years , we can scarcely realize that any private woes could have chequered the general joy ; but the general doom stamped upon the fortunes of our race by the hand of its Creator , was not reversed for our fathers-it will ever remain unchanged for their children . How unmitigated soever the draught of national or individual prosperity may seem to be , still from the depths of the flower-crowned goblet the fountain of tears is ever welling up its bitter waters and ever " O'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings . " But something too much of this dear reader . Should we walk again together I will lead you to scenes redolent of merrier memories.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
