Hence , we may not exclude from the list of currencies some of the articles adopted as such , by our fathers before the close of the 17th century , merely because they do not tally with those to which we have been accustomed . This introduction now brings us to enter on the course immediately in view . As we advance , it is proposed to remark on currency , not merely in its several species , but also in some of its relations . Long before any permanent settlements were made on the shores of Maine , there was an extensive commerce carried on with the Indians of that territory by the fleets , which annually came from Europe for fish and peltry . In such intercourse , cash was scarcely known . The natives were ready to barter large amounts of skins for beads , knives , hatchets and blankets , and especially for tobacco , powder , shot , guns and strong water . Philanthropists , who desired the highest welfare of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salutary restraints of the gospel , according to the professed purpose of every charter for American colonies , perceived that the most of such merchandize tended to demoralize and render him a dangerous neighbor . They petitioned and obtained restrictions . Their benevolent action , as usual in attempts to suppress gainful but deleterious customs , caused much excitement among the numerous traders , who set more by their own interest than they cared for others ' ruin . The article of peltry , so abundantly oifered by the natives and so eagerly sought by foreigners , was received and passed as cash by the colonists . Another commodity , adopted by them from the aborigines , for a similar end , was wampum . This was brought from Manhadoes , afterwards New York , on a voyage thither in 1628 . It is thus described by Governor Bradford : " That which in time turns most to our advantage is , their now acquainting and entering us into the trade of wampom . By which and provisions , we quite cut off the trade both from the fishermen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great alteration it in a few years makes among the savages . For the Massachusetts and others , in these parts , had scarce any , it being only made and kept among the Pequots and Naragansetts , who grew rich and potent by it ; whereas the rest , who use it not , are poor and beggerly . " Here we have the position , long assumed by the great body of the civilized , that a circulating medium , aside from the fruits of the field and of the chase , tends to enrich and strengthen a people , confirmed by the experience of men in a state of nature . Roger Williams , in his observations on such money of the New England Indians , gives the succeeding account : " Their own is of two sorts , one white , which they make of the stem or stock of the periwinkle , when all the shell is broken off ; and of this sort , six of their small beads , which they make with holes to string their bracelets , are current with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclining to blue , which is made of the shell of a fish , which some English call hens poquahock ; and of MASSACHUSETTS CURRENCY . j this sort , three make an English penny . One fathom of this their stringed money is worth five shillings . " To witness the good credit of what they deemed their choice riches among the emigrants superior to themselves only by means of education must have gratified the natural proprietors of the soil , and afforded them , amid their degradation , a feeling of some independence . In passing from this kind of currency , we come to another . Our fathers having at first neither mints nor banks , except those of the earth and ocean , drew from the former liberal discounts . Of these , was corn . This was used as a generic term , to include several species of grain and even peas . Such and similar productions , together with live stock , lawfully received at the Colonial treasury for public taxes , was often designated by the phrase , " country pay . " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a custom in the old Colony , 1 when a surveyor 1628 ran the lines of a lot of land , to compensate him with a J g n " peck of corn . " It was propounded , 2 that Mr. Phillips 3 should have 1630 allowed him three hogsheads of meale , one hogshead of $ ' malte , four bushels of Indian corne , one bushell of oate meale , halfe an hundred of salte fishe ; for apparrell and other provisions xx lbi or els to have xi lbs given him in money per ann to make his owne prouisions , if hee chuse it the rather . " " It is ordered that Mr Patricke and Mr Sept . Vnderhill shall have allowed them for halfe a yeare 's 7 * prouision two hogsheads of meale , four bushells of malte , ten pounds of powder and leade to make shote , also howse roome prouided for them and 15 lb8 12 s in money to make other prouision from the tyme they begine to keepe howse .

" " Sir Richard Saltonstall is fined four bushells of malte for his absence from Court . " These passages give us an idea of the manner , in which our ancestors long passed several articles of trade as we do cash . Such a paying of grain , as just mentioned , was no unheard of practice in the kingdom , whence the Puritans emigrated . 1 " By the 18th of Elizabeth , it was enacted , that one-third of the rent of all College leases , should be reserved in corn , to be paid either in kind or according to the current prices at the nearest public market . The money arising from this corn rent , though originally but a third of the whole , is , in the present times , according to Dr. Blackstone , commonly near double of what arises from the other two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ensuing items are presented . 2 " It is ordered that labourers shall not take about 12 d a day for their work and not above 6 d and meate and drink under paine of 10 ' ; noe master carpenter , mason , joyner or bricklayer shall take about 16 d a day for their worke , if they have meate and drink and the second sort not above 12 d a day under payne of 10 s both to giuer and receauer . " Oct . " It is ordered that sawers shall not take about 12 d a 19- scoore for saweing oake boards and 10 d a scoore for pyne boards , if they haue their wood felled and squarred for them . " These enactments exhibit a great difference between the prices of labor then and in our day and thus denote how much more the same amount would procure at that period than it now does . Our civil authorities , perceiving the legal restrictions on the rate of beaver had better be repealed , comply with such expediency .

" This sort of money , so introduced to our notice , suggests the ensuing remarks . 2 The method of keeping accounts by our Colonists , relative to specie 3 as well as other currency , was by pounds , shillings , pence and farthings . It was first introduced in England by William the Conqueror . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver , and this to be divided either into twelve shillings of twenty pennies , or twenty shillings of twelve pennies , in accordance with , the table of Troy weight . It was not till several reigns after his , that such a pound was denominated a pound sterling . So reduced had this standard become under Charles the First , who granted the Charter of Massachusetts , that a pound of silver was estimated , while he was on the throne , both here and in the mother country , at more than three times what it was in the days of William . Owing to the unsteady and injudicious system of the predecessors of Charles , for the regulation of the currency , as well as to large debts contracted under his father 's administration , coin was very scarce when our ancestors emigrated to this country . Hence , we have one reason , why they adopted such a medium of exchange , as has been already described . This they applied to their judicial as well as commercial proceedings . 4 " Chickataubott is fyned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Saltonstall .

" It is ordered that corne shall passe for payment of all debts at the vsuall rate it is solde for , except money or beauer be expressly named . " This rule was far from being a dead letter . For over a half century , it continued in full force and operation .

" It is ordered that noe planter March within the limits of this jurisdicon , returneing for England , shall carry either money or beauer with him , without leaue from the Governor , under paine of forfeitinge the money and beauer so intended to be transported . " As an example for such a step , with regard to metallic currency , they had an edict of Q , ueen Elizabeth for a like purpose . While thus vigilant , the civil authorities are careful to enlarge the circulating medium , by promoting the traffic June in peltry. lu lt is agreed that there 2 shalbe a trucking 5 - howse appoynted in eury plantacon whither the Indians may resorte to trade , to avoide there comeing to seuerall howses .

However the animal items of Maverick 's agreement do not come to our ears with such a dignified sound because use has made it so , as the other of a pecuniary sort ; still they were part and parcel of a bona fide contract . While the circulating medium partook of so great a variety , we have another specimen how well it expended . 2 " It is ordered , that maister carpenters , sawers , masons , Oct. clapboard ryuers , bricklayers , tylars , joyners , mowers , &c.; shall not take about 2 s a day , findeing themselves dyett , and not above 14 d a day , if they haue diett found them , under the penalty of 5 s both to giuer and receaver , for euery day that there is more giuen and receaved .

" Whereas by order of Court holden in October last , the wages of workemen were reduced to a certainety in regard of the greate extorcon vsed by dyvers persons of little conscience , and the greate disorder which grewe hereupon by vaine and idle waste of much precious tyme , and expence of those imoderate gaynes in wyne , strong water and other superfluities : nowe , least the honest and conscionable workemen should be wronged or discouraged by excessive prizes of those commodyties which are necessary for their life and comfort , wee have thought it very iust and equall , to sett order also therein ; wee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noe persons shall sell to any of the inhabitants within this jurisdiccon any provision , cloathinge , tooles or other commodities above the rate of 2 foure pence in a shilling more than the same cost or might be bought for ready money in England , on paine of forfeiting the vale we of the thinge solde , except cheese , which , in regard of the much hazard in bringing , and wyne and oyle , vinegar and strong waters , which in regard of leakeing may be solde att such rates ( provided the same be moderate ) as the buyer and seller can agree . And for lynnen and other commodyties , which , in regard of their close stowage and small hazard , may be afforded att a cheape rate , wee doe advise all men to be a rule to themselves in keepeing a good conscience , assureing them , that if any man shall exceede the bounds of moderacon , we shall punish them seuerely . " This enactment of authorities , who meant to be minded , shows the small progress made by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repealed Sept. 2 , 1635. /z/ independence of other countries , which she has long 1533 enjoyed , and would more enjoy , if not indulging fanciful v wants and hurtful extravagances . It would be legislation , passing strange to our ears in this period , to allow extra encouragement on the products of the dairy and of the orchard , because of the pains and perils of importing them . This is an exemplification of the oft suggested thought , that what the necessities of one age render important , the fullness of another renders trivial . *For a further illustration , as to the worth of money in 1634. judicial service , we have the ensuing order . " It was Jan concluded , that the Jury should have ( 3 d a man , and the foreman 12 d , in such cases of controversy as they shall go upon . " Pence would hardly spend so well in law now a days .

" The law so broken , being found of very difficult application , is repealed the next month . While means are thus taken to keep the price of goods and labor within limits , suited to preserve the medium of exchange from depreciating , business is transacted conveniently with the Indian money . 3 " Our neighbours of 12 . Plymouth trade this year at Kenebeck , so as Mr. Winslow carried with him into England , about twenty hogsheads of Beaver , the greatest part whereof was traded for wampampeage .

" While a landlord was thus tied up to economic rules , he was strictly required to suffer no whiffs nor fumes of tobacco within his premises . So restricted , he had little opportunity to play either Shylock or Falstaff . Feeling constrained to increase their means of defence , the General Court pass a law , which wears the appearance 1C35. of more favor for Mars than for Minerva . l " It is ordered J that hereafter farthings shall not passe for currant pay .

Aware that the board at public houses , if extravagant , s v - not only required a corresponding price from the traveller , but also put him in the hazard of contracting a taste for similar fare at his own house , and thus promoted a costly mode of living , ever unfavorable to the pecuniary concerns of community , our civil fathers thus interpose their 1637. authority : " Whearas complaint hath bene also made N v - that diverse pore people , who would willingly content themselves with meane dyet are forced to take such dyet , as is tendered them at 12 d the meale or more ; it is now ordered that every keeper of such Inn or comon victualling house shall sell and allowe vnto every of their guests such victuals as they shall call for , and not force them to take more or other then they desire , bee it never so meane and small in quantity , and shall affoard the same and all other dyet at reasonable prizes vpon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the measure and quantity of the offence .

" The merchants of England and Ireland having sent cargoes hither for sale , and thereby drained the colony of its cash , the legislature pass the subjoined resolve : " Whereas many men in the plantation are in debt and j ( 540. heare is not money sufficient to discharge the same though * . their cattle and goods should bee sould for halfe their worth , as experience hath shewed upon some late executions , whereby a great part of the people in the country may be undone and yet their debts not satisfied , though they have sufficient upon an equall valewation to pay all and live comfortably upon the rest .

And the creditor is at liberty to take his choyce of what goods hee will , and if he hath not sufficient goods to discharge it , then hee is to take his house or land as aforesaid . " In reference to this state of depression , the elder Winthrop thus expresses himself : " The scarcity of money made a great change in all commerce . Merchants would sell no ware , but for money . Men could not pay their debts , though they had enough . Prices of land and cattle fell soon to one half and less , yea , to a third , and after to one fourth part .

Oct . The want of coin enhances the rate of wampum . " It is ordered , that white wampompeage shall passe at four a penny and blew at two a penny and not above 12 d at a time except the receiver desire more . " In conformity with a regulation , now becoming more particular and frequent than before , the General Court fix the price of the subsequent articles , as part of the circulating medium .

This is an indication , that the practice of former years , for embracing within the range of currency , necessary as well as artificial representations of property , was no great departure from sound discretion . We are told , that while the mania of speculation lately filled many minds with nothing but golden dreams , the Messrs . Josephs of New York forwarded a schedule of various stocks to the Rothschilds of Europe . The reply of these shrewd bankers was , 11 We do n't think much of a country that imports its bread .

The occasional necessities for this period , however , did not ; ilvays keep within tin ; limits of the statute . 1 64 1 . To enlarge the funds of exchange and aid to cancel the j e public debts , the civil authorities let out the wampum /q/ trade as well as that of fur , to a certain company . For 1541. this privilege , the stockholders are to reserve one-twen- * tieth of all their peltry for the Colonial treasury , and also to purchase whatever wampum the college may have paid to it , if not exceeding at one time the sum of 25 . One of the same association is authorized to collect wampum , due the government as tribute , from the Block Island and other Indians . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearly payments from the natives , as a bonus for the protection afforded them and an acknowledgment of their subjection , constituted a considerable revenue . To prevent taking advantage of persons , 1 forced to pay j une the demands upon them in live stock , the Court adopt the 1 succeeding method : " Whereas it hath appeared to this Court , that there hath bene much difference in the countrey in the appraisement of cattle , which is conceived to arise from the different rules which men have gone by in such appraisements , this Court having weighed the great inconvenience which may follow upon such appraisement , have thought fit to declare what is conceived to bee the true rule to bee followed in such cases , viz : that it is not to bee iudged the market or true price , which some are forced by urgent necessity to sell a beast for ; but what benefitt may arise by the milke and increase of a cowe , or labor of an oxe , charges of hay &c.; considered , and it is desired that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule .

" The name of these coins was more frequently heard than they were seen and handled . 1644 . While there was impoverishment of estate , measures j** were taken to enrich the intellect . In compliance with advice given by commissioners of the United Colonies , the Legislature order , that each family contribute a peck of corn , or 12 d in money , " to help forward the maintenance of poor scholars in the colledge . " This option , as to the sorts of circulating medium , was exercised more fully in bestowing the products of the field than in the proceeds of the mine . Speaking of an assessment laid on the several towns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1645. selves : " This levy of 616 15/ , each Towne 's proporMay tion is , as above expressed .

" There was a great and fearful embarrassment as to hard money and every species of exchange . A main cause of this was , that the foundations of all confidence were /z/ broken up , and inhabitants continually emigrated to other 1545. parts , in consequence of the contentions in England between the Royalists and Parliament . The head had become confused by jarring elements , and each of its members was deprived of its guide , and compelled to depend on its own resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole face of the country , speedily pass away .

The servant answered him , he could serve him for more of his cattle . But what shall I do ( saith the master ) when all my cattle are gone ? The servant replied , you shall then serve me , and so you may have your cattle again . " J From so distressed a condition of the civilized , we look to one of the instances , in which the riches of the untutored natives frequently took wings and flew away .

" With regard to such money , it began to be a common thing for inventories of deceased Colonists to have among their various items of account , particular sums of wampumpeage . For the purpose of preventing the injury of pecuniary interests , it is enacted , that any individual forging notes of hand , or other paper relative to property , 3 " shall stand in 154 g the pilory three seuerall lecture days , and render double Nov. damages to the party wronged , and disabled to give any evidence or verdict to any Courte or Magistrate .

These , just mentioned , are very much below what they were prior to 1640 . While peltry was desired and sought as a staple commodity of exchange , the Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuing requisition . l " Or- Nov dered that the trading establishments for traffic with ' Indians shall be contributory to the public charges , and pay two pence for every beaver , otter , bear , and moose skin , or forfeit the same . " That we may have an idea how the shell currency of the natives was prepared for ready exchange , we are pre- 1648. sented with the ensuing regulation : 2 " It is ordered for Oct. triall till the next Court , that all passable or payable peage henceforth shalbe intire without breaches , both the white and black , without deforminge spotts , sutably strunge in eight knowne parcells , l d , 3 d , 12 d , 5 ' , in white ; 2 d , 6 d , 2/6 d , and 10 ' , in blacke .

It is enacted , " that it shall not be in the Colon y ws. * Mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or person to pay peage to their 1 ( 549. country rate , nor shall the Treasurer accept thereof . " This example of the Government is soon imitated by the people . To arrest the progress of such a consequence , an injunction of the Court is issued . Its words are , " It is ordered , that wampampeage shall passe current in payment of debts to the vallew of forty shillings ; the white at eight a penny and the black at four so as they be entire and without breaches and deforming spots , except in payment of countrye rates to the Treasurer . " As specie still remains inconveniently scarce , one reason for it is the vigilance with which the authorities of England prevent its exportation hither . In the act of Parliament for incorporating the Society to Promote the Gospel in this country , and thus patronize the labors of Eliot , Mayhew and others among the Indians , there is the subsequent clause . Collections are to be made in the Churches of England and from house to house , l " provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trans- 19 * portation of any gold , silver , plate , bullion or other commodities , prohibited by the laws and statutes of this nation . " As grain and live stock , collected for Colonial taxes , were customarily brought to the Treasurer for being estimated , and such a practice not giving general satisfaction , the Deputies pass the subjoined resolve . 2 " For a 1650. more equal way in the appraising of cattle and other goods to be paid in the several Towns for their country rates , and that the Constables be not put to bring such goods to the Treasurer for appraisement , " it is required that a fit person be employed in each town for this business . The Magistrates concur , if the Treasurer appoint one appraiser , the owner of the property another , and the Marshal be the third . At this period , a change takes place in the pecuniary concerns of Massachusetts , which is in greater harmony with modern predilections , than others previously named . /z/ 1650 . Perceiving that European merchants still drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch , Western Islands , and elsewhere , the Legislature determined to set up a mint of their own . * An additional cause for such a purpose , is , that our vessels , which traded to the West Indies , took considerable quantities of " light Spanish coyne , whereby many people were cousened , and the Colony in danger of being undone thereby ; " and to prevent this deception , it was deemed requisite to have this coin melted down here , and stamped according to its weight and value . Hutchinson informs us , that our commerce to the West Indies brought home part of the bullion , taken by numerous buccaneers from the Spaniards and circulated there , and this was another call for our fathers to make their own coin . Besides , our ancestors were induced so to do , because they supposed the opportunity for it , more promising than any which might be expected for a long time to come . It was but recently , that Parliament had proposed to exchange the Patent of this Colony for a new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjection more closely around the people here . A further consideration was , that our forefathers felt themselves as much justified in being independent of Cromwell , as he was in throwing off the yoke of Royalty . Hence it followed , that so far as they could , without coming to an open rupture with him , they declined the commital of themselves to his policy , and acted for the prosperity of their own Commonwealth . Their intention to establish a mint , was accompanied with circumstances which greatly ward off from them the charge of treason , so often brought againstthem after the fall of the Cromwell administration , and inconsiderately repeated by Robertson and other historians . Still it is evident , from the manner in which our ancestors subsequently defended themselves against the charge of exercising a right of the throne , by issuing specie of their own manufacture , that they felt the force of the position , that /z/ coining money in all States belonged to the supreme power thereof . With respect to such an institution the General Court give their own views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritye of this Courte enacted , that the printed order about money shall be in force vntil the first of September next and no longer . And from and after the first of September next and no longer , the mony hereafter appointed and expressed shall be the current mony of this Commonwealth and no other , vnless English , ( except the receivers consent thereunto . ) Iii pursuance of the intent of this Courte herein , be it further ordered and enacted by the authoritye of this Courte , that all persons whatsoeuer have libertye to bring in vnto the mint howse at Boston , all bullyon , plate or Spanish coyne , there to be melted and brought to the allay of starling silver by John Hull , master of the said mint and his sworne officers , and by him to be coyned into twelve penny , six penny , three penny peeces , which shall be for forme flatt and square on the sides , and stamped on the one side with NE , and on the other side , with the figure xii d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valew of each peece , together with a privy marke , which shall be appointed euery three months by the Gouernor , and knowne only to him and the sworne officers of the mint . And further , the sayd master of the mint aforesaid is hereby required to coyne all the said money of good silver of the just allay of new starling English mony , and for valew to stampe two pence in a shilling of less valew than the present English coyne , and the lesser peeces proportionably . And all such coyne , as aforesaid , shall be acknowledged to be the currant coyne of this Commonwealth , and passe from man to man in ail payments accordingly , within this jurisdiccon only . And the mint master for himselfe and officers , for their paynes and labour in melting and refining and coyning , is allowed to take one shilling out of every twenty shillings which he shall stampe and it shall be in the liberty of any person who brings into the mint howse any bullion , plate or Spanish coyne , to be present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alloyed , and then to take a receipt of the master of the mint for the weight of that which is good silver alloyed as aforesaid , for which the mint master shall deliver him the like weight in currant mony , viz. euery shilling to weigh three penny troy weight and lesser pieces proportionally , deducting allowance for coinage as before expressed . And that this order , being of so great concernment , may not in any particular thereof fall to the ground , it is further ordered that Mr Richard Bellingham , Mr Wm Hibbens , Mr Edward Rawson , Capt John Leverett and Mr Thomas Clarke , be a committe appointed by this Court to appoint the mint howse in some convenient place in Boston , to give John Hull master of the mint the oath suitable to his place , and to approve of all other officers and determine what else shall appeare to them necessary to be done for the carrying an end of the whole order . " This document , as will appear from the sequel , was of no trivial results to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto obscure and unsettled question When did the custom of computing in Old England currency go down in our country ? It is plain from the legislative enactments , that there was a departure in Massachusetts from the method of calculating in Old England sterling , immediately in succession to Sept. 1 , 1652 . But the appointed standard of our first coin did not vary so much , in the estimation of our Legislature , from that of the London mint , as it soon did . Still from the alloy , expense and wastage of the bullion here , reckoned by European financiers as 22 J per cent. , and also the prejudice in the mother country against our coin , it would be very probable , had we no other proof , that the difference of exchange between our coin and that of London , speedily amounted to 25 per cent . In addition to this , however , we have the report of a Committee , designated by the General Court in 1654 , which expressly states , that our coin passed abroad at the discount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is reason to believe , that no sooner did our coin reach the London market , than it was valued at a rate one quarter lower than theirs , and that thus the /z/ standard of New England currency was fixed as early as 1 ( 553 1653 . True , this pecuniary alteration has been allotted to 1690 , when our government ordered bills of credit to be emitted . But such an assumption does not appear to be confirmed by the data already cited . Not satisfied with the means of obtaining an increased medium of circulation for purposes of traffic , serious thoughts are entertained of resorting to paper money , in addition to what had been already issued by individuals . This , as well as other concerns of a similar nature , is apparent in the ensuing extract . It is a report accepted by the Legislature . Its language is , 1 " What hath bin thought of June , by any for raiseing a Banke or engaging in generall trade or relating to monies in regard of the badnesse of it , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters tending to the promoting and well regulating of trade , will by this means be ripened , and things reduced to a more comfortable state , than wee now find . " In a subsequent apology to the King , our fathers , alluding to this period , say , 2 " For some years paper bills passed for payment of debts , which were very subject to be lost , rent or counterfeited , and other inconveniences . " Relative to the further promotion of the mint . The following is the oath administered to the mint masters . 3 " Whereas you , John Hull and Robert Saunderson , are u. appointed by the order of the Generall Courte , bearing date the 10 th of June , 1652 , to be officers for the Massachusetts Jurisdiccon in New England , for the melting , refyning and cojning of silver , you doe here sweare by the great name of the Euerlasting God , that you will faithfully and diligently performe the duty of your places , that all mony cojned by you shall be of the just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be of due weight , viz. three penny troj weight , and all other peeces proportionably , according to the order of Courte so neere as you can . So helpe you God . " " At a meeting of the Committee for carrying an end of 2 /z/ g HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF 1652. the or ( er concerning mony , it was determined , First , that there should be a mint howse and all tooles and implements necessary thereto , built and procured at the countrje 's charge , which is in acting and a declaration accordingly made . Second , that warrants should issue out to the constables of Boston for the pressing of Isacke Culljmore for that service , which was done . Third , that another warrant should issue out to the said Isacke Culljmore for the empowring him to presse other workmen , carpenters , &c.; as may joyne with him in the countrje 's service , which was done . Fourth , that the said mint howse shall be sett vppon the land of the said John Hull , and alsoe it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hull , that whenever either by his death or otherwise the said John Hull shall cease to be the mint master , that then the countrje shall have the ground y e howse stands vppon at such prize as two indifferent men equally chosen by the countrje and sajd John Hull or his assignes , shall determine , or else the said John on the like termes have the said howse as two indifferent men shall judge it to be worth at the choice of the countrje . " Here we have a sample of the manner in which our ancestors transacted business . Though not the most loving friends of royalty , yet they had no small spice of it in the execution of their orders . With them , it was no sooner said than done . As to the building for the manufacture of coin , it did not call in requisition the talents of a Sir Christopher Wren nor would it fully compare with many stately piles of our metropolis . It was ordered to be made of wood , to be sixteen feet square , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however circumscribed in its materials and dimensions , was then pointed out to the stranger as an object of more than ordinary curiosity . Certainly it did not deserve the rebuke of an adage , common in that day , " Twelve pence laid out on the purse , and only six pence in it . " Scarcely had the coin of our Colony seen the light , and excited the gaze of unsatiated curiosity , before it was /q/ beset by the inventions of fraud . Such an evil was 155 speedily taken in hand by the Legislature . Their words " follow . l " For the prevention of washing or clipping of Oct. all such peices of money , as shall be cojned within this 19 jurisdicon , it is ordered by this Courte and the authoritie thereof , that henceforth all peices of money cojned aforesaid , shall have a double ring on either side , with this inscription Massachusetts , and a tree in the center on the one side and New England , and the yeere of our Lord , on the other side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve their currency , they were extremely low in funds , and constantly looking for an attack from a Dutch fleet . On this occasion , their language is , " As the countrje is in 1654. debt , no stock in the treasury , no meanes , at present , to raise any , so that workemen can not be procured to finish the Castle , which yett is necessary forthwith to be done , " the several military companies must do it ; one division of them by having each of their soldiers labor three days on this fortification , and another by being individually assessed 4 s 6 d . Thus troubled for the want of money , our fathers were also troubled about the little which was circulated . They saw , that however they had their coin less valuable than foreign , which rather tended to keep it at home , still it found vents enough to threaten its almost entire withdrawal from our shores . To hinder a result of this kind , General Court adopt , for substance , the succeeding report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mony within this Commonwealth is for the more easy managing 1 General Court Records . such a tree , that the battle of Bunker 2 A pine tree appears to have been Hill was fought by our forces . So a favorite symbol with the authorities long ago as when the Britons paid of Massachusetts . They used it at taxes to the Romans , they used the this time , when expecting that events coin , among others , which had a tree would so occur in England , as to on it , and which Camden supposes afford them an opportunity of being to be money paid for assessments on an independent people . When they wood land . The pine tree , as used declared themselves free from British by our immediate ancestors , was rule , they had it appointed on the probably more as a sign of permaState flag , April 11 , 1776 .

" Therefore no coin of this Colony , except 20 s to pay each individual 's expenses , is to be exported on forfeiture of the transgressor 's whole estate . They further require , that a searcher for money be appointed in every port of entry . Such repeated endeavors to keep specie from being carried out of the country , show how difficult it was to have legal enactments for this purpose strictly observed , when the balance of trade came in conflict with them . Suidas relates the legend , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must be just . So , would any people be just to themselves , and save their coin from being inordinately drawn from them , they must send , at least , as much abroad in commerce , as they have in return . l " A country , " says Montesquieu , " that constantly exports fewer manufactures or commodities , than it imports , will soon find the balance sinking ; it will receive less and less , till , falling into extreme poverty , it will receive nothing at all . " In order to meet the exigencies of the time , and to continue the credit of various articles as a legal tender , the Aug. ensuing regulation is made by the government . 2 " All * contracts for mony , come , cattle or ffish , shalbe satisfyed in kind , accordinge to covenant , or in default of the very kind contracted for , in one of said kinds .

By 18 strings of peage for tribute , at 6 a penny , 45 . " Thus we have renewed notice , that the currency of the natives was not yet supplanted by the brighter products of the ore , and was still paid as the earnest of their fealty . As an instance of trouble , which frequently attended the bringing of stock to our metropolis , for the payment of Colonial rates , we have the story of Nicholas Norton , late Constable of Weymouth .

John Dickenson , late Constable of Salisbury , petitions General Court , that , having taken boards in payment for taxes , from people of his own town , because they had no corn and Treasurer would not allow him so much for the boards , as he did he may have redress . To promote a wider diffusion of the Indian money , as well as to prevent the continuance of oppressive monopoly , the commissioners of the United Colonies interpose their authority in the subsequent case . l Being informed that 1658 the " Montackett " sachem had hindered the Pequods from getting shells to make wampum , they required him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Being introduced to the King , while on a visit to London , he was permitted to kiss his hand . 1 Colonial Records . 3 Chalmers . * Massachusetts Archives Pecu- 4 Mass . Archives Political vol. niary , vol. i . Life of Thomas Hollis . /q/ This sovereign discoursed with him on the state of affairs IQQ. in Massachusetts , and discovered great warmth of feeling - against them . Among other things , he said , that they had invaded his right by coining money . Governor Temple told him , that the colonists thought it no crime to make money for their own use . In course of the interview , Mr. Temple took some of our coin from his pocket and presented it to the king . Seeing a tree on one of the pieces , Charles inquired what sort of a tree that was . The immediate reply was , it was the royal oak , which preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king to good humor , and induced him to hear the pleas which the governor made in favor of our colony . It is presumed from the character of Mr. Temple , that on this occasion he intended no deceit , but a pleasant , figurative allusion to a remarkable preservation of his majesty . Among the severe trials of our government , was their 1665. being called to an account by the royal commisioners , % who had come hither , respecting their mint . Thus they had the fruit of the dissatisfaction , so openly expressed by the King to Governor Temple . The commisioners declared , according to the generally received opinion of Europe , that the coining of money was a royal prerogative , for the usurping of which , the act of indemnity was the only salvo . They bore so hard on our civil authorities , in this and other respects , that they refused any further conference with them , and made an appeal to the throne . In this document we have the ensuing passage : 1 " Royal Sir , a just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charter , wee have and doe l ' professe and practise and have by our oathes of allegiance to your majesty confirmed . But to be placed vpon the sandy foundations of a blinde obedience vnto that arbitrary , absolute and unlimited power , which these gentlemen ( i. e. commissioners ) would impose vpon us , who in their actions towards us , haue carried it , not as indifferent persons towards us . This , as it is contrary to your /z/ 1 665. majestye 's gracious expressions and the liberties of English- s v x men , so wee can not see reason to submit thereto . " As a step towards softening the asperity of the King 1666. w n could ill brook the independence of our ancestors Sept. in establishing their mint they order " two very large masts , " to be transported to London for his majesty 's Q ct navy . They soon add to this present a ship load more of 11- smaller sized spars. 1 However , given to understand by the royal agents from London , that their continuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown , yet our rulers did not slack in their exertions for its furtherance . Perceiving that the mint masters , Messrs . Hull and Saunderson , made large profits by their employment , they applied to them , by a committee , to pay rent for their use of the building 166 7. and apparatus . A report is made , that those two gentleOct men will allow 40 for past occupation , and 10 annually in future , on a lease of seven years . 1668 . A computation being made , as to the average cost of 25 transporting the produce for taxes , from different parts of the colony to Boston , it was found to be not less than onetenth . To avoid , in some degree , such loss , the Treasurer is instructed to pay the colonial creditors out of the commodities collected for rates , in the towns where they reside . Oct .

" Such proposals , in one form or another , were frequently made in order to regulate the medium of exchange . 1 Sir Henry Ashurst and other there , to pay for the expenses of friends of our Colony , being in Lon- sending these presents to England , don , are empowered to hire 1,000 2 Mass . Archives Maritime , vol. i. /z/ The following is the caption of a report made to the 1669 . Assembly relative to a similar subject : 1 " Being sensible N jjT ' of the great necessitie of money for the more easie and 2. equal carrying on of commerce amongst us , and finding that coyning hath not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaynes great want of a further supply . " With this introduction , a proposal is made to repeal the law , which forbad all foreign coin , except of the mother country , to pass current ; and to make each piece-of-eight , made of the finest sterling silver at 6 s , and its halves , quarters and eighths in like proportion , and other money at the same rate . This plan was evidently promoted by the petitions previously mentioned , but was not approved by the magistrates , and consequently delayed to be enforced . To meet a change in the negotiations of business , the 1670. subsequent order is passed : 2 " Whereas the law titled Oct - payments doth make corne , cattle and fish equall with money and to be payd as money , when money is indented for , which , at that time , when the law was made , was as good as money , but now is otherwise and proveth prejudiciall on several accounts , " therefore contracts for specie , shall be paid in specie . The project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of England , being kept on the tapis , and becoming increasingly popular , is now adopted . " Whereas 1672. peeces-of-eight are of more value to carry out of the Of*-country then they will yeild to mint into our coyne , by reason whereof peeces-of-eight which might else come to coyning are carried out of the country , It is therefore ordered by this Court and the authority thereof , that all peeces-of-eight , that are full weight and good silver , that is of six shillings of N.

" Notwithstanding the obstructions thrown in the way of the mint here by royal authority , it is leased again , in 167 5. accordance with the subsequent report : " That the forJul y mer masters of the mint , Robert Saunderson and John Hull , doe continue to mint what silver bullion shall come in for this seven yeares next to come , if either of them liue so long , and doe receive of those that bring bullion to the mint as a full reward for their pains twelve pence for every twenty shillings , and three pence for the waste of every three ounces of sterling silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whole for euery twenty shillings , and the sayd minters are to pay into the Treasurer of the Country in money twenty pounds per ami. during abouesaid terme . " So pressing was the want of specie , experienced by the government , in consequence of Philip 's war , they offer to abate twenty-five per cent , on taxes , payable in grain , to all who advance cash . l During the same disastrous contest , such discount reached one half the estimated price of country pay . A mode , having some approximation to paper currency , is now introduced . It is thus expressed by the LegislaNov. ture : " For prevention of the charge and trouble of a transportation of the rates to be leveyed , to the Treasurer of the country , as also matter of convenience , therein appearing , It is ordered , that bills for wages , horses , provisions , &c.; being regularly passed to the sayd Treasurer , /z/ the Treasurer vpon the desire of persons concerned , shall 1675. repasse bills to the Constables of such Townes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aforesayd accounts .

Hull and others , and find no other expedient but the raysing of the vallue of our coyns or making our money for future higher by nine or twelve grains , or making the mint free ; for the first , if it be done , three half pence in the shilling and the law for exportation of money duly attended , we hope it may obtain what is desired , the matter of paying coynage out of the Treasury , we find the charge uncertain , but great , and both expedients attended with difficulty , and therefore judge them worthy of further consideration .

For several years a plan had been on foot in the Colony , gf to have a free mint , or have bullion coined at it without any charge to its owner . * Reasons assigned by a writer for a change of this kind were , that it would remove general complaint , lessen the languishment of trade , and increase the amount of specie . Among his remarks were these , that foreign coins came from the mint 6J per cent , less in value than they entered ; that the stamp on our money added nothing to its real worth " a Spanish Cross in all other places being as well esteemed as a New England Pine ; " that little coin was now made here compared with what used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion circulated in the other colonies . 1681 .

" With their conduct thus watched and criticised in London , our ancestors were soon to experience the feared , but deprecated suspension of their Charter privileges . This event they soon realize . Though the long estab- 1686. lished form of our Colonial Government had departed , and May its remains had come into hands of greater reputed royalty , to be modified and administered according to their instructions from the Crown , still the doors of our coining establishment were not yet closed . 2 This institu- j u j y tion became the occasion of another report from the Earl 15. of Rochester , Lord High Treasurer of England . Such a document advanced , as reasons why the mint here should be abolished , that a similar establishment had been refused to Ireland , even after being allowed to Sir Thomas Vyner and others in 1662 , and another to Jamaica in 1679 , applied for by the Governor of that Island , the Earl of Carlisle , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Parliament .

This , like other kindred institutions , was hailed as the object of fresh and cheering hope . It was undoubtedly regarded by its advocates as promising them much more of a golden harvest than they realized . As the project of 1 Mass . Archives Usurpation , vol. i. /q/ enterprizing merchants in both hemispheres , it must have 16g6 been viewed as a new bond of union between the Colony - and its mother kingdom . Experience , however , probably taught them that banking was not so much a surer road to wealth than minting , as their sanguine expectations predicted . The history of that age , and of every other , as to commercial countries , has proved that no plans for enlarging the currency of a Commonwealth can really flourish , unless based on the earnings of its honest and industrious population . How long or how far the preceding Corporation continued their operations , we are unable to tellj because the records of the Presidential government of New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were left here only in loose and comparatively small fragments . This much , however , is certain , that if it existed , as it very probably did , till the Revolution of 1689 , it did not survive any longer . As almost an entire stranger among the computed institutions of currency in our country , we quote the ensuing paragraph in relation to it , from a rare tract published in 1714. 1 " About twenty eight years ago , our fathers entered into a partnership to circulate their notes , founded on land security , stamped on a paper , as our Province bills , which gave no offence to the Government then and at that time , when the prerogative of the Crown was extended further than ever has been since . " The Bank , to which this refers , had much resemblance , in its regulations , to one formed in London , 2 1683 , which did not keep long in operation . Though the administration of Sir Edmund Andros was deemed very oppressive by the most of our Provincials , and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it did not refuse to accommodate many of the people , in receiving from them country pay for their rates . 3 It carried the spirit of accommodation so far , as to permit 1687. the public demand on Hingham to be paid in milk pails . Its coffers were kept open for the treasures of the field , /z/ 1688. as well as of the mine . One report of the Treasury states its funds thus : Com remaining unsold , ... 938 11/1 . Money , ........ 1,340 10/3. 1687 A considerable means of enlarging the specie circulation , was e arr va f severa l vessels , fitted out in Boston and elsewhere , with Indian divers , from some Spanish wrecks on the north side of Hispaniola . Such vessels brought from these sunken argosies , treasures of various sorts and amounts . It was from the same source , that Sir William Phips derived his title and his fortune . Still , a supply of this kind was nothing near equal to the increased charges to which many persons were subjected , in defending their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely for new deeds of them , 1688. r m meeting the claims of quit rent on them . l The inhabitants of Cambridge having been engaged in controversy with Edw d Randolph , who tried to get a large piece of their territory , thus express themselves in a petition to the throne : " Royal Sir , we have no way to procure money to defend our cause in the law therefore unto our Royal master , as the public father of all your subjects , do we make this our humble address for relief . " 2 With the recovery of their freedom , by the overthrow of the Usurpation , our ancestors renewed their exertions to sustain the Boston mint . 3 They sent a petition to William and Mary , for permission to coin money , as they had done . But this request does not appear to have had a favorable reading , and of course the coining establishment , which seems to have been suspended under the late administration , must soon have received its final quietus . Thus fell an institution , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and against which expressions of regal dissatisfaction had been often uttered . Formed 1 Hutchinson . Narrative of New 3 Mass .

However the mint was thus absolutely terminated , yet the products of its operation were long current in our country . Down to the Revolution of our Independence , they were often seen , and passed readily in business transactions , with other coin . 1 Disappointed as to the renewal of their mint , and borne down to the very dust by the burden of debt , 2 incurred by the failure of an expedition against Canada , the General Court saw no other choice than to form a Provincial Bank , and issue paper money . Let their own words tell the cause for such a measure . 3 " Whereas for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hostile invasions of their French and Indian enemies , who have begun and are combined in the prosecution of a bloody war upon the English of their Majesties Colonys and Plantations of New England , this Colony hath necessarily contracted sundry considerable debts , which this Court taking into consideration , and being desirous to approve themselves just and honest in the discharge of the same , and that every person who hath credit with the country for the use of his estate , disbursements or service done for the public , may in convenient time receive due and equal satisfaction ; withal considering the present poverty and calamities of the country , and , through scarcity of money , the want of an adequate measure of commerce , whereby they are disadvantaged in making present pay- 1 Thomas Hutchinson , afterwards 2 Gov .

Notwithstanding all the safeguards which an honest and anxious government threw around such a price of their defeat in Canada , they were mortified and alarmed to perceive , that it failed to have a strong hold on popular confidence . x To aid in the prevention of a panic , relative to monied concerns , and ever injurious to community , Sir Wm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a large amount of his coin for the Province paper . Still he found the common fear stronger than his persuasion and example greater than the funds of his wealth . The result proved most oppressive , where it always does in similar exigencies . 2 The soldiers , who survived the perils and pains of the expedition , the widows and orphans of their companions , who perished in the disastrous enterprise were compelled , by want , to receive their dues in public bills , and to part with them at a discount of at /z/ least one third . This opened a new source for speculation , 1690. with the usual pleas and objections for its being practised . " l lt is ordered tat the bills out and to be emitted , shall not exceed 40,000 , " which is supposed will amount to May the full of what the country is indebted , and will probably be called in again by the rates already granted . " Here was a hopeful anticipation , which was not happily realized , because the protraction of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishment of Oct. their purpose , General Court require that 10,119 9 s in 23 bills , collected by the Treasurer , be consumed by a committee . Thus began a burning process , which was repeated over a half century . Curiosity has preserved no residuum of the bills , as the Repository of the Royal Artillery at Woolwich has of the Bank of England notes , in a case of glass , for the examination of visitors . 2 A writer of this period , in describing the unwillingness of many to take the paper currency , asks , " Is the security of one Plantation magistrate in the West Indies better than that of all the Massachusetts Representatives ? " He adds , that the French in Canada had more faith in the promise of their government , for they readily took the notes issued from their treasury . 3 To rectify the diminution of our paper , the ensuing order is passed . " Whereas theire Majesties affaires within 1692. this Province do require a speedy advance for y e defence of y e Province and y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian enemies , and there being no stock at present in y e Treasury to supply y e same , or to defray other y e necessary charges for support of y e government , be it therefore enacted that all Bills of publick creditt issued forth by order of y e Generall Court of y e late Collony of y e Massachusetts Bay , shall pass current within this Province in all payments equivalent to money , and in all public payments at 5 per cent , advance . And for encouragement to such persons as are possessors of said Bills , to lend them for y e service of y e publick , it is further /z/ enacted that they shall be secured by y e publick Taxes and other Revenues , and shall be reimburst in money within twelve moneths . " This remedy for restoring the paper to a par with specie , had its intended efficacy for about twenty years . l The bonus of five per cent , was allowed as often as the bills were brought to the exchequer , though several times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly issued . This , which was more than six per cent , a year , virtually contradicts the ensuing representation of Smith , in his Wealth of Nations , certainly in part , as to Massachusetts . " The paper currencies of North America consisted not in bank notes payable to the bearer on demand , but in a government paper , of which the payment was not exigible till several years after it was issued . And though the Colony government paid no interest to the holders of this paper , they declared it to be , and in fact rendered it , a legal tender of payment for the full value for which it was issued . But allowing the Colony security to be perfectly good , 100 payable in fifteen years hence , for example , in a country where interest is at six per cent. , is worth little more than 40 ready money . To oblige a creditor , therefore , to accept of this money as full payment for a debt of 100 , actually paid down in ready money , was an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been attempted by the governments of any other country , which pretended to be free . " Such language evidently shows , that Mr. Smith looked only at the worst features of our Provincial paper currency , and not at its best . Besides , a considerable portion of the Province bills were redeemed sooner than he appears to have supposed . With regard to the loan of the bills to government , which a considerable number of merchants in Boston made , it did not operate so punctually , as was anticipated . In the petitions of the latter , they regret , that though the time had expired several months , yet the treasury had no coin to satisfy their claims . 1 Boston Gazette , Aug. 20 to 27 , 1739. /q/ Among the various evils , aside from those of witchcraft , 692. which attracted public attention , was the counterfeiting of ** the hard money . x The Legislature felt themselves called Nov. to deal with this crime more severely than before . Besides 24 ' other judicial inflictions , those convicted of it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cropped . Still , though this and other severer measures were adopted , the organ of acquisitiveness , if we may use a phrenological phrase , had developed itself so inordinately in some , they braved the terrors of justice and aimed to debase the currency for their own gain . While thus guarding the medium of exchange by penal enactments , our civil fathers strove to improve it in other respects . They say 2 " Forasmuch as the abatement of 1 693 . Interest hath always been found beneficial to y e advance- J " ne ment of Trade and improvement of lands by good husbandry , " and they order that the long standing eight per cent . 3 interest be reduced to six . Of the frequent difficulties , which attended the transportation of country pay for taxes , we select the following : 4 A constable of Springfield , employed to collect the Province rates , received 130 bushels of peas . As the water carriage was most preferable , he had to make seven or eight journeys to Hartford and two to Boston , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taken on freight . But however such toil was at an end , his chief anxiety begins . His adventure in descending the Falls of Connecticut River met with a sad mishap and was rendered unsaleable by being wet with the water . His townsmen laid his case before General Court , desiring , June that as he was in the way of his duty for the public , he 14. might not bear the loss . They lent a favorable ear to the petition . Such a mode of gathering the public rates , being found thus inconvenient , and paper money serving the same purpose with much greater facility and economy , it appears 1 Massachusetts Province Records . us that the law of England reduced 2 Massachusetts Archives Pecu- the interest there in 1623 , from ten to niary , vol. i. eight , and in 1660 from eight to six . 3 Essay on the governing causes of 4 Massachusetts Archives Pecuthe Natural Rate of Interest , informs niary , vol. i. /z/ 1693. to have been last practised in 1694 , with the exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of date . Thus was grain , as a currency , shut out from its principal course of circulation . Still , the custom was clothed , in the view of the aged , with the veneration and attachment of antiquity . Having associated itself with their youth , business and predilections , as well as with those of their fathers , they could not suffer it to depart without wishful looks and heartfelt adieus. 1 With a partial reference to the custom so terminated , we adduce an extract from a female traveller : " They give the title of merchant to every trader , who rates his goods according to the time and specie , they pay in ; viz. pay , money , pay as money and trusting . Pay is grain , pork and beef , &c.,; at the prices set by the General Court .

Pay as money , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and trust , as they agree for the time . When the buyer comes to ask for a commodity , sometimes before the merchant answers that he has it , he says , ' is your pay ready ? ' Perhaps the chap replies , * yes .

The buyer having answered , then the price is set ; as suppose he wants a 6 d knife , in pay it is 12 d ; in pay as money , 8 d , and hard money , its own value , 6 d . It seems a very intricate way of trade , and what Lex Mercatoria had not thought of . " 1694 .

While j ) ec . there was this tendency in hard money to go abroad , as 22. the stream to find its level , it was considerably increased by means which held no sympathy with honest gain . 2 Bucaneers , who had nefariously pushed their fortunes in various seas , secretly brought liberal portions of their ill-gotten wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3 imprisoned in our metropolis and thence transported to London , where they paid the forfeit of their crime on the gallows .

These , with others still out , were the only paper currency passing in all New England . How often or how much of it was emitted from the Treasury up to this time , was not particularly recorded among the transactions of the General Court . But no doubt the amount of it for such a period , as repeatedly issued and printed , must have been large , for the computation of that day . 3 In reviewing the history of their paper currency , the House of Representatives inform us , that the taxes assessed from 1692 to 1702 , inclusive , were nearly 11,000 , one year with another . As it was customary for the Treasurer to pay the public debts with bills , before the taxes were collected , it is very probable , that the emissions and re-emissions of such money exceeded 110,000. 4 Having been put in circulation before the arrival of the second Charter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nov. 5 The public being strongly desirous for more paper 21 * currency , the Legislature vote to issue 10,000 . The cause for such a step is thus given . " Forasmuch as by reason of the extream scarcity of money , and the want of other medium of commerce , the trade of this Province is greatly obstructed , and the affairs of the Government very much hindered , the payment of the publick debts and taxes retarded , and in great measure rendered impracticable , to the discouragement of souldiers and seamen ' Discourse on Currencies . 4 Discourse on Currencies .

The brick ware-house of Thomas Palmer on the Dock in Boston , was broken open , and a large iron chest with nine bolts was robbed of its contents , amounting to 4,000 or more , in pieces-of-eight and other Spanish and New England coins , and in bills of credit . Several persons were suspected . The Governor issued a proclamation , offering pardon to all confessors of the crime , except the principal and immediate actor , and a reward of ten per cent , for all of the property returned , which was to be paid by the owner . 1 As a specimen of pecuniary remittances , the ensuing 1708. is presented . " Any merchants or others that have any u money at New York , and want to remit the same by bills of exchange to Boston , let them apply themselves to Mr. Benjamin Faneuil of New York , where they may be supplied .

They were assured by her Majesty , that her Exchequer should meet the costs of any expedition against the Canadas . Thus encouraged , they soon yielded to her proposal . But such an attempt was not to be made without price . For its /z/ 1709. commencement , there was but little specie in the country . More paper currency must be provided . 1 Accordingly it is enacted that 30,000 be issued , with 10,000 of the former emission . The printer has particular instruction to impress a " scrowle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to prevent counterfeits. " 1711 . After some delay , for want of orders from the Crown , General Hill and Admiral Walker obtain 10,000 more in our bills to supply the land and sea forces . For the amount of both sums , bills of exchange are to be drawn on the Royal Exchequer , at the advance of forty per cent . Thus another quantity of paper , large for the age , is called out by an enterprise , like that which produced the first issue of such money from the Treasury . Both of these occasions were prolific sources of evil to the Province . Had they been crowned with success , they would have been differently considered . Not the least of their undesirable effects was fastening upon community a medium of exchange , unaccompanied with a necessary proportion of specie to keep it safe , which finally impoverished thousands , and became the origin of party animosities . Had the event been proportionate to the freeness , with which our fathers poured out their treasure and blood , they would not have again experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were yet to make more energetic efforts , to endure many hardships , to lose multitudes of lives , and to expend immense sums , before the flag of France was to be struck on the ramparts , which skirted the North and West of the British Territory . 2 Another evil , consequent on the second crusade , as it was here construed against Canada was , that it brought the rest of New England and other Colonies under a sort of necessity of emitting bills of credit to pay their quotas of military forces . This was an inlet of much unsafe currency into our jurisdiction , which tended to diminish the value of what Massachusetts issued . 1 Massachusetts Archives Pecu- 8 Discourse on American Colonial niarj , vol. ii . Currencies . /z/ With regard to the emissions of this Province , there 17 n was a further cause , which operated unfavorably to them . After their first year , they stood well till 1712 . Then they visibly and gradually lost public confidence . This was owing to the manner , in which our government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l The new emission of 1703 was to be cancelled by taxes on polls and estates , in some over a year . This was as soon as the public rates could be conveniently collected , and therefore not an injudicious step of the government . Other emissions , to 1707 , were to be redeemed from one and a half to nearly two years . But in the year just named , the gathering of the taxes , so that the issues of paper might be recalled , was put off for three years ; in 1709 , for four years , ' in 1710 , for five years , and 1711 for six years . By such management , the burden of public debt was increased , and the Province bills accordingly multiplied and depreciated . The faith of the people being thus shaken , with regard to this currency , it becomes less and less , to an alarming and injurious degree , as we shall have occasion to notice . At first view , such a change should not have been suffered by government ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their avoiding of its commencement and continuance . The voice of a protracted and expensive war , continually and imperiously demanded of them more money than the inhabitants could pay without much depression , or than they could punctually obtain . They were under such a pressure , that they unwillingly submitted to the evil of burdening a future period with the expenses of the present ; of rendering the children liable to pay the debts of their fathers . 2 As an example of the worth of money in labor , the following is presented : Carpenters had 5 s a day for building the Town House of Boston , in 1712 , with silver at 8 a an ounce . As explanatory of a mode in which the paper of other Provinces was circulated in ours , we have the succeed- /z/ 1712. m S : * " Her majesty 's government of the Province of New TT Hampshire , have ordered a certain sum of their bills of 2. public credit to be deposited in the hands of Mr. James Pemberton of Boston , merchant , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are worn out and unserviceable , may repair to have them exchanged . " Nov. 2 j n orc er t o arrest the downward progress of the credit , sustained by paper currency , there is a repeated enactment that it shall be , at all events , specialties of contract excepted , a legal tender . This measure failed of its purpose . Under its long continuance , many debtors delayed their payments so as to meet them with bills , purchased at an increasingly reduced rate . Such management was the spring of numerous litigations . Then they who were no more closely clad with the garb of honesty , than to put it off as expediency might dictate , exhibited their propensity . Then such acquired temporary gain , if that may be called so , which destroys principle , peace and reputation , while those of sterner integrity , lost in their worldly possessions , though increasing in a thousand fold more in habits of moral excellence and in conscious rectitude .

" 1714. 3 At this period , there were three dominant parties with reference to pecuniary concerns . One , adopting the principle of antiquity , " nil utile , quod non , honestum nothing is useful , but what is honest , expressing their views of paper currency , contended that this should be abolished and no currency allowed , except that of the precious metals . A second , both numerous and respectable , who were urgent for a private bank , based on real estate . A third , no less large and honorable , who favored a system of loaning by the Province to the inhabitants on interest , payable annually , and applied to liquidate public 1 Boston News Letter .

The advocates for a bank hold up , among several inducements , that if allowed to establish one , they will promote the erection of a J bridge over Charles River . The reply , subsequently made to this from the press , shows a prevailing want of acquaintance with such works , and how they were suspected by no small number , as nothing more than fancies of a disordered intellect . It follows : " One great thing proposed , hath been the building of a bridge over Charles River , and that it would be a service to us . This , I look at to be next to building castles in the air . For if we could sink 40 or 50,000 in building such a bridge , the matter is uncertain , whether it would answer the end . For I ca n't learn of a fast bridge over such a river where there is such a stream in the whole world . " Could Charlestown bridge , however forlorn its aspect , and the similar avenues to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to such writers ? But , not to lose the clue of our course , the question respecting the bank , produced many spirited pros and cons . Among the merchants of this metropolis , who forcibly argued the claims of such an institution , was John Colman . He asserted , that it would not lessen the coin ; for to his knowledge , it was shipped off as much before bills of credit as afterwards , in proportion to the trade and resources of the Province . He further stated , that the belief of New England in general was , that the country might count on greater depressions , unless there could be issues of notes from private companies as well as from the public treasury . Another argument in favor of this plan was , that it would sever the connection between money and might already in the hands of the government and dangerous to the liberties of the people . On the other hand , his project was not tenderly dealt with by 1 June 4 , 1712 . Rhode Island pro- and Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Charles River .

They severely censured it , as a South Sea bubble , a pandora 's box , an infringement of the regal prerogative , and covering a design for absolute power . These specimens teach us , how the mind of one age answers to the mind of another , when called to the same point of debate . Amid a conflict of this sort , the common voice cried vehemently and repeatedly for more paper money , from some source or another . Feb. l Thus confirmed in their wishes , a considerable number " of gentlemen met at the Exchange Tavern of Boston several times , to have the stock of a proposed bank taken up , and prepare to lay their rules before the General Court for approbation . 2 Hoping to check the prevalent practice of counterfeiting their bills of credit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime more than once , shall sufler death . 3 The amount of bills of credit made and received into the Treasury of Massachusetts from May , 1703 to May , 1714 , was 194,950 13 . Aug. 4 Perceiving that the project of a private bank was likely 20 - to succeed , unless resisted by Legislative interference , the Province Council hold a convention , and vote the following order : " Upon reading a memorial , presented by the Queen 's Attorney General , setting forth , that upon good information , a certain number of gentlemen and merchants are projecting a bank of credit , as they call it , and design speedily to make and emit a quantity of bills to a great value , which is a matter of importance and will necessarily be of general influence , Ordered , that the projectors or undertakers of any such bank do not proceed to print the said scheme , or put the same on public record , make or emit any of their notes or bills , until they have laid their proposals before the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to countenance and encourage any proposals , that may be a benefit and advantage for the public , or for the promotion and encour- 1 Boston News Letter , No. 512 .

" Thus cautioned , the patrons of the intended bank , did not cease to make active exertions for its promotion . They issue the ensuing advertisement : l " Whereas the Aug. trade of this Province is very much embarrassed for want %* of a medium of exchange , and an expedient being proposed to ease this difficulty by circulating bills or notes founded on land security , considerable sums being already subscribed , " there will be attendance at the Sun Tavern of Boston , weekly , to complete the subscriptions for entering into partnership . In less than two months from this they meet to choose Oct. directors of their institution , which went by the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to immense trouble . While they were thus striving to advance , a majority of the government thought it best for themselves alone to hold the purse strings of the Province . The opinion of the Legislature is regarded as less objectionable than that of the bank party , by those who preferred hard money , therefore such an opinion receives the support of these and becomes embodied in a law . The introduction of this act follows : * " Whereas the public bills of credit on Nov. this Province , which have so long and happily supported this his Majesty 's government in the long and expensive war with the French and Indians in our neighborhood , for defraying the necessary charges thereof in the defence of his Majesty 's subjects ' interests in this as well as the neighboring Provinces and Colonies , ( and the preventing the inconveniences that may arise to the Province by any private projection for providing any other medium of exchange , ) and served as a medium of commerce in the business and trade of this Province , greatly facilitating payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now grown very scarce and few of them passing in proportion to the great demand of the same , whereby the affairs of the Government are very much hindered , the pay- /z/ 1714 ment of the public debts and taxes retarded , and in great - measure rendered impracticable , and the trade and business of this Province both at home and abroad is greatly obstructed to the great discouragement and distress of the Province . " Therefore 50,000 in bills , of the same tenor with those already issued , are to be put in the hands of five Trustees , and let out at five per cent , on safe mortgages of real estate , one-fifth part of the principal with interest payable each year . l Though the loans were restricted as to time , yet some of them were continually made , so that they were out over thirty years . No person was to hire more than 500 , nor less than 50 , of this Province loan . The income of it is to help liquidate public charges . Having in this manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient call might exist for the one projected by individuals , as a more private concern , the Legislature proceed to give the finishing blow to this association : Nov. 2 " A scheme for establishing a fund or bank of credit upon a land security , which may give the bills issued therefrom a general currency sent up from the Representatives with an order passed thereon , that is to say Ordered that no private company or partnership proceed to the making or emitting of any bills of credit , as a medium of exchange in trade , without the allowance and approbation of the Court . " Such an order passed the Council and was approved by the Governor . 1715. 3 Governor Dudley in his speech , reverting to his proMay posal , the foregoing session , that the bills , still out , might 5 * be recalled , says , they " passed with honour ; if not redeemed , they will depreciate . " June 4 The mercantile part of community were still dissatis21. fied with what they deemed the insufficiency of the loan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eighty others of Boston and elsewhere , petitioned that they would provide a larger medium of exchange in trade . Their request was laid over to the next session . Though the supporters of the Land Bank were 1 Letters from Boston on Currency . 3 Journal of the House . /z/ defeated , they were not conquered . Their fall only made i7i5 4 them more careful and determined to stand . " 1 The enactment relative to debtors not being forced to Dec. pay their obligations , contracted from 1705 to 1715 , in hard money , except they had specially agreed to do so , is prolonged to October 30 , 1722 . While this betrayed a very unsound state of currency , it prolonged and increased temptations to take advantage of creditors by paying them in bills continually reduced in value , and also occasions of animosities and litigations . It was only binding up the wound of community with unsuitable , injurious and perilous preparations of well intended , but ill-directed art . It increased the very disease which it was given to cure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design of friends to the Land Bank , though formerly the promoter of a similar one , they did much for his removal . 3 In answer to a letter of the General Court to Jeremiah 171 6 , Dummer in London , he writes in the subsequent terms : Feb - " I have received the three instructions agreed on the last October session , which I shall carefully observe . Only that , which commands me to oppose any attempts , that may be made here to incorporate a private bank in New England , is that there will probably be no occasion to make use of . For the gentlemen , who have been desired from Boston to solicit this business , have not yet moved in it , and I am informed by one of them , that they do not design to stir in it at all . Some other people having heard of it , and of the exigency which the country was reduced to for want of money or some other medium of trade , have started a project for the coining ( of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one third copper and the rest silver , to pass in New England , which they pretend will answer all the necessities of trade , tho ' in truth it will answer nothing but their own private gain , which they propose by it . Upon the first notice I had of this project , I waited on several of the ministry in order to speak to them of the 1 Acts of Massachusetts . 3 Massachusetts Archives Let- 2 Governor Dudley takes leave of ters , vol. ii . the General Court , Oct. 18 , 1715. /z/ 1716. destructive consequences of it , if it should take effect ; but s v ' their Lordships would not hear me upon it , for they were so clear in that , they assured me at once that no such thing should be done . " Nov . After Mr. Smite 's J arrival at Boston , as chief magis* trate , he recommended in his first speech , that endeavors should be made to revive the low state of trade . This was taken as an intimation , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sanction . They seem to have viewed such a mode of supplying needed funds , as a sort of Pactolus , which could bring treasure to their feet without consequent privation and misery . Dec. 2 Hence it was forthwith ordered that there be an additional loan of 100,000 . The reasons assigned for this enactment , was the heavy debt incurred lately in the French war , that all the hard money which formerly aided the trade was sent to pay for debts contracted in England , and the scarcity of Province bills . This amount was committed to the care of county Trustees ; was proportioned to each county according to its tax ; secured by mortgaged estates of double the value of the sum borrowed , each loan not exceeding 500 nor under 25 , for ten years at five per cent. , paid annually . The profits to help pay for expenses of government , and the bills to be returned at the end of this period and burnt .

" As the General Court conclude that it is out of their power to comply with this energetic appeal , they make no sufficient effort to resist the torrent of calamity . A writer upon the times , expresses himself in the subsequent strain : 2 " I suppose this Province doth not raise 1719. nigh so much provisions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We buy much from other places j while so , would it not be an hurt to send any provisions to a foreign market ? But out of the products of our labour , we may spare great quantities of fish , oyl , whalebone , etc. , and for these , what returns should we chiefly desire ? Why things that are most serviceable and necessary for us , and not for needless commodities . " He goes on to state , that too much rum is imported , which is a great injury to the Province . He remarks further " All the silver money which formerly made payments in trade to be easy , is now sent into Great Britain to make returns for part of what is owing there . We have been so deficient in farming and managing our own manufacture , lived so much above our abilities , spent so much of our imported commodities , that our money is gone , there is scarce a penny of it passing for a twelvemonth . " He informs us , that , notwithstanding the promptness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its notes or bills are still in circulation . With reference to a new arrangement in the means of recalling the Province bills , he remarks that they are to be redeemed by any stock in the Treasury , so that they who keep bills expecting to obtain silver , may get country produce . 3 Another observer of the times , who was more in favor of paper currency than his cotemporary opponent , gives the ensuing statements : The evils of litigation abound . People of estates can not raise money , unless they dispose 1 South Carolina , in order to pay of the notes was properly referred to charges of an expedition against the by Gov .

The private bank does not receive encouragement in its operations from the Legislative authorities . 50,000 ought to be laid out for making a bridge over Charles River , so that workmen might be employed and currency enlarged , as well as the public accommodated ; and ruin will come unless more bills of credit are emitted . It is hoped that country towns will send Representatives to secure such an emission . This writer says " It is a dark day upon us , I pray God to guide and lead his Excellency and his Council and others concerned in the government , into some measures for the relief of the people . " Sept . As an instance , with what pertinacity an evil purpose ' will compass sea and land to be gratified , the succeeding fact is adduced : l Jeremiah Dummer , agent in London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an Engraver on Tower Hill , who had assisted Woddin to counterfeit the Province bills . Mr. Dummer employed an ingenious man to wait on Bryan , who told him , that Woddin had carried the copper plate to Boston .

We being met at the Town house in Boston on the day abovementioned , and having conferred the subject matter before said , did unanimously agree on the following heads that is to say ; First , it will be greatly for the service and benefit of the publick , not to emit any more bills on Loan . Secondly , That no more bills should be emitted , than what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it will 1 Mass .

The foregoing heads or proposals are humbly submitted to the consideration of the General Court of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay , the Colonies of Connecticut , and Rhode Island , at their next Court of Election , by /z/ The Council approved and recommended such advice , but the House received it coldly and merely had it read . This was a plain expression of the different views entertained by these two Bodies on the subject of currency .

These had lent their all , and depended for subsistence on its income , which was paid to them in paper at fifty per cent , discount . Then , as in all such periods of social convulsions , the influences of ill regulated currency were evidently pernicious to public morals . The barque enters the gale with a gallant bearing ; but how altered , when she emerges ! Is not this the symbol of many a character passing through the calms and storms of life ? However the people were perilously and painfully situated , yet the most of them omitted to trace much of their wo to an undue dependence on the emissions of notes from the Treasury . Like an individual , under the delirium of /z/ 1720. excessive stimulus , crying for the very liquid which has produced his disease and his pangs , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidings of such a disposition , as prevailed here , had been carried to the ear of Parliament . l As one step , to turn back its onward course , this body lay an interdict upon all banking associations in their dominions , who have no legal charter , so that from June 24 , 1720 , they shall cease . Such an act has particular application to the Private Bank of Boston , which had circulated their notes , though forbidden by the Legislature . April 2 T ne Governor laid a pamphlet before the Councilentitled , " Distressed State of the Town of Boston in a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend in the Country . " They were of opinion , that it had many passages reflecting on the acts and laws of the Province and other proceedings of the Assembly , and had a tendency to disturb the administration of the Government as well as the public peace . They voted that the Justices of the Peace at their General Sessions inquire after the author and publisher of the said pamphlet , and proceed therein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Answer to the Letter , " ( in the above jg pamphlet , ) has the succeeding passage : " As to silver and gold , we never had much of it in the country ; but we can very well remember , that before we had paper money , there was a sufficiency of it current in the country , and as the bills of credit came in and multiplied , the silver ceased and was gone ; and of all men , you in Boston , especially merchants , should be silent as to that matter , for you have shipped it off and yet now complain of the want of it .

This is what I have almost at every session mentioned , as a matter not only of justice but of interest . And I am more especially obliged to do it now , because the neighbouring Governments looking upon it as a matter of the last consequence to us all , have lately appointed Commissioners to inquire into that affair and lay before their respective General Assemblies what they have thought proper for the public good with respect to the Public Bills of credit . The unanimous resolution of the Commissioners when they met at Boston , I shall order to be laid before you .

I believe it will be of necessity , when the Bills become very scarce , for the Government to think of some reasonable method for the ease of the people in paying in the publick debts , and at the same time to take great care not to postpone them , as we have too often done , to the detriment of the Government and lessening the value of the Bills of Credit . I am very well pleased to observe by all that have the state of the country and of our Trade at heart , that good husbandry and industry are unanimously agreed on , as among the first and best expedients to help us under our great difficulties . " 1 To meet the exigencies of the day , the General Court July modify the conditions of an issue of 5,000 in paper 20 * currency , so that they present two features different from what they had for a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , which had been continued for twenty-eight years , as means of preserving the Notes of the Treasury at par , because it had lost its intended effect . Another , was the restoring of the former custom /z/ 1720. f having country produce substituted as a medium of v - ' exchange , and answer the purpose of money . It was introduced again by necessities which overcame the objections to its re-adoption . It was , however , found so inconvenient under the new associations and habits of business , as to be dispensed with , for a considerable time , in three years . Its re-appearance at this date , is thus appointed : " Whereas through the scarcity of bills of credit , it grows difficult for persons to convert the produce of their lands and other effects into bills and pay their rates in them , it is ordered that the inhabitants of this Province shall have liberty ( if they see cause ) to pay the several sums , which shall be on them respectively assessed , in the several species hereafter mentioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set them ; viz. in good barrel beef and pork , or in wheat , peas , barley , rye , Indian corn , oats , flax , hemp , bees ' wax , butter in firkins , cheese , hides , tanned leather , dry fish , mackerel in barrels , oil , whale bone , bayberry wax or tallow . Which species shall be received by the Treasurer of the several constables and collectors , to be by him disposed of to the best advantage for the calling in of the said bills into the Treasury . And if any loss by the sale of the aforesaid species , or by any other unforeseen accident shall arise , then such deficiences shall be made good by a tax of the year next following , so as shall be fully and effectually to call in the whole sum of 5,000 of bills emitted as aforesaid .

Not harmonizing with all the opinions advanced in the Chief Magistrate 's late speech , the House sent him a reply : " Your Excellency was pleased to acquaint us 1 Massachusetts Provincial Records . /q/ that you lately assembled some of the principal gentlemen 1731. and merchants of Boston , with a view to public good , that they might propose or receive schemes for the relief of this people under their grievance ; for want of a good medium of trade . If those gentlemen when assembled , did agree upon any method and had laid the same before the House , it had been very readily received and due consideration had thereon . But none such as yet hath been shewn forth . Last session , a Bill for emitting 100,000 , to help the inhabitants to pay their public debts , passed the House , but stopt in the Council . We feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote such an object . We agree with your Excellency , that if a new emission should depreciate the bills out , it would be pernicious . To prevent this , a bill was passed , the present and last sessions , to hinder buying and selling , bartering or exchanging silver money or bullion at higher rates and prices than heretofore stated by act of Parliament . Our judgment is , that had such an act been made by Massachusetts when they first issued paper bills , they had to this day been equal in value and credit to silver money . We further think , that passing it now , would prevent depreciation of bills and bring them up to what they once were . " They speak of a pamphlet against their proceedings of last session , called News from Robinson Crusoe 's Island . To make the mode of paying the rates more convenient March for the body of the people , a majority of the Legislature " vote for another loan of 50,000 , instead of the 100,000 , for which they had strongly contended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent . The Governor , contrary to his own wish , and doubtful whether it was consistent with his orders from Parliament , consents to this reduced emission for the sake of complying with the general desire . It was to be distributed among the towns , according to their amount of taxes , who were to elect Trustees for letting it out . As a specimen of the manner in which such corporations apply the money , we instance Salem . l This place chose three Trustees , who let no Oct. /z/ /z/ 721 more than 50 , nor less than 10 , to any individual , at six * per cent , on ample security . These officers had one sixth of the interest , and the rest went towards disbursing town charges . The whole loan was to be redeemed by a fund of taxes on polls and estates , both real and personal , at the ensuing periods . One tenth part of it was to be redeemed May 31 , 1726 , and so on for each year , the last being May 31 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed . 1 From some queries of casuistry by Rev. Mr. Stoddard . of Northampton , the ensuing extract is made : " Is not the depreciating the bills of credit matter of provocation ? It must needs be ; for great wrong is done to many persons , who have received them according to their denomination , and have been forced to put them off , as if they were of less value . Some men are able to help themselves by getting greater wages for their work , and advancing the price of what they bring to the market ; but others have been great sufferers by this practice , and if ever the bills are called in , such as are in debt , either to public or particular persons , will be great losers . It may be , some of them will be undone thereby . The temptation to the merchants was to get the money into their own hands , that thereby they might make returns to England . They would give 30 s in bills for 20 s in silver . And they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell their goods at excessive rates . They are under no necessity to do thus , for they have the command of the market , and might buy the produce of the country at such prices , that they might make as profitable returns as they now do . " 1722. 2 While the paper money was multiplied , small coin as well as large , was exceedingly scarce . For this reason , an emission of 500 worth of l d , 2 d , and 3 d bills is ordered .

This suspension is again to be temporarily interrupted in a few years , by the scarcity of other medium of exchange . There was great debate in the Assembly about the 1724. emission of 30,000 . The Council wished to have it I ) ec * redeemed in three years , but the House insisted on a longer credit of four years . The latter body prevail . Judge Sewall , as a member of the Board , remarks on this occasion ; 3 " The diminution of the value of the bills of public credit , is the cause of much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand in adding to the heavy weight of this oppression , which is already become intolerable .

Aware of their equitable claim for indemnification , an act is passed that they shall be obliged to take bills of credit only at their real value . 5 That we may judge of the sums issued in Treasury notes or bills , the succeeding minutes of James Taylor , the Treasurer are adduced . 1 Proud 's Hist , of Pennsylvania . 4 Annals of Salem . 2 Mass .

" He desires Mr. Wood 1737. may be assisted in the execution of his office . 1 The Board of Trade in London agree upon orders for his Honor , William Dummer , to require the General Court to withdraw from circulation the 100,000 loan of 1716 , and have it destroyed by the next May , and that he sign no act for bills of credit without his Majesty 's express leave for that purpose . 2 A letter is forwarded by Secretary Willard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as his Colony 22 - had issued a Proclamation for calling in their bills of credit , they would appoint an agent in Boston , to exchange an abundance of such paper and other notes of theirs , worn and defaced , which had fallen upon the hands of Massachusetts people . 3 At the next Election Mr. Dummer lays the concerns of j une another loan before the Court , as having an important 1-bearing upon their views and exertions. 4 Urged on by the necessities and solicitations of their Ju j y constituents , the great portion of the House apply to him 5. for a further loan of 50,000 . Aware that his order from the crown forbid this in the naked form of a loan , they propose that it be issued towards redeeming the 100,000 . He replies that his instructions are imperative to decline compliance with all such propositions until the Royal pleasure can be known . He remarks that if the proposition was couched in terms to denote an emission for recalling the 100,000 , he could not object . He adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , to settle the costs of Government , as had been customary . They and the great body of the people are exceedingly loth that he should be guided by dictates of the Crown in this respect , because they considered it as an important article of their internal policy , which no foreign power could touch without a violation of their Charter liberties . They were aware , that if once allowing 1 Lt. Gov . William Dummer 's 3 Lt. Gov . Dummer 's Speech . Speech . 4 Massachusetts Provincial Rec- 2 Massachusetts Archives Let- ords. ters , vol. ii . /z/ 1727. it ? as consistent with their Constitutional rights , it would x v " be difficult for them to retract , and would prepare the way for unlimited taxation . Hence , they had uniformly met it on the threshold , and refused to give it a welcome . Aug. l While a larger part of the Representatives were thus vigilant , lest the Province should be brought under deeper subjection to the Throne , they came into Collision with the Council , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued in 1723 and 1724 . The latter body urge that " the faith and honour of this government is strongly engaged " for the recalling of such a sum . The former allow , that the time , when it should be taken out of circulation , according to the pledge of the Legislature , had arrived ; but that the distressed condition of the country was a sufficient apology for a delay of fulfilling the contract , that greater evil than good would accrue to the public , if the bills out should be drawn in . Several communications passed between the two branches of legislation on this subject , each adhering to their opinions , and holding one another to be in a dangerous error . The same scene was repeatedly exhibited . But an impartial view of the subject would suggest , that the Council had the better side of the question , and that conformity with principle rather than policy was better then , and always is , than the contrary .

The Council , with his Honor , having repeatedly 1733 pressed the recall of the 100,000 loan , the date fixed Jan.

But as some off-set for their disappointment in this particular , an Act is passed for another loan of 60,000 . The heading for this was more in accordance with their views and feelings , than with those of the other part of the Legislature . It runs thus : " Whereas the public bills of credit on this Province , which have for a great length of time happily served this Government , both in war and peace , and enabled the inhabitants thereof to pay their publick dues , are now become very scarce , by reason they are in a great measure already drawn in . " This money was issued to the towns proportionably to their taxes . They are empowered to let it out at 6 per cent. , four of which went to the Province , one to the trustees , for their responsibility and service , and the other to help pay town charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund for the redemption of the loan , payable annually in ums of 12,000 each , from Dec. 31 , 1734 . March Dr. William Douglas states the ensuing facts to Caldwal ' der Golden of New York . c Our paper currency , by too great emissions , has gradually lost its credit , so as at present 16 s is but sufficient to purchase an ounce of silver . The bills of Massachusetts in circulation amount to 314,000 , besides those of Connecticut , Rhode Island , and New Hampshire . ' Aug. 2 Mr. Burnet having assumed the government here , and 20 * being urged by the Representatives to favor their views for plentiful issues of paper money , sends one of his instructions to them for perusal , and also to the Council . It runs thus ; " Whereas Acts have been passed in some of our Plantations in America for striking bills of credit , and issuing the same in lieu of money , in order to discharge public debts and other purposes , from whence several inconveniences have arisen , it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give your assent to , or pass any 1 Doctor William Douglass , in a terminating 1742 , which disagrees letter to Caldwalder Colden , Esq . of with the Act .

" This was a lesson for the popular branch of Legislation to read , to which , though they saw it with their eyes , and heard it with their ears , they gave no heartfelt respond of approbation . Like other expressions of Regal authority , which had been repeatedly laid before them , it seems to have made little impression on their memory , or which is the truer of the two , they would gladly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer imposed on them , as what they deemed an advance of oppression . For the short period Governor Burnet lived here , being some over a year , he perceived , that unless he would surrender the prerogative of the Crown to forbid the loaning system of the Assembly , as well as to fix the salary of the Chief Magistrate , he must be in an incessant turmoil . 1 With such relations to each other , they so disagree , that 1729. he said to the House , for substance , Gentlemen , I have A ril ordered you no pay , because you have voted me no salary . Thus with his hand on the points of opposition , he would have had much to endure had he survived , and longer retained his office . 2 So downward was the tendency of Massachusetts notes , that they again become the subject of remark in another Province . James Logan , writing from Pennsylvania to the Proprietaries , and referring to their bills , says , " I dare not speak one word against it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bad as they are in New England , where an ounce of silver is worth 20 s of their paper . " 3 One occasion of such a difference between bills and cash , was because the Factors here from England had 1 Massachusetts Provincial Rec- 2 Annals of Philadelphia , ords. 3 Discourse on Colonial Currency . /z/ 1729. orders from their employers , to remit , for the goods imw * " v ' ported , nothing short of silver or bills of exchange . While the pecuniary state of the Province was such , Mr. Burnet is succeeded by Jonathan Belcher . Of this gentleman the Court of St. James had strong hopes , that he would be able to subdue what they accounted and denominated the refractory spirit of Massachusetts , and make a speedy close of the paper currency . Accordingly he comes hither with an injunction to 1730. have preparatory measures adopted for effecting this object in the course of ten years . 1 Governor Belcher says in his speech to the General D ec . Court , " I must not dismiss this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , the state of your bills of credit , the course and manner of their being such at present , as makes them a common delusion to mankind . " The law for compelling creditors to receive paper , specialties excepted , however fallen , at par value , and openly denounced in England , as flagrantly unjust to her merchants who traded with this Province , comes before him for reapproval . At first , he gives it his prompt veto . But 1 7 3 ? , * tired down by Yankee perseverance , he is induced to 2. have it prolonged , at the expense of being severely censured in London . Still , however pliant in this point , no guard of the golden apples of Hesperides could have been more vigilant and unyielding than he was , to keep the injunctions of his Majesty . These , being the 16th and 18th , restricted all issues of Treasury notes to the bare liquidation of Government charges , and required that not more than 30,000 of them should be in circulation at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A consequence is , that the House retaliate , in not providing a sufficient sum for the public chest , in the manner which he could approve . Dec . The Representatives of Massachusetts having peti- tioned the King to repeal the 16th instruction to Governor 1 Journal of House of Representatives . /q/ Belcher , as very detrimental to the Province , his Majesty 1732. confirms a report of his Council to have the instruction still continued . j an . 1 As officers of courts of justice had recently refused to 20. take their fees , except in silver , a committee of the Representatives report that so scarce is specie , and so necessary is it to preserve the credit of bills , such a refusal must by no means be allowed . 2 Gov .

" While the Treasury is unsupplied , James Oglethorp , a member of Parliament , a particular friend to the interests of New England , and the founder of Georgia , sends word that he is on his way , from that Province , for Boston , to take passage for London . The Legislature raise a com- j une mittee to give him an honorable reception and entertain- 21. ment . In the meanwhile , the Governor forwards a letter to them , saying , that as they had voted no funds for any 33. extra expense , he should accommodate the worthy gentleman at his own house , and own charge . This was a requital more deeply felt , than it could be openly faulted . The House having petitioned the King several times , that the restrictions laid on their Governors , as to the raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescinded , they had lately received a sharp rebuke from his Council for so doing . These account for such restrictions in the succeeding terms . " A pernicious practice had prevailed in several Plantations of America , for issuing bills of credit instead of money , to pay public debts . Hence great inconveniences arose in depreciation 1 Journal of House of Represen- 2 Massachusetts Archives Lettatives. ters , vol. ii . g3 HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF 1733. f bills . " Indeed , the conduct of our Legislature , as to v v ' pecuniary matters , was viewed at the court of England , as a sort of Pandora 's box to our country . It was made the occasion there of changes , which were deprecated by the most of our fathers . It ' hastened on the explanatory Charter of 1725 , which confirmed the Governor 's right to negative the Speaker of the House , and curtailed this body in other exercises of power . It subsequently helped to throw the auditing and settling of public accounts into the hands of the Governor and Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . Still , while its unhappy results , in these and other respects , political and social , public arid private , poured over our Commonwealth , hope , in the minds of the Provincials , remained at its bottom . Oct. x As by the Royal commands to the chief magistrate , H- Treasury notes had become curtailed , a number of merchants and others of Boston , in order to supply the deficiency of such a medium of trade , had recently engaged in a project of issuing paper to the value of 110,000 . Rhode Island had also ordered a large emission of their bills , which , as usual , were expected to have their chief circulation in Massachusetts . With these facts laid before them , and concluding that by such causes their own bills would proceed from bad to worse , the General Court appoint a committee to examine them , and make report . Oct. 2 Notified of such action , Governor Wanton replies , that 26 * the Rhode Island Assembly had enacted , in July last , to issue 100,000 loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He adds , " I do assure the General Assembly of the Province , we had an especial regard for the welfare of the public in said emission . And hope ' - ' that they " will take care that trade may not be injured by a private emission now coming out without their sanction , as I am informed . " Nov 3 After a hard contest between the House and his Ex2. cellency , they so far harmonize , that he consents to an 1 Massachusetts Provincial Rec- in answer to Secretary Willard 's ords. express . 8 Gov . William Wanton 's letter , 3 Massachusetts Provincial Records . MASSACHUSETTS CURRENCY . gg emission of 76,500 , in bills , for Provincial charges . On 1733. this occasion he remarks , " I am glad you have , after a v - struggle of near three years , now agreed in a bill to make provision for the payment of the public debts . " 1 A letter of the General Court to Francis Wilks , their NOV. agent in London , requesting him to petition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as on those in the merchant service , of 6 d a month for Greenwich Hospital , remarks , that their fish brings " a very large sum in silver and gold , from Spain , Portugal , and the Streights , " which goes to Great Britain for the payment of goods . 2 The committee raised about the paper money in circula- g % tion , make their report , which is accepted by both Houses . They state that the merchants ' notes emitted by Boston gentlemen , should be backed with greater security ; and that his Excellency be desired to send out a proclamation , warning the people to be on their guard against taking the late bills of Rhode Island . The bills of the private bank , just mentioned , amounted to 110,000 , and were redeemable in ten years , with silver at 19 3 an ounce , then the common rate of the Province paper . Though a great and imposing effort was made to keep the Rhode Island bills out of our market , yet they soon flowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expedient to issue a proc- 7. lamation against both of these sorts of currency , though he is decidedly opposed to them .

These concurrences made a flush of paper money . But 1 Massachusetts Archives Let- 3 Massachusetts Provincial Recters , vol. ii . ords. 2 Massachusetts Provincial Rec- 4 Letter to a merchant in London , ords. /z/ 1733. the flood was far from being like that of the Nile , which x v " enriches and blesses wherever it comes . While such a change for the worse is attracting the anxious gaze and attention of friends to the Province , Mr. Belcher , in his speech , utters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to what a low ebb our bills of May credit are reduced , which carry in the face of them these ol* words ' in value equal to money . ' And yet 16 s in these bills will not , at this day , purchase 5 s lawful money . It will then become the wisdom of the Legislature to search into this matter , and to apply a speedy remedy ; for next to the defence of the Province , I take this to be an aifair of the greatest consequence . I should also think it prudent to look carefully into the several loans of the Province , and , after so many years ' indulgence to the borrowers , to order them to be paid in without more delay . For a sacred observation of the terms of the several Acts , by which the bills have been issued , must have a natural tendency to support their credit . And I think it would be an instance of the wisdom and justice of this Government , not to suffer an emission of any sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will instantly , and at all times , honestly and truly command the value expressed in them . I look upon the land and commerce of the country to be but one joint interest , and should be always equally encouraged . And it is with much concern I mention to you the decaying state of the trade of the Province . While our importations are so exceeding as constantly to leave us a large balance in arrear to our friends abroad , it is impossible we should carry on a gainful trade , or have among us gold and silver , the only valuable medium of commerce . Happy would it then be for the Province , if the Legislature would establish some large premiums to encourage the cultivation of the lands , as on hemp and other naval stores , and our English grain . Something of this kind may gradually bring the balance of trade in our own favour , which will of course fix the standard of money among us. " /z/ 1 Governor Belcher makes further remarks on this sub- 1734. ject , which he deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it - is most certainly apparent that emissions of bills of what sort soever , have sunk the value of all bills that were extant before , more or less in proportion to the sums that have been emitted , and a plain proof of this we have had the last year upon an emission of this government , of about eighty thousand pounds , and of a much greater sum by a number of private persons , and of still more by the neighboring Colonies , which in the course of the year , have sunk the value of our Province bills , at least a fifth part . " This has injured those of Great Britain who trade here . " Yet the loss has more heavily fallen upon such as are the most careful and industrious to live within themselves , upon widows and orphans , upon the ministers of religion , and upon such as spend their time to serve the publick . " They who live by credit are most benefited by such a state of currency . The bills of the Private Bank or merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Province bills , as it was confidently said , have had a contrary effect . Such compends of sound political economy had been often repeated , from the Chair of State , in the ears of the two Houses . A page from Davenant , or Steward , or Smith , could offer no better advice for a country situated as ours was . In accordance with the suggestion of Mr. Belcher , the General Court consider the means for suppressing the merchants ' notes , but as they could not agree , the subject is deferred . Actuated by the prevalent mania , against which wise precautions had been given , a company in New Hampshire concluded to follow the example set by the association of our metropolis who had issued notes on their own responsibility but not to imitate their judicious provisions to hinder loss to the public . 2 Hence our Leg- 1735. islature pass a law against the circulation of their bills on a penalty of heavy fine . A part of the introduction to /z/ 1735. this statute runs thus : Whereas sundry persons of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue " promissory notes of a most uncertain and sinking value , as they are payable in New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island bills , or in silver , gold or hemp , at the unknown price they may be at in Portsmouth , in New Hampshire , Anno 1747 , whereby his Majesty 's good subjects will be great suiferers , should they part with their goods and substance for them or accept of them in payment . " This was a banking speculation , which promised much advantage to its promoters , but very little to the public . The larger amount of its paper , like all such currency of that day , in New England , reached Boston the great mart for the northern Colonies . But placed under the ban of the law , its market was spoiled for this Province . June While this money was thus driven from circulation , * the bills of Massachusetts are so scarce , that the inhabitants are permitted to pay their taxes in hemp , flax and bar-iron . In this manner , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occasional returns to the ancient mode of satisfying demands of the public Treasury upon them . 1737. 2 Perceiving that with all their vigilance and exertions , they could not restore the credit of their notes , the General Court resolve to have others made , differently expressed . This they do in an emission of 18,000 in bills of the current form , and of 9,000 in a different form . The first sum was to be re-called in a year , and the last in 1742 . As a sinking fund for both of these amounts , the people are still allowed to pay their taxes in hemp , at 4 d and flax at 6 d to the Treasurer , or money , both hard and paper , if they could . As the conditions of the 9,000 emission , differ from those in preceding bills of credit , it causes them to be denominated new tenor and the others old tenor . The succeeding form was adopted for the new tenor : 1 Massachusetts Provincial Records . * General Court Records . /q/ /z/ This Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New England , to the possessor thereof , shall be in value equal to three ounces of coined silver , Troy weight , of sterling alloy , or gold coin at the rate of four pounds eighteen shillings per ounce ; and shall be accordingly accepted by the Treasurer and receivers subordinate to him in all payments ( the duties of Import and Tunnage of shipping and incomes of the Light House only excepted , ) and for any Stock at any time in the Treasury . Boston , By order of the Great and General Court or Assembly . Twenty Shillings . Twenty Shillings . Committee . A reason why these notes were not to be received for the excepted duties , was because such duties were ordered to be paid in hard money , which was to redeem the notes . 1 As the act for such bills limited the preceding ones to the payment of like taxes , though when first ordered , they were to be taken for all taxes , merchants loudly complained , that this was a breach of public faith , was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to injure both sorts of bills . Though government set the new tenor at one for three of the old , yet the people passed them at one for four . As a specimen of the Protean appearances , which were assumed by knavery with regard to New England notes , we copy the heading of an act against such iniquity : 2 " Whereas by the tearing of the bills of credit on this Province and on the neighbouring governments into halves and quarters , and then passing the same so torn and defaced , many frauds have been committed by taking and joining bills of a lower denomination to those of a higher /z/ 1737. denomination , and so uttering and passing the same ; and likewise parts of false and counterfeit bills in parts separate , or joined to parts of true bills , and thereby many of his Majesty 's good subjects of this Province have suffered considerable loss and damage and are likely to suffer more . " Then follows a heavy penalty for such offenders , and no persons should receive any payment from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was so marred while in their own possession . Dec. l Governor Belcher observes that the issuing of new ' tenor bills has had a good effect in promoting public credit . The General Court renew their endeavors to guard the community against the influx of unsafe paper . On this 1739. head , their language runs thus : * " Whereas the emission Jan. of great quantities of bills of public credit without certain provision for their redemption by lawful money , in convenient time , hath already stript us of all our money and brought them into contempt to the great scandal of the government ; and for the remedy thereof , this Province hath fixed the value of their bills in lawful money and the time of their redemption in 1742 . Yet the neighbouring Governments whose bills have been received by the inhabitants of this Province promiscuously with our own , have taken no care to fix any certain value on theirs , and by that means , our good intention may be frustrated unless special provision in this can be made . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be enacted , that no paper money of other Provinces shall be taken in Massachusetts , except redeemable by lawful money , on good security , in ten years from their first being issued , on fine of 10 for every such note paid or received . This bill is sanctioned by the Governor . 13. 2 The Assembly assure the Governor , that his purpose to have all their bills re-called in a year or two , is impracticable , and that if attempted , would accumulate the distress already endured by the inhabitants . 16 . He replies , in reference to an emission of bills , which 1 Journal of the House . s General Court Records . /q/ they had urged more than a year before : " I will employ 1739. my best offices , consistent with my duty to the King , that his Majesty 's Royal leave may be obtained for giving my consent to a bill of this nature . " Thus encouraged , both Houses designate a Committee to urge their agent in London to obtain such permission from the Crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , states that it is the desire of his Excellency as well as of the other branches of our government , that he may have leave from the throne to sign an act for the emission of 60,000 in bills for redeeming those due in 1742 . They relate , that Massachusetts had recently made a law against the bills of adjacent Colonies , unless payable in specie , and that her paper could not sustain its credit without such a regulation . 2 The agent for Massachusetts writes , that the Lord 's March Commissioners for Trade strongly object to an issue of the 60,000 , while it is allowed here , that debts , payable in specie , may be discharged with such paper . He also relates , that in an interview with the President of the Lords of Trade , he mentioned how unequal it was for the Governor of Massachusetts to be limited in giving sanction to the issues of paper money , while the Chief Magistrates of other Colonies are left unincumbered in this respect . He further stated to the President , that notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the adjacent governments , yet our people were under a necessity of taking and paying them , because our own bills were scarce . While exerting themselves to enlarge their medium of exchange , they pass a law to be enacted for the relief of debtors . This requires that every creditor shall receive the bills of his own government for demands , if such bills were issued before March 25 , 1738 . Supposing the House unduly inclined to regard the future finances of the Province more under the emblem of a cornucopia than otherwise , the Chief Magistrate reminds them of what they had reason to anticipate from /z/ 1 739 1 their present and past experience . * He states to them *- that their loans to 1727 were 260,000 , and that a quarter of it was still unredeemed and that a part of this should have been called in twenty years ago , and that their old bills had fallen two thirds of their first value . Such plain talk brings a reply from them which does not give so sombre a hue to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also induces them to send a committee and ask an explanation of him for some other remarks , but he declines to see them . Oct. 2 His Excellency sends a report , made by the Lords of Trade the preceding April 11 to the Council , concerning the 60,000 emission for which the House were anxiously desirous , as a means of easing the heavy burden , that must come on the people in paying rates to redeem the bills of credit . This report , however , proposed conditions with which the General Court are unwilling to comply . 1740. 3 Knowing that coin had been mostly driven from the M j4 Ch country by the unsuccessful management of the paper currency , and that this was soon to be drawn in , Thomas Hutchinson afterwards Governor as a leading member of the House , brings forward a project to meet so unpleasant an exigency . It is , to hire 220,000 ounces of silver or gold equivalent , for ten years at four per cent , in England , on the credit of the Province . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his proved to be . As a partial relief to the dark forebodings of the public mind , if no increase to the medium should be allowed by the Executive , he signs an act for an emission of 160,000 in old tenor bills , equal to 35,333 6 s 8 d , payable December 31 , 1742-3-4 . The notes for this emission received the name of new tenor , which made the preceding series , that had been similarly denominated , called middle tenor . 19. 4 In continuance of the controversy between the Representatives and the Governor , he repeats his account of the Province arrearages . He says , that there are 210,000 in 1 Mass . Provincial Records . 3 Mass . Archives Pecu. , vol. ii . 2 Mass . Provincial Records . 4 Mass . Provincial Records . /q/ bills now circulating , 40,000 are on loan , and the rest 1740. 170,000 , former Assemblies have promised shall be col- * lected into the Treasury , by a tax in the several years specified , by 1742 , and that this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to supply the place of paper currency . Such being the pecuniary condition and prospect of the Province , several projects are advanced by companies to supply the deficiency of money . The petitions of these associations , being laid before the Legislature , and assigned to a Committee for consideration , are reported on . One of them was John Colman and three hundred and ninety-five others , for 150,000 , to be lent in notes on land security , and payable in twenty years by various articles of merchandize . It was in some degree like the scheme of the noted , but mistaken John Law of Scotland . Another was Edward Hutchinson and one hundred and six partners , for 120,000 , redeemable in fifteen years , with silver at 20 s an ounce , or gold pro rata. 1 The latter was upon a plan similar to one before mentioned , and its bills were denominated merchants ' notes . It was promoted in order to put down the other . Though the gentlemen appointed to consider them had less objection to the Specie bank than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank , they give an opinion , that both are inexpedient. 2 In the Legislature , there is a diversity March of opinion , as to these companies . 3 The Council express 26 their wish that the Land Bank may be forthwith disannulled , but that the silver scheme , so called , be put over to the coming session . The Representatives , looking on the Land Bank as designed for people of moderate property as well as for the rich , manifest their desire that both suspend operations till the next Assembly , and then be considered as to their respective claims . This was the motion agreed on , and thus the petitioners earnestly looked for a hearing . 4 The Assembly enact that 4 in bills of the old tenor pri ! and 26/8 of the new , otherwise called middle , shall be 16. /z/ 1740. received in all payments equal to 20 9 of the last form and " tenor , and so pro rata for a greater or less sum . 1 It appears that there were at this time more plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct observer of the financial concerns of the country , as they were in that period , wrote to a correspondent . His remarks substantially follow : There are many schemes in Boston for emitting enormous quantities of paper currency ; one , for counteracting Rhode Island bills , to issue on the responsibility of individuals 500,000 in notes without fund or period . In this connection , he states that the emissions and reemissions of Massachusetts bills , from 1702 to 1740 , amounted to 1,132,500 on funds of taxes , and 310,000 on loans . Of these sums 230,000 are still outstanding , and , if public faith be better kept , such an amount will be cancelled by 1742 . He also states , that the ordinary charges of the Government are 40,000 of the paper currency at 450 per cent , advance , or 5J of it for 1 sterling . He describes the unequal necessities , to which several classes of society are reduced , in consequence of the fall in Treasury notes . The carpenter gets 12 s a day , equal only to 3/4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounce . He is also obliged to take half of his labor in shop notes , payable in goods at 25 per cent , advance . Such notes began to appear with the bills of the Province , and they are a great grievance to tradesmen . The clergy experience similar diminution in their means of subsistence . Widows and orphans are great sufferers in their property . Charity funds are greatly reduced in their May real income . 2 Rev. William Cooper in speaking on this subject , thus describes it : a An empty treasury , a defenceless country and embarrassed trade are indeed melancholy things . " Leaving this dark picture , we resume the story of the two banks before the Assembly . Of these , the Land Bank is particularly obnoxious to the Governor . He appears resolved , that if necessary , he will put forth his 1 Discourse concerning the Cur- * Rev. William Cooper 's Election currencies of the British Plantations in Sermon . America . /q/ utmost power to crush it in the bud . His feelings in this 1740. matter were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic and utterance is given to them in the capital of Great Britain . 1 They are embodied in a memorial , signed June by merchants there and others , and presented to our Assembly , Still , with this array of discouragements , they issue their notes . The Specie Paying Bank , securing July more extensive confidence , and viewed with less severity of suspicion than the Land Bank , does no less than its rival . In reference to these associations , Mr. Belcher issues the succeeding Proclamation : 2 " Whereas a scheme for emitting bills or notes by John Colman , Esq . and others , was laid before the General Court , in their session held the 5th of December , 1739 , and by a report of a Committee appointed by said Court , was represented , if carried on , to have a great tendency to endamage his Majesty 's good subjects as to their properties ; and whereas application has been very lately made to me and his Majesty 's Council , by a great number of men of the most considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken to prevent the inhabitants of this Province being imposed upon by the said scheme ; and it being very apparent that these bills or notes promise nothing of any determinate value , and can not have any general , certain or established credit ; wherefore , I have thought fit , by and with the advice of his Majesty 's Council , to issue this Proclamation , hereby giving notice and warning to all his Majesty 's good subjects of the danger they are in , and cautioning them against receiving or passing the said notes , as tending to defraud men of their substance , and to disturb the peace and good order of the people , and to give great interruption and bring much confusion into their trade and business . " This language was the genuine expression of his Excellency 's heart , uttered to a community under the influence of strong and conflicting excitements . Among the deep and turbid springs of calamity breaking forth in the Province , was the exacting of long 1 Massachusetts Archives Pecu- 2 Massachusetts Archives Pecuniary , vol. iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the treasury loans . Much litigation v " and great loss accrued to many , who had mortgaged their estates for such debts . July Understanding that his permission for a late issue of notes was censured in Parliament , Governor Belcher 1 writes to Mr. Partridge , an agent for our Province in London : " I wonder Mr. Sandys or any member of the Honorable , the House of Commons , should think it a fault in me to give my assent to a bill for more than 30,000 . The sense of such instructions is , that I am to allow no greater emission than what will pay the expenses of Government . My consent was to 80,000 old tenor , which is only equal to 26,633 13 4 of new tenor , which is not so much as my privilege allows . " Oct. 2 Of the bills which had been issued by the Province , and to which much of the prevailing distrust and distress was imputed , 143,952 19 5 are still passing . This amount had so fallen in value , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent , advance . Nov. 3 Mr. Belcher being assured that part of the military 6 - corps encourage the circulation of the Land Bank paper , publishes a Proclamation to suppress such an example , as he judged , against the executive authorities . His words are " I hereby warn all commissioned officers in the militia from signing or giving any countenance to the passing of the said notes of hand , directly or indirectly . And as I apprehend , that if these should obtain a currency , it will reflect great dishonor on his Majesty 's government here , and be very detrimental to the public interests of this Province and people , I do hereby declare my firm resolution , that if after this publick notice given , any of the military officers of this Province persist in being any way concerned in or giving any encouragement whatsoever to the passing of the said notes of hand , and full proof be made thereof to my satisfaction , I will immediately dismiss them from their said offices .

Correspondence . 2 Massachusetts Archives Pecu- 3 Massachusetts Archives Pecuniary , vol. iii . niary , vol. iii . /z/ 1 Civil as well as military individuals are compelled to 1740 . bow before the storm . As a sample of their communications with the Governor , the following is adduced : " May it please your Excellency . Inasmuch as your Excellency 's Proclamation of the 5th current , the holding of a commission under your Excellency is made inconsistent with the prosecuting the manufactory scheme , in which we are concerned , and whereon , in our humble opinions , the interest of our native country so much depends as to require the utmost of our endeavours to promote the same . Therefore , as with a grateful sense of your Excellency 's favour we received our commissions and trusts , so with the same sense for your so long continuing us therein , we now , with your Excellency 's leave , resign these trusts , being concerned , that our being out of town deprived us of the opportunity of accompanying those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are your Excellency 's dutiful and humble servants , /z/ Doctor Robert Hale of Beverly , holding a similar trust with these two gentlemen , resigns for the same cause . 3 While these changes are occurring , the Governor , with the eye of suspicion upon the track of the two banks , reminds the Assembly , that the notes of these companies are spreading among the inhabitants . He and the Council require the stockholders to give bonds , so that the public shall not be injured by such currency . He informs the Representatives , that , as for the Land scheme , the King and Parliament had been petitioned for its immediate suppression . He proposes to them that they pass a law for a like end . But the greater part of them being actuated by their own views as well as by the popular wish , take no step to arrest the operations of the bank , but they rather encourage them . /z/ 4 The three justices , whose resignation is previously 4.

Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ 1740 stated , with William Stoddard and Samuel Watts of v v " * " Boston , sustaining like offices , have their commissions nullified by the Governor and Council , for favoring such an association .

As referring to this Association , which for a protracted period received a large share of public attention , the subsequent plan , on which it was formed , is given .

Boston , etc " 1 His Excellency writes to the Colonels , urging them to Dec. make rigid scrutiny of all officers in their regiments , suspected of promoting this company 's object , and to dismiss all who persist in such a course of action . He also requires the several County Registers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , as recorded on their books . The Courts of Sessions are prohibited from allow- 20. ing licenses to any who are similarly disobedient . No /z/ 1741. lawyer is allowed to plead before the Council , who is alike chargeable . Indeed , no class of the community escapes the energetic inquisition of the Executive authorities . * A gentleman , writing to his correspondent in London , on the state of our Province , relates " The Governor and Council are dismissing all officers , civil and military , from their appointment , who are concerned in this combination , " that is , the Land Bank . " Whole troops , nay , almost whole Regiments either resigned or told their Colonels , who examined them , that they would resign , rather than not encourage the bills . " 2 A spirit kindred to this , infused itself into a portion of the towns , who resolve that they will pay their rates in such money . March 3 With regard to private banks , a letter from Francis 27 Wilks to Secretary Willard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the House of Commons to extend the Act , commonly called the Bubble Act passed in 1720 , to the Plantations in America , after it had sundry alterations from what was first printed . I am satisfied it is the determined resolution of the Parliament to dissolve all companies in America , who have put forth any Notes or Bills to pass in publick , and to prevent any from doing it hereafter . " Resistance is manifested towards the Governor in various modes and instances , as though he had assumed and exercised arbitrary power . Of the many letters forwarded to him by those who fell under his displeasure , is one A P ril from Henry Lee , Esq. , of Worcester . 4 In it the author confesses himself an approver of the Manufactory Bank , and thus gives expression to his purpose and sentiment : " I am determined to do what I can to encourage it , and think the priviledge of an Englishman is my sufficient warrant . To sacrifice my post for the service of my country , is infinitely more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here we have an outbreaking of the Magna Charta spirit a spark of the Revolutionary ardor. /z/ While clashing resolutions thus prevailed , there is a 1741. mania for banking , considerably resembling what has been witnessed in later days . Some companies in several counties determine to enter the vortex of such speculation . 1 One of Essex County had applied to the Legisla- A P ri l ture for leave to issue notes of 50,000 on land securities . They were not , however , encouraged to proceed , though they had gone so far as to engage an engraver for their bills . Another was proposed by residents in Scituate and neighboring towns , and a third in Middlesex County , which met with no better success on application to the General Court . 2 That we may have a general idea of the mixed currency at this time , the succeeding extract is quoted : " We have in Massachusetts public bills of four Provinces at 29 s for an oz. of silver . New tenor of . Massachusetts at 6/8 , but currant at 9/8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Rhode Island new tenor at 6/9 , of private bills are 110,000 of silver money scheme or merchants ' notes , issued in 1733 , to prevent an enormous Rhode Island emission from depreciating our currency . They are punctually paid in gold and silver , and are 33 per cent . better than Province bills . There is another sum of 120,000 in merchants ' notes emitted in 1740 on a silver bottom to stifle the Land Bank which are equivalent to cash . They who are responsible for them are eminent and wealthy merchants . The Bills of the Land Bank or manufactory scheme are payable in twenty years , arid then only , in goods at an arbitrary price . " While the resistance of Mr. Belcher to banking associations rather increased than diminished their zeal , because they construed his activity in this respect , as the result of an aristocratic temper , he and his friends are startled at the rife reports of a plotted insurrection. 3 One person deposes , May that he has been assured , that a thousand men are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Others testify , that the malcontents mean H. /z/ 1741. to march for the metropolis and demand the reasons for " " opposition to the Land Bank , and to mob the traders who should refuse to sell coin for its bills . That there were attempts to promote something of this sort , is plain from the evidence given under oath . As a confirmation of these statements , we have two letters from under the hand of Governor Belcher . One of them is addressed to Secretary Waldron , and is in point , as well as in relation to a topic which he had suggested . May i The Land Bank concern openly defy the act of Parliament , are now combining to raise a rebellion , and are coming to Boston at Election , the 27th inst . I have this day sent the sheriff and his officers to apprehend some of the conspirators . The Land Bank does so affect every affair in the Assembly and throughout the Province , that it will be the ruin of the government and people , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the first leisure moment , sit down and gravely consider your scheme for issuing bills of credit , though I tell you before hand , if it does not secure an invariable value to the bills , that is , to be worth as much to-morrow , next day , and all the time they are extant , as at the moment they are issued , or I might have said , to be at the first of their coming out and always , what they are called in the face , I say , unless effectual care can be taken for so ascertaining of them , I can never be in opinion of any scheme for a paper currency . Every other thing must be a cheat and delusion . " 2 The other , directed to Thomas Hutchinson , has the subsequent language : " You say , it would be much better if some other way than by application to Parliament could be found to suppress it , ( Land Bank . ) I assure you , the concerned openly declare they defy any act of Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so brassy and hardy as to be now combining in a body , to raise a rebellion , and the day set for their coming to this town is at the Election , and their Treasurer , I am told , is in the 1 Governor Belcher 's Correspond- * Governor Belcher 's Correspondence in the Library of the Massa- ence. chusetts Historical Society . /z/ bottom of the design and I doubt it not . I have this day 1741 sent the sheriff and his officers to apprehend some of the * heads of the conspirators . " The energetic measures adopted on this occasion , strike a damp upon the feelings of the conspirators , and they draw back from their hazardous purpose . The individuals , so implicated , were chiefly from what are now denominated Plymouth and Norfolk Counties . 1 While the Land Bank is the occasion of such a disposi- May tion among many of the people , its influence is renewedly exhibited in the Assembly . The House propose several of its supporters for members of the Council , but the Governor puts his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sends the subsequent message to the Representatives . 28 . " The management of the Elections made yesterday , discovers to me so much of the inclination of your House to support the fraudulent , pernicious scheme , commonly called the Land Bank , condemned at home by his Majesty and Parliament , that I judge it derogatory to the King 's honor and service , and inconsistent with the peace and welfare of this people , that you sit any longer in General Assembly , and I have therefore directed Mr. Secretary Willard to declare this Court dissolved . " 2 Perceiving his Excellency to be so determined , Rev. June Jonathan White , of Gloucester , writes an apology to him 29-for being concerned with such a company . He relates , that his people had so far failed in their fishery , by reason of war with Spain , and fear of war with France , that they owed him 200 of his salary , which greatly straitened his family , and drove him to hire money . He then says , " I pray that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being concerned in the Land Bank . When I first gave in my name , I looked upon it as just and beneficial to the publick . But it , in the event , proving hurtful , I am sorry I was ever concerned in it . " While Governor Belcher thus strenuously set himself /z/ 1741. against private banks , the majority of the Representatives - delay not to retaliate . Already had they instructed their friends in London to solicit his removal . Nor were their efforts unsuccessful . He is recalled before accomplishing what he honestly considered an important work of reform in our political economy . July 1 His course in this country was misrepresented to the 3 - Royal Council , by those who took advantage of his unpopularity with the advocates of the Land Bank , so as to get him displaced , in the hope of advancing their own interest . Nor was this management discovered till he was actually ejected from office . When the rights of the case came to be properly understood , he was placed in the government of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government here , he thus gives vent to his emotions . " I must needs own , it gives me a terrible shock , and the more so , when I consider how faithful I have been to the King , and after all to be turned out without fault or complaint , I think must be a great discouragement to all faithful servants . " William Shirley having been appointed as his successor , arrives to resume his task . This , in point of labor , had much resemblance to Sysiphus rolling his stone . As an alleviation , however , of his toil , he does not insist on the withdrawal of the Province notes so soon as his predecessor did . Aug . Still , in his first speech , he describes his views of pecuniary affairs , as far from being bright and cheerful . A compend of this document gives us the ensuing facts . It is hoped that the legislation of Parliament will terminate the miseries accumulated on the Province by the depreciation of its bills . It states , that exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of the former , and hence creditors , as the law stands , suffer immensely , except those who make their contracts on special conditions . It intimates that such a state of trade is an abundant source of dishonesty . It remarks , /z/ that the adjacent Colonies have flooded Massachusetts 1741. with their paper money , to the great profit of themselves , vbut to the greater detriment of our community . In conformity with the implied wish of Mr. Shirley , Sept. in this document , l &; committee of the Court meet at 22 ' Milton , to examine the condition of the Land Bank . They find that 49,250 of its notes are struck off and endorsed , and that the Treasurer had issued them from his hands to the amount of 35,582 , and that the Directors employ 4,067 of them in trade . This investigation is soon followed with heavy restrictions upon the funds of the company . As a sample how banking concerns figured in poetry as well as prose , the following is presented . 2 It is a dialogue between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will , a rustick ; wherein Ralph undertakes to instruct Will in State affairs . /z/ " Two bits of paper from the plate , Ingaged in cruel wars of late , Drest in the pride of copper cuts , Each other charged with being cheats , " /z/ " Stay pleased to explain ; I fain would know what ' t is you mean .

This is , to their ears , like good news from a far country . 3 As a means to correct the effects of a deranged cur- 1743 , rency , is the enactment of the Equity Bill , which had Janbeen long on the tapis , and which experience had proved 1 Massachusetts Archives Pecu- 2 Ames ' Almanack , 1742. niary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1742. to be very necessary . This document requires , that , after N v " the 1st of February next , all coined silver of sterling alloy shall pass , as lawful , at 6/8 the ounce , troy weight , and other money in the same proportion ; " and as bills of credit have been fluctuating and uncertain in their value , whereby many mischiefs and inconveniences have arisen , " those now to be emitted shall be equal to hard money , and pass at the preceding rate . It provides , that all debts , which shall be contracted within five years , shall be payable in such notes , special agreements excepted ; and if they depreciate , allowance shall be made accordingly . It demands , in order to prevent discount on the intended paper money , that , whenever exchanged for silver , it shall pass in proportion of 6/8 an ounce of such metal .

By the delay of those indebted to the institution , our company is thrown into the last extremity of confusion ; and without the most speedy measures are pursued in bringing in the bills , the consequence will , we fear , prove ruinous to some hundreds of the partners . The possessors of our bills are more and more uneasy every day , as that part of their estates lies useless by them , and are so incessant in their worries , that the Directors have in their late advertisement implicitly threatened to be on the possessors ' side against the delaying partners . " April 3 While his Excellency and the rest of the General Court 7 are doing what they can to prevent ruinous collapses in the machinery of monied interests , he publishes an Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations without charters . 1 Boston Gazette . 3 Massachusetts Archives Pecu- 2 Ebenezer Hartshorn , Jacob niary , vol. iii . Sheafe , Peter Prescott . /z/ In accordance with this Act , all the proprietors of the 1742 . Land and Specie companies , who ceased connection with their operations before the 29th of September last , and who immediately settle all their dues to them , are to be saved harmless from the penalties specified in such an instrument . 1 It is enacted that 4 in bills of the old tenor , and April 26/8 of the first new tenor , otherwise called middle . tenor , shall be received in all public payments equal to 20 9 in bills of the last form , and so pro rata for a greater or less amount . It must have required some of Mr. Biddie 's genius to have readily and correctly managed so complicated a mode of calculating the different denominations of the Province paper . The Act of Parliament , just mentioned , leads to the ensuing resolve : " Whereas it is expedient and necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this Province , that all the notes of the silver and manufactory schemes should be drawn in and consumed , as soon as may be , " a committee are appointed to investigate them , and report at the approaching session , so that their notes may be collected and consumed . 2 To show the fears , feelings , and situation of stock- May holders in the Land Bank , the petition of twenty-two of 27 - them to the General Court is here cited . " We the subscribers were partners in that unlucky and unfortunate scheme , called the Land or Manufacture Bank , and when the Act from Great Britain arrived here and was published , we yielded as speedy compliance thereunto as was possible for us to do by paying in our respective parts or shares , and renouncing being any longer partners in the said affair . But some of our fellow-partners were incredulous , and would not believe that there was any such Act , and so under that incredulous notion , or rather through wilful negligence , have not nor will pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank or Manufactory Bills , although they have been cautioned so to do by this honoura- 1 Massachusetts Provincial Rec- 2 Massachusetts Archives Peeuords. niary , vol. iii . /z/ 1742. ble Court , and so by their obstinate and wilful negligence , or dishonest delays and dealings , your petitioners ' persons and estates lie exposed to the demands of the possessors of the said bills , and several of your petitioners have already had demands made on them by the possessors of the said bills , to exchange several large sums of the said bills , and the processes are now out against them therefor . And yet we lie further exposed to have more and greater demands made upon us , and may , as we greatly fear , prove the undoing of your petitioners . " Therefore they pray for needed relief in the premises . A committee are accordingly appointed . June x The gentlemen so intrusted , report on the " silver 30 scheme . " They state that this 2 association had emitted 120,000 in notes , and recalled 69,361 12 6 of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers and other partners in these monied institutions , placed under the ban of a Parliamentary enactment , had already met with no small trouble , yet they were to experience much more . The powerful opposition under which they commenced operations , was but a dark omen of their catastrophe . While these institutions fill a large space in the public vision , the last series of Province notes do not help the 174 3. community so much as anticipated . Individual interest 4* then , as it generally has in all ages , being made paramount to the common benefit , is the occasion of so bitter a disappointment to the true guardians of the country . 3 The notes , payable in specie , are hoarded up , and others are imposed on the inhabitants for their produce and manufactures . Hence , the common currency is the paper of adjoining Colonies , and that of this Province is not enough to meet the demands for taxes . June 4 But , however , the last Treasury notes are scarce , and /z/ 1 Massachusetts Archives Pecu- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

As the public faith had been suffered to be violated respecting the payment of Province bills , it is not fully credited now , though backed with promises more strongly guarded , and thus the paper falls from its appointed valuation . 1 To lessen this evil , the Legislature of Massachusetts July , propose to New Hampshire , Rhode Island and Connecticut , to have commissioners meet with theirs at Worcester , on the first Wednesday of November , to prevent further depreciation of the bills of credit in New England , arid bring said bills to a period , consistently with the best interests of the said Colonies . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nov. complied with the order of Government , are made liable for its paper , and have suffered great loss , because others of their company neglect to imitate their example , the Legislature commit the settlement of this institution to several commissioners . 3 In speaking on the pecuniary affairs of the Common- 1744. wealth , the Executive gives the ensuing details . Of F g b * Rhode Island bills , now in circulation , and amounting to 440,000 , 350,000 are passing in Massachusetts , and also 50,000 of Connecticut . On these two sums , the people here have lost , by the fall of them , 25,000 in nine months , which is so much proportioned gain to the two Colonies . This and other such losses equal 180,000 . Not only this , but their bills reduce the value of those issued by Massachusetts . The Governor also observes , that it is an error to allow the Colonies to coin money or make bills , and that this is a Royal prerogative . The House , knowing that individuals here had peti- 37. tioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Colonies , and believing this to be contrary to their Charter privileges , order instructions to their agent , Christopher Kilby , so that he 1 Massachusetts Archives Let- 2 Massachusetts Acts , ters , vol. iii . 3 Journal of the House . jig HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF 1744. may endeavor to prevent such interference . The Council x v ' refuse to have part or lot with the Representatives in this movement . The latter seem to have been induced partly to pursue such a course by the closing remark of the Governor . March l In despite of the measures previously adopted , to ex. - * elude the bills of adjacent Colonies , they still find many who receive and pass them . His Excellency assures the Assembly that , unless they cut short this practice , their Charter will be forfeited . A Bill was accordingly passed to be enacted . May 2 In quoting from an Election sermon of Mr. James 31 * Allen , a performance , which , as annually given , furnished the leading topics of discussion , and thus valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious instructions , has the ensuing passage : " And that you ( the Governor ) will be the means of delivering us from the perplexing difficulties we are involved in , particularly by an unhappy medium , uncertain as the wind , and fluctuating like the waves of the sea , and which lies at the mercy of every one to rise or sink at his pleasure . Through the unrighteousness whereof the land mourneth , and the cries of many are going up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth . " Dec . As debtors , who confided in the last emission of Government notes , had promised to pay lawful money , meaning these bills , but their creditors demanded specie of them , because such paper had diminished in value , a law is passed , that no debtor shall be obliged to pay silver , unless he received it when contracting his obligation . 1745. 3 Pressed on all sides with the demands on their Trea9 ' sury for the war , and not having sufficient funds to satisfy them , the Government resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

X A law is passed to forbid the currency of Rhode Se P l Island , issued since 1742 . All persons holding any offices , are required to take oath , that they will obey this Statute . Such a rule was , either purposely or unintentionally , often overlooked in the choice of town authorities , and 1747. this caused many 2 petitions to the Legislature , that their * doings might be made legal . As debtors find the Equity law , in reference to paper Oct. money , bears hard on them , the Council and House desire the Governor to have it repealed . But he declines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act , though he was aware that it needed some modification . 3 A report is made by the Lords of the Treasury , on the Dec. expense of the North American Colonies in the expedition against Cape Breton . They state the proportion of Massachusetts to be 261,700 3 in their new tenor bills . This computed at 142 10 per cent , exchange , makes 183,649 2 7J- sterling . - Though this corresponds with the value of said bills in 1744 , before the expedition against Cape Breton , yet it greatly exceeds the present value of them . Such notes have fallen much since February 14 , 1745 , when the first order was passed by Massachusetts to emit them for the expedition . But Mr. Bollan contends , that the great depreciation of our paper was owing to the distress occasioned by that expedition , and that no advantage should be taken of such contingences . The Lords of the Treasury maintain that the reduction of Massachusetts paper might be traced to the uncertainty of their being redeemed . The fact is , that truth lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our agent in London , writes to the Speaker 1748. of the House , that there are many schemes before Parlia- J n * ment , as to the plan of having the Colonial notes recalled . /z/ 1 Massachusetts Acts . * Massachusetts Archives For- 2 Massachusetts Provincial Rec- eign Relations , vol. i. ds. . 5 Massachusetts Provincial Rec- /z/ 1748. notes only by the standard of silver and bills of exchange , there is wrong done to the community , as well as to the government , because such a standard is suddenly and immoderately increased by speculators , " It is enacted , that when the persons appointed for such a purpose make their stated valuation of the paper money , they shall do it by the prices of provisions and other necessaries of life , as by the customary scale . " As a general and correct exposition of the state in which the country is with respect to its medium of exchange , the succeeding extracts from his Excellency 's speech , are here given . " The general distress of the Province , arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereof , for all occasions of life , is sunk so low , and is still sinking , and thereby the estates of orphans and widows , and many others who have no remedy in their power against this growing evil , daily diminishing which , must inevitably , in a little time , bring many good families to poverty . I most earnestly recommend to you to find some other way to supply the Treasury , than by making new emissions of paper money . And I am fully persuaded , that you will thereby not only give relief to the oppressed , who justly expect it from you , but also whatever charge may attend any new method to supply , it will be found in the end to save money to the Province . " In accordance with the advice thus given , Thomas Hutchinson moves , that the public notes be redeemed by the specie , to be received from the Royal exchequer , for charges in the capture of Louisbourg . In the meanwhile , merchants of London , who traded here , petition Parliament to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but little encouragement from the House at first , but it is soon adopted by them . Wearied by the arduous bondage in which they had been to the Treasury system of loans , and other frequent emissions of notes , they gladly comply with his proposal . A committee are designated to meet similar bodies /z/ from the other New England governments on the same 1748 subject . A circular letter is prepared to give such an invitation . But it does not receive the cooperation of New Hampshire , Rhode Island , and Connecticut , which was ardently wished . They suppose it better to let their monied concerns pursue the common course . The burden of depreciation in their notes , having fallen more on Massachusetts than on themselves , they had not the motive of interest to draw forth their compliance which this Province had . This plan is not without its 1 opponents in our Commonwealth . A considerable party , headed by Dr. William Douglas , the historian , though very desirous to have the paper taken out of circulation , contended , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if carried into operation in its present features , it would give a fatal shock to business . 2 Such a diversity of opinion was not peculiar to our Fe fc . country ; it existed on the other side of the Atlantic . 29-Merchants in London , who had commercial relations with ours , petition the Lords of the Treasury , that the reimbursement for capturing Louisbourg may not be paid to New England until they establish the rate of redeeming their bills . They state that since the prospect of the Colonies ' being paid for the expenses of such a conquest , there has been great speculation in their paper currency . 3 In a circular written by order of the General Court March to Connecticut , New Hampshire , and Rhode Island , 5 - about having Commissioners meet on the subject of applying the reimbursement of Parliament for taking and keeping Cape Breton , to redeem their bills of credit , we have the subsequent extract : " There have been some proposals and endeavors , that the payment might be made by debenture . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money granted , to redeem and finish our fatal paper currency , so absolutely necessary to the establishment and preservation of justice in our ' Hutchinson. 3 Massachusetts Archives Colo- 2 Massachusetts Archives Pecu- nial , vol. v. niary , vol. iii . /z/ 1748. commerce , and so much for the interest of Great Britain , * " as well as ourselves . " This absorbing topic is viewed by distant friends of our Province with mingled feelings of hope and fear . Among them is its late Chief Magistrate , Mr. Belcher , now Governor of New Jersey . 1 He writes to Mr. Minot ; " I am glad Massachusetts is like to be retrieved from her bankrupt circumstances by the interposition of the British Parliament , in a just reimbursement of their charge in the conquest of Cape Breton . So shall my dear native country again sit as a queen among the Provinces . " Oct. 2 His Excellency has the ensuing passages in his speech . 27 * " By advices I have received from Great Britain , I have reason to think , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sinking the whole paper currency of this Province by means of the late reimbursement , voted by Parliament , and which passed both Houses of the last Assembly , has induced his Majesty 's ministers , to whose consideration the manner of paying the money voted for the benefit of the Colonies concerned is referred , to determine it shall be paid in such manner as will put an end to the paper currency in New England . " Various schemes have been offered by gentlemen in England , to the Government there , on this subject . He suggests to the General Court that they had better send despatches to be in London by the session of Parliament early in the winter , so as to prevent the adoption of any method injurious to this Province . Nov. 3 Still impressed , that their plan for closing the paper ' currency in Massachusetts could not be fully accomplished while adjacent Colonies did not cooperate with them , our Legislature hear a report of their committee for another invitation for delegates from those Governments to meet in Boston relative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Shirley 14. states in his 4 message , that this sum , at the rate of 10 1 Governor Belcher 's Letters . 3 Massachusetts Provincial Rec- 2 Massachusetts Provincial Rec- ords. ords. 4 Journal of the House . /z/ in bills , for 1 sterling , will draw in all their paper money , 1743. except 50,000 of the last emission . * Desirous that the plan here mentioned , may be exe- Nov cuted as soon as possible , the General Court l petition the 22 . Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in London , that the reimbursement may be forwarded with all despatch . They express their expectation , that this sum will close the paper currency in their jurisdiction , and will substitute gold and silver . 2 Notwithstanding the repeated efforts to have the Colo- Dec. nies bordering on Massachusetts adopt the mode of having only hard currency , Governor Shirley says he despairs of thus gaining them over , and advises the Court to go forward , though under so great an embarrassment . 3 Some merchants of Boston memorialize the Assembly , 1749. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan * rency of notes with the funds expected from London . They observe , that they do this not only because they really wish for it , but , also , to show , that representations , as though they were opposed , were not correct . Other merchants of the same place request that the Bill may be published , and carefully considered , before it is passed . The latter petition , however , did not prevail . 4 A law is made for the redemption of the Province bills 26. of credit . It requires all this paper to be exchanged at the treasury by March 31 , 1750 , at the following rates : For forty-five shillings in bills of the old tenor , one piece-of-eight or a dollar ; for eleven shillings and three pence of the middle and new tenor , the same coin ; and so in proportion for greater or less sums . If any of such bills are kept back for a year after the time designated , they are to be irredeemable . The enactment further provides , that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and private demands contracted after the date , fixed for recalling the treasury notes , shall be accounted as payable in silver coin estimated at 6/8 for an ounce . It appoints that what the specie , to be received /z/ 1 74 9. from England , lacks of paying these notes , shall be ean " celled by a tax . It appoints a penalty for taking or passing any of the New Hampshire , Connecticut and Rhode Island notes . It demands a renewal of the practices for innholders and all officers of town and state , with retailers , to take oath for carrying such a clause into effect . The form used in this respect , follows : " You , A. B. , do in the presence of God , solemnly declare , that you have not , since the last day of March , 1750 , wittingly and willingly , directly or indirectly , either for yourself or any for or under you , been concerned in receiving or paying within this government , any bill or bills of credit of either of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island . So help you God . " 1 That this Act may have its proper effect , the Legislature petition his Majesty respecting the adjacent Colonies . They say " nothing can prevent the measures we have taken for these purposes , proving effectual , unless it be the currency of the paper bills of your Majesty 's other govern- 28. ments , which are unhappily interwoven with our bills . " 2 Aware that such a law bore the aspect of severity towards New Hampshire , Rhode Island and Connecticut , the Governor writes an explanation of its reasons to the last Colony . He says " We could not avoid prohibiting the currency of the bills of your governments among us . Past experience having convinced us , that it is impracticable to keep silver currency among us , while a paper currency is continued . It was with great reluctance that we agreed to any paragraphs in this Act , which affected the bills of other governments , especially those of Connecticut , of whose good disposition we are so well apprized , as to make no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Act , being so completed , is immediately forwarded by the Secretary , to William Bollan , the Province agent , for the Royal sanction . This gentleman , knowing that a April bill was pending before the House of Commons , relative * to the Colonies ' legislation on currency , petitions , that it may be arrested as inconsistent with their Charter rights , /z/ and with the privileges of Englishmen . He allows that 1749. it is good to have their paper money stopped , but he - desires that it may be done by themselves . l He again June repeats similar sentiments on this subject to the same Body . He says that if they pass the bill , " it will take from the inhabitants of the Massachusetts Bay , not only the special powers and privileges they enjoy by their Charter , but likewise all the liberties , they hold in common with other British subjects . " 2 As a sign of the great depreciation of bills , we have the succeeding distich , which , though not remarkable for poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sauce to market come , And carry loads of tattered money home . " 3 By a communication from Governor Jonathan Law to 13 Governor Shirley , it appears that the Assembly of Connecticut had voted to redeem their bills and levy three rates in 1751-2-3 , which will be sufficient to call them all in , " and all fines , fees and penalties are to be established in Proclamation money . " 4 Another communication is made by Mr. Bollan , to our 30 . Legislature , that their Act for drawing in their paper by means of the money expected from the treasury in London , has passed the Parliament , and was approved by the King on the 28th. 5 Expressive of disinclination on the part of many to Sept. the redemption of our paper money with specie , until the adjacent Colonies come into a similar agreement , is the passage of a letter from Jeremy Allen of Boston to Samuel Waldo in London .

The Evening Post of Boston , informs the public that ' the specie , paid by the Crown , had arrived , under the care of Mr. Bollan . While the General Court were debating the question , whether they would redeem their paper with this money , the inhabitants were generally indifferent , because they viewed the plan as chimerical , and not likely to be realized ; but when they heard that Parliament had granted the reimbursement on condition that it be applied for such a redemption , discontent began to show itself . This money consisted , 653,000 oz. of silver and 10 tons of copper .

And with the blessing of God upon our wise and faithful management of this advantage , deliver this Province from the evils and mischiefs ( particularly the injustice and oppression ) arising from the uncertain and sinking value of the paper medium . " He advises the Court to fulfil their law for so desirable a purpose . 1 Though absent , Governor Shirley takes a deep interest Nov. in our pecuniary concerns . Let his own words , as sent from London , be given : " I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , for bringing the neighbouring Colonies under the like obligation with ourselves , to put an end to their paper currency , to be of the utmost importance at this crisis ; as it seems to be the only sure method of preventing Rhode Island , New Hampshire and Connecticut from drawing away our silver coin in exchange for the Massachusetts bills , which they are and shall be possessed of , and leaving their bills to sink in the hands of the people of our own Province an evil , which , besides the loss it will bring upon our people , in whose hands those bills must finally sink to nothing , may so far lessen our silver , as to make it insufficient for a medium within the Province . " He adds " The gentlemen of the Council and House of Representatives may therefore be assured of my unwearied endeavours to guard against those mischievous consequences to the Province , fry forwarding , ( as far as in me lies , ) a suitable Act of Parliament for that purpose , towards preparing the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House of Commons , who was pleased to tell me , that he expected to hear from me soon in Parliament upon the affair of the paper currency j that he should be extremely glad to know my sentiments upon it ; and that I might the more fully draw them up , proceeded to acquaint me with the objections insisted upon against putting an entire end to the issuing of bills of credit in New England , and particularly with his own difficulties in that point , with /z/ 1749. his sentiments in general upon the subject of a paper cur ' * rency in the Colonies . This took up near an hour , and I was surprized a little to observe by what dropt from him , that two or three principal gentlemen , whose assistance I thought might be depended upon for abolishing paper currency in New England , seemed of late to have slackened in their sentiments upon it . However , I shall proceed to draw up my sentiments upon the state of the New England paper currency in the most explicit manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accompany them , both of which shall be communicated likewise to those gentlemen , I have before hinted at .

In the mean time , to prevent the mischiefs which may arise for want of this , till it can be effectually done , I shall endeavor to obtain his Majesty 's leave for the Lieutenant Governor to consent to an Act of Assembly for protracting the time , stated by law , for calling in the money , as is proposed in your letter . I shall also endeavour to obtain his Majesty 's leave for issuing a proper quantity of bills of a low denomination upon the foot proposed in your letter , to supply the Province with money to serve in common dealings for the petty articles in the daily necessaries of life ; concerning which , I should have been glad if you had specified the proposed denominations of the bills , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service .

Here we are introduced to coins , which became current and are familiar to the memory of many . 1 To suppress the outbreakings of disaffection with the exchanging of the Province bills by order of the government , a Riot Act is passed . This law resembled one of Parliament , with some change in the penalty . The Treasurer is instructed to pay out hammered or Feb. cobb money at 6/8 oz. with milled dollars , in proportion to the amount of each in his hands . While this process of redemption is going on , money is very scarce . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribers are unable to obtain either paper or coin , for their work or wares , and therefore can not pay their taxes ; for which their property is seized and vended from one fourth to one tenth of its value . For such reasons they pray , that relief may be granted them in the premises . 2 Edward Cornwallis , Governor of Nova Scotia , had 27. applied to Massachusetts for aid against the Indians in his neighborhood . Lieut . Governor Spencer Phips , sends him the succeeding reply : " I am heartily sorry that nothing could be obtained at this time from our General Court . The difficulties we are under by reason of the change of our currency , it is thought had some influence . It is the opinion of the wisest and best men among us , that the change of the medium from bills of credit to money , will be much for the general benefit of the Province ; yet there are great numbers of people that are much too strongly attached to the paper currency , and it happening at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the silver not yet circulating in the several parts of the Province , a great stagnation of business ensued . And at the very time , when your affair was under consideration , we had rumours that many hundreds of people were coming to the General Court with a petition for making more /z/ 1751. paper money , and about three hundred men were actually assembled within less than three miles of the town . However , all the effect of it was , the passing a good wholesome law against riots , which could never before be obtained . " Another passage in this letter , marked over with lines of ink , shows the public feeling as to another topic . It follows : Many " are dissatisfied with the present remarkable decay of Trade , which is supposed to arise from the breaking off our correspondence in a great measure with our neighboring Colonies , by interdicting the passing of then : bills among us , and their receiving our silver in exchange for the Massachusetts bills in their hands , for we are now gotten within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair , when by law , bills of credit are no longer to pass among us . " April l To put down the various demonstrations of opposition * to the plan for exchanging the paper currency , both Houses give their immediate attention , as in the ensuing case : Robert Howland of Duxborough , and Fobes Little of Little Compton , " are suspected of publishing and dispersing a printed paper , containing sundry expressions , tending to bring into contempt and subvert the constitution of this government . " From depositions in reference to this subject , these persons were concerned in having verses printed in Rhode Island , " containing a lamentation for the death of old tenor , having very hard reflections on the General Court . " That these individuals might be made an example so as to deter many others , who sided with them , the Representatives and Council vote , that Mr. Phips issue a Proclamation , offering a suitable reward for their apprehension . A great 2 cause of prejudice against the redemption of paper currency and its cessation was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected , that while the wealthy would hoard up the silver and gold , they should have none of it , and should be worse off than under the system of Province banking . This led to several tumultuous assemblies in and near Boston . A large number of people from Abington arid /z/ other towns came to the metropolis with riotous inten- 1751. tions . They expected to be joined here by a large party . But they were disappointed . Their courage cooled , and their purpose was relinquished by the hoots of boys and servants , who drove them back . To supply a medium of exchange , a bill passes for the April Treasurer to issue Certificates , on interest , to be paid by December 31 , 1751 . His Honor declines signing it , because such paper is not legal tender , will drive specie from the market , become reduced in value , promote injustice , and is contrary to Royal instructions . For the same reasons , Andrew Oliver and Thomas Hutchinson had recently dissented from a vote of the Council on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for supplying the want of currency , which had any resemblance to the paper system , from which they hoped the Province would entirely extricate itself . On further consideration of the matter , with some 26. modification , Mr. Phips consents to the issue of treasury notes for money , borrowed for the Province on interest . This precedent became a practice . Similar securities were continually issued to meet the disbursements of the government . Though it passed in business , on special agreements , yet it was not allowed to be legal tender . It was emitted from the treasury till the Revolution , and was then soon renewed under a different administration . The Commissioners appointed to exchange the public j une notes for specie , close their labors . They redeemed 3 - 50,705 6 s 8 d in bills of the old tenor , 38,431 7 3 of the middle , and 1,703,099 11 s 5 d of the new tenor , making an amount of 1,792,236 5 s l d at the rate of about one in specie for ten of paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , petitions continued to be laid before the Legislature , that parcels of them discovered in old desks , bottoms of leather chairs , and other private places of deposite , might be allowed and exchanged . Thus the conquest of Louisbourg not only wrested a strong hold from enemies , but , also , furnished the means of freeing this Province from one of its most prolific /z/ 1751 sources of anxiety , contention , crime , and calamity . The emission of notes from the Treasury , whether as loans , or payments of annual expenses of Government , was an incessant cause of difficulties between the Chief Magistrate and popular branch of the Legislature . If ever men had cause to exclaim , in reference to paper currency , " The love of money is the root of all evil , " it was Dudley , Shute , Burnet , Belcher and Shirley . This proved to them an opponent of Brierius power . It was among the principal causes , which raised the question of Parliamentary jurisdiction over this Province , as well as others , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . In producing such an important alteration in the pecuniary concerns of Massachusetts , Thomas Hutchinson stood in the front rank , and acted a prominent part . l The remark he subsequently made to a 2 correspondent in England , was amply justified by his conduct . " I think I may be allowed to call myself the father of the present fixed medium , and , perhaps , have a natural bias in favour of it . " One fact , derived from a review of the paper money system to this period , is that large and frequent emissions of it , not redeemable till several years , and then not punctually paid , is no addition to the real medium of trade , which existed when such a course commenced . A prominent reason for this inference is , that as the bills of credit were thus multiplied , so they diminished in value , and drove almost all the coin from the market . 3 The tendency of such paper , with regard to itself , is much like what any article of commerce has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in too large quantities . In Holland , it was formerly the case , that when there was too large an importation of spices , it was found expedient to destroy part of them , so that the remainder might bring more than the whole would , if preserved . In 1740 , Virginia , perceiving that their tobacco , which ' Massachusetts Archives Hutch- England , dated Dec. 14 , 1761. inson 's correspondence . 3 Discourse on Colonial currencies . S A letter of his to a friend in /z/ constituted part of their currency , began to depreciate in 175 , value , passed a law restricting 1,000 pounds of it annually , to each " tythable . " For a similar purpose , Maryland , in 1734 and 5 , ordered 150 pounds of it " per rateable , " to be consumed . Indeed , it must be plain to every observing mind , that excess in paper money , emitted on any promises and securities , like excess in every thing else , is injurious to community just in the proportion , that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Colonies might not fall again into June the course they had done , in respect to issues of bills of credit , Parliament enacted a law . This instrument forbid such money to be passed , except for current expenses of the Government each year , and of invasion by an enemy ; but never as a legal tender for debts . That its requisitions might be complied with , any Governor who should consent to a rule of different signification on this subject , should be dismissed from office , and ever after be ineligible to public employment . While this subject was under consideration , able and iteresting memorials against such a statute were premted by agents of New England . It was deprecated by the people here , not so much for its immediate purpose , as for its relative influence to bring them more under the control of the Crown , arid to impair the remaining liberties of their Charter . 2 Relative to such a statute , Mr. Bollan writes to our July Representative . " The paper currency Bill was attended with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill would have been agreed on before it was moved in the House ; but the design , which was at first concealed , of putting , by Act of Parliament , the credit of the Colonies wholly under the power of an Instruction , prevented it ; or , at least , it appeared to me , this was the chief reason for some of the principal managers proceeding as they did . This design , which had , I am satisfied , been formed by some persons of consequence , 1 Journal of the House of Com- 2 Massachusetts Archives Formons. eign Relations , vol. i. /z/ 1751. was conducted with great art . When the Bill in 1748 " " was brought into the House , for enforcing the King 's orders and instructions , that being brought against all the Colonies , and to enforce all the King 's orders and instructions whatsoever , whereby the Constitution of the Colonies would , I think , have been wholly subverted , and a despotic power vested in the Crown . That was plainly such an unconstitutional attempt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully explained and laid open ; whereas this Bill , brought in against part of the Colonies , was to put only one single article under the King 's instruction , and the King , by his prerogative , having greater power over money , than over most other matters , and bills of credit having been used in the Colonies as money , it was apprehended , that this might more easily pass , and being once passed , would serve for introducing , by degrees , the King 's instructions to control other articles , and so would have been a very dangerous precedent . It was moreover urged , that there had been great abuse in this article , in particular , in the Colonies , and that they had disregarded the orders issued upon address to his Majesty from Parliament , and there was a necessity of laying a restraint on the Colonies , and , also , of reposing a trust somewhere ; and that it could not be so well placed any where in this case , as in the Crown . Thereupon , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost . ' 7 Notwithstanding the exertions of our Government , as well as that of England , to exclude bills of other Colonies from ours , still they are not altogether effectual . Oct. 1 In reference to the recent law of Parliament concerning * the currency of this country , Mr. Phips writes as follows to the Lords of Trade . " I have received the Act of Parliament for regulating the currencies of the Governments in New England , and I am glad I can inform your Lordships , that there is a general disposition in the inhabitants of this Province to conform to it , which I hope will continue , unless the example of any of the other Governments in evading the force and intent of the Act should prevent it . " 1 Massachusetts Archives Letters , voK iv . /q/ 1 As evidence that the products of the Commonwealth 1751. are still current at the Treasury for taxes , a committee , consisting of the eldest Counsellor from each County , and the Treasurer , are appointed to set the prices of such articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of credit were appraised , to 1727 , we now proceed to offer the following . 1728 %Z* 16/6 , 17/ , and 18/ , * " /z/ 1730 21/ , 20/ and 19/ 1731 18/6 and 19/ 1732 ..... 19/6 , 20/ and 20/6 1733 21/ , 21/6 , 22/ , 22/6 and 23/ 1734 24/ , 25/ , 26/ , 26/6 and 27/ /z/ 3 With regard to the bills of other Colonies , the Lieu- Dec. tenant Governor expresses himself in the subsequent 27 * Journal of the House . 3 Massachusetts Provincial Rec- /z/ 1751. terms . " I must continue to recommend to you , to keep a constant eye upon the state of the Treasury , and of the current money or medium of trade of the Province . With respect to the latter , I have been informed , that some persons venture to run the risque of the penalty of the law , and presume to receive and pass the bills of credit of the neighboring Governments ; which mischievous practice , if in any measure connived at , will probably spread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done what I thought necessary , on my part , and with the advice of his Majesty 's Council , have issued a Proclamation , requiring all whom it concerns , faithfully to do their duty in prosecuting all offenders against this Act . " 1752. 1 A question , productive of many debates , of prolonged Dec. legislation , and many spirited remarks , begins to be agitated in the General Court . It was , whether gold should be a legal tender , as well as silver . Its settlement will be mentioned in its chronological place . 1753 In reference to coins which had been sent with the April reimbursement from the Royal Exchequer , their value is now appointed . Being whole and half pistareens , they are to pass at the rate of 14J d for the former . 11. 2 Though the Province paper had closed its currency as a legal tender in traffic concerns , yet it was not all redeemed at the Treasury . The officer of this department shows by his account , that 131,996 3 9 of it , in old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in the hands of the people . In this connection , he states , that a committee of the Legislature had burnt , at the Town House , such paper to the amount of 1,792,236 5 1 . To those who earnestly sought the extermination of such currency , it was a fire of joy but to the many , who cast longing and lingering looks for its continuance , it was a fire of sorrow . 13. 3 Not only was this imputed occasion of Provincial distress though it appeared to be , in a great measure , a necessary evil thus put away from being an object of /z/ temptation , but also , the very plates , which ushered them 1753. upon community , were formally destroyed by a Legislative committee . 1 Governor Shirley , who had great influence in changing D GC the character of the currency , makes the ensuing remarks . 5 - " It is a great pleasure to me to find the happy effects of the reimbursement granted by Parliament of our charges , expended in the reduction of Cape Breton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only natural and genuine one , both for private commerce and the public business of the Government , and delivering us from the many mischiefs attending a paper currency , especially as it has been of late years unhappily managed in the several Provinces and Colonies of New England .

I must therefore recommend it to you to fix as short a period as conveniently may be , from this time , for putting an end to the currency of the bills still outstanding , and to concert proper measures for keeping the silver and gold within the Province . Among other methods for that purpose , I would recommend to you to give some encouragement to the raising of wheat , and other English grain within the Province , as our purchasing it from the neighbouring Colonies , contributes greatly towards draining us of our coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged the 37. passing of the notes of adjacent Colonies , as to the prohibition of such a practice , an Act is renewed to prevent this sort of currency . Such preventives were repeatedly adopted by the Assembly till the Revolution . 3 As the last particular mention of the Province bills of 1754 . credit , we have a published notice of Harrison Gray , Jan - Treasurer . He states that all of them still out , must be brought to him for being exchanged by the first day of next June , or be forfeited j and if subsequently passed , a /z/ 1754. fine is to be imposed of 10 for each offence . He also no tifies , that the quarters , halves , and three quarters of such paper must be presented at the Treasury by the first of the succeeding March , or else be irredeemable . Dec . Occasionally the effects of the Provincial banking 10 - system come before the Assembly . They order , that , as lands and buildings in several counties are still mortgaged for loans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed , the trustees are instructed to sue the debtors . 1755. 2 Having no paper medium , except Province securities , J J* n - and there being little of other money in circulation , the Government find it very difficult to realize specie for their notes . Governor Shirley observes to the Representatives , " For remedying this evil , I would earnestly recommend to you , gentlemen , that such monies as persons may advance may be exempted from being taxed in the usual assessments . This has been the constant practice of the Parliament of Great Britain , and has been found by long experience , to be a happy expedient for seasonable supplies of money in the public exchequer there . " March 3 As large quantities of counterfeit half pence , of base metal , had been imported , and , with French and other small copper coin continually increase , a committee are ordered to report measures to prevent such practices . 29. 4 Finding it impracticable to hire what silver they needed , on the faith of their notes , Government vote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterling , for six years , at lawful interest . They were constrained to adopt this method several times , in order to meet their engagements .

For such an exchange , " good merchantable Isle Sable Cod Fish , " is also taken . ' Massachusetts Archives Pecu- * Journal of the House , niary , vol. iv . 6 Massachusetts Archives Pecu- /z/ *Gen . William Johnson , commander of the forces at 1755. the Westward , intended to go against Crown Point , writes to Governor Shirley . Speaking of a grant made by Mas- 19. sachusetts , he remarks , " The 600 mentioned for the Indian service , is not specified to be sterling , or what currency . I make no doubt it is the former , and that the word sterling is an omission . In this you will please make me positive . " This passage shows how hard it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as our Provincials . These well understood , that , unless sterling was used in any vote for money , it of course meant New England , or lawful money . 2 Still urged by Governor Shirley to rally their almost 1756. exhausted energies , and raise the funds , imperiously Feb - called for by expenses of the war , the House address a message to him in a desponding tone , which shows that they found it extremely hard to obtain money . Their language is , " When the Province lay under a heavy load of debt , contracted on account of the late expedition to Kennebeck , the two Houses notwithstanding readily engaged in the expedition to Crown Point , which has so much increased the debt of the Province , that its inhabitants are ready to sink under the burden of taxes hereby brought upon them ; and the Government have so stretched their credit , that they even despair of borrowing money sufficient to pay off their troops , lately returned from that expedition . " 3 His Excellency replies , that , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown for carrying on the war , were never intended to be loaned to any Colony , yet , seeing the necessity of the case , he would venture to let Massachusetts have 30,000 sterling , to be secured by the taxes of the two succeeding years . This proposition was readily adopted . While thus taking on themselves repeated burdens of debt , the authorities of this Commonwealth , as those of others , were encouraged , that the Royal exchequer would refund the bill of costs . 1 Massachusetts Archives Let- ' Journal of the House , ters , vol. i v. 3 Journal of the ' House . /z/ 1756. *In accordance with the earnest expectation of the jJJ following recipients , a warrant is issued from his Majesty 's 3 .

April 4 The General Court , in a letter to William Bollan , their 17 agent in London , state several reasons why their proportion of the large amount , recently granted the Colonies by Parliament for military service against the French and Indians , should be greater . Among such reasons , is the subsequent one . " Notwithstanding the extreme difficulties of procuring money , yet we have not taken any step to a paper medium , but have borrowed our supplies of money and pay interest therefor at 6 per cent. , whilst the other Governments have pushed out their depreciating bills , and an hundred pounds of their currency is not now worth so much as seventy-five were when the expedition began .

" Such recitals were yearly and truly made while the contest with the French continued . Q ct 2 As an encouragement to the Province , the Governor , 4. after adverting to the capture of Cape Breton , and other victories , informs the Assembly , that a repeated grant of 27,380 19 11 J sterling had been made to them by Parliament , for its expenses in the war of 1756 .

I am therefore directed by the whole Court to desire you to give all possible despatch to the affair , that so greatly concerns this Province ; and that you would convert the money into Portuguese , or other good heavy gold , or Spanish milled dollars , as from the price of the two species in England , compared with the current rates here , you shall find to be most for the interest of the Province .

He thus speaks to the Assembly : " I think myself happy , that it has fallen to my lot to congratulate you from this seat , upon the glorious conclusion of the North American war , and the fair prospect that now presents itself , of the security of our country 's being settled upon the most sure and lasting foundations . " 1761. 3 With regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , the most of our authorities were strongly desirous that all of them should be transported in specie . Indeed , this sort of money was requisite to redeem the Government notes . So situated , they had been at great charges in getting over what had already come to hand . Perceiving how this matter stood , Governor Bernard kindly mentions it to the Council and House . His observations follow . " If we look for the advantages which are to balance " the great cost of importing the reimbursement in hard money , " we shall find them all imaginary . They are not of the real value of one shilling . If there was any want of specie for circulation , it would be but a temporary convenience , and not a lasting gain , to introduce specie ; and the want must be great to justify so large a premium as 10 per cent . It is the nature of trade , like water , to bring itself to a level . It is just the same /z/ thing , whether you bring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the like quantity from going out v v - of it . As , therefore , the advantages of negotiating your money by bills , are very plain and certain , the only question will be , whether it is practicable . " His Excellency then states that he has made it certain , from the promise of merchants , that the Province may receive its reimbursements by bills of exchange , instead of hard money . 1 In accordance with the advice of the Chief Magistrate , July it is ordered by the Legislature , that the Treasurer draw bills of exchange for 60,000 , being the proportion of Massachusetts , as granted by Parliament , for military charges . As silver was found to be most profitable by the merchants for paying their dues in England , such coin was continually scarce . At the same time , gold not being of so ready an exchange there for mercantile obligations , and also not a legal tender for debts here though it was current as individuals could agree was plentiful . To prevent the inconvenience arising from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as of the community are desirous to have gold made a legal tender . 2 The expression of a desire , so naturally originated and Nov. to be expected , is made among the Representatives by the 23 ' introduction of a bill . This document not only proposes the legality of gold as well as silver , in the discharge of debts , but also the prevention of counterfeiting coin , and particularly the Province notes or securities . 3 It is thus introduced : " Whereas divers species of foreign gold coin are current in this Province , and are received into and paid out of the public treasury , but are not lawful tender , in public or private payments , by which it is apprehended many inconveniences have arisen to the prejudice of Trade and Commerce , and consequently very detrimental to the public , " such money be placed as to legality , on the same footing with silver . It is immediately singled out to serve as the pivot , on which party views and feelings , relative to the prerogative of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Province , are made " long to revolve . A similar experiment had been tried on the bills of credit for forty years . The fruits of that labor , now show themselves engrafted on another branch . The Council on its being presented to them , negatived it as an unpropitious measure . Nov . ! Perceiving that there were signs of discord between the two Houses , the Governor addresses them by a message . This contains the ensuing passages : " I am willing that my recommendations should be confined to the single business of calling in and reemitting the Treasurer 's notes . I think it indispensable , that the owners of the notes should be obliged to bring them in by a certain day , under the penalty of the Interest ceasing at that day . Without this , it can neither be ascertained what notes have been counterfeited , nor will a stop be put to the practice for the future ; for this purpose , it will be most expedient to ree'mit them in the same money they are payable in now . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all punishments , except capital , will be inadequate , I shall consent to such others as you shall think fit , provided you add a clause , that all the interest upon those reemitted Treasurer 's notes , shall cease upon the expiration of the several terms for which they are granted , that there may be a certain determination of the probable mischief of counterfeiting notes within a few years . " His Excellency 's peace offering does not appear to have produced conciliation between the Representatives and Council . The former were strenuous for the enactment of the proposition before them for gold to be legalized as apart of the currency . The latter took a point blank position on the other side . Seeing that there was no probability of their coming to terms of agreement , the Governor again interposes . His address to them follows : " After more than a fortnight spent in fruitless debates , I find myself obliged to prorogue this General Court , without any thing effectual 's being done in the important 1 Journal of the House . /q/ business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 171. desires , that when they assemble , they will come unbiased and unprejudiced by the events of the present session . In writing on this subject to a correspondent , Thomas Hutchinson uses the subsequent language : l " The last Dec. session of the Court was spent in a controversy about our money . The House passed a vote for making gold a lawful tender at the rate it passes . This would have driven away our silver and eventually depreciated the currency . I stood in the front of the opposition , and it was with difficulty the Council was kept from concurring . I am afraid the next session , as the Governor , at present , is not sensible of the ill consequences of the proposal , it will pass . If it succeed , I look upon it to be the first step of our return to Egypt . " The same writer , judging from the appearances of the Legislature , that his favorite plan , which he first formed and promoted against much untoward resistance , that silver only should be tolerated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made copartner with gold for a like purpose thus uncovers his heart to a friend in England : " I opened my letter of the llth , to tell you , that the House have passed a bill for 15. * issuing notes , payable in dollars at 6 s or in gold at the rates now set , which sinks our currency four or five per cent . It will pass the Board with little opposition . The Secretary , Erving , Bowdoin , and two or three more are with me , and a great clamour is raised against my papers . 2 Pray tell me if I am wrong , and let me know what people say on your side of the water . If the party see them condemned , I shall have no chance . Our dollars will be gone in a twelve month . Pistareens will succeed , and I sha n't wonder , if the next motion , or at least after some time , is , to bring gold to a proportion of them at 14 d each . The intrinsic value perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many plans adopted by the Legislature 2 &; to stop the iniquities of counterfeiting , the following is passed to be enacted : Individuals convicted of such a 1 Massachusetts Archives Hutch- 3 Massachusetts Archives Pecuinson 's Correspondence . niary , vol. v.

The Governor did not sign this . His reason will soon appear . March l In accordance with the fears of Mr. Hutchinson and /z/ his friends , the bill for adopting gold as a legal tender , receives the sanction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at the rate of 2J d a grain . It is accompanied with another enactment , that the Province notes , of which large amounts are in circulation , shall be renewed at the treasury . In anticipation of this , a form , suited to the law , that gold should be a legal tender as well as silver , had been prepared , of the succeeding tenor : Province of the Massachusetts Bay . The day of A. D. Borrowed and received of the sum of for the use and service of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay ; and in behalf of said Province , I do hereby promise and oblige myself and successors in the office of Treasurer to repay the said or his order the day of A. D. the aforesaid sum of in Spanish milVd dollars at six shillings each , or in the several species of coined silver and Gold enumerated in an Act made and passed in the twenty-third year of his late Majesty King George the Second , inlitled , an Act for ascertaining " the Rates , at which coined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass within the Government , and according to the Rates therein mentioned , with interest annually at six per cent .

" Province notes of this class , received the name of the new form , and occasioned the preceding ones to be called the old form . This was a partial imitation of the phrases of new and old tenor , as to former bills of credit . 1 For such scrip there was still a further call . Though April hopes were cherished , that peace by this time would have been made , yet it was interrupted , and therefore the Province must still gird on their armour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject , Governor Bernard gives his own views : " Although I would not have you despond , I must caution you against being too secure or indifferent . You must not think , that if the war does not rage at your own doors , you may therefore be unconcerned spectators of it . Your interest is at the bottom of this contest ; and wherever the battle is fought , the prize lies in this country . The negotiations for peace were interrupted by the Spaniards demanding a right of fishing on the Banks of Newfoundland ; and he has also avowed , that the concessions of the French were too advantageous for the British nation . Whereas the cession of Canada is the only one that can be said to be greatly advantageous to Great Britain . The North American fishery , therefore , and the possession of Canada , are the stakes for which the game , now begun , is to be played . " 2 As a result of resistance to the Act , for making gold a 20. tender for payment of debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bench of the Supreme Court , a strenuous movement is made in the House to exclude them from holding any place in the Legislative branches . This being the first formal trial of strength on such a point , fails by a majority of seven votes in the negative . Though thus arrested , it soon succeeded . 3 Governor June /z/ /z/ 1762 . Bernard states to the two Houses , that a reason why he " did not sign the bill for the punishment of counterfeiters , was because it did not require death for fraud upon the government notes . He says , that so far as he is acquainted , such a penalty is demanded in all other dominions of his Majesty . He gives an opinion , that unless a clause is inserted to this effect , it is better to have the matter dropped . If inserted , he advises that the penalty be printed on the bottom of each note . The House do not agree to this proposal . June *As the treasury is not in funds sufficient to liquidate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enacted , that the time specified for such payment shall be prolonged . Though measures of this sort had been resorted to from necessity , yet they always impaired the credit of the paper concerned . July 2 As having much influence , as to the concerns of our 16 - currency , the King signs a warrant for 200,000 as a grant to the Colonies for charges in the war . Of this , Massachusetts is to have a large proportion . Of the above sum , 10,000 were reserved to settle a claim of Massachusetts , which was not sufficiently clear . This reservation was ordered by his Majesty , December 14 , 1763 , to be paid , and our Province to have 5,190 12 6 of the whole amount . 1763. 3 With earnest desires for the pecuniary and every other 27 true interest of the community to be promoted , the Governor delivers a speech to both Houses under very encouraging circumstances . Let his own words " be cited : " I can now congratulate you upon the final conclusion of a peace highly honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become entirely British . Your fortunes are now in your own hands ; and on yourselves will greatly depend the future welfare of your country . By the ceasing of the war , several sources of the current wealth 4 of this Province will be shut up . It will there- 1 Journal of the House . The liberal grants made by Par- 1 Massachusetts Archives Pecu- liament for the expenses of war with niary , vol. v. the French . /z/ fore be necessary to open others to supply their deficiency . 17 63 . It will be necessary not only to avail yourselves of every possible improvement in agriculture , fishery and trade , but also to revive and promote a spirit of industry , frugality and economy . Without some such precautions , it will be difficult to preserve your present currency and support your credit with Great Britain . " The fair prospect , thus presented to the country , is soon clouded . 1 His Excel- Dec. lency is constrained to tell the sad tale , that there is a * general conspiracy of the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again girded to defend the territory from the horrors of savage invasion . In addition to this , the mercantile communities are thrown into fear and commotion , by laws of Parliament such as the Sugar Act and others , which are deemed greatly prejudicial to the trade of this Province . 2 The merchants and traders 27. petition the Legislature to strive for averting the apprehended evils of such policy on the part of the mother government . In reference to trials of this sort , the Representatives 1764. communicate their thoughts to Mr. Jasper Mauduit who , June they supposed , had not acted , as their agent , with suitable energy for the welfare of Massachusetts . From this letter we extract a few sentences : " In the last war , we exerted ourselves much beyond our natural strength , and thereby we have incurred a heavy load of debt , which all the resources in our power will hardly clear us from in many years . Can it be possible , that the duties to be imposed , and the taxes to be levied , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " In connection with their letter to Mr. Mauduit , the House order " the state of the rights of the British Colonies " to be forwarded to him . They also authorize a Committee to correspond with the other governments and inform them what instructions are ordered for their agent , requesting him to use his endeavors for repealing the Sugar Act and preventing the Stamp Act or other taxes on American Colonies . Thus , however this Province had been enabled to sustain by the /z/ 1764. reimbursements from England , the credit of its notes , v - since paper money ceased to be a legal tender much better than before still , the most of its inhabitants dread that their pecuniary and other kindred interests will suffer greatly by the attempt of Parliament to obtain a revenue from them , when they had scarcely leisure to breathe freely and fully from the struggles of a prolonged and Oct. vigorous warfare . As a further illustration of the condition of Massachusetts in its pecuniary interests and other relations , we adduce some extracts from an address of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves at the happy conclusion of the war by our great exertions in it , involved in a heavy load of debt , which will take us many years with all the resources in our power to clear ourselves of . The sums annually required in the course of the late war being much greater than could be raised on your Majesty 's subjects each year , we were constantly obliged to borrow large sums at a high interest , and to secure the payment thereof to the lenders , to anticipate and mortgage the standing revenues of the government , which consist of a tax on all polls and all real and personal estate , within the , Province , on import , certain duties on shipping and an excise on all spirituous liquors . We can not therefore conceal our grief to find by a late Statute , made and passed in the fourth year of your Majesty 's reign , entitled , an Act for granting certain duties in the British Colonies and Plantations in America , etc. , such duties laid and regulations established , as must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must finally destroy our trade , and as we humbly conceive , deprive us of the most essential rights of Britons . The duties laid by the said Act , interfere with the Import and Excise Acts of this Province , nor can we continue these , if the said duties are exacted j whence , the security the creditors of this government had from those branches must fail . The high duty on foreign sugar and molasses must soon destroy our Trade to the foreign islands . Without this , our fishery can not be supported . The restraint on lumber , which we are by said /q/ Act prohibited from sending to any other part of Europe 1764. besides Great Britain will destroy another great branch of v our commerce . And the many other regulations introduced or newly enforced by the said Act , have already produced the greatest distress on all your Majesty 's trading subjects in this Colony . And our Trade being totally ruined , which we apprehend will be the necessary and speedy effect of these new regulations , if enforced , this Province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must soon arise a general bankruptcy , and whenever this happens , the inhabitants of the kingdom of Great Britain , will , we fear , be great sharers in our calamity . But we must further humbly represent to your Majesty , that we look upon those duties as a tax , and which we humbly apprehend ought not to be laid without the Representa- tives of the people afiected by them . With respect to a general stamp duty , we beg leave to observe to your Majesty , that in the late war , being driven by want of money to every expedient , we , in this Province , once made such an Act , which was to continue two years ; but we found it so burthensome to your Majesty 's subjects , and it was generally complained of , that it was laid aside , and hath never been since revived . We beg leave to add , that these duties joined to the other aforementioned , will exhaust this Province of all its money . It will be utterly incapable of paying its public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the subjects here of paying their debts due to your Majesty 's subjects in Great Britain . " This is indeed a piteous relation . But however , our fathers may have felt more in contemplating the facts on which it was founded , than they would have experienced , if having give to these facts a full trial ; still , the relation had many fearful realities about it . It does not appear to have been the soundest policy on the part of the parent government to impose burdens on a country , yet oppressed with a debt contracted in the warfare , which was as much for the honor and welfare of the Crown as for themselves . Still less wise does it seem to have been in Parliament , so to strain the interpretation of the Prov-/z/ j764.ince Charter as to interfere with the long established ' custom of our fathers , of laying their own taxes for the support of their own internal government . 1765. l Thus situated , large amounts of the treasury scrip are g rc in circulation and soon become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to levy a tax , " insupportable to the inhabitants under their distressed circumstances . " Therefore , the Treasurer is instructed to renew the notes out , for all who are disposed thus to accommodate , and to hire of others who may be inclined to lend , at five per cent , interest . My Desirous and vigilant to free the Province from its embarrassments and promote a safe medium of exchange , his Excellency calls the attention of the Assembly to what he judged would have such a tendency . He observes to them " Soon after my arrival , I formed in my mind an idea of three improvements which this country was capable of making profitable to itself and convenient to Great Britain ; I mean potash , hemp , and the carrying of lumber to the British markets . " While thus recommending what approves itself to our perception , he discourages other enterprise contrary to the popular views of our age . On this point , his words are " You will have no occasion vainly to attempt to transfer manufactories from their settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undertaking at all times diffi ' cult , but , under the disadvantage of high priced labor , impracticable . " June With reference to the movement of the House for a 8 Congress of the Colonies , to meet in New York , and confer on their difficulties in consequence of Parliamentary laws , and to other demonstrations of resistance to what they considered oppression , the Governor is constrained to Sept. say , 2 " This Province seems to be on the brink of a precipice . " In the same address , after dwelling on the evils which must result from a refusal to use the stamp papers , which were then near Boston harbor , and made necessary in all public transactions , he asks , " Can this Province bear a cessation of law and justice , and of trade and navigation , at a time when the business of the year is 1 Journal of the House . * Journal of the House . /q/ to be wound up , and the severe season is hastily ap- 1765. proaching ? " The appeal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the Representatives from their course . J In their reply to his speech , they remark , " Your Oct . Excellency tells us that the right of the Parliament to 24 * make laws for the American Colonies remains indisputable in Westminster . Without contending this point , we beg leave just to observe , that the Charter of this Province invests the General Assembly with the power of making laws for its internal government and taxation ; and that this Charter has never yet been forfeited . There are certain original inherent rights belonging to the people , which the Parliament itself can not divest them of , consistent with their own Constitution . Among these is the right of representation in the same body which exercises the power of taxation . " These passages are cited from an abundance of discussions , very ably and interestingly sustained between Governor Bernard and the Representatives , not for a political purpose , but to give a specimen of the different views then entertained and advanced as to measures , which had a sensible and powerful effect on the currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . 2 Among several objections which the House make to 176$. the late proceedings of the Governor and Council , as Jan - savoring too much of arbitrary power , is " taking upon themselves to regulate and stop the interest of the public securities . " The popular branch of Government would have been glad for the interest on the large amount of the Province paper to have ceased in a proper way ; but were dissatisfied that a matter , which long custom had assigned to them more than to the other branches , should be taken from their hands . 3 While a thick cloud so rested on the monied concerns May of the Province , tidings come which tend greatly to its 21 * dispersion . They are , that the Stajnp Act has been re- /z/ 17 66. pealed . Demonstrations of joy were made , which , in some of their appendages , led more to a spirit of insubordination than to regularity . The effigies of Pitt and Lord North were paraded through the streets . The former was greatly honored , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly on this occasion . 2 The House 3 - reciprocate his benevolence , and call the repeal " a most interesting and happy event , which has diffused a general joy among all his Majesty 's loyal and faithful subjects , throughout this extensive continent . " 28. 3 As an index of the Government notes which circulated in community , and were to be paid in one year , we have the following . This enacted that the Treasury be supplied with the sum of one hundred and fifty-seven thousand pounds , for the redemption of securities , that become due in 1767. 1767. 4 After various attempts to close the concerns of the Feb . Land Bank , it still makes its appearance , like a troubled spectre , in the hall of legislation . The commissioners give a long account of the transactions relative to this 5. institution . 5 The amount due from it , in notes and interest , since September 9 , 1740 , was 1,740 7 3 .

But a question was made by Mr. Robert Auchmuty , an attorney for the directors , as well as a descendant from one of them , whether they were not already released from all such responsibility by a previous settlement with the Assembly 's commissioners . Aug. 6 Notwithstanding all that had been said and experi25 - enced , with regard to bills of credit , there is still a party among the people of the Province and their Representatives , for its restoration as a legal tender for debts .

Having sent his Lordship *-a concise history of such currency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The occasion of drawing up this representation was this . It appeared in the London newspapers , that Dennys De Berdt , Esq. , agent for Massachusetts Bay , joined other agents of the Colonies in their solicitation for a permission to create paper money . If Mr. De Berdt had really been agent for Massachusetts Bay , as he really never was more than a charge d'affairs of the House of Representatives , he could not have done any thing more contrary to the sense of this Province , than appearing as an advocate for paper money . " His Excellency also adds , that the Council , at the last session of the Assembly , desired the Representatives to unite with them in a statement , that this Province did not wish to join in such a solicitation to Parliament for paper money ; but the House declined to act with the Council in this affair . The fact here presented , shows that there was a more extensive wish , among the people at large , for the renewal of a legalized paper currency , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berdt , in connection with his being employed by the Representatives as their agent , justifies the conclusion , that there was far less satisfaction with the hard money system , even with the circulation of a half million of Government scrip , than was anticipated and maintained by the exclusively coin party . 1 Dennys De Berdt , agent for the House , writes from Oct . London to our Assembly : " I was well apprised how hap- 1 . pily you were relieved from the late difficulties of a paper currency , and the contentment the sensible part of your Province experience in having a solid medium . " Respecting a proposal for the introduction of bills here again , he adds , " Whenever the matter is under consideration , I shall act agreeably to the precautions in your letter .

Such a law , though not producing so much alarm as the Stamp Act , was followed with riots , and insults to its executors . According to the 3 motion of Boston , subscription papers are soon circulated through the towns , for the promotion of industry , economy , and manufactures , and " thereby prevent the unnecessary importation of European commodities , which threaten the country with poverty and ruin . " 1768. 4 With reference to the same absorbing subject , the Feb . House pass the ensuing resolves . Only one member , Timothy Ruggles , who openly manifested his adherence to Royalists , voted against them . " Whereas the happiness and well-being of civil communities depend upon industry , economy , and good morals j and this House , taking into serious consideration the great decay of the trade of the Province , the scarcity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , which still remains on the people , and the great difficulties , to which they are by these means reduced : Resolved , that this House will use their utmost endeavours , and enforce their endeavours by example , in suppressing extravagance , idleness and vice , and promoting industry , economy , and good morals in their respective towns . And in order to prevent the unnecessary exportation of money , of which this Province has of late been so much drained , it is further resolved , that this House will by all prudent means , endeavour to discountenance the use of foreign superfluities , and to encourage the manufactures of this Province . " 5 The inquiry , whether the surviving directors of the 1 Annals of Salem . 4 Journal of the House . * This Act signed by the King 6 Massachusetts Archives PecuJune 29 , 1767. niary , vol. v. /z/ Land Bank , and heirs of others , deceased , had not been 1768. released from all further demands , still remains unsettled . The last amount of claim made upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was about 1,500 . The final action of the General Court on this subject , does not appear to have been definitely recorded among their proceedings . The probability , however , is that the directors or their heirs discharged this balance . Still the case of Benjamin Jacobs , one of the partners of the Bank , who had been sued and cast for a considerable amount of its notes , interests the Legislature , who require the late commissioners for winding up the afiairs of this institution , to consider his petition for relief . Here we take our leave of this monied association , as one of the most noted that ever existed in our country ; not on account of its immense capital , for this was comparatively small ; but of its being made the occasion of bitter strife in politics , of costly and demoralizing litigation , of persecution extended to almost every ramification of community , and of protracted and intense anxiety , as well as of great loss to its principal proprietors . 1 The troubles between the Crown and the Colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petition the House of Commons to aid in the removal of grievances here endured . This document contains the ensuing passages , relative to our currency . " This Province is still in debt on account of the charge incurred by the late war . The yearly taxes upon the people for lessening the debt , though not so great as during the war , are nevertheless with more difficulty paid , by reason of the great scarcity of money . The scarcity of money in the Colonies is owing to the balance of their trade with Great Britain being against them ; which balance drains them of their money , to the great embarrassment of their trade , the only source of it . This embarrassment is much increased by the regulations of trade , and by the Tax Acts , which draw immediately from trade the money necessary to support it ; on the support whereof the payment of the /z/ 1768. balance aforesaid depends . The exports of the Colonies , all their gold and silver , and their whole powers of remittance , fall short of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indeed , this is a gloomy portraiture of the monied concerns of the Commonwealth . The determination of our fathers to stand in their lot and contend for their Charter privileges , and the equally strong purpose of Parliament to continue their policy of Colonial taxation , gave but faint signs , that such a representation would greet the eye of watchful patriotism with brighter and more cheerful hues . The alternative of these relations between our country and England , was , that either one or the other must retreat from their position , or else both be brought to the conflict of arms . 1772. * While there is a strong inclination on the part of many J e to take the paper money of New Hampshire , Rhode Island and Connecticut , which was as strongly forbidden by renewed laws , the bills of Nova Scotia , New York , and New Jersey , had circulated considerably in Massachusetts . To prevent this , so far as the partial fences of legislation could , a motion is made by the Council for an Act , but being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July there rejected . 2 Again proposed , it succeeds , and receives the sanction of Governor Hutchinson . Thus passed , it furnishes us with the succeeding extract : " Whereas the bills of the Governments of New York , New Jersey , and Nova Scotia , have long since obtained a currency in some parts of this Government , and whereas the Government of New York , have , the last year , emitted the sum of 120,000 , which are in no way a tender , saving in the Treasury of said Province , and already begin to depreciate among themselves ; and as many of the bills of the said last emission , as well as the bills of former emissions of the aforesaid Governments , are counterfeited , by which many persons are already sufferers , and more liable to be so , and as all paper bills are liable to depreciate , " none are to receive or pay such currency after the first day of next November , on penalty . /z/ 1 Though the plot thickens , as to reconciliation between 1773. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ j creasingly insist on a stricter adherence to their Charter 6. privileges , even as liberally construed by themselves , and the latter more determined to oppose such demands , as presumptuous in their view , yet the monied interests of the province are in a better condition than they had been . This is occasioned by the prosperity of merchandize , fishery and agriculture . 2 As an indication that the enactments against usury are much evaded , we have the subsequent introduction to a corresponding Bill before the Assembly . " Whereas the Acts already in being against excessive usury , have been found in a great measure ineffectual , to prevent avaricious and unprincipled people from taking more than six per cent , per annum , for the loan of money , whereby many honest and useful members of community , who have been reduced to the necessity of borrowing money on interest , have been oppressed , in contempt of law . " 3 Notwithstanding the differences between Parliament 1774. and our country had reached so high a pitch , as threatened ' a speedy breakage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so improved , that the currency of the Province stood on a good foundation , and , if the threatening aspect of political controversy had immediately changed , it would have given the promise of long prosperity . The remarks of Governor Hutchinson on this topic , are as follow . " There never has been a time since the first settlement of the country , when the Treasury has been in so good a state as it now is . I may congratulate the Province upon its being entirely free from debt , the tax of the last year , with the stock in the Treasury being equal to all the securities due from the Government , and to the charges of the current year . " However his Excellency gave a true description of pecuniary affairs , yet the friends of liberty regarded it only as a gilded pill , which they would not receive as a catholi- /z/ 1774. con fr their complaints , while they felt that their Charter " rights had been increasingly and alarmingly restricted . From one step of debate and action to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of repelling force by force . To measure swords with the power of Britain , they have but little comparative preparation . In order to cultivate a spirit of friendship with other Colonies , as well as to comply with the continued and prevailing wish of many for paper currency , the Committee of Safety , appointed by the Provincial Congress 1775. pass the succeeding Resolve . la Whereas , many of our y brethren of the Colonies of Connecticut and Rhode Island are now with us , to assist us in this day of public and general distress , in which we are all deeply concerned ; and whereas , our brethren of said Colonies have brought with them some of the paper currencies of their respective Colonies which have not , of late , had a currency with us , and for want of which , our common interests may greatly suffer . Resolved , that said paper currencies shall , from and after the date hereof , be paid and received within this Colony , in all payments , to all intents and purposes , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and received within the respective Colonies by which the same have been issued . " Thus proposing a measure , which had been frequently prohibited , under severe restrictions and penalties , the Committee refer final action upon it to the Provincial Congress . 3. 2 To sustain the attitude of defence which they had assumed , and which was rendered more necessary from the blood recently spilt at Lexington , the Provincial Congress empower the Treasurer to borrow one hundred thousand pounds , lawful money , secured by notes of the Province , at six per cent. , and made payable June 1 , 1777 . They also desire the other Colonies to give currency to such securities . The phraseology of paper , issued under such new and interesting relations , would call for a repetition at this 1 Journal of the Committee of 2 Provincial Congress Records .

May i Aware that the political foundations of the Commonwealth were broken up and that an anxious uncertainty rested on the result , and that , as a consequence , there must be much backwardness in loaning money to the Revolutionary authorities , the Provincial Congress offer an address to the people . Their language follows : " This Congress have opened a subscription for 100,000 . It is of the utmost importance that the money be immediately obtained , that the public credit may not suffer . We me earnestly recommend to such of you as have cash in yoi hands , which you can spare from the necessary supplies of your families , that you would lend the same to the Colony , by which you will put it in our power to carry into effect the measures undertaken for the salvation of the country . There are no ways of improving money in trade . There is the greatest probability , that the other colonies will give a ready currency to the notes , which will render them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footing than any notes heretofore issued in this Colony . If you should furnish the money that is now needed , you will perform a meritorious service for your country , and prove yourselves sincerely attached to its interests ; but , if an undue caution should prevent your doing this essential service to the colony , the total loss , both of your liberties and that very property , which you , by retaining it , affect to serve , may be the unhappy consequence . " This is a gloomy description of the pecuniary condition of the commonwealth . They who had cash could invest it to no advantage in business . If they loaned it to government , they could never recover it , if the Revolution proved unsuccessful . The hazard of such a loan required the exercise of no ordinary patriotism to comply with the impressive appeal of Congress . This compliance , however , was made at a most critical juncture , and thus aid ( /z/ on their burdensome enterprise , and subsequently bene- 1775. fited the country a thousand fold . vvx As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oo interested in the paper currency of the " Continental " Congress , we shall have frequent occasion to make it the subject of notice . Indeed , such are and will be the political relations of our Commonwealth to the General Administration , that the pecuniary regulations of the latter must have a connection with the former . l Driven by stern necessity to the last resort of means for sustaining the conflict with Britain , the Continental Congress order an emission of notes to the amount of two millions of dollars . This was the first issue of bills ever made by the vote of delegates from the various American Colonies . Such and other abundant emissions from the national exchequer , were soon found too large for the sustenance of their own credit as well as that of the State 's paper . The form of the national bills was as follows : /z/ No . Dollars . This bill entitles the bearer to receive Spanish milled dollars , or the value thereof , in Gold or silver , according to the Resolutions of the Congress held at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1775. 2 The question of making the bills of other Colonies a 28. tender in all payments , as previously suggested by the Committee of Safety , comes before the Provincial Congress . This Body resolve , that such paper of Rhode Island shall thus pass at 6/9 for an ounce of silver , and also of the rest of the Colonies , except Nova Scotia and Canada , at 6/8 an ounce . They order , that whoever refuses to take these notes without some discount , " shall be deemed an enemy to his country . " /z/ 1775. tender in all pecuniary transactions , as equivalent to specie - at the usual rates , " under 1 penalty of treble damages to both the payer and receiver . " The form of such obligations is as follows : Colony of the #@# T , - . - K AT t nn Massachusetts Bay $ Jv * The possessor of this Bill , shall be paid by the Treasurer of this Colony ' , two shillings and six pence , lawful money , by the 18th day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all payments at the Treasury at all limes . By order of Congress , /z/ B. E. #@# Committee . /z/ July i The Provincial Congress order a part of the preceding " amount to be struck off . 29. 2 Of another emission of Continental bills , amounting to $3,000,000 , the proportion of them is assigned to each Colony . Virginia and Massachusetts are to receive a greater sum than the rest . The former has $496,278 , and the latter , $434,244 . It is intended , when the matter can be settled , to have population the basis of such a pecuniary appropriation . It is resolved , " that each Colony provide ways and means to sink its proportion of the bills ordered to be emitted by this Congress in such manner as may be most effectual and best adapted to the condition , circumstances , and equal mode of levying taxes in such Colony , " and that each Colony pay its quota in four equal annual instalments , as follow November 30 , 1779 , 1780 , 1781 , /z/ The first General Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon find themselves called to legislate Aug. for the supply of the treasury . 3 After several weeks of /z/ each bill the figure of an American with a sword in his 1775 right hand , with the following inscription suspended there- from , viz. ' Ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem , ' and from his left hand , Magna Charta , and round the figure these words , ' Issued in defence of American liberty . ' " The circumstances under which this currency is sent forth , are clothed with serious greatness . They embrace the oppressions , necessities , purposes , perils , hopes and fears of a people , breaking from long established relations and setting themselves in array against a mighty empire . The most of the interesting device required to be stamped on the notes of this emission , composed the Seal of our State , as recently adopted by the General Court . It showed to the eye , that the Royal armorials , which were long contained on our public documents and which denoted subjection to the British Crown , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and the sentiment of the patriot , Sidney , had been chosen in their stead . On each bill , the names of three persons , designated to sign it , were to be written , one with red , another with black , and a third with blue ink . This kind of paper received the appellation of " sword in hand money , " because of the armed image on its back . As the ramifications of war increased and extended , so were our public guardians compelled to try the perilous experiment of swelling the amount of their treasury securities . uch currency , as yet , had not faltered . In an Oct. intercepted 2 letter of Doctor Church is the succeeding 27 * passage : " The bills of all the Colonies circulate freely , and are readily exchanged for cash . " 3 Respecting an emission of three millions , ordered the Dec. 29th ult. , Congress resolve " that the thirteen United 26 ' Colonies be pledged for the redemption of the bills of credit , so directed to be emitted .

Assured that there is encumber the progress of the Revolution , the General Court , in compliance with a resolve of Congress , empower a Committee to detect its authors and have them punished as enemies to the country . March 2 Anxious to extend the passing of their bills , and thus to excite a sympathy in favor of their enterprise , the national government devise various methods for such an object . As they are about despatching Commissioners to Canada for the purpose of bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown , they instruct them , among other particulars , " to use every wise measure to introduce and give credit and circulation to the Continental money in Canada . " June 3 As a sign of the scarcity of specie as well as of a distrust in the safety of paper money , strenuous efforts had been made to raise 30,000 of hard money in Massachusetts on exchange for bills , to promote the expedition of our forces in Canada , but with a small and disheartening degree of success . Knowing that to fail in this point , would have a disastrous effect on other operations of the country , our Legislature make further exertion , and entreat all who are able to aid in accomplishing such an exchange , to do it , and thus " assist their distressed country in this critical day . " Aug . An emission of bills , now ordered by Congress , with 13 * what had been already issued , amounts to $19,000,000 . The proportion of this aggregate sum , assigned to Massachusetts , is about $2,750,210 . Dec. 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these /z/ notes , is far from being a talisman , which can demand and 1776. punctually receive whatsoever funds and supplies are needed , the credit of our own Commonwealth , in the same respect , has not much greater influence . Our State authorities are obliged to intercede with the Committee of Correspondence in every town , to open subscription lists for a loan of 100,000 , required several months previously , on the basis of treasury notes , at lawful interest . These securities , though of the safest kind , tend to the depreciation of other paper currency . 1 Desirous to prevent the evils which threatened the Dec. currency of the Union , and in accordance with a letter from Governor Trumbull of Connecticut , our Assembly appoint delegates to meet others on so great a concern . Another object , having a near relation to the same topic , for the designation of these individuals , is to suppress monopolies and extravagant prices in the necessaries of life . These prices were not only enlarged themselves by the abundance of government notes , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less sufficient to command the supplies of maintenance and warfare . The Convention , so proposed , soon assemble at Providence , Rhode Island . 2 Painfully assured , that popular reliance on the safety 1777. of the national bills was seriously shaken and enervated , ' Congress declare , that so deprecated an effect had been urged on by enemies to American liberty , and that every State is obligated to put forth all its energies to recover the credit of such money from its downward progress . To strengthen and accomplish their proposal , they enact that whoever pays or receives this currency at a less rate than originally prescribed , besides being accounted a foe to the liberties of his country , shall forfeit the sum so exchanged . They also advise the several States to make this paper a legal tender for debts , as previously required , and to provide that a refusal of it in such a mode , shall be the extinguishment of all claim . They further suggest to the States , that they make preparation to discharge /z/ 1777. their respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the precise periods specified . Jan. l In accordance with previous conference and agreement * with other New England States , our Commonwealth pass an Act to prevent monopoly and oppression . As this document , which was to commence from the 28th of the month , in which it was made , has a direct and important bearing on the currency , and shows what its value was generally estimated at , we make the succeeding extracts : " The price of Farming Labour in the summer season shall not exceed 3 s by the day and found as usual , and so in usual proportion at other seasons of the year , and the labour of Mechanics and Tradesmen and other labour beside what is herein hereafter especially enumerated in proportion thereunto , according to the usages and customs which have heretofore been adopted and practiced in this State when compared with farming labour .

" 1 Having found that it was difficult for the loan officers of this and other States , to hire money for the Union at four per cent. , as at first expected and expressed in the certificates or notes , Congress vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be borrowed on their account . Such obligations formed no small share of the circulating medium . 2 In order to obstruct the facilities for counterfeiting the May treasury notes of our Commonwealth , the House pass a resolve , that particular exertion be made by some paper maker to manufacture sheets for such money , and " that the word State , or some other word , be stampt or wrought in the body of the paper of each note , and that said paper maker shall oblige himself by oath never to make any /z/ without special leave of this Court . " The crime * here referred to , was considered peculiarly aggravated by our fathers , because one efficient means of encumbering their exertions for freedom . Hence , they give authority to officers of justice to enter and search any house , suspected of containing the implements of such iniquity . Public sentiment being not yet sufficiently purified from the error of supposing , that the Scriptural allowance for casting lots in certain cases , comprised lottery chances , Congress resorted to the latter means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities . l Hence , among the ' varieties of paper currency , in that dark period , we have the subsequent form , dated as in the opposite margin : /z/ DOLLARS . The United States of America acknowledge themselves to be indebted to in dollars , being for prize of that value drawn in Jj the United States Lottery , which they promise to pay to the said or bearer , on w j the day of with interest annually at the rate of four per cent. , agreeable to a resolution of the United States , passed the eighteenth of November , 1776 . June 2 A delegation is appointed by the Legislature to meet others from the rest of New England and New York , at Springfield , on the 10th of July . The objects of this Convention were of national concern . Among them was to devise the best method of arresting the depreciation and counterfeiting of the paper money , and of having it recalled by taxes or otherwise . j u ly 3 It is ascertained that the British were strongly 3 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for retaining their dominion over this country , large amount of counterfeit bills , in imitation of such were emitted by Congress , had been brought from English ships into the Delaware and partly circulated . /z/ 1 To throw up one barrier against the fearful fall of our 1777 own bills as well as those of other States , it is ordered , Q that , in the place of increasing them in this Common- 9. wealth to meet the charges of war , taxes shall be levied and assessed on the people , and be punctually collected . 2 Reduced to the conviction , that if such paper should 13. be increased as it had been , or even if the most of it should be allowed to pass , the energies of the country would be paralysed , our Legislature prohibit its currency in all sums over six shillings . One necessity which urged on this measure , was that the Continental notes , which in January had depreciated five per cent. , had by this date sunk so as to pass three for one of specie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarming diminution , which called for every possible remedy . As our Commonwealth could not command the means for speedy liquidation of the bills paid out of their own treasury , it is ordered that they be exchanged for obligations of not less than 10 , with legal interest , payable annually . This was only moving the burden of public responsibility further ahead , in the hope of a better period for its discharge . In connection with these regulations , no paper money of other States was to be taken after December first , on a certain penalty . From the first movement of our State authorities to obtain pecuniary supplies for the Revolutionary struggle , to this gathering in of their notes , they had borrowed 956,400 on treasury securities , and issued 500,042 in bills of credit . Besides this amount paid out in two years , there was a large sum of Continental paper , received for military stores and service , circulating among our population . However the object of nullifying the credit of Massachusetts bills was to invigorate and restore that of the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect was far less than was generally hoped and anticipated . The alteration resembled that of 1751 , so far as drawing in the paper currency of the Commonwealth , but not with so available means and so fair a prospect of preserving the public credit . Then the price of our Provincial bravery /z/ 1777. and sacrifices in the capture and retention of Cape Breton , as paid in coin from the Royal exchequer , was a medium far better to redeem sinking notes , than merely to return one species of them for another . But when men can not do as they would in reference to many social concerns they must do as they can . It was but poor philosophy which induced Aristotle to throw himself into a river and there drown , because he could not bear the disappointment of his endeavors to explain the fluctuation of the tides . Our civil authorities , though unable to solve the numerous and perplexing questions which arose in their councils , as to the management of their pecuniary affairs , did not suffer them to prove the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had no regal coffers , whence they could draw the amount of their public disbursements , yet they could look for relief from the natural resources of the country . True , their expectations of help depended upon the success of their arms . True if conquered the gloom of desolated credit , the loss of all right to liquidate their pledges to the lenders of the Commonwealth , the forfeiture of every obligation for money advanced to sustain the Revolution , must inevitably follow . Still , they took courage and did the best their circumstances allowed . Nov. l Massachusetts , in common with other members of the Union , agree on the articles of Confederation , wherein power is delegated to Congress to borrow money , issue bills on the responsibility of the States and regulate the alloy and value of coin . By another clause of the same compact , all notes previously emitted and obligations given by the general administration , are to be accounted a charge against the whole country , for the liquidation of which , the national promise is to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular to the several members of the Union , Congress speak of the Confederation , as the source , whence they expected much benefit . They ardently regarded it , as the restorer of their depreciated paper and the supporter of public confidence . 1 Journal of Congress . * Journal of Congress . /q/ 1 An address is made by the same authorities to their 1777. constituents . While proposing to raise five millions of dollars for the next year by way of tax , of which Massa- 22. chusetts was assessed $820,000 , a larger rate than that of any other part of the Republic , it advances the succeeding ideas in relation to paper currency . To meet the demands for sustaining our land and naval forces , large amounts of it had been issued from the National as well as from the State Treasuries . In this manner it was multiplied beyond the limits of sound policy . It is an assumed truth , that wherever the sum of any currency " exceeds what is useful , as a medium of commerce , its comparative value must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with efforts of open and secret enemies , the overreaching disposition of many in community , and the scarcity of foreign goods , there has been a great reduction in the value of such paper . Convinced that the necessities of the country could not be supplied by this medium of exchange , and the period for its redemption must come , Congress were constrained , to adopt the unpopular measure of laying heavy taxes on the inhabitants . It is also recommended , that all the States call in their bills over one dollar , and depend on annual taxation to pay their individual expenses . It is further advised that they send delegates to specified places for agreeing on prices of labor and merchandize , and for suppressing monopolies and extortion . Discoursing in such language , which came from hearts warm with patriotism , and reached ears , not dull to comprehend its sad realities , the address was sped , as on eagles ' wings , through the land . It is readily perceived , that , with regard to the counsel in this address of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessments of property for the payment of its charges , and not on factitious currency , and to gather in all such money exceeding a dollar , Massachusetts had been beforehand , and the records of her legislation had already borne testimony to the wisdom and promptness of /z/ 1 77 7 1 her action . It is no flattery to say , that this Common v - wealth freed herself from the charge , once brought against the metropolis of Italy , " Rome deliberates and Saguntum perishes . " Dec. 1 As having a common concern and participation in the 3 * national bills , this State is interested in the attempts of foes to the Union , for destroying all confidence in such currency . An endeavor of this sort consisted in the formation of associations , who pass notes under the pretended authority of the King of Great Britain . Congress resolve , that whoever has been deceived by such paper so as to take it for genuine , may exchange it for that of theirs . This was accommodation , which strict justice did not require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 The members of Congress from Massachusetts are /z/ j " c notified , that the articles of Confederation have been accepted here . This event is noticed , because it was still viewed as an omen for much improvement in our pecuniary perplexities . But the same disappointment , which betided it , in reference to the General Government , as before intimated , was experienced by our own Legislature as well as people . M a y 3 Among the various influences , which increased suspi &; cion of the Continental paper , was the frequent allegation of friends to the Crown , that it was worth nothing , and that the debt , resulting from the diminution of its value and from charges of the war , could never be paid by the inhabitants . Such predictions found so many believers , it was matter of solicitude with our leaders in the struggle for independence . Oct. 4 As the period was about to close for the redemption of 13. our State bills of six shillings and under , dated before October 18 , 1776 , an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exchanged for a new set . Dec. 5 Among the rumors , on which eager and anxious curi- ' osity often dwells in times of perilous enterprise , adverse to the national currency , is the one , that the General /z/ Administration neither meant to redeem it , nor to grant 177 any allowance for it as paid to the soldiery . So very " serious an aspect did this story assume , that such authorities felt themselves constrained to pass a resolve , " that the said report is false and derogatory to the honor of Congress . " 1 In order to lessen the impression of such tales , but 1779. especially to do as they purposed , our National Government *-order , that the States pay their quotas of fifteen millions of dollars for the year 1779 , and , also , six millions , from the same date , annually for eighteen years , as a fund to sink their notes up to 31st of December , 1778 . They further resolve , that , as their bills , issued May 20 , 1777 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and particularly of late in New York , and spread through the country , enhancing the price of provisions and injuring our currency , such paper shall immediately cease to be passed . 2 Deeply anxious to lessen the apprehensions of the 13. public mind , concerning the fall of the United States ' notes , Congress mention their alliance with France as a ground for reasonable belief , that better days and brighter scenes were at hand . But in this , also , however they were sincere in their proffers of encouragement , they were to be much disappointed . 3 In compliance with the injunction of these authorities , 37. our Legislature prohibit the bills of May 20 , 1777 , and of April 11 , 1778 , from being taken by their collectors , except for Continental taxes . 4 As one of the frequent occasions for our Commonwealth Feb. to issue Treasury notes , 200,000 worth of them are 20 - ordered to be given out for the purpose of importing provisions . In connection with this , a circular letter , addressed to Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A passage from it shows the afflicted condition of our people , and how unfavorable their wants must have been to their monied concerns . It runs thus : " This State being almost wholly destitute of flour and /z/ 1 779 m grain , the General Assembly are impelled by urgent v necessity to renew their application to your State for a supply of these essential articles , without which the inhabitants in general , and the sea ports in particular , must be reduced to a situation more easily to be conceived than expressed . " That an appeal of this kind , specially adapted to awaken sympathy and meet the ready hand of benevolence , might be more impressive and effectual , Congress are requested to give it their particular recommendation . April l The order of the General Government for the suppres20-sion of the notes emitted in 1777 and 1778 , as previously particularized , has greatly embarrassed Massachusetts , because a large proportion of them had fallen upon their hands . For relief in the premises , Congress is petitioned to deposit other paper at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such prohibited currency . Oar delegates there are also instructed to represent , that so low are the public finances here , and so great the advances in behalf of the Union , a most urgent pressure exists for this State to have from the National Exchequer $500,000 . Our Legislature say to the delegates , respecting this matter " The bearer is empowered to receive any sum you may obtain , no time may be lost in returning him , as we hourly suffer for want of money . " June 2 A document of great importance to every member of ** the Confederation was ordered by Congress the 26th ult . It is now required by our Assembly to be printed and read by all the ministers of their jurisdiction , from the pulpit , on the first Sabbath after it reaches them . The subsequent passages from it are here adduced : " The present situation of public affairs demands your most serious attention , and , particularly , the great and increasing depreciation of your currency requires the immediate , strenuous and united efforts of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mischiefs , that have already flowed from that source . For defraying the expenses of this uncommon war , your representatives to 1 Resolves of the General Assembly . 2 Resolves of the General Assembly .

They were 1779. very sensible of the inconveniences with which too frequent emissions would be attended , and endeavored to avoid them . For this purpose , they established loan offices so early as in October , 1776 , and have from that time to this , repeatedly and earnestly solicited you to lend them money on the faith of the United States . The sums received on loan have nevertheless proved inadequate to the public exigencies . Our enemies prosecuting the war by sea and land with implacable fury and with some success , taxation at home and borrowing abroad , in the midst of difficulties and dangers , were alike impracticable .

Though it is manifest , that moderate taxation , in times of peace , will recover the credit of your currency , yet the encouragement which your enemies derive from its depreciation and the present exigencies demand great and speedy exertions . " Such were the momentous relations involved with the facts of this circular , and such the inexpressible interest , which millions took in its development of the Republic 's necessities , perils and prospects , that no messenger , like a Mercurius , was wanted to herald it through the country .

Gendered in a family quarrel , may they always be substituted by words of national benevolence and Christian intercourse. /z/ 1779 . The situation of our general government , as depicted " by their address , was very far from being enviable . As they witnessed the credit of their paper on a rapid decline , and learned that loans and taxes could not be procured so as to supply its place , they were forced still to try the deprecated experiment of renewed emissions of a similar currency . While pouring this out like water , they perceived with anguish , that its nominal abundance diminished its real value , and left the vacuum of want unsupplied , whose sound continually came to their ears like a warning curfew , and whose cry increasingly was , Give give . Sept. 1 With such experience , Congress resolve , that their * issues of such money shall , at no period , and under no circumstances , be to a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum within $40,051,120 . But time was to prove , that , borne onward by an irresistible throng of necessities , they were to break over the barriers of their own erection , and to go far beyond them . Thus have concurrent events often shown , that the best devised purposes of human wisdom are set at naught , and the greatest efforts of human might become powerless . 2 2 A law , on one of the most absorbing topics of political economy , is passed by our Legislature . Its caption reads thus : " Whereas this State are using their utmost endeavours to appreciate the currency of the United States , and there is great danger , that their laudable exertions will be entirely defeated , if measures are not speedily taken to prevent the inhabitants of this and the other United States from conveying articles out of this State , " it is therefore enacted , that there shall be no exportation of them , either by land or water . Such articles were wine , ardent spirits , coffee , molasses , sugar , cocoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool cards , flax , salt , linen , cotton , cotton and linen , cotton and woolen goods , provisions , shoes , skins and leather . To this interdicted list , steel , hats , and India teas were added the ensuing month . Such a step was taken , that the established rule for the /z/ prices of various goods might not be evaded , by the trans- 1779 portation and vending of them in other States , at a greater " profit , and thus our own jurisdiction be left in distress . Congress , still subject to severe rebuke from every quarter , because of the abundance and depreciation of their bills , prepared another appeal of September 13th , to the people . 1 This document is required by our Assembly to be Oct. read , as usual , from the pulpit . It represents , that all the loans and taxes , from the whole nation , since the beginning of the Revolution , did not amount to one sixth of the public debt . Hence , it remarks , may the cause be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much embarrassed . It computes , as the chief item of such debt , the bills of credit still in circulation , which are estimated at $159,948,880 . It then furnishes us with the succeeding extracts . The depreciation of this money " is always either natural or artificial . The latter is our case . The artificial depreciation is a more serious subject . A distrust , however occasioned , entertained by the mass of the people , either in the ability or inclination of the United States to redeem their bills , is the cause of it . The ability of the United States must depend on two things ; first , the success of the present revolution , and , secondly , on the sufficiency of the natural wealth , value , and resources of the country . That the time when honest men might , without being chargeable with timidity , have doubted the success of the present revolution , we admit ; but that period is past . " With regard to a prevalent fear , lest , if our independence should be achieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal has the subsequent language . " The redemption of these bills , and the settlement of the accounts of the several States for expenditures or services for the common benefit , are among the objects of this Confederation , and consequently it can not , so far as it may respect such objects , be dissolved , consistent with the laws of God or man . " Then come the ensuing items . " In order to prevent the 1 Resolves of the General Assembly . j 34 HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF 1779. further natural depreciation of our bills , we have resolved s to stop the press , and to call upon you for supplies by loans and taxes . Leave us not , therefore , without supplies , nor let in that flood of evils , which would follow from such neglect . Let it never be said , that America had no sooner become independent , than she became insolvent , or that her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith , in the very hour when all the nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendor of her rising . " Such solicitude to raise the fallen value of the paper currency , by eloquent and rational arguments , was not only cherished by our supreme authorities , but also by the leading patriots of our own and other States . It was a common sentiment , taught by ministers at the altar , and cherished by themselves , as well as by most of their congregations . While , however , this solicitude was painful to the heart , was read upon the countenance and described in words , the people believed , that compliance with its full dictates was more than commensurate with their means of self-support , and of annually liquidating the heavy charges of war , as well as of the national debt already contracted . Hence , it failed in actuating them to multiply their burdens , already oppressive . The population being so situated , their delegates in the general administration were soon forced upon the hard and only choice of resorting to another mode of paper medium , whose final scene exhibited wider and greater calamity than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet in Philadelphia , the first 22 . Wednesday of January , composed of members from all the States , to consider the pecuniary and other interests of the Confederation , instructions are given to Elbridge Gerry and Samuel Osgood , as Commissioners of Massachusetts , to that body . One object of such a meeting , as proposed by Congress the preceding month , was the topic of limiting the prices of produce and merchandize , in order to improve the currency . As our Commonwealth had /z/ already despaired as to the continued utility of a similar 1779. plan in New England and New York , which was not yet nullified , and believing that another effort of the kind would be of little use , the said gentlemen are accordingly empowered . 1 To supply their quotas for the Continental army , and j. act on equitable principles , the General Court had agreed , 13 that all , who complied with the terms of such enlistment , should have the depreciation of paper money , which they might take for their service , made up to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound , com at 4 s a bushel , wool at 2 s a pound , and sole leather at 1/3 a pound , as designated in the monopoly bill . With regard to this subject , which had become one of much magnitude and anxiety in the minds of our rulers , they request Congress to assure them , that Massachusetts shall not be a loser for thus doing what is right , and essential to invigorate their military energies for the national good . They also forward to the same authorities , a table of the depreciation , on the basis of which , they felt themselves bound to settle with the warworn soldiery , or the heirs of those whose blood had sealed their patriotism . /z/ 1 Letters are ordered by our Legislature for the States of j 730 . New York , Connecticut , Rhode Island and New Harnp- " jj shire , on the subject of the inland embargoes . The object 14. of these restrictive measures was , as previously denoted , to hinder the downward tendency of the bills of credit , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within its own territory , and having them sold at reasonable prices . Our Government relate , in such communications , that they have a bill before them for the repeal of their embargo , as recommended by Congress , August 21 , 1779 , and a Convention of the five eastern States the succeeding September . They observe , that this bill would have been enacted , had the four other jurisdictions done the same ; but as they have not , and unless the step of repeal should be taken by all concerned simultaneously , it would have an injurious effect on the first taking it , they suspend their final action on the matter . As their conclusion , they say , " We request an early answer to this letter , that we may the sooner be enabled to remove the inconveniences , and prevent the jealousies , which embargo acts have a natural tendency to produce , and speedily to restore unconfined intercourse in commerce , which must always operate to the mutual - ' advantage of the respective States . " 2 Still on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency , Congress determine to try a new method . By such a change , they are , at last , freed from despondency as to the past experiment , and are temporarily cheered with the hope of success in the present . We could heartily wish , that the fruits of their anticipation had been more than visionary . But they found , that let them turn which way they would in this great concern , the brightness of imagination was soon converted to the darkness of adversity . Of the alteration so made , we have the subsequent details . The States are to pay the Continental Treasury $15,000,000 a month . Forty dollars of the national paper are to equal one of specie , and all of it gathered in at this rate , shall be consumed . There is to /z/ 1780. be a new emission of bills , equal to , and payable in silver - and gold , within six years , at five per cent . This paper shall be issued on the funds of individual States , and the promise of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of them may fail to redeem . Each State is to have a portion of such notes , according to its national tax , and place them in the Loan office there , from which they may be drawn completed for circulation , in the proportion of twenty dollars of the old tenor , for one of the new . Of its quota of the last money every Commonwealth is to have six-tenths , and the United States four-tenths , which sum shall be credited to the former government . May 1 In compliance with these Congressional instructions , * Massachusetts order an issue of bills , not to exceed 460,000 . To the general phraseology of this paper , as applicable to all the jurisdictions of the Union , our Commonwealth add particulars suited to their relations . Thus coming to the view of the public , who watched its condition and bearings with eager curiosity and intense feeling , as their last hope of a good paper currency , such an emission passes ere long from its source in every direction . As a sample , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , which has survived the many hands which handled it , and lived , like an aged pensioner , to look out , from its antique depository , upon the widespread blessings which it aided to achieve .

Not made payable on demand , but the period of its redemption put off more than six years , it was not likely to be secured against a fall in its par value . Such a deferring of payment at the Treasury had been one main cause , why its kindred paper had previously suffered so greatly in its credit . Under these unpropitious circumstances , the new tenor did not obtain a circulation till the first day of August . On this account , the Assembly subsequently order , that its interest shall be estimated from such a date . Some of the most threatening objections to the circulation of this emission , may be perceived in what follows . Among the forces under Washington , much opposition was manifested against the Continental bills . 1 He writes May from Morristown , that such an exhibition of their views 27 - and feelings , filled him with deep concern . Rochambeau , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his j u y arrival at Newport , the country was in a consternation 16 - about paper money , which had fallen to sixty for one of specie , and even Government took it at forty for one . Washington , in corresponding with Congress on this sub- Aug. ject , states , that an effort had been made among his troops /z/ 1780. to render their notes altogether uncurrent in the camp . " On this point he remarks , " Every method has been taken to counteract it , because such a combination in the army would be a severe blow to our declining currency . " Issued under such signs of resistance to the old tenor notes , there is no wonder , that the new should have been coldly received , and scarcely admitted to the confidence of the public . Not only was there a marked disaffection in the army against every kind of such money , but also among the recruits of our Commonwealth . Nov. l For this reason , the Legislature make special applica- 16 - tion , and offer liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their quota of men for military service . 2 By this time hard money had become plenty here , and in other parts of the country . Large quantities of it came from the French and British forces , from Havana and other foreign parts , and from prizes captured in the West Indies . While it passed freely among the population , not a dollar of it could be found in the State Treasury , because a thousand claims stood there unsatisfied , and ready 1781. to seize upon it , as soon as its sound was heard . 3 To J * ? - pay the interest due " on public securities , and redeem and destroy one seventh part " of the last order of bills , the Legislature require , that of a heavy tax , being 939,075 , equal to specie , $72,000 of it shall be collected in hard money . Feb. 4 As public watchmen for the welfare of the community , 26 - our political authorities make an address to the people , in which they ingenuously confess their difficulties on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent desires , opinions , advice and facts . Considering the failure of government to sustain the credit of their bills , there can be no wonder , that the confidence of the people in it had been shaken . Still , as this lapse was a misfortune and not a crime , it is hoped that their virtue and patriotism will lead them to befriend such cur- 1 Resolves of the Assembly . 3 Resolves of the Assembly . 3 Bradford 's Massachusetts 4 Resolves of the Assembly . Gouge . MASSACHUSETTS CURRENCY . gj rency , as the best means of relief which stern necessity 1731. of circumstances would allow . " The value of money which is but a representative of property , will ever be regulated by the common consent of the people at large ; hence attempts of any Legislature to regulate it must prove abortive . " When the Assembly emitted the last bills , guaranteed by the United States , they estimated them on a par with specie , and those preceding them , at one fortieth of such value . But before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk to seventy-five for one . In this way the Commonwealth were liable to a loss of seven fifteenths of the whole amount which was to be issued . On this account , the Treasurer was ordered not to pay out one seventh of the sum first intended for circulation . The l clause , which delayed the redemption of this currency to 1786 , has been lately repealed , so that the creditors of the State may not be liable to suffer in the manner they had been . While informed of these things , the people are also told , that the debt of the Commonwealth is 1,200,000 . With this burden upon them , and with a full explanation of the basis on which their paper money rests , they are exhorted to gird themselves up to their necessities , preserve equanimity amid their difficulties , discharge their several obligations , and believe that the bow of promise betokened for them a brighter and a better day . While the old emission money of Congress was legally set at the rate of seventy-five dollars for one of specie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty in Philadelphia . This difference subjected our dealers to great imposition . One marked case may serve as a sample : A noted merchant of Boston received a large amount of such paper from a friend of his in the former metropolis , with instructions to buy whatever saleable articles he conveniently could . Accordingly he went to the principal stores which were filled with dry goods . He pointed to 1 The Acts for this and the reten- uary 2 , 1781 , and were enacted the tion of a seventh part of the new succeeding 10th of March , tenor bills , passed to be enacted Jan- /z/ 1781. a shelf of cotton , of linen , and so on , inquiring the price , and when told , said , " I will take the whole lot .
