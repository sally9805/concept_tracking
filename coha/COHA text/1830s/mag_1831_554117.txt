txt We have always attached great impQrtance to the systematic study , as a part of education , of the personal narrative of the Revolution . No nation the world has ever known can make a more substantial boast , as respects the character of its founders , than we can , and classical antiquity has no more romantic picture than our free infancy presents . Pride in such an ancestry is an elevated and honorable sentiment , which we would fondly cherish , as calculated to fill a void which may he less beneficially supplied . Ad illa , pro se quisque acriter intendat animum , qwe vita , qui mores fuerint ; per quos viros , quibus artibus domi militia*que partum et auctum imperium sit . ' it is surely not extravagant to say , that the man , who thoroughly imbibes the spirit of romantic devotion which actuated our revolutionary progenitors , will scorn the humbler associations of ephemeral politics , and , in aiming at an imitation of the virtues of our heroic age , will rise to a level suited to such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such men as James Otis and Josiah Quincy , and watch the developeinent of patriotic ardor , which , when once it burst into a flame , defied control , the fearlessness that shrunk from no danger and despised all compromise , the willing immolation of every selfish feeling , and the romantic consecration of every faculty to what seemed to he the engrossing purpose of their heing , and he will hardly view with much respect the feats and honors of a modern politician . We have referred to these two instances , on account of their marked peculiarity , and be // cause they are among the few , which the care of posterity has illustrated . The principles on which they acted were those which guided every patriot of the times . There seemed to be a holy atmosphere that enveloped the soil of freedom , and exerted its genial influence on all who breathed it . It is painful to confess , that less pure breezes have occasionally tainted this consecrated element , and to observe the difference which , in point of moral and poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same individual . We shall not easily forget the unpleasant effect produced by the contrast of the revolutionary with the post-revolutionary memoirs of Mr. Jefferson , his autobiography with his Ana . ' In the first , we trace the operation of pure and patriotic sympathies , and affections too active and powerful to permit the intrusion of personal antipathy , or suspicion of any feeling unworthy of the great cause he was so anxiously promoting ; in the last , it is impossible to be blind to the influence of party association on a vigorous and honorable mind , in fostering unkind resentments , and perpetuating hostility of the severest description . And yet , of all the eulogies which the natural enthusiasm of the day has bestowed on that great man , how few , in comparison , are founded on the enduring basis of his revolutionary services . It is matter of sincere regret , that as a study and a part of at least accomplished education , the history and biography of the Revolution have been so grossly neglected . We do not hazard much in saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the details of which the great body of our fellow-citizens are less familiar , than that which records the actions of our immediate ancestry ; and that there are many , very many Americans , young and old , who , while they would smile in scorn , if asked what ship-money ' or lettres de cachet ' were , would pause in ignorance if catechised as to the objects of the Quebec bill ' or the writs of assistance . ' Ilampden , and Russell , and Sidney , are names familiar to many , to whom the personal services of our own patriots are unknown . To produce a different result is the legitimate object of American literature , and it is with sincere pleasure that we hail any attempt , however humble , to rescue from the dark oblivion in which they have too long reposed , the records of our early fame . We would make it popular by all the fascinations of eloquence and all the mechanical embellishments of art . We would have a Family Library , ' truly // national , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the records of justified or palliated crime , in the biographies of profligate heroes and licentious monarchs , * we would chastea them by the habitual exhibition of virtues of domestic growth , and actions of appropriate interest . Independently of the ulterior consequence of contributing to the capital stock on which the future historian of our country will have to operate , the revolutionary biographer may be stimulated by the reasonable hope of giving a new and salutary direction to the public taste ; and , putting out of view the practical and substantial benefits to which we have incidentally referred , he will find , that the personal narratives of our early history are replete with incident worthy of illustration from authors as able and accomplished as any that our country has yet produced . Our attention has been recently directed anew to the materials for supplying the void to which we have alluded , by the publication of the volume whose title we have prefixed to this article . Though it is in itself meagre in point of novel information , the source from which it emanates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it professes , in part , to illustrate portions of our early history , which have hitherto been in great measure neglected . We refer , especially , to the revolutionary annals of what , at the commencement of the contest , was the metropolis of our country . It is matter of painful astonishment , that , with the abundance of materials and the acknowledged existence of the requisite ability , no biography of a Pennsylvanian patriot has yet appeared . The descendants of the great men whom that portion of the Union produced , owe a vast debt to their country , which we hope will before long be cancelled ; and if such a result shall be at all promoted by the cursory remarks we have made , every object we have in view will be fully attained . There is a peculiar interest connected with this subject , which deserves a more specific reference , than our limits will now permit us to make . All that we hope to d6 , is to point to the soil beneath which the treasures are hidden . Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the two points at which the flame of active patriotism seemed to burn brightest . The density of city population // quickened the contagion of revblutionary doctrines , and the fact , that the oppressive measures of the Government immediately affected commercial interests , rendered the large ports the scenes of the first grievance and complaint . Our city was the theatre of the first overt act of rebellion and actual insurrection . In fact , the materials for combustion had been long collecting there . At various times anterior to the general conflagration , the fire of opposition had hurst forth ; and though , as in the case of the combat with Captain Preston , it had been suppressed , every thing seemed on that account the more ready for rekindling , whenever accident should apply the torch . In our sister city , there was less harmony of sentiment and action , in consequence not only of a different constitution of society , but of an accidental difference in the course of events . Manifest as was the dissimilarity in the former particular , occasioned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and substantial interest in the preservation of tranquillity , and by the pacific tendency of the principles of the Society of Friends , it would beyond doubt have been less apparent , had the same impulse to violence been given . We do not pretend to say , that the staid and reflecting ancestors of our Philadelphia brethren would have gone to the work of rebellion , as did our progenitors , in masquerade ; but there is every reason to believe , that , had the tea ships arrived first at that city , and the same arrogant folly and insolence been exhibited there as here , by the Government party , the waters of the Delaware would have been impregnated with the hated herb . As it was , there was more than one developement of excessive and appropriate exasperation . On receiving the intelligence of Dr. Franklin 's examination before the Privy Council , a manifestation of feeling occurred , illustrative of the actual state of the public mind . A cart was prepared , with the usual decorations for such exhi-. bitions , in which were placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Hutchinson , and in open defiance of the delegated authority of royally , was drawn through the principal streets of the city , and with its contents publicly burned in the presence of an immense concourse at the Coffee-house . When the arrival of the tea ships was announced , a degree of excitement prevailed , which , had it not been tranquillized , would have led to open violence and resistance . Meeting after meeting had been held in anticipation of the event , and the most strenuous exertions made // by all parties , to give to the inevitable explosion a direction suited to their various views . A spontaneous* though informal resolution was taken , that the ordinary services of pilotage should be withheld ; and though the leading whigs earnestly opposed such a course , as calculated to discredit the cause of opposition , the decision was formed and the vessel was unable to procure a pilot . Her actual arrival below the city was a signal for a more open demonstration of popular sentiment . A town meeting composed of several thousand citizens was convened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were adopted , threatening summary retribution in case the wishes of the people should be slighted . This indication of certain consequences , the captain and consignees thought it expedient to regard ; and in less than six hours from the time of dropping anchor in the Delaware , the ministerial adventure was on its return to Great Britain . We have referred to the conduct of the Philadelphians in relation to the Revenue Bill rather than to that produced by the Stamp Act , because it better illustrates the actual state of feeling anterior to the catastrophe , and because it served immediately to bring forward the patriots , who , in the eventful struggles of succeeding years , gained enduring fame . Before this time the ardent and zealous , those who were truly the men of revolution , cautiously , and , from a strong sense of expediency , kept themselves in the shade until accident should occasion the final rupture . They felt that active participation on their part might produce a reaction , and , by rendering the timid still more cautious , might obstruct the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on without their interference . The necessity and propriety of this reserve resulted from a peculiarity in the political condition of the Province , arising from local causes , and from the great ascendency of the Quaker interest , whose acquiescence it was necessary for the popular party to secure . For many years , the councils of the Colony had been distracted by conflicts of a violent kind . There had been an uninterrupted series of disputes between the proprietaries and the popular branch of the Colonial Legislature , of which the natural result was increased obstinacy on both sides , without the least shadow of concession by either . The Quakers , uniformly the predominant sect , averse in all instances from extremities of any kind , had acquired great influence , by their wealth , their numbers , and their respectability , // and , by the inculcation of their pacific tenets , obviated the effect of contests so bitter and unremitting . Had these principles been less prevalent , different consequences would have ensued , and the Assembly of this Colony , like those of Virginia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearless discussions , in which the least loyal doctrines would have been boldly uttered and resolutely sustained . As it was , however , in the first instance anti-ministerial , and * fortiori revolutionary opinions met with comparatively little favor . Every effort was made to prevent a rupture , which , if it once occurred , every one knew must be irreparable . It was necessary to try every conceivable project of conciliation and compromise , before this pacific set of men could be induced to enter the ranks of opposition . During the disputes with the Governors , the Friends had consistently supported xvhat were called the popular doctrines , and had uniformly opposed the proprietary interests . Transition from one kind of opposition to another would seem to be natural . Yet , with all their inveterate and well-ascertained antipathy to the proprietors , and their avowed anxiety to alter the form of Colonial Government , they shrank from active resistance to the parent country , and scrupulously avoided the contagion of principles , by any construction or in any degree revolutionary . It was in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded , and it was on this account , that her active and zealous whigs appeared comparatively at a later period before the world . They were , for the reasons we have briefly stated , hampered by the necessity of a gradual persuasion of the Friends , and by the reasonable fear , that extreme measures of any kind , if taken too soon , would occasion a fatal secession . They had foresight enough to know that the halcyon season of equivocal tranquillity which then existed , and the continuance of which was the burthen of many a fervent prayer , could not in the nature of things endure long , and they attached too much importance to harmony of sentiment and action on the occurrence of the catastrophe , to endanger it by indiscreet and premature manifestations of their zeal . When Mr. Quincy , at a still later period , with characteristic ardor , complained in a letter to Mr. Dickinson , of the refinements , delays , and experiments of the Philadelphians , ' he forgot the difference of the elements which he and his correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was // electrical with indignant zeal , and but one voice was heard and one sentiment uttered ; in the other there was a temporary qualification of hostile feeling , which time only could remove . He knew nothing of the anxieties and deferred hopes of those who sympathized with every grievance , and bitterly lamented their inability to place themselves at once in the line of opposition . The crisis was not long postponed . The unceremonious refusal to permit the importation of the tea shipments , was an act of confessed illegality and aggravated insult , which no one was so sanguine as to suppose would be allowed to pass unnoticed by the ministry , and every one waited in silent expectation for the developement of vengeance . The Bostonians had thrown the tea into the river . The Philadelphians had not , because they had found in those interested more compliant adversaries , but had compelled the captain to carry back his cargo whence it came . The difference of offence was slight , for though there was but one criminal overt act , so perfect was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitement on this point , and those who had most actively offended were not more reasonably apprehensive than those who had justified the act of violence , and whose innocence of outrage could only be attributed to the want of opportunity . For several months after the tea ship sailed , there was an ominous tranquillity , broken by no expression of public feeling . It was the boding quiet that precedes the storm . There is a passage in the life of the puritan , Colonel Hutchinson , couched in the quaint language of the day , which is accurately descriptive of the period to which we allude ; The land , ' says the fair historian , was then at peace ,  --  it being towards the end of the reigne of King James i. ,  --  if that quietness may be called a peace , which was rather like the calme and smooth surface of the sea , whose dark womb is already impregnated of a horrid tempest . ' Legislative omnipotence , the vital principle of the Stamp Act , the declaratory law and the Revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that severe retribution would follow the commission of what , on the royal and ministerial scale of criminality , was the height of political enormity . The bolt of vengeance did not long lie unemployed in the metropolitan armory . The fury of insulted authority was realized and concentrated in the Boston Port Bill , the news of which , and of the conduct of its // immediate victims , reached Philadelphia in the early part of May , 1774 , and marked the era of the full developement of the patriotic zeal , which previously had been unnaturally suppressed . The object we have had in view , is not to dwell upon the details of local history further than as they illustrate the valuable biographical materials which are yet to be produced . The prominent incidents of the times have been recorded by the general historian ; but the hidden impulses to action , the secret motives , the remote and final causes of these results , can be ascertained only from the private and confidential correspondence of the patriots of the times . In the interval between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congress of 1774 , each hour seemed destined to develope some new mode of oppression abroad , and some variety of excitement and resentment at home . On the part of the patriots , activity had usurped the place of deliberation , and compromise and conciliation were forgotten in the sense of the necessity of some kind of opposition to claims and impositions , felt and acknowledged by all but a small fragment of the community to be intolerable . By opposition we do not mean actual hostility and rebellion , having independence for its aim , for such a result we have no reason to believe was then generally anticipated , but resolute refusal to acknowledge the right of imposition and coercion , and a readiness to yield unreserved sympathy to those who were the immediate victims of ministerial tyranny . Such an opposition was fully organized in Philadelphia before the assembling of the General Congress . When that body met , the necessity of local exertion seemed to be in a measure removed , and the individuals who had been the heroes of the provincial stage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were transferred to a higher sphere of action on the legislative theatre of the nation . The pi'oceedings of the Congress of 1774 are matters of history , to which we refer no further than incidentally to notice them . It was the venerable parent of American legislation , the untainted source of our national honor and renown . It was an assembly placed hy the character of its objects above the suspicion of impure or selfish motive , representing the majesty of an injured people , and acting under the guidance of no wish , hut to do full justice to the end of its institution . It embodied all the romance and purity of purpose that adorn revolutions , and was destitute of // all the fanaticism and absurd and vulgar violence , that often disfigure them . On the minds of the citizens of the capital where it was convened , it had a most happy influence . All parties seemed to be satisfied . The personal character of the members , who were known to be , without exception , men of commanding intelligence and unquestioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mystery with which their deliberations were conducted , and the unanimity with which it was believed that all their resolutions had passed , although , as in the case of Mr. Galloway 's proposition , which was adopted by a majority of but one Colony , there had been little harmony as to questions of policy ; the manifest cordiality which marked their personal intercourse ; the firm , but temperate tone of their published addresses , the most decided of which was the answer to the Suffolk County resolutions ; - all had a tendency to compose the previous political agitation , and to assuage the bitterness of feeling , which had before been manifested . It is remarkable , considering the result , that the various views of all parties in the Province should have been so happily met . The zealous patriots , who , in case of extremity , looked directly to the last resort , knew that whilst temporizing measures were sanctioned by the Congress , in which body there were many as ardent as themselves , they could have no reason to complain . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of Colonial rights , but who deemed temperance of language and action the safest and best policy , were satisfied with the moderation and caution of the Congress , and with the conviction , that those whom they regarded as their proper representatives , had great influence in that assembly . Even the timid and disaffected had less reason for discontent than they had anticipated . They , too , had their representatives , who , as in the instance of Mr. Galloway , were distinguished for talent and influence ; and they found consolation amid their fears and forebodings in a decided preference of the counsels of the moderate party , with whom they had some sympathy , to those of the ultra patriots , with whom they had none . Such was the state of feeling in Pennsylvania on perceiving the success of this first experiment of independent legislation ; and the satisfaction which all expressed was realized in the apparent cordiality with which the non-importation and non-consumption agreements were adopted and enforced . When these measures of peace // ful , but resolute opposition were recommended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by a solemn compact signed by the members , by which they bound themselves and their constituents by the sacred ties of virtue , honor , and love of country , ' to the performance of the requisitions it prescribed . Public opinion fully sanctioned this obligation , and the loyal as well as the liberal portion of the citizens of Philadelphia , the tories as well as the whigs , immediately acceded to it . In the Congress of 1774 , there was one man , of whom his native State has especial reason to be proud , and whose memory we hope she religiously cherishes . We refer to the first of a triumvirate of patriots , to whom only we shall be able to allude at this time , John Dickinson , of Pennsylvania , the author of the Farmer 's Letters . From the period of the first Colonial discontents , in consequence of the restrictions on the West India trade in 1763 , and the Stamp Act in 1765 , to the final catastrophe , Mr. Dickinson was the determined and efficient advocate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of his native Colony , he had acquired a high and honorable distinction there by the part he had acted in the animated contests of local politics . The position he held was a singular and a fortunate one . He was friendly to the continuance of the proprietary form of government , which , in the peculiar circumstances of the times , he believed to be the one most conducive to the welfare of the community , and was at the same time intimately connected with the Friends , who , as we have said , were desirous of a change in the Colonial charter . From this peculiar relation , independently of the consideration of his commanding talents and unblemished private worth , his sentiments and conduct derived great influence . His constitutional moderation and deliberative d isposition were remarkable . This distinction was not destined to be confined to the sphere of local action . The publication of the Farmer 's Letters actually formed an era in the history of the times . They were republished and read throughout all the Colonies . No one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many , which , from peculiar circumstances , enjoyed for a time equal repute , were of far inferior merit . They are the finished product of the scholar 's labors , and contain the genuine expression of the patriot 's aspirations . In them , the student of revolutionary // history will find a strain of simple and fervent eloquence suited to the theme , and an aptness of illustration and force of reasoning the most admirable and conclusive , if beauty of style and interest of subject form the essence of the distinction , they are part of the classical literature of our country . Their effect at the time of their publication was inconceivable , and the Pennsylvania Farmer was at once ranked among the most eloquent advocates of resistance that had then appeared . Yet who reads the Farmer 's Letters now , and how many are there , we ask the question mournfully , of the multitudes of well-edu cated young men in our country , who have drunk largely of the poisoned stream of foreign political literature , and are familiar with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British toryism , who are ignorant alike of the object and the author of these once celebrated productions ? We will venture to express the hope , that some of those who peruse these pages will credit the cordial praise we have bestowed , and be induced to ascertain for themselves that our encomium is not undeserved . The tribute of admiration paid by Dugald Stewart to the early American state papers , is as justly due to the occasional publications of the day , of which the Farmer 's Letters were beyond comparison the most distinguished . Mr. Dickinson was par excellence the writer for the first Congresses , and it is to his pen that we are indebted for a great portion of the addresses , which embodied in language so appropriate the resentment of an injured people . He wrote what the thunders uttered . ' The addresses of the various conventions of his native Colony , the instructions from the people of Pennsylvania to their delegates in the General Assembly , the letters of Congress to the Canadians , and to the inhabitants of Bermuda on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other papers , which our space will not permit us even to mention , were written by him . It is known that Mr. Dickinson was opposed to Jndependence at the time when it was decided on by Congress , and that he did not , sign the Declaration . It is not our duty , in this place or at this time , to vindicate his fame . In his doubts , let it be remembered , he was not singular . Caution and deliberation , perhaps too uniformly operating , were his characteristics , and it is apparent from the detached portions of his private correspondence , which have met the public eye , that , as the crisis approached when the destinies of his country were to be determined , // his constitutional temperament did not soon enough yield to the exigencies of the times , and that he hesitated a moment too long , and allowed others to adopt the decisive measure to which time would have reconciled him . His un-* published correspondence on this subject must be peculiarly interesting . In strong contrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just referred , was his early associate , Joseph Reed , subsequently President of the Executive Council of Pennsylvania . Of the character and temperament of the latter , we can not convey a better idea than by describing him as the confidential and intimate friend of Warren and Quincy , and the one of their numerous correspondents to whom they seemed to write with the least reserve . Theirs was the intercourse of minds perfectly congenial , and confident , not merely in each other 's faith , but in each other 's zeal and enthusiasm . I congratulate you , ' says Mr. Reed in a letter to Mr. Quincy , which has been published , on the rising glory of America ; our operations have been almost too slow for the accumulated sufferings of Boston ; but should our bloodless war fail of its effect , we are ready to make the last appeal rather than resign our liberties into the hand of any ministerial tyrant . ' And it was in reply to this assurance , that his correspondent , filled with romantic enthusiasm at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from participating , made his prophetic declaration ; I look to my countrymen with the feelings of one , who verily believes they must yet seal their faith and constancy with their blood . This is a distressing witness indeed . But hath not this ever been the lot of humanity ? Have not blood and treasure in all ages been the price of cj , vil liberty ? Can Americans hope for a reversal of the laws of our nature , and that the best of blessings will be obtained and secured without the sharpest trials ? Adieu , my friend . My heart is with you , and whenever my countrymen command , my person shall be also . ' Mr. Reed belonged entirely to the era of the Revolution , the commencement and termination of his public life being coincident with the beginning and the end of . the contest . His career was a short but a brilliant and eventful one , crowded with incidents worthy of ample illustration at the hands of those on whom the care of his memory has devolved . His private correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Colonies , commenced // by the young American at the suggestion of some foreigners friendly to the Colonial cause , encouraged by the minister , and abruptly terminated by Mr. Reed on the occurrence of hostilities at Lexington , must possess great historical value . The other features of his biography are marked with equal interest . In the early stages of revolt and opposition at Phil .. adelphia , he was the orator of the patriotic party , and the individual on whose eloquence the friends of liberty principally relied . The commanding position which he then assumed was not subsequently abandoned . As the confidential Secretary of Washington during the opening campaign in New England ; as the bosom friend and destined biographer of Greene ; * as the Executive head of his native State during the gloomiest period of the Revolution , when her counsels were distracted by faction , and her great energies paralyzed by the discord of her rulers and the temporary secession of her troops ; as the valued military counsellor of the Commander-in-Chief in the anxious hours which preceded the attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peculation , whose treason he was the first to suspect and denounce ; as the associate of Morris and Laurens in repelling the insidious attempts of the agents of ministerial corruption , the detailed history of which has never yet appeared ; and as the author of the reply so often recorded , and never to be forgotten , that he was not worth buying , but that such as he was , the King of Great Britain was not rich enough to do it ; ' in all his relations to the history of the times , his character and actions are clothed with peculiar interest . A shade of gloom attended the close of'his honorable career . The termination of the war found him with a constitution impaired by exposure to unremitting anxiety and fatigue , and at the early age of forty-two , when the powers of his brilliant mind had reached their full developement , and at a period of public affairs , when he might have won new honors in a new career , he sank a broken-hearted man into a premature grave , dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The record of his virtues and his actions has , we believe , never been attempted , and in the allusion we have made to them , we have been guided principally by the imperfect information which general history affords . We are awave * President Reed actually commenced a biography of General Greene , as well as a history of the Revolution* in neither of which work3 did he live to mike much progress* // how inadequate it is . It remains for others to do the subject more ample justice . There is yet one name worthy of a far more substantial memorial than our transient pages can afford , with a reference to which we must conclude this article . We allude to that of Robert Morris , of whom it has been justly said , that our country , with a single exception , owes more to him than to any other individual of the times , and of whose public services , imperfectly as they have been understood and appreciated , we are reluctant incidentally to speak . The civil history of the Revolution is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his financial system ,  --  and it is the highest praise to apply such a term to a structure raised on the uncertain soil , and adapted to the varying exigencies of revolution ,  --  and the faithful narrative of his unwearied and successful efforts to supply aliment to the feeble Government which depended on him for sustenance , will be far more interesting than any historical or biographical memoir that has yet been written . It is a subject worthy of all that talent and experience can bestow on it . His services were confined to no local scene . His fame is part of the common property of the nation . The appointment of Mr. Morris to the office of Superintendent of the Finances was the great era of his life , and we had almost said , the most fortunate incident of the revolutionary contest . But the commencement of his usefulness , and of his public services , may he dated at a period long anterior . At the time of the first indication of serious opposition to the British Government , his native city and State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her patriots . The splendid services which he subsequently rendered , in the administration of the Continental finances , threw all the incidents of his previous life into the shade ; hut there was a beautiful unity in his whole career , which his future and faithful biographer will not forget . With respect to his administration of the fiscal concerns of the Confederation , it would be inconsistent with the design of these remarks to make any detailed or even general observations . What Mr. Morris accomplished , tradition and history have informed us , and in the blessings of our national credit , we realize the results of the system which he and his successor designed . How he accomplished the projects which his genius suggested , and with what specific difficulties and disappointments he had to contend , the progress of // his financial plans from conception to maturity , amid circumstances of every variety of depression and gloom that clouded every mind , and prostrated every spirit but his*own , the succession of hopes and fears which were never intermitted ; - these are points , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confidential correspondence can alone adequately illustrate . In the delineation of Mr. Morris 's char-. acter and services , which we gather merely from the meagre and unsatisfactory memoirs which have been published , and from the details which have been preserved by his few surviving contemporaries , the strongest peculiarities are his unbounded personal influence , the fruit of a life of unblemished integrity , and the spirit of philosophic heroism with which he seems to have been actuated , and which in the course of his public life was most severely tried . Without his personal credit , the system he designed , successful as his inspiring genius made it , would have been nothing but an inoperative theory , and all the horrors of national bankruptcy and military despotism , the one rendered necessary by the other , must have ensued . It is said to have been the honorable distinction of the Spanish colonial merchants , that in commercial intercourse with them , the artificial securities of notes and guarantees were never resorted to , and that an entry in their own books , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , constituted a safe and religious obligation . Confidence like this , which never was , and never will be habitual with us even in peaceful times , Mr. Morris was enabled to realize amidst the anarchy and convulsion of a civil war . If the army needed provision or ammunition , his promise of indemnity alone could procure a supply even from the most cautious ; by his aid money could always be raised , and the name of Robert Morris on a note gave it a currency and credit , which neither the States nor the Confederation could cornmand . His letters to different individuals in relation to the various exigencies of the Government are richly adorned with the moral beauty which this weight of character imparted . In one to General Schuyler , in the year 1781 , on the occasion of a request to that officer to procure some supplies , he used the following characteristic language . 1 take it for granted , that you can upon your own credit and engagements raise this money ; and for your reimbursement you may either take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledge myself to repay you // with hard money wholly , if required , or part hard , part paper , so you transact the business , in short , I promise , and you may rely that no consideration whatever shall induce me to make a l ) promise that I am not able to perform . ' That security was never known to fail . By the heroism to which we have alluded , we mean the perfect subordination of natural feeling to a stern sense of duty , which enabled him to withstand all the cavils of calumny and suspicion to which his official station exposed him , in the full reliance that the time would come , sooner or later , when all would acknowledge the propriety of his measures , and the purity of his motives . Mr. Morris passed through every variety of trial in this respect , without the slightest faltering of resolution , and on no occasion is it recorded of him , that for the purposes of temporary vindication he sacrificed a public benefit , however remote , or swerved from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to follow . The judgment which his sagacity assured him was inevitable , has long since been pronounced . During his life , all the misrepresentations of his public character that had ever existed were dissipated , and every succeeding year , as it elicits some new memorial of his services , pays new and cordial honors to his memory . The closing hours of this illustrious man also were obscured by personal misfortune , and darkened by pecuniary difficulties induced by speculations , in which misplaced confidence and a sanguine temperament had led him to participate . But overwhelming as were those misfortunes , and dark as was the shade they cast upon his parting hours , their effect has , we have every reason to believe , been much misunderstood , or most unkindly misrepresented . The consciousness of unsullied honor and honest motives was a support that never failed him . The vigor of a mind like his , trained in the school of difficulty , and strengthened by continued probation in a public post of painful responsibility , was not subdued ; and while he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had fondly indulged , he submitted to the blow with calm resignation , and found in the discharge of familiar and social duties enough - to console and cheer the short remnant of his eventful life . Mr. Morris devoted the last years of his life to the selection and arrangement of his financial papers and letters , which remain a rich legacy to his posterity and his country . There are other individuals connected with the history of // the Revolution in our sister State , to whose memory we regret our inability to pay the tribute , which is most justly due . The names of statesmen , such as Charles Thomson , James Wilson , and Thomas McKean ; of gallant soldiers like Wayne , and Muffin , and Potter , and Irvine , and Armstrong , are worthy of a more elaborate notice than we now have it in our power to bestow . We owe some apology to the respectable association , the title of whose transactions we have placed at the head of this article , for having used their volume merely for our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As there is nothing , however , among the papers now published , with the exception of a single memoir , which relates to the subject to which our observations have been directed , we may be excused for the unceremonious manner with which we have treated them , and for one suggestion in parting . We regret to find , by a comparison of this with the preceding volumes of the society 's transactions , that so small a share of their attention has been bestowed on the revolutionary annals of their State , and may be permitted to hope that they will ke induced to give another and more profitable direction to their inquiries . Much may be done by them towards illustrating the subjects to which we have cursorily referred . Materials may be collected , records preserved , and the testimony of the few suvvivors of our age of honor and legitimate renown may be per-. petuated . The colonial history of our country , with which alone the society seem to have employed themselves , is a subject of little interest , except so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one about which the public may be excused for being very indifferent . We would not exchange one document illustrative of the era of the Revolution and of the ancestry from whom we have inherited our youthful liberties , for all the records of charter history that now slumber in appropriate oblivion . They are as worthless in comparison as was the commentary on the Psalms , which for so many ages obscured the treatise de Republic4 . The unhonored sleep in which the revolutionary progenitors of our Pennsylvanian brethren repose , will , we trust , ere long be broken ; and if any thing that we have said shall have a tendency to produce that result , all the ends we have had in view will be attained.
