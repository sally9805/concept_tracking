txt PRy-EMINENT among the Indians of the United States , during the whole period of our colonial history , were the confederated tribes of the Mohawks , Oneidas , Cayugas , Onoadagas , and Sene . cas , by the French commonly called the Iroquois , and by the English the Five Nations , and afterwards , the Six Nations , in consequence of the accession of the Tuscaroras to the league . When the French entered Canada , they found these Indians where Montre* 1 now stands , and engaged in war with a neighboring tribe called the Adisondocs . This war continued , with sundry vicissitudes , until the Iroquois proved at length victorious , and the power of the Adisondocs was completely broken ; but meanwhile the Iroquois saw fit , or perhaps were compelled by the operations of the French , to recede along the St. Lawrence towards Lake Ontario , by reason of which that part of the river St. Lawrence bore the name of Iroqltoi8 , preserved in the treaty of 1783 , in the definition of the boundaries of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat of their power in the region of the Lakes Ontario and Erie , the Iroquois drove before them the less energetic , or less powerful bands which previously occupied the country , and spread themselves or their authority and influence south and west over an extensive territory , which now comprehends New York , Western Pennsylvania , and most of Ohio . This great movement of the Iroquois , displacing the tribes immediately in contact with them , which tribes again pressed upon , and displaced , others beyond , diffused far and wide a knowledge of the warlike bands whose advance originated the general disturbance of pre**xisting relations . Among the remotest Indians of Ne*v England , the Mohawk was a name of terror . The fugitive Ilurons and Ottowas bore the name and the fame of the Iroquois inland to the Sioux of the Upper Mississippi .

Occasionally , and for temporary objects , they have been held in league awhile , by the talents of a Pontiac , or a Tecumseh ; but these have been exceptions to the general rule . The Senecas , Onondagas , Mohawks , Oneidas , and Cayugas , on the contrary , exhibited the rudiments of a *veil constituted and stable confederacy , each tribe having its own separate usages and interior government , but all , for a long period , conducting great undertakings in concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength and spirit by and through which they vanquished or overawed the other Indian tribes ; and in the same way they secured and retained the respect of the Europeans of New York and of Canada , with whom , by their geographical position , they were perpetually brought in contact . At a very early date , they became the allies of the English of New York against their common enemy , the French of Canada ; and were , of course , active in the border wars of the northern frontier ; and thus they continued , until the war of independence , * which divided their friends , divided them , and led to the dissolution , in effect , of their confederacy , and the downfall of their power . Thayendanegea , by birth a Mohawk , and of the tribe which , by the custom of the Six Nations , usually furnished the war-chief , had borne arms in the French and Indian wars , and other frontier transactions prior to the Revolution ; and when the war of the Revolution broke out , sided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous incursions and detached conflicts of which our northwestern settlements were the scene for nearly twenty years . We say twenty years ; for neither the hostilities of the Indians , nor indeed those of Great Britain , ceased until Wayne 's victory subdued and humbled the former , and compelled the litter to surrender the frontier posts which , in violation of the treaty of Paris , she had so long retained , and to desist for a while from open machinations against our peace . During this period , then , Thayendanegen , as principal chief of the Mohawks , and of such others of the Six Nations as adhered to the same cause , was the active and indefatigable ally of England , and enemy of the United States ; and his name , coupled with so many reminiscences of savage cruelty , of which lie was the real or supposed instigator and agent , has descended to our times invested with a bad eminence of peculiar infamy . It is distinctive of the North American savages to follow usages of war at once cowardly and ferocious ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenceless inmates ; to shun fair encounters in the open field ; to burn , destroy , and lay waste , in sheer vindictiveness , or wanton malice ; to slaughter women and children with unrelenting blood-thirstiness ; and to glory in carrying off the // scalps of sucking babes , equally as those of manful opponents won in the heat of battle . Now that these things have passed away from our own doors-from the immediate neighbourhood of so large a part of the population of the United States-much sickly sentimentality is wasted upon the men whose only pride is in the perpetration of such deeds ; and whom , thus far , neither persuasion nor example has been able to reclaim from their inveterate habits of dissolute idleness in time of peace , and unmitigated barbarism in time of war . As the leader of some of the fierce bands armed against us by Great Britain at that period , Thayendanegen , we repeat , by his English name of Brandt , has come down to us , in the histories of that day , and in the tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horror . Notoriously and unquestionably , he was a commissioned leader of the Indian auxiliaries of Great Britain , commanding a portion of those troops the mere employment of which at all was justly stigmatized then , and ever since , as deeply disgraceful to the mother country . He was known to have been present , as war-chief of the Mokawks , in numerous scenes of massacre and carnage . In his case , as in that of other commanders , common fame , whether rightfully or not , held him responsible for the savage acts of his savage followers . All the contemporaneous accounts concurred in imputing to him the traits of character common to his race and his position ; or as Mr. Stone himself says : " In the meagre sketches of his life hitherto published , although an occasional redeeming *Tirtue has been allowed by some , anecdotes of treachery and blood have been introduced , to sustain the imputed disposition of relentless ferocity ; " and we may add , that with all the light that Mr. Stone , a most friendly biographer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw upon the question , too many of those " anecdotes of treachery and blood " are , in point of fact , undenied , and undeniable . And Campbell , in the well remembered passage of Gertrude of Wyoming , has expressed the ideas concerning Thayendanegea , handed down to us by our fathers . Outalissi , the Oneida chief , speaks : " But this is not the time , ' - he started up , And smote his breast with woe-denouncing hand ,  - -  This is no time to fill the joyous cup ; - The Mammoth comes ,  --  the foe , the monster Brandt , With all his howling , desolating , band ; - These eyes have seen their blade , and burning pine , Awake at once and silence half your land. - Red is the cup they drink , hut not with wine : Awake , 0 wretch ! to night , or see no morrow shine ! Scorning to wield the hatchet for his tribe , " Gajast Brandt himself I went to battle forth : Accursed Brandt ! " // This notorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather , in the execution of the original purpose of preserving the memory of the great number of interesting events , of which the Indian country of New York , and especially the valley of the Mohawk , was the theatre , Mr. Stone adopted the plan of associating the history of those events with an account of the life of Thayendanegea . Though called the Life of Joseph Brandt , ' it is , therefore , a much more extensive and important work ; including , in part , as the title page indicates , the border wars of the American Revolution , and sketches of the Indian campaigns of Generals Harman , St. Clair , and Wayne , and other matters connected with the Indian relations of the United States and Great Britain . ' Indeed , these other matters ' - other , that is , than the life of Brandtoccupy the chief part of the work , and are of the greatest value , and the more permanent historical interest ; and we should have been better pleased with the work , if Thayendanegea had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true , the most conspicuous Indian of that time , and that section of the country ; he performed the acts of blood proper to such an auxiliary ; but his condition was that of a simple captain , as he himself states , ( vol. ii . pp. 408 , ) in the British service ; he played a secondary and subordinate part in the great drama , of which he is here made the hero ; and he is thus lifted into an apparent position of relative importance , altogether undeserved by him , or any other of the savage instruments of the vengeance of England against her revolted colonies . We object , in general , to the posthumous canonization , which a misdirected sympathy , as we think , and erroneous impression of the facts , is so prone to bestow on every savage , who like Thayendane*ea , or Oseola , happens to distinguish himself by peculiar ferocity or activity , against our own people , and our own blood . And , in the particular case before us , we see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this magnitude , has been to seduce Mr. Stone into an over-estimate of the personal character of Brandt , and of his importance in history . Thus it is , we conceive , that much ingenuity and acuteness are expended , in several instances , in the attempt , on the one side , to disclose the mind , or the hand of Thayendanegea , and to ( 10 him honor , in connection with great affairs , wherein his participation is either purely conjectural or imaginary , and wholly subordinate ; and , on the other , to free him from the generally received imputation of odium in reference to smaller events within his appropriate scope and sphere . This we think to have been a fault of arrangement or plan , which , though it may not impair the general interest of the work , and may , perhaps , add to it , is nevertheless a defect , because it is injuriou5 to symmetry of design , and because it introduces questionable facts , // and still more questionable conclusions , into a book whose value and attractiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the novelty and original sources of much of its contents , will possess great intrinsic historical importance . At the same time , Mr. Stone has explored successfully , a rich and productive mine of facts . The valley of the Mohawk , and the contiguous country west of it , was the seat of the Five Nations . There the French and English so often met , negotiated , and made war . There it was that the Five Nations , the Romans of the new world , as Caldero grandiloquently calls them , displayed their eloquence arid their bravery , elicited by the conflicting relations of their European neighbours of Canada and New York . There , in the long contest of the Revolution , and in the Indian wars which followed , were manifested all the traits of courage , hardihood , perseverance , enterprise , intelligence , and patriotism , which distinguished our own forefathers ; and the sagacity , fortitude , physical endurance , fierceness , and blood-guiltiness , of the savages around them . Vindictive expeditions of the expatriated tories , wasting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the inhabitants for the defenee of their homes , and the support of their independence ; and all the vicissitudes of battie , captivity , and thrilling adventure , belong to the local history of that region . In addition to which , during the Revolution , it was the scene of many , among the most remarkable acts and brilliant enterprises , on a large scale , of the national forces of England and of the United Colonies . All these things render the tract of country in question , peculiarly rich in historical incident . Mr. Stone having spent some of his early years in the valley of the Mohawk , in the midst of localities marked by such interesting events , and of those who had acted and suffered in them , was prompted , in the process of time , to conceive the idea of collecting and preserving the papers , letters , and fleeting recollections , appertaining to the past , ere they should pass into oblivion with the generation in whose possession , or memory , those original elements of history subsisted ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period of his researches , is the result of that design ; a life of Sir William Johnson , the celebrated English agent among the Indians of New York , being promised , which shall narrate the events of the former part of that period , anterior to the Revolutionary war . In the prosecution of this task , the author , in addition to the matter previously in print , has had the use of a great mass of manuscript materials , consisting of journals , letters , and other papers , of many of the distinguished men of that day , including those of General James Clinton , of General Gansevoort , of Sir William Johnson , and of Brandt himself , preserved by his family in Canada . // Connected with the local history , which Mr. Stone has derived from the sources indicated , or from the communications of living persons , he has introduced from time to time sketches of the general history of the Revolution . While the effect of this may have been to render the contents somewhat multifarious , it has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great variety of incident and of personal adventure which it brings to relieve the graver events of war and policy . Without enterin into all these topics , which the limits of an Article like the present forbid , and reserving the liberty of recurring again , in a future Second Article , to this interesting work , we will endeavour to throw together , in a continuous narrative , the principal traits in the life and character of Thayendanegea . Mr. Stone labours to show that Thayendanegea was a full-blooded Mohawk , and the son of a Sachem ; . whose name , as communicated to him by the chief 's family , was **27;1019;TOOLONG This rQputed father is said to have died in the infancy of his son ; . and the mother having afterwards married an Indian called Brandt , her son grew up with the name of Joseph Brandt . The old popular tradition , however , made him a half-blood . His being the grandson of one of the Mohawk chiefs who visited England in 1710 proves nothing as to his father , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The point is not important except as hearing upon the capacity of the Indian for cultivation and improvement in the arts of civilized life ; it being notorious that very many of those Indians , at the present time , who have risen above the mass are half-breeds . Who **25;1048;TOOLONG was , does not distinctly appear . Mr. Stone conjectures ' that he may be the same person with a Mohawk Indian frequently mentioned in Sir William Johnson 's papers , as an intimate of his , by the name of Nickus Brant ; and yet he informs us that the tradition in the family of Thayendanegea corresponds with the received idea , that he derived the name of Brandt , not from his own father , but from his mother 's second husband . On the whole , little on this point is certain , except that he was born in 1742 , of a Mohawk wo* man , the daughter , perhaps , of a Sachem , and that his mother returned from a distant expedition among the Miamis and Wyandots of the Ohio , with two infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other a dau*hter commonly called Molly Brandt , whom Sir William Johnson afterwards took into his family as his wife , though probably without a formal marriage . This connection laid the foundation of the fortunes of Thayendanegea . Sir William Johnson became his patron , employed him frequently in military and civil business among the Indians , caused him to be placed at the Moor charity school in Lebanon , Connecticut , under the charge of Dr. Wheelock , and thus prepared him , by education , employments , as // sociation with the English , and his own countenance , to rise in due time to be head chief of the Mohawks . We first hear of Thayendanegea in the field , at the age of thirteen , under Sir William Johnson , at the battle of Lake George in 1753 ; and again , in the Niagara campaign in 1759 . Between this time and the year 1762 , but for how long precisely does not appear , he was at the Moor school in Lebanon . In 1762 we find him acting as interpreter , with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he accompanied an expedition against Pontiac , and the Indians of the upper lakes . During the long interval of peace which followed the conquest of Canada by the English , occasional notices occur of Thayendanegea , residing at Canajoharie , one of the castles of his tribe , and greatly esteemed by the missionaries and other English who visited the Mohawk country , for his comparative cultivation , his decent life , his adoption of christianitv , and his endeavors to civilize and convert his countrymen . He continued , also , in frequent association with Sir William Johnson and his family ; and after the death of Sir William , in 1774 , he became the secretary of Colonel Guy Johnson , the son-in-law of Sir William , and his successor in the post of English superintendent of the Indians of New York . When the troubles between Great Britain and the Colonies began , and the spirit of resistance to the measures of the mother country spread from Massachusetts to the other Colonies , the Whigs of western New York found themselves in a peculiar trying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of them were many loyalists , some of whom , the Johusons especially , possessed great influence . Sir William had enjoyed much personal popularity as well as official power . his son , Sir John Johnson , his sons-in-law , Colonel Guy Johnson and Colonel Daniel Claus , had succeeded to his estates , his rank , and his official employments ; for while Guy Johnson was made Indian agent , Sir John obtained his father 's commission of brigadier-general of the militia* They were actively supported by the Butlers , another family of great wealth and influence in their neighbourhood . Both parties , whigs and loyalists , looked with anxiety to the future movements of the Indians , and endeavoured to gain their good will . The Oneidas and Tuscaroras , it soon appeared , were favorably disposed towards the Colonies , under the influence of their celebrated missionary , Mr. Kirkland ; or at least would not take up arms in behalf of England . But the Mohawks , part of which tribe lived in Canada , the Cayugas , and many others of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain . Among the circumstances , which led to this , the public relation of the Johusons to the Indi*-ans , and the habitual deference they had thus acquired , was undoubtedly the principal one ; but another was the alliance of tho // family with the Mohawks , through Molly Brandt , the wife of Sir William-in all but the forms of law  --  and through her brother , Thayendane*ea . Aided by the latter , Colonel Johnson iatrigued continually with the Indians , in anticipation of war , and when the war commenced , he , with Colonel John Butler , his son Walter N. Butler , and Thayendanegea , retired into Canada to raise forces . Thayendanegea assisted at several Indian councils in the course of this period ; and finally , at a council held in Lontreal , in July , 1775 , at which Generals Carleton and Haldimand were present , he , at their instigation , together with a large number of chiefs and warriors who accompanied him , enlisted in good earnest in the war against the Colonies . We pause a moment only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endeavour of the Continental Congress , as it was of the United States at a subsequent period , that neither English nor Americans should enlist the Indians in their contests . Congress exhorted the Indians to stand neuter , and to continue their ordinary pursuits , without engaging for , or against , either party . This humane purpose was defeated by England , who set the example of arousing the savages against us ; and notwithstanding numerous efforts on our part to l ) produce a different state of things , has persisted from that day to this in her unhallowed policy , to the destruction of the Indians themselves , and the perpetual dishonor of the English name . Previously to actually taking the field , however , Thayendanegea visited England , early in the year 1776 ; hut for what precise object , does not appear . Having returned , he was present , it would seem , at the affair of the Cedars , in May , 1776 ; for though he is not mentioned by any of the old books as active in that affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of Indians engaged there , because , after the surrender of Major Sherburne , he exerted himself to aid in saving the life of Captain MeKinstry , one of the American prisoners . In the following year , Thayeadanegea led a band of Indians across the country to the Susquehannah ; and had an interview with General ilerkimer , at Unadilla ; hut , without committing any serious hostilities , drew off his men to Oswego , where Sir John Johnson , and Colonel John Butler , were concentrating a force of Indians and Tories . This was an ominous con junction . Neither the officers nor the men of the regular British army , had , in general , any inducement to carry on the contest otherwise than according to the ordinary usages of war . But the Indians employed by them were Indians still-savages , in spirit and conduct . And the refugee English , compelled to abandon their property and their homes , in consequence of their loyalty or their attachment to Great Britain , many of them irritated by insults as well // as by losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passions of men seeking for personal vengeance . The forces at Oswego were destined to advance upon the Mohaxvk country , under Colonel St. Leger , simultaneously witl. * the march of General Burgoyne , by Lake Champlain , and to form a junction with the latter at Albany . Scouting parties of the Indians ) receded St. Leger . The Six Nations were now divided , and in arms , some for one party , and some for the other , and the great council fire in the Onondaga country was extinguishe ( l . St. Leger laid siege to Fort Schuyler . The Provincials , upon learning the approach of the Royalists , prepared to meet them ; and the consequence was the battle of Oriskany , fought on the sixth of August , 1777 , in which , after a desperate engagement , the Provincials remained masters of the field , though with the loss of their brave commander , General 1-lerkimer , and many of his followers . Thayendanegea commanded the Moha*vk and other British Indians in this battle , and they suffered severely . Colonel St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , for several weeks , when he was obliged , by intelligence of the alleged advance of a large body of troops , under General Arnold , to retreat from before Fort Schuyler , and endeavour to join the main army by another route . While the defeat and surren ( ler of General Burgoyne , in October , broke the power of the British on this side of the St. Lawrence and the lakes , and freed the country from hostile expeditions on a great scale , the inhabitants suffered the more from the partisan incursions of the vindictive Indians and Tories . During the residue of the war , Thayendanegea and his Indians , often , in conjunction with the Butlers , were , year after year , perpetually engaged in harassin* the western settlements of New York and Pennsylvania . What Mr. Stone says of his operations in 1778 , will apply to the subsequent years . " Wherever a blow could be struck to any advantage , Joseph Brandt was sure to be there . Frequently , moreover , were there instances in which individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disappeared , without any knowledge on the part of those who were left , that an enemy had been near them . The smoking ruins of their dwellings , the charred bones of the dead , were the only testimonials of the cause of the catastrophe , until the return of a captive , or the disclosures of some prisoner taken from the foe , furnished more definite information . " Mr. Stone adds : " But there is no good evidence that Brandt was himself a participator in secret murders , or attacks upon isolated individuals or families . " This remark is a singular sequel to " the charred honest ' and " the smoking ruins , " and the other evidences of midnight massacre , just before described . If Thayendanegea is to have all the honors of being " The Great Captain of the Six Nations , " and if , in that capacity , he for years conducted a // war of massacre , private vengeance , and midnight pillage , it avails little to show that here and there , he rescued a prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abstain from condemning him , and wait until women and children , massacred in their beds , or burnt in the conflagration of their dwellings , shall arise from the grave to bear witness against their murderers , and to give " good evidence that Brandt was himself a participator . " Our author himself says : " Wherever a blow could be struck to any advantage , Joseph Brandt was sure to he there . " Very well . When did his Mohawks ever strike any blow voluntarily except from ambush , or in midnight surprises , with peaceful cultivators , and helpless women massacred or made captive , and burning hamlets and villages to mark the presence of the savage foe ? Thayendanegea , we cheerfully admit , was superior to the rest of his tribe in cultivation , and in civilized tastes and tendencies , and various well authenticated instances of his humanity are adduced by Mr. Stone ; hut it is impossible for the " Captain of the Six Nations , " their warchief in all the operations of the war , to shake from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them in New York and Pennsylvania . y4re have not space to go over the particulars of all these frontier outrages , or do more , for the most part , than simply to enumerate them , dwelling only on two or three of the most important . Early in 1778 , Thayendanegea burned and wasted the settlement of Springfield , at the head of the Otsego Lake . In July of the same year , Colonel John Butler led a band of Tories and Indians against the settlements in the Valley of Wyo ' - ming , beat the Provincial troops who opposed him , reduced Fort Wyoming , and , regardless of the articles of capitulation with the garrison , by which he stipulated to leave the settlers and their property unmolested , suffered the valley to be laid waste , the dwellings to be destroyed by fire , and the inhabitants , men , women , and children , such as escaped massacre , to be led into captivity , or driven off to perish miserably in the woods or swamps . This is the fearful tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one of the most infamous and daring deeds of horder warfare on record . It is the generally received account , in all the books of history , British and American , that flrandt was associated in this affair with Colonel Butler , the ostensible leader of the expedition . This , however , Mr. Stone strenuously denies , affirming that " he was many miles distant at the tme , " in proof of which , he refers to the declaration of Thayendanegea himself , and " the uniform testimony of the British officers engaged in that expedition . " We should have been glad to see this matter a little more fully explained . Where was Thayendanegea at the time ? How engaged ? Who // are the British officers referred to by Mr. Stone , as the compurgators of Brandt ? Only one of them , a Mr. Frey , is mentioned by name . John Brandt , a son of Joseph , visited England in 1S22 , and with honorable filial piety strove , in correspondence with Mr. Campbell , to vindicate the memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the poem of Gertrude of Wyoming had disseminated wherever the English language is read . It is singular that neither the letter of John Brant , nor the documents he laid before Mr. Campbell , are given to us . We discover their unsatisfactory nature from Mr. Campbell 's reply . He says : " I rose from perusing the papers you submitted to me , certainly with an altered impression of his ( Thayendanegea 's ) character . The evidence afforded induces me to believe that he oftei* strove to mitigate the cruelty of Indian warfare . Lastly , yen affirm that he was not within many miles of the spot where the battle which decided the fate of Wyoming took place , and , from yonr offer of reference to living witnesses , I can not but admit the assertion . " We ask again , how many miles off was he when the battle - was fought ? Where was he AFTER the battle was fought , the next and the following days , when the Indians and Tories ravaged the valley , and drove the inhabitants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses " of his absence from the battle , even ? When Gordon , Ramsay , Belsham , Adolphus , and , as Mr. Stone candidly admits , " every written history of this battle extant , not even excepting the last revised edition of the Life of Washington by Chief Justice Marshall ; " when all these 01 ( 1 accounts concur in representing Brandt to have accompanied this expedition , the evidence should be very full , and very circumstantial , to establish the contrary " in the face of every historical authority . " We confess to be not very well satisfied as to the whereabout and the occupation of the Mohawk chief , the man always present " wherever a blow could be struck to advantage , " on this occasion , when his Indians were reaping such a plentiful harvest of blood and plunder among the blazing rafters of Wyoming . We need to see more evidence on the subject . However this may be , we find Thayendanegea , in the course of the same summer , actively engaged in ravaging the Mohawk valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the populous settlements of German Flats , though the inhabitants , receiving timely warning , fled before him , and took refuge in Forts Dayton and Herkimer . And in November of the same year , a party of Indians and rrories , led by Brandt and by Walter N. Butler , the son of Colonel John Butler , fell upon the settlement of Cherry Valley , and repeated , point for point , the tragedy of Wyoming . The village was burnt to the ground , whole families massacred in cold blood , and all who survived the tomahawk and the brand , were // made captive , though most of the women and children were afterwards released . There is evidence that Brandt saved one woman 's Isfe in the course of the affair ; but whether he or Butler is to be held chiefly accountable for the barbarities perpetrated by the Indians , was disputed between them . Butler 's friends ascribed them to Brandt . Butler himself said , in a letter to General Schuyler , I have done every thing in my power to restrain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or killing the prisoners who fell into our hands . I look upon it beneath the character of a soldier to wage a war with women and children . ' Nay , in another letter , addressed to General Clinton , he undertakes to say that both he , and his father , Colonel John Butler , were innocent of the commission of any cruelties , either at Wyoming , or Cherry Valley . The truth is , the employment of Indians in the war at all , was the fundamental wrong , for which the English Government is responsible to past and future generations . We may concede , for the argument 's sake , that Brandt was as well disposed as the Butlers , Johasons , arid other refugees , his associates ; and that is conceding much ; for , in addition to being a refugee loyalist equally with them , he was an Indian , having the passions and sentiments of an Indian , how much soever humanized by long association with the English . And Mr. Stone himself relates that , in after life , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by society , Thayendanegea justified and defended the Indian usages of warfare . Why then seek to free him from responsibility for outrages which he led on the Indians to perform , and which he thought it right to perform ? To illustrate this , we shall give the next of Thayendanegea 's achievements in Mr. Stone 's own words . The village of Minisink being left without protection , except by its own people , Captain Brandt determined to make a descent upon it , for the purpose of taking both plunder and prisoners . Accordingly , on the twentieth of July , ( 1779 , ) or rather during , the night of the nineteenth , the crafty Mohawk stole upon the slumbermg town , &amp;c . Such was the silence of their approach , that several houses were already in flames u/rem the inhabitants awoke to their situation . Thus surprised , and wholly unprepared , all who could escape fled in consternation , leaving the invaders to riot upon the spoil , &amp;c . " This attack upon , and destruction of , Minisink , professedly planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in principle , from the affairs of Wyoming and Cherry Valley . It was followed , a few days afterwards , by a battle between the Indians and a party if militia from Goshen , in which the latter were defeated and nearly all killed , many in the fight , and many others in cold blood after it was over . Brandt tomahawked Colonel Wisner , one of the prisoners , with his own hand , for the purpose , as he himself has since explained it , of putting the wounded officer out of pain ; which our author des . // scribes as " a savage exhibition of humanity . " We think it was a very savage way of manifesting benevolence . In the same year , Thayendanegea was in the battle of Newtown , where General Sullivan defeated the British and their Indian allies , commanded by the Butlers and the Johnsons . The ravages of the Indians continued in 1780 . Thayendanegea himself fell upon , and destroyed , the village of Canajoharie ; and later in the year accompanied Sir John Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we sicken of all the horrors of savage rapacity and vengeance . From their winter-quarters at Niagara and Oswego , Brandt and his Indians , and the Tories , their worthy companions , continued their course of incursions into the back settlements of New York , burning , pillaging , and slaying , until the depopulation of the country , or their own losses , stayed their hands , and the approach of peace put an end , in that quarter , to their bloody vocation . When the treaty of peace came out , the Mohawks , and other Indian allies of Great Britain , were disappointed to find that it contained no stipulation in their behalf . England had used them for her benefit , not for theirs . " Notwithstanding their constancy , their valor , the readiness with which they had spilt their blood , and the distinguished services of their great captain , Thayendanegea , " - that is , to say , notwithstanding the alacrity with which , at the instigation and under the orders of Great Britain , they had , for eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and midnight confiagration ,  --  notwithstanding " the distinguished services ! " of Thayendanegea , as the " great captains ' of a baud of outlaws and assassins ,  --  they discovered , as it was right they should , that they must either abandon their old homes , or remain at the mercy of the people whose habitations and kinsfolk they had plundered and murdered . Of course , the Mohawks gladly accepted permission to occupy a tract of country on the Grand River of Lake Erie , ready to be again employed by England , when occasion should arrive , in savage inroads , against the frontier settlements of the United States . This concession of land was originally made by General Haldimand , immediately after the conclusion of the war . Brandt and his people contended that it was a grant in fee , and that the Mohawks were to be treated not only as the owners of the soil , but as an independent nation . This , of course , the Canadian Government could not , and did not , allow ; it having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider the Indians as dependent tribes subject to their power , and as holding only a possessory use in the soil . Any other view of the subject would have been fatal to the peace and sovereignty of the country . But while England adhered to this policy in Canada , as she had always done in the // other colonies before their separation , she spared no exertion to spirit on the Indians of the United States , especially those Indians of the Six Nations who remained in New York , and the various Indians of the northwest , to insist on having all the country northwest of the river Ohio yielded up to them in full sovereignty by the United States . To accomplish this object , Great Britain , notwithstanding the treaty of peace , retained the frontier posts along the St. Lawrence , and the lakes , and thus had ample facilities to inflame the hostility of the Indians ; and from the close of the revolutionary war , until Wayne 's treaty of Greenville , a period of ten years , her intria nes among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liarmand 's defeat , that of St. Clair , and Wayne 's victory , are the great events which mark that sorrowful period . In the numerous councils of the confederated hostile Indians , Thayendanegea was generally present , sometimes the advocate of peace , at others of war , but contributing efficiently to keep alive the agitation of the Indians . In 1792 , he visited Philadelphia , invited by our Government to a council there , in the hope that he might be persuaded to cease altogcther from hostility to the United States , and even to quit the service of Great Britain . He was an object of curiosity and interest to our people , on his journey to the seat of Government , like Blackhawk , Oseola , and other Indians , in proportion to the injury they have done us ; but the settlers in the Mohawk Valley could not so soon forget the wrongs they had suffered at his hands ; and were with great difficulty withheld from taking his life . He rejected the overtures of our Government , except so far as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though supposed , or professing , to be friendly to peace , he , and his Mohaxvks , it now appears on the testimony of his family , were actually in the field at the battle of the Miamis ; or , as Mr. Stone says , " one of the master spirits against whom he ( St. Clair ) contended , and by whom he was signally defeated , was none other than Joseph Brandt . " Indeed , his favorite object , for which , in part , he visited England in 1785 , had been to combine nfl the northwestern Indians in a permanent confederacy , under the protection of the English Government . We consider the facts and documents in relation to this period of our history , as among the most important parts of this work . It contains an abundance of authentic original evidence , of the most conclusive character , in illustration of the fact , so dishonorable to her , that England was secretly at the bottom of the Indian wars of that period . We have not space , as we wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Major Matthews , Sir John Johnson , and other Canadian officers , bearing on this subject . We will adduce one thing only , as an example . In the spring of 1794 , Governor Clinton , of New York , transmitted to GeneralWashing*. // ton , an alleged speech of Lord Dorchester to the Indians , manifestly hostile to the United States , and totally incompatible with the neutral relations of the two nations . Chief Justice Marshall , in the Life of Washington , denies the authenticity of this speech ; and Mr. Sparks seems to follow his opinion . Mr. Stone settles the question . Lie bad in his possession , among the papers entrusted to him by Brandt 's family , a certified manuscript copy of the speech , preserved by Brandt himself . Other facts of tile same class , which his work contains , are invaluable , in their bearing upon our past and present relations with Great Britain . With the defeat of the Indians by General Wayne , and the treaty of Greenville , the military career of Thayendanegea terminated . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exceptin a second visit to the United States. , in which , as before , he was pursued by the vengeance of those who had suffered in the Revolution by his followers , and narrowly escaped being the victim of their matured and well founded hatred . In Canada , he laboured for the civilization and improvement of his people ; and his efforts to establish among them the institutions of religion deserve commendation . He himself procured much of the ordinary cultivation and acquirement belonging to civilized life , as evinced by his speeches , and by his letters . But notwithstanding his endeavours to civilize his people , nay , partly in consequence of his plans to introduce white settlers among them , he encountered some difficulties and complaints on their part . He was accused of peculation ; but apparently without good cause . At one time his opponents succeeded , under the guidance and advice of the Seneca Chief , Red Jacket , in having him ( leposed from the chieftainship , by a council of the Six Nations . But he was afterwards restored at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he seems to have retained , and deservedly , the respect of the Indians and Canadians , until the end of his life . A few years before his death , Thayendanegea removed his own residence to the head of Lake Ontario , and died there in 1807 , at the age of sixty-four , his third wife , Catharine Brandt , surviving him . In 1795 , his eldest son , Isaac , a man of reckless and dissolute life , struck at his father in a fit of intoxication , and in the sudden heat of the affray Brandt drew his knife , and gave the son a blo*v on the head , of which he died . Though Brandt was acquitted , by the public opinion of the English , as well as of the Mohawks , of the guilt of premeditated murder , in this affair , yet the circumstances were characteristic of the spirit and the impulses of the Indian race . Other children survived him ; and his youngest son , John Brandt , the correspondent of Mr. Campbell , was designated by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed his father as chieftain of the Mohawks . John I$randt was a // well educated man , served actively in the war of 1812 , in company with others of his family and tribe , and in 1832 was elected a member of the Parliament of Upper Canada . His election was disputed by his competitor , and set aside on the ground that many of the electors who held lands in the Mohawk country , under Indian leases , were not freeholders . And in the same year he died of the cholera , leaving the succession to an infant son of his sister , Mrs. Kerr . Having , in the course of this Article , expressed our opinion of some of the leading traits in the life and conduct of Thayendanegea , we have a few words of general explanation to add . He was , undoubtedly , a person of very considerable natural abilities , cultivated by education and circumstances , superior to the rest of his tribe in all respects , a sagacious and brave partisan officer , a man of general intelligence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which usually belong to those of his race , and possessed of many of the qualities which distinguish the civilized man . That he was Indian still , in the basis of his character , and that in those military events of the revolutionary times , which alone have given him celebrity , he carried on war as an Indian , we fully believe ; and to a mere partisan officer , the captain of a band of savabes , though in general spirit , or individual cases , he shewed himself more merciful than his followers , we can not concede the honors of a great man or a hero , any more than to Sir John Johnson , John Butler , or Walter N. Butler , the companions of his marauding expeditions in New York and Pennsylvania . If we regard him as an Indian , and compare him with such men as Pontiac or Tecumseh , we must place him on a lower scale of native intellectual eminence . If we compare him with English or Americans , we can not perceive any cause to elevate him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same subordinate rank . The highsounding names of chief , noble , and king , which are so liberally applied to the head men among the North American Indians , lead to most erroneous conceptions of the true relations of things . In 1763 , the Mohawks were computed to muster one hundred and sixty warriors ; in 1776 , three hundred warriors , representing at most , one thousand , or fifteen hundred souls . We can readily estimate the political weight of the selectmen , or even the chief citizens , of a little village of fifteen hundred souls of our own race or people ; and if he were a good man in his station we should honor him as such , and not otherwise . And why think better of the head man of a little Mohawk village or tribe ? Again-if that chief citizen of one of our own towns rose to the rank of colonel of a regiment of six hundred , eight hundred , or one thousand men , and performed good service in that capacity according to his lights for eight years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ) justice to the // character and services of Thayendanegen , to place the latter on the same level with the former . We comprehend why an Indian is , by those unaccustomed to the sight , sought after as a spectacle , a rarity , a show ; but when we sit down calmly to estimate the character of a man , we must measure him by the general standard of humanity , and not allow ourselves to fail into the error of imagining , that because he is of Indian blood , in part or in whole , he is therefore wiser or greater , than the men of our own nobler Anglo-Norman race . The general presumption is the reverse always . And instead of wondering that Thayendanegea , brought up from boyhood under the eye and favor of Sir William Johnson , and habitually associated with Englishmen for so many years , should have acquired a tincture of the knowledge and tastes of civilization , the marvel would have been if he had failed to acquire it , as the marvel now is , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impervious to all the elevating influences of christianity , and of the European arts and mind . Doubtless the Indians have suffered in contact with us ; but they have suffered , because of their own inherent vices of character and condition , such as their obstinate idleness and apathy , and their want of , and revulsion from all political institutions ,  --  infinitely the rather than by reason of any fault of ours . It is our misfortune , quite as well as theirs , that they cling so tenaciously to their native degradation . In conclusion , we heartily recommend this work to the patronage of the reading public , as replete with entertainment and instruction , and entitled to a place in every well stored library.
