CHARACTERS . Ganem . Musif . Spahis , &c.; Zamira . Spirit of the Lake . Main text Scene Scene .  --  A romantic Landscape  --  a Lake in the distance  --  Zamira discovered . ZAMIRA . Zamira Why comes he not ? I long have tarried By this silv'ry lake , upon whose verdant banks We have oft wander 'd at the moonlight hour ; And I have listen 'd for the gentle song , Which he is wont to chaunt when his light boat Glides swiftly thro ' the sleeping waters , like A fairy barque , seen in midsummer dreams ; And yet he comes not . Ah ! if his vows are false , And he to other maidens should incline , And so forget his faithful , fond Zamira , No longer then , will beam upon her brow , The smiles which he so oft hath gaz 'd upon , And call 'd them , moonbeams on a modest lily . Hark ! do I hear his oar ? hush ! hush ! ye winds , That not a sound may mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ' t is the summer trees , Waving and rustling , as the evening gales Pass lightly through their branches . Bright Spirit ! Who oft has cheer 'd us in our saddest hours , With happy omens of futurity , Come from thine unseen dwelling ! whether beneath The placid waters of this quiet lake , Or , in the greenwood , that is smiling near ; Tell me , where tarries Ganem , that he comes not To his Zamira , at the promis 'd hour ? Come , gentle Spirit ! at my bidding come , To give new hope , or seal my woe at once . The Spirit of the Lake appears . SPIRIT . Spirit of the Lake Maiden , at whose call I come . From my bright and viewless home ; Maid of ever blooming cheek , List the warning , that I speak . When in yonder starry skies , The moon shall brilliantly arise ; Passing gales shall bear along To thine ears , thy lover 's song . Other maids , can win him not , Plighted vows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And weep in woe , ere joy in weal . The Spirit disappears . ZAMIRA . Zamira And he will come again ! Oh ! thou bright queen Of yonder starry arch , why dost thou stay From thy celestial station ? each moment Of thine absence , seems an age of sorrow . The moon rises . Ah ! now art thou rising , bright herald Of my fond love 's coming ! sweet harbinger Of his fidelity ! how beautiful thou art ! Who can marvel , that all lovers love thee ! Thy beams shed peacefulness , thy presence joy ; Thou art the very light of love , the orb Of happiness and sweet serenity . But soft , methinks I hear his distant song Stealing upon the breeze which crisps the lake , Like the soft breathings of love 's gentle lute , Borne on the southern gale , from orange groves . Oh ! this sweet silence ! which thus lets me feed My raptur 'd ear with sounds so heavenly , That the imagination well might deem , An Angel hover 'd warbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore with Ganem , Ganem who sings the following Song . My love ! each beauteous flower that springs , Is fair  --  but none so fair as thee ; Oh ! list the lay thy lover sings , As swiftly o'er the summer sea , Glides his light barque to thee love , Glides his light barque to thee . In climes afar , in court or bower , Where beauty dwells and splendours shine ; I saw none like my mountain flower , No eye so bright  --  no form like thine , To win a heart like mine , love , To win a heart like mine . Then swiftly o'er the placid tide , Like the wing 'd fowl my barque shall flee ; My mountain maid ! my promis 'd bride ! Unchang 'd and true , I come to thee , To find thee so , to me love , To find thee so , to me . Ganem springs from the boat and embracing Zamira . Oh ! dear one  --  can the honey bee , that lights On ev'ry flower , to sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Zamira ! ZAMIRA . Zamira Welcome ! more welcome than the holy dew , Which cools the fever 'd earth , art thou my love ! Oh ! Ganem , each moment of their absence Have I counted  --  Why didst thou tarry so ? A thousand fears , have shook my anxious soul  --  A thousand fancies , tortured my weak mind ; Woman that loves as I do , ever fears In times of peril , when her love is absent . GANEM . Ganem I know not how it is , when most we wish That Time should swiftly fly , be seems to lag , And move , as tho ' his wings were made of lead . But now I 'm here to listen to thy song , More sweet than that which yonder Bulbul sings ; Nightingale sings . Hush ! hush vain bird , thy plaintive warblings , My love will teach thee sweeter notes than those . ZAMIRA . Zamira I can not sing  --  my song was ever gay ; But sadness now is stealing over me , And I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy tidings . Oh ! tell me , Ganem , Has ill befallen thee ? or dost aught dread ? Thou art not friendly to the Sultan , love , A thousand dark suspicions crowd my mind , And dread forebodings , fill my soul with fear . GANEM Ganem aside . She has not heard , no babbler sure , has told Of the conspiracy . ZAMIRA . Zamira catching the last word . Conspiracy ? Oh ! then , indeed , the spirit truly spoke ; And I shall weep in woe , ere joy in weal . Ganem , thou know'st my soul is knit with thine , A simple mountain girl ' t is true , whose cot Would be a palace , were it shar 'd with thee : The flowers that bloom around , brighter than gems , Which sparkle in the court , where thou would'st take me . Ah ! leave me not , to raise thy hostile arm Against thy countrymen ; let no civil war , Make those whose blood perchance flows in thy veins , Widows or wiveless , childless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindred Rush on kindred , in hot war  --  abandon it , Oh ! as you love me Ganem , abandon it . GANEM . Ganem Is it not better love , that I should strive To rid my country of a tyrant 's reign , And make all free as nature hath ordain 'd ? ZAMIRA . Zamira No  --  not at such cost  --  the peril is too great . Ha ! what light streams suddenly across the lake ? A boat with armed men , is rowing hither ; What mean they Ganem ? are they friends or foes ? A boat is seen approaching the shore . GANEM . Ganem I know not  --  I would they sped elsewhere , We can not be betray 'd ; who would betray ? Sadi , would not ; or Agib , or Achmet . Who then can be the traitor ? there 's Hassan , He is faithful  --  is't Musif ? that man , I like him not  --  there is a devil in his eye , A double glance , I ever doubted ; ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Spahis ! Musif is there  --  the villain points to me ! Ho ! there , the boat !  --  fool ! fool ! I am alone ! He rushes towards his boat as the Spahis , headed by Musif , land and seize him . ZAMIRA . Zamira Hold  --  are ye men ? ye shall not drag him hence ! Tear from the dove her mate , will she not die ? Ganem , dear Ganem  --  let them not part us thus . GANEM . Ganem My poor Zamira  --  one word , one word , to her . MUSIF . Musif Now , Spahis , now  --  heed not the woman 's shrieks , Not yet his girlish whining  --  on with him ! On with the sullen traitor to his doom . GANEM . Ganem Struggling with the guards . Oh ! that I had brave Achmet at my side , Or e'en a sabre in this single hand , Your triumph slaves , should not be easy won ; And to the hell he merits , yon false wretch , Would I in justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I hold no parlance , with a maniac ! Ganem is forced into the boat which pushes off , Zamira watching the action with intense anxiety . ZAMIRA . Zamira Protect and shield him  --  generous Allah ! GANEM . Ganem As the guards attempt to chain him . No  --  by Mahomet , no ! not for these limbs ! I am no felon , for a felon 's chains . Off villain , off ! Ah ! Providence is kind . Succeeds in drawing his dagger , with which he stabs Musif . Drink deep  --  drink deep , it is a traitor 's blood . Now then , for liberty or death ! Leaps into the lake and swims towards the shore . ZAMIRA . Zamira For life , love ! How his stout arm divides the glassy waters ! Kind Heaven , give him strength to ' scape his foes . Ah ! they pursue him  --  Oh ! my kind spirit , Weave some magic spell , to make all motionless , Save him whose life , hangs on this fearful crisis . The boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and falls exhausted at the feet of Zamira . GANEM . Ganem Safe ! and near thee  --  my own  --  my kind Zamira ! As the boat is again near the shore  --  a mist rises and intercepts its approach , the Spirit of the Lake appears . SPIRIT . Spirit of the Lake Maiden rest , thy woes are over Safe from danger , is thy lover ; Let no idle fears alarm thee , Spells are wrought , and none can harm thee ; O'er thy future life , will we Watch , protecting faithfully . The Spirit placing Zamira 's hand in Ganem 's , continues . By the dangers now past , And the fears that are fleeing ; By the spells that are cast , By unseen , yet still seeing ! By the Spirits that dwell , where no mortal eye reaches , By the fond pray'r of love , which ne'er vainly beseeches ! In the reign of the stars and the empress of night , Like thy souls long since wedded , thy hands I unite . The Spirit disappears , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage . ZAMIRA . Zamira See , see my Ganem , yonder is my home , My own sweet native cottage ! there my love , Thinking no more of sorrows that are past , But as of some sad dream , which ages Can not wipe from faithful memory , We cheerily will see the stream of life , Flow calmly on , unruffled by a care . GANEM . Ganem My bright Peri ! thy words , are like the strains That Angels warble unto fainting souls , Assuring them of Paradise ! Yon cot , Which seemingly some fairy hand has rear 'd , And love has consecrated , to love Shall be devoted . My sweet Zamira ! There will thy Ganem pass his happy life And think of nothing , but his bliss and thee ! SONG . Air .  --  The Soldier 's Tear . She saw her flowers wither , And beheld her hopes decay ; And all their bright creations , Like shadows pass away : But she gaz 'd on him , whose smile Like the summer 's sun could cheer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of peace , was there . But she saw no more that smile Of joy upon his brow ; And the breast which oft had pillow 'd her , No home of peace was now ; For cold the heart which beat within , To its first love had grown ; And affection 's smiles which cheer 'd her once , With hope 's young dreams had flown . There is no lustre in her eyes , No bloom upon her cheek ; She weeps not , speaks not , yet her sighs , The soul 's despair , bespeak , She 's fading like a summer plant , Forever from this earth ; To dwell where sorrow ne'er exists , Where Angels have their birth .
