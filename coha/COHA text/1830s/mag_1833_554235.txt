txt Ov the many great names which adorn our country 's histo* ry , it would he difficult to point to one more eminent for intellectual dignity or virtue , than that of the late Chief Justice Jay . Age and infirmity had long detained him in that retirement , to which he was induced by inclination to withdraw in the fullness of his fame and honors ; but the admiration of the wise and the affection of the good went with him there ; nor can we name a fact more honorable to our countrymen , than that the stern political hostility of which he was at times the object had so effectually and so long ago subsided , that not a trace of it remained to dim the brightness of his declining years ; that all combined to render him the homage due to eminent ability and worth ; that the veneration which accompanied him while living , was expressed with solemn and impressive earnestness , when he was called to join those fellow laborers in the cause of freedom , of whom nearly all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that some permanent memorial should be raised in honor of his name ; nor is the monument of the father less imposing to the moral eye , because it is erected by the son . In this instance , it does equal honor to the hand that reared it , and to him , to perpetuate whose memory it was built . The student of our political history will find much in these volumes to invite his attention , and reward his labor . If the feelings of the writer have led him occasionally to express opinions in which many1will find it impossible to concur , they are at least maintained with manliness and candor ; but with respect to the general merits and public services of the subject of his work , there is no room for controversy ; on this point , the verdict of enlightened public sentiment has already been pronounced , with a fullness and decision , alike emphatic and unchangeable . We think w* can not gratify our readers more , than by placing before tiiem a brief sketch of the most important incidents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extracts from these volumer as may be fitted to illustrate them , without entering into the discussion // of any controverted topics , in which we have neither space nor inclination at present to engage . Mr. Jay was born in the city of New York , on the 12th of December , 1745 . His ancestors were of the number of those Protestants , who were driven from France on the occasion of the revocation of the edict of Nantz , and bore their full share in the sufferings of that disastrous time . His grandfather , a man of sense and enterprise , established his permanent residence in this country , to which he originally fled as a place of refuge . The character of his parents did much to inspire in Mr. Jay those principles of generous and manly action , of which he subsequently gave so memorable an example . His father was a man of strong intellect , stern principle , and thorough knowledge of mankind ; and graceful manners were finely blended with taste and religious feeling in his mother . Both gave as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a numerous family would allow ; and though no remarkable incidents of his early life are at this day remembered , it is known that his character and progress gratified their pride , and fulfilled their warmest expectations . At the age of fourteen , he entered King 's , now Columbia College , over which Dr. Samuel Johnson presided at the time with dignity and honor . This eminent person appears to have formed a strong attachment to his pupil , but retired from the institution before the close of Mr. Jay 's collegiate term . The latter was afterwards banished from the college for a time in consequence of an occurrence , which his biographer relates without comment . Several of the students were guilty of some outrage , in the presence of Mr. Jay , who was , however , not concerned in it ; but when an enquiry was instituted in order to discover the offenders , Mr. Jay , though he disclaimed any share in the transaction , refused to reveal the names of those who had , on the ground that he was not obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was by this refusal that his sentence was incurred ; but he returned soon after , and left the institution at the expiration of the usual term , with its highest honors . Immediately after leaving college , Mr. Jay commenced the st**dy of the law in the office of Mr. Kissam , a distinguished adv*cate in the city of New York , whose confidence he soon acqurzed by his industry and talent . In 1768 , he was admitted as a nember of the bar , and entered at once upon an extensive course of profitable practice . His reputation was soon // established for eminent attainments , and forensic power ; but the controversy between Great Britain and the Colonies was now drawing to a crisis : and , like many other of the young and ardent spirits of the time , he did not hesitate to relinquish his professional career to enter upon the broader field of public labor , in which he soon acquired abundant honor to himself , and advantage to his country . The passage of the Boston Port Bill , in 17 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures of resistance to the aggressions of the British Gov .. emnient . When the intelligence of this measure was received in New York , a meeting was at once assembled , to deliberate respecting the course which ought to be pursued ; and a committee was appointed , of which Mr. Jay was a member , to correspond with other committees of the sister Colonies on this momentous subject . One of the letters addressed by this committee to another which had been appointed in Boston , suggests the propriety of an immediate convention of delegates from all the Colonies : the authorship of this letter is attributed to Mr. Jay . A recommendation of substantially the same character bad been made by the House of Burgesses of Vir-. ginia a few days earlier , but the intelligence of their proceedings could not have been received in New York , when the letter in question was prepared . In both instances , however , it is probable that the suggestion was rather an expression of the prevailing sentitnent , than an original one : it was received with universal approbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jay was associated with other distinguished individuals as a representative of his native city in the Continental Congress : - that remarkable assembly , whose dignity , moral energy and intellectual power will command admiration , as long as virtue shall be held in reverence by men . At the time when he took his seat in Congress , Mr. Jay had not yet reached the age of thirty , and was the youngest of its members ; but his reputation had preceded him , and his character for wisdom and practical ability was already very high . The general opinion of his power was soon confirmed by his Address to the people of Great Britain , which he was appointed to prepare by a committee , of which Governor Livingston and Richard Henry Lee , together with himself , were members . It was said of this noble composition by Mr. Jefferson , while he was yet ignorant of its author , that it was a production of the finest pen in America : ' the remark was // almost literally just : for it would be difficult to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better adapted , by the choice and illustration of its topics , to the purposes for which it was designed , or more remarkable for fervid , yet chaste and manly eloquence . It gave to Mr. Jay at once an ascendancy , which he never afterwards lost . Doubts were subsequently started respecting his claim to the honor of its authorship , by some , who chose to attribute it to Governor Livingston . That gentleman , however , with a becoming regard to truth and justice , voluntarily disclaimed it ; and Mr. Jay , in a letter addressed in 1818 to the late President Adams , has stated all the circumstances connected with its preparation . Such a vindication was not required to prove his ability to compose it ; there are many other evidences of his power . It would lead us into too great minuteness of detail , to enumerate all the services rendered by Mr. Jay to the cause of his country during the early period of the Revolution , numerous and important as they certainly were . In such a period , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page of history : in fact , where every thing is to be newly created and arranged , there are numberless details , which require the highest efforts of firmness and ability , without bringing the exhibition of these qualities very brilliantly before the public eye . The session of the first Congress terminated in six weeks after its commencement ; but provision was made , before its dissolution , for the assembling of another on the 10th of the following May . With the view of securing a more full representation of the Colony , it was recommended to the people of New York to elect delegates to a Provincial Convention , for the special purpose of appointing representatives in the Continental Congress ; and , in pursuance of this recommendation , the Convention met and reappointed Mr. Jay to his former office . In May , the Congress entered ( upon its second session , and proceeded to deliberate upon some of the most momentous questions , which men were ever summoned to decide . They saw that a contest of fearful import and of a duration which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to meet it with the confidence and energy of freemen . The first subject which demanded their attention , was the organization of the army . Some embarrassment having arisen in the nomination of the superior officers , after the appointment of Washington as chief , and it being considered // desirable that one should be selected from New Hampshire , the name of John Sullivan was suggested by Mr. Jay ; and the result fully justified the wisdom of the choice . The task of preparing addresses to the people of Jamaica , Canada and Ireland , was properly confided by Congress to the writer of that to the people of Great Britain , and was executed by him with equal vigor and ability . With the exception of a short recess , the session continued through the year . Towards its close , a singular incident occurred , which threw a gleam of unexpected light over the prospects of the patriots , and which was thus related by Mr. Jay himself to his biographer . Sometime in the course of this year , probably about the month of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Philadelphia , who was desirous of making to them an important and confidential communication . This intimation having been several times repeated , a Committee , consisting of Mr. Jay , Dr. Franklin and Mr. Jefferson , was appointed to hear what the foreigner had to say . These gentlemen agreed to meet him in one of the Committee rooms in Carpenter 's hall . At the time appointed they went there , and found already arrived an elderly lame gentleman , having the appearance of an old wounded French officer . They told him , they were authorized to receive his communication : upon which he said , that his Most Christian Majesty had heard with pleasure of the exertions made by the American Colonies in defence of their rights and privileges ; that his majesty wished them success , and would , whenever it should be necessary , manifest more openly his friendly sentiments towards them . The Committee requested to know his authority for giving these friendly assurances . He answered only by drawing his hand across his throat and saying , " Gentlemen , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what demonstrations of friendship they might expect from the king of France . " Gentlemen , " answered the foreigner , if you want arms , you shall have them ; if you want ammuniti*n , you shall have it ; if you want money , you shall have it . " The Committee observed , that these assurances were indeed important , but again desired to know by what authority they were made . " Gentlemen , " said he , repeating his former gesture , " I shall take care of my head ; " and this was the only answer they could obtain from him . He was seen in Philadelphia no more . It was the opinion of the Committee , that he was a secret agent of the French court , directed to give these indirect assurances , but in such a manner that he might be disavowed , if necessary . Mr. Jay stated , that his communications were not without their effect // upon the proceedings of thin Congress . This remark probably related to the appointment , on the 29th of November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for corresponding with the friends of America in Great Britain , Ireland , , and other parts of the world . ' In April 1776 , . while he was ; engaged in the discharge of his duties as a member of the Continental Congress , Mr. Jay was elected by the people of the city and county of New York , a delegate to the Convention of the Colony . The situation of the Colony was then such , as required the utmost prudence on the part of the friends of the patriotic ' cause : there was little unanimity of seutiment among the people , and the tories were so numerous and powerful , as to render it quite hazardous to proveke them to resistance . But some decisive measures were absolutely necessary . As the Convention was the source from which the power of the New York delegates in Congress was derived , that body assumed the right of recalling . therm at pleasure : and accordingly directed Mr. Jay , without depriving him of his seat , to return in ; order to assist them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . In obedience to this command , he took his seat in the Convention in the latter part of May , and thus lost the honor of affixing his name to the Declaration of our National Independence , the state of affairs at home being . so critical , as to render it inexpedient for him to return tO* Philadelphia in season for that purpose . The Convention was dissolved on the last day of May , after recommending to the people the convocation of a new one , invested ' with special authority to frame a constitution of government . On the 9th of July , the new Convention met , and on the very first day of the session , received from Congress a copy of the Declaration . Mr. Jay , who was again a member , immediately drafted a resolution , setting forth , that the reasons ' assigned in that memorable instrument for declaring the Independence of the Colonies were cogent and conclusive , and that the Convention were ready to sustain that measua*e at the ' hazard of their lives and fortunes . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances peculiarly solemn and impressive , and calculated to show that it was formed with a full view of the consequences which might *llow .. The state of public affairs was then rapidly growing , as it not long afterwards became , exceedingly dark , and almost desperate . The // *ttempt to conquer Canada had failed ; Washington ) with his almost disheartened army , was slowly retreating through New Jersey ; the city of New York , and other important por* tions of the Colony , lay completely at the mercy of the enemy ; but under these accumulated discouragements , the Convention *was firm and undismayed . Instead of temporizing , or listening to the proclamations with which the British General was laboring to bring them back to their allegiance , by repeated appeals to their interests or fear , the exigency of the crisis only inspired in them additional fortitude to meet it . They spoke to their fellow-citizens in a tone which , even at this hour , thrills the heart . Mr. Jay was the writer of the address in which their sentiments were embodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of that Roman band , than by quoting the paragraph , with which it closes* Do your duty like men : and be persuaded that Providence will not suffer this Western world to be involved in the horrors of slavery . Consider , that from the earliest ages of the world , religion , liberty and reason have been bending their course towards the setting sun . The holy Gospels are yet to be preached to these Western regions ; nrd wc havc the highest reason to believe , that the Almighty will not suffer slavery and the Gospel to go hand in hand . It can not , it will not be . But if there be any among us , dead to all sense of honor , and love of their country ; if deaf to all the calls of liberty , virtue and religion ; if forgetful of the magnanimity of their ancestors , and the happiness of their children : if neither the examples nor the success of other nations ,  --  the dictates of reason and of nature ,  - -  or the great duties they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have any effect upon them : if neither the injuries they have received , the prize they are contending for , the future blessings or curses of their children , the applause or the reproach of all mankind , or the happiness or misery c*nsequent upon their conduct , in this and a future state , can move them : then let them be assured , that they deserve to be slaves , and are entitled to nothing but anguish and tribulation . Let them banish from their remembrance the reputation , the freedom and the happiness they have inherited from their forefathers . Let them forget every duty , human and divine : remember not that they have children , and beware how they call to mind the justice of the Supreme Being : let them go into captivity , like the idolatrous and disobedient Jews ; and be a reproach and by-word among the nations . But we think better things of you ; we believe and VOL* XXXVII. - NO. 81. 41 // are persuaded that you will do your duty like men , and cheerfully refer your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown your efforts , all the blessings of freemen will be your reward* If you fall in the contest , you will be happy with God in Heaven . ' We have thus far exhibited Mr. Jay in the character of a stern and devoted patriot ; but , however rigid he might be in the discharge of his public duty , there was nothing of asperity or harshness in his heart . In a letter written about this time , and addressed to his friend Robert R. Livingston , afterwards Chancellor of New York , he observes ; Amid the various sources of consolation in seasons of poignant distress , which the wise have long amused themselves and the world with , the little share of experience and observation which has fallen to my lot convinces me , that resignation to the dispensations of a benevolent as well as omnipotent Being , can alone administer relief . The sensations which the first paragraph of your letter has occasioned mock the force of philosophy , and I confess , have rendered me the sport of feelings , which you can more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness , is nevertheless on certain ocea*ions amiable , arid recOuHJeIids itself by being in the train of the passions which follow virtue . But remember , my friend , that your country bleeds and calls for your exertions . The fate of those friends , whose misfortunes so justly afflict you , is linked with the common cause , and can not have a separate issue . Rouse , therefore , and after vigorously discharging the duties you owe your country , return to your peaceful shades , and supply the place of your former joys , by the reflection that they are only removed to a more kindred soil , like flowers from a thorny wilderness , by a friendly florist , under whose care they will flourish and bloom , and court your embraces forever . ' In another letter , addressed to the same Iriend a few months afterwards , he says : I sympathize most sincerely with you , in your melancholy apprehensions about your parents . I know and I can feel such a loss ; but you draw your consolation from a never-failing source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever it may happen , with that resignation to the will of Heaven , which becomes one who is satisfied both of its wisdom and goodness . If we could shake off human frailty in the hour of affliction , we should certainly think it less reasonable to lament the death of a // good man , than to complain of the absence of ' a friend , who by that absence infinitely increases his happiness : to wish them back is selfish and unworthy of true friendship , and yet we may , we must grieve , when we are not permitted to take leave , it is , I am sensible , a weakness , but I can not help suffering myself to be afflicted at this circumst'ince . I know the pleasure that the best of fathers always took in my company and conversation and when I indulge the thought , I am unhappy that by my absence I lessened any of his enjoyments . But where am I run* fling ? God bless you ! farewell . ' The Convention of New York were authorized to exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation of a constitution for the State . They accordingly took measures for the framing of such an instrument ; but , owing to the repeated inroads of the enemy , which compelled them to hold their sessions successively in seven different places , they found little leisure for the work . Mr. Jay was appointed to draft it , and performed the task with his usual ability ; he felt himself compelled , however , to omit several provisions which he deemed important , but to which the state of feeling in the Convention was unfavorable , intending afterwards to propose them as amendments . One of these was a prohibition of the continuance of domestic slavery . He was soon summoned to return home by intelligence of the fatal illness of his mother , and the opportunity of offering his amendments was lost , the Constitution having been adopted in his absence . When the judicial offices were filled , for the period intervening between the adoption of the Constitution and the organization of the Government under it , the place of Chief Justice was accepted by Mr. Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention , to exercise the powers of Governme ; i in the mean time ; of this council he was one , and his exertions were equally efficient and vigc*ous ; but , with the organization of the Government , its labors terminated , and he received anew an appointment to the first judicial office . It was provided in the new Constitution , that the Chief Justice should hold no additional office , other than that of delegate to Congress upon special occasions . Such an occasion , in the opinion of the Legislature , was presented by the secession of the people of the territory which now constitutes Vermont , from the jurisdiction of New Hampshire and New York . The Legislature of New York applied to Congress to interfere in // their behalf , and elected Mr. Jay a delegate to that body , with the privilege of still retaining his place upon the bench . In three days after his return to Congress , that assembly conferred upon him the distinguished honor of electing him their Pre- . sident . They shortly afterwards bestowed on him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter in their name to the people of the States , reminding them of the necessity of providing the funds required for the prosecution of the war , and explaining the evils incident to the depreciation of the currency , and the disordered state of public credit . In September , 1779 , he resigned the office of Chief Justice of New York , though earnestly requested to retain it , believing a correct discharge of its duties incompatible with his protracted absence ; but he continued to hold the station of President of Congress with dignity and credit , until it was deemed expedient to employ his services in a more extensive field of action . A secret article was annexed to the treaty between the United States and France , by which the privilege of acceding to that treaty was reserved to Spain ; and Congress , to whom an extension of their foreign connexions was at this time most important , resolved to send a minister plenipotentiary to Madrid , with the hope of inducing Spain to adopt this measure . The firmness and prudence of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting it , he resigned his place as President of Congress , which he had held for nine months without being absent for a single day . Mr. Gerard , the French minister , had given intimations , that if the United States would cede to Spain all claim to the Floridas , together with the exclusive right to the navigation of the Mississippi , she would undoubtedly espouse their cause ; immediately after the appointment of Mr. Jay , he urged anew upon him the same considerations , disclaiming at the same timet*any instructions from his own government upon the subject . Mr. Jay had long entertained the opinion , that neither the prospect of conquering the Floridas , nor the desire of retaining the right of navigating the Mississippi ,  --  a right , the importance of which was not then generally known ,  --  was of consequence enough to render it wise to encounter the hazard of a protracted war . He was therefore , willing to relinquish that right below our territories , and to surrender all claim to the Floridas , on condition that $pain should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant them the pecuniary aid of which they stood in need . So decided a course upon the part of the Spanish Government would be likely , in his judgment , to bring the war to an early termination ; but when that Government declared war for the accomplishment of their own objects , without reference to the interests of the United States , Mr. Jay became persuaded , that no cession of any right whatever should be made . The question was not , however , then presented ; Congress gave no indication of willingness to make the cession . Late in the year 1779 , Mr. Jay departed on his mission , in a frigate which was fitted out for the conveyance of Mr. Gerard to France . By repeated disasters , they were compelled to sail for Martinico ; whence Mr. Jay took passage in a French frigate for Cadiz , where he arrived in January , 1780 . He gave immediate notice to the Spanish Court of his arrival , and received in return an invitation to Madrid , but was given to understand , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On arriving at the capital , he found no disposition in the Spanish Cabinet to enter upon negotiations . He was , moreover , much embarrassed by an extraordinary measure on the part of Congress , which even their necessities could hardly justify . That body , immediately after Mr. Jay 's departure , had ordered that bills to the amount of five hundred thousand dollars , payable six months after sight , should be drawn upon him . The only reason assigned for this singular proceeding , was the hope that he might procure a subsidy from Spain , before the time of payment should arrive . Whatever may have been the motive of Congress in adopting such a measure , it placed Mr. Jay in a position , equally disagreeable and delicate : the bills were soon presented , and he was reduced to the necessity of soliciting the Spanish minister to provide him with the means of paying them , as they were successively brought in . The minister neither promised ncW refused to furnish these means , but offered to advance to him the whole amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with vessels of war of equal value , a proposal which was at once rejected ; it being urged , with some reason , that a State entirely destitute of money would be somewhat at a loss to find the means of building vessels . Mr. Jay was next given to understand , that the claim of the United States to the navigation of the Mississippi was the only obstacle to the conclusion of a treaty : but this , in conformity with his instructions , he // refused to surrender . Bills to the amount of thirteen thousand dollars had before this been accepted with the assent of the Spanish minister , but Mr. Jay was now informed , that no more advances would be made . it was not long before he received an assurance , that if the United States could borrow $ 150.000 , the king of Spain would guaranty the repayment of that sum in three years . No such loan could be effected : and Mr. Jay came at length to the resolution to accept all the bills that might be presented , on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thus accepted them to the amount of $ 50.000 ; and , in the course of a few months , the Spanish Court agreed to pay them , as they should become due , to the amount of $ 150.000 . Still , no progress whatever was made in the projected negotiation . in the following February , Congress resolved to instruct Mr. Jay to insist no longer on retaining the right of navigation of the Mississippi ; and , under these instructions , he renewed his attempts to conclude a treaty , but with no better success than before . In the mean time , his acceptances had far exceeded the amount which Spain had promised to provide , and he was compelled to protest the bills which still remained unpaid . Fortunately , he received a few days afterwards from Dr. Franklin permission to draw on him for the requisite amount , and in May , 1781 , he was invited to proceed to Paris to assist in conducting the negotiations for peace , which were about to be opened there . This summons was obeyed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be conducted himself throughout the whole of his mission with admirable dignity and prudence , its progress and issue must have made it peculiarly disagreeable and irksome . He felt the importance of appearing to preserve a good understanding with the Spanish Court ; while the civil contempt with which he was treated rendered it not easy even to maintain appearanc*s . It was the policy of the Spanish Cabinet to delay and temporize : to encourage this country as far as might be necessary to promote their own hostile views in regard to Great Britain , and at the same time to render no effectual aid ; and the key to this policy was probably the apprehension , that the independence of the Colonies would be likely to be followed by a similar movement of their own . At all events , there is no great cause of gratitude to Spain for the miserable aid she rendered . The correspondence of Mr. Jay , during his residence in // Spain , is very interesting . It strikingly shows his uniform and cautious prudence , and his elevated patriotism : personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole aim and effort appeared to he to accomplish all that could he done for the welfare of his country . Owing to the difficulty of protecting his letters from the scrutiny of official agents , he rarely wrote with freedom on the subject of public affairs ; but the following extract of a letter , addressed to Robert Morris , will be read with pleasure . We remove next week to Aranjuez , where I expect again to spend some agreeable weeks . It is a charming place , containing a tract of several miles in circumference , and divided into gardens , meadows , parks , cultivated grounds and wilds , full of fine trees , fine roads and fine walks , and watered by a slow winding river , which , if more clear , would be very beautiful . A genius of a different character from that which presides at your hills and gardens , reigns over these . Soldiers , with fixed bayonets , present themselves at various stations in these peaceful retreats ; and though none but inoffensive citizens are near , yet horsemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal family in their little excursions to take the air daily , renew and impress ideas of subjection . Power unlimited , and distrust misplaced , thus exacting homage and imposing awe , occasion uneasy reflections , and alloy the pleasing sensations which nature , smiling in such delightful scenes , never fails to excite . Were I a Spaniard , these decorated seats would appear to me like the temporary enchantments of some despotic magician , who , by extending his wand , could at pleasure command them to vanish and be succeeded by galleys and prisons . Nothing is more true , than that all things figure by comparison . This elegant seat , being surrounded by exclusive wastes , appears like a blessed and fortunate island in a ( Ireary ocean . The contrast heightens its charms , and every traveller arrives with a mind predisposed to admire and enjoy them : but as the first impression wears away , and he begins to recollect the more happy , though less magnificent abodes in his own country , the attractions and allurements of this insensibly diminish . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to please or be contented , yet I find little here that resembles , and nothing that can compensate for the free air , the free conversation , the equal liberty , and the other numerous blessings which God and nature , and laws of our making , have given and secured to our happier country . I would not be understood to insinuate , that good companions and agreeable society are wanting // IIOct4 here . They may perhaps abound more in some other parts of the world , but they are also to be found here , though an unsocial kind of policy requires unceasing attention to the most austere rules of caution and prudence . The little that I have seen and observed of this people induces me to think , that ( except the generality of those who compose the highest and lowest orders ) they possess many qualities which are praiseworthy : and that two or three long and wise reigns would make them a very pow* erful and an amiable nation . But as I have not had sufficient opportunities of mixing with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information may either confirm or alter this opinion . The evident suspense and indecision of the court concerning us has kept many at a distance , with whom I should otherwise have been on a very familiar footing , and some of them have been so candid as to tell me so . This is a kind of prudence which naturally grows out of a jealous and absolute government , under which the people have , for mitny generations , been habit* uated to that kind of dependence , which constrains every class to watch and respect the opinions and inclinations of their supe* riors in power . The prosperous tide of our affairs , however , has for some time past run so strong , that I think man*of our ob* stacles here must soon give way . Shyness will then cease , and I shall not afterwards find it difficult to be received into more of their houses , and that in the only manner I can wish to be re* ceived into any ; -I mean , at the front door , by direct invitation from the masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ces of upper servants and unimportant favorites , whom I never can submit to court . ' On receiving his commission to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of peace with Great Britain , Mr. Jay wrote to the President of Congress , expressing in decided terms his objec .. tions to that portion of the instructions given to the commissioners , by which they were required to govern themselves by the advice of the French ministry in all the stages of the nego* tiation , and requesting that he might be relieved* from the performance of a duty , which , under the circumstances , he considered as humiliating* In the mean time and until the reply of Congress could be received , he resolved to undertake the commission , and went for that purpose to Paris , where he arrived on the 23d of June , 1782 . In July , Mr. Oswald was commissioned by the king of Great Britain to treat , consult of , and conclude with any commissioner or commissioners named , or to be named by the thirteen Colonies or plantations in iNortli // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poIitie* or any assembly or assemblies , or description of men , or any person or persons whatsoever , a peace or truce with the said Colonies or plantations , or any part thereof . ' Count de Vergennes was solicitous that the commissioners of the United States should negotiate with Mr. Oswald under this commission , and Dr. Franklin was of opinion that it was sufficient . Mr. Jay* however , considered it as a virtual declaration that the United States were still Colonies of Great Britain , and declined corninencing the negotiation , but resolved to take upon himself the responsibility of violating the express command of Congress . Without the knowledge of the French minister , he assured Mr. Oswald that he would take part in no negotiations in which the United States were not treated as an independent nation , and at his request , gave him a draught of such a corn- ' mission , as he was willing to admit as satisfactory . This was transmitted by Mr. Oswald to his court , who informed him in reply , that it was the King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article of treaty . In the mean time , the Count de Vergennes had given the British Government to understand , that the original commission was , in his judgment , a sufficient one . On being informed of this fact by Mr. Oswald , Mr. Jay prepared a letter to that gentleman , intended to be subscribed by Dr. Franklin and himself , in which a resolution was avowed to treat upon no other footing than that of absolute independence . Dr. Franklin refused to subscribe this letter , but it was communicated by Mr. Jay to Mr. Oswald , and by him transmitted to his court . On the 9th of September , it was ascertained by Mr. Jay that M. Rayneval , the secretary of Count de Vergennes , had gone to London , and he immediately inferred , that the journey could be undertaken only to inform the British cabinet that the comrni*. sion was regarded by the French Government as *a sufficient one , to counteract the claim of the United States to the fisheries and the country bordering on the Mississippi , and to ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France . The well known letter of Marbois had by this time made its appearance , and had confirmed Mr. Jay in his suspicion of the hostile purposes of the French ministry ; and , without the knowledge of the Count de Vergennes or D* . Franklin , he immediately dispatched a secret agent to the British Secretary of State , to inform him , that the United // States would treat on the basis of independence , or not at all ; that it was not for the interest of England , however it might be for that of France , to postpone the acknowledgment of our independence until the conclusion of a general peace ; and that he was i*esolved to take a part in no negotiation , that should not recognise the right of the United States to the fisheries , and the navigation of the Mississippi . On the 27th of September , the agent returned from London with a commission ; authorizing Mr. Oswald to treat with the commissioners of the United States of America . The negotiations were now actively commenced . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his efficient aid in prosecuting them , and , on the 30th of November , the provisional articles of treaty were subscribed by Mr. Oswald and the American commissioners . The account which we have here given is a mere abbreviation of the more extended one , which is contained in the work before us . The author naturally enters warmly into the feelings of his father , on all the questions relating to the inclination and policy of the French Cabinet , throughout the negotiation . Our views upon these questions have been more than once expressed , and it is hardly necessary for us to declare them now . We will only here remark , that we are not aware of the existence of any evidence , tending to show , that the object of M. Rayneval 's tour to London was that which Mr. Jay supposed . All the testimony , which we have seen , goes to contradict that supposition . What verbal overtures he may have made , it is of course impossible to ascertain ; but it is hardly proper to proceed upon the supposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact be made in some way to appear . As respects the letter of M. Marbois , the considerations relating to it have been already amply examined in this Journal ; admitting its authenticity to be beyond dispute , as the biographer assures us that it is , it would hardly justify the liberal inferences which have been deduced from it . But this , as we have already said , is a subject which it is not now our intention to discuss . The point of view ' in which it is most interesting , is that which relates to the character of Dr. Franklin , whose views , respecting the designs of the French ministry , differed essentially , in the early stages of the negotiation , from those of Mr. Jay and Mr. Adams . It was not until after the arrival of Mr. Adams , that Dr. Franklin consented to disobey the instructions of Congress ; but his subsequent willing* // ness to do so may have arisen as much from a desire to preserve harmony of action , as from any conviction of the incorrectness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he was ready to relinquish the claims of the United States to the Mississippi and the fisheries . This statement is , however , effectually refuted by the following passage , in a letter addressed to him by Mr. Jay . I do not recollect the least difference in sentiment between us , ' says the latter , respecting the boundaries or the fisheries : on the contrary , we were unanimous and united in adhering to and insisting upon them , nor did I perceive the least disposition in either of us to recede from our claims , or be satisfied with less than we obtained . ' On the subject of the navigation of the Mississippi , Dr. Franklin had expressed his views in a very forcible manner , in a letter addressed three years before to Mr. Jay . Poor as we are , ' said he , yet as I know we shall be rich , I would rather agree with them ( the Spanish Government , ) to buy at a great price the whole of their right on the Mississippi , than sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ask me to sell my street door . ' It is somewhat remarkable , that this suggestion of Dr. Franklin pointed out the very course , which was some years afterwards adopted . He was evidently more reluctant than his colleagues to violate the express commands of Congress , and entertained a better opinion than they did of the purposes of France ; but there is nothing in the circumstances of the negotiation , which should subject his patriotism to the slightest stain . Mr. Jay 's biographer imputes to him nothing more , than an error in judgment ; and those who differ with him in opinion , lay nothing more to the charge of Mr. Jay . Each of these distinguished men has too much merit of his own , to require that any thing should be taken from the credit belonging to the other . We are ourselves believers in the sagacity arid correct judgment of Di*9 . Franklin ; his conduct appears to us to have been distinguished by his usual caution , without exhibiting any ' want of energy or truly patriotic feeling ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive , as became their character . During his residence in Paris , Mr. Jay received a letter from an old friend , Mr. Peter Van Schaak , who had , at an early period of the Revolution , adhered to the British cause , and , after experiencing much inconvenience and privation here , had taken up his residence in England . It was his object to // renew his old relations with his former friend , or at least to ascertain , whether political differences had permanently estranged them from each other . Mr. Jay 's reply is so full of just and manly feeling , and indicates so well his high and honorable character , that we regret our inability to insert the whole . Dr. Franklin sent me this morning your letter of 11th August last ; I thank you for it . Aptitude to change in any thing never made a part of my disposition , and , I hope , makes no part of my character . In the course of the present troubles I have adhered to certain fixed principles , and faithfully obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my friends , my fhmilyor myself ; all of whom , however dreadful the thought , I have ever been ready to sacrifice , if necessary , to the public objects in contest . Believe me , my heart has nevertheless been , on more than one occasion , afflicted by the execution of what Pthought , and still think , was my duty . I felt very sensibly for you and others ; but as society can regard only the political propriety of men 's coiiiduct , and not the moral propriety of their motives to it , I could only lament your unavoidably becoming classed with many whose morality was convenience , and whose politics changed with the aspect of public affairs . My regard for you , as a good old friend , continued notwithstanding . God knows , that inclination never had a share in any proceedings of mine against you : from such thorns no man could expect to gather grapes ; and the only consolation that can grow in their unkindly shade is a consciousness of doing one 's duty , and the reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformly preferred the public weal to my friends and connexions , so , on the other , I have never been urged by private resentment to injure a single individual . Your judgment , and consequently your conscience , differed from mine on a very important question : but though , as an independent American , I considered all who were mA for us , and you among the rest , as against us ; yet be assured , that John Jay did not cease to be a friend to Peter Van Schaak . You see how naturally I slide into the habit of writing as freely as I used to speak to you . Ah ! my friend , if ever I see New York again , I expect to meet with the shade of many a departed joy . ' My heart bleeds to think of it . How is your health ? Where and how are your children ? Whenever , as a private friend , it may be in my power to do good to either , tell me . While I have a loaf you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this idea hurt you . If your circum // stances are easy , I rejoice ; if not , let me take off their rougher edges. * On the 1st of May , 1783 , Mr. Jay , together with Mr. Adams and Dr. Franklin , was commissioned to negotiate a treaty of commerce with Great Britain ; his health , however , was already much impaired , and he had formed the resolution to return to his country after the conclusion of the treaty of peace . This event took place in September ; but he was detained in Europe by various circumstances until May of the following year , and did not reach New York until late in July . He had determined , on his return , to devote his whole attention to his old profession ; but Congress had already elected him to fill the vacancy in the office of Secretary of Foreign affairs , occasioned by the resignation of Mr. Livingston . He did not feel himself at liberty to decline the appointment . Before accepting it , he was elected a delegate in Congress by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish Government began to exhibit a disposition to enter upon those negotiations , to which their attention had long been solicited in vain , and , for this purpose , appointed Mr. Gardoqui as their minister to the United States . The Secretary of Foreign Affairs was authorized by Congress to treat with him ; but the old question of the navigation of the Mississippi proved , as before , an obstacle not to be surmounted , and the negotiation was suspended . By the direction of Congress , Mr. Jay appeared before them , and expressed at length his sentiments on the subject . He gave it as his opinion , that the commercial privileges which Spain proposed to grant to us were of great value ; that his views in regard to the importance of the claim of the United States to the navigation of the Mississippi had undergone no change ; but that it might be expedient to stipulate with Spain , by a treaty limited in ( duration to twenty or thirty years , to forbear to exercise that right below our Southern boundary , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , and the United States could not then become possessed of it , except by force of arms . It will be remembered , that Congress had some years before instructed Mr. Jay to make a formal surrender of this claim , on condition that the citizens of the United States should be at liberty to use the river , so far as it bounded their own territory . This had been done , as the biographer of Mr. Jay // declares , at the instance of the Virginia delegation ; but the proposition of the Secretary was so ill received by the Southern members , that a motion to revoke his commission was made , and supported by all of them but one . This motion did not prevail ; the Northern and Eastern delegates , who constituted a majority , authorized him to assent to a suspension of the right of navigation for twenty years , if necessary , on condition that Spain should recognise our territorial limits , as they had been fixed by the treaty of peace . But the Spanish minister still refused to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States to the navigation in question , and the negotiation was accordingly broken off . The important public services rendered by Mr. Jay in the office of Secretary of Foreign Affairs , are very generally known ; hut we ought not to pass by in silence his proposal for the foundation of a Navy , which was prevented from being carried into execution by the consciousness , on the part of the Congress of the Confederation , of its inability to enforce its requisitions on the States . Every reader of our history is familiar with the part he took in establishing our present system of Government . No man felt more deeply the : ncurable defects of the previously existing system ; his pen and voice were very actively employed to illustrate those defects , and enforce the necessity of change ; and very interesting portions of his correspondence with Washington upon the subject , affording strikincr evidence of his sagacity and patriotism , are given in b these volumes . When the Convention met in Philadelphia , Mr. Jay 's official duty required his attendance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was , of course , not included among its members . No sooner had the new Constitution been prepared and submitted for ratification to the Conventions of the States , than he engaged , in connexion with General Hamilton and Mr. Madison , in the wfiting of the Federalist ; but , owing to an accident which is thus related by his biographer , his'contributions to the work were limited to a few papers . In the month of April , the peace of the city ( New York ) was disturbed by a serious riot , long known as " the doctor 's mob , " occasioned by some violations of the grave by persons of the medical profession . The magistrates found it necessary to confine certain physicians in prison , to protect them from the fury of the irritated multitude . The mob , finding themselves // thus disappointed of their vengeance , assembled the next day for the purpose of forcing the jail . Mr. Jay , on being informed of what was passing , seized a sword , and , with some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to prevent the meditated outrage . The party were attacked by the mob , and Mr. Jay was struck by a stone nearly senseless to the ground . He was carried home , and confined for some time , in consequence of a deep and dangerous wound in the temple . ' But his labors in this great cause were not , in consequence , wholly lost to the country . After his recovery , he published an address to the People of New York , in vindication of the Constitution , which , though it did not bear his name , was soon attributed to him , and was commended in the highest terms for its ability . He was also a member of the Convention of New York , and labored , in conjunction with Livingston and Hamilton , to procure the adoption of the Constitution by his native State . It is well known , with what difficulty this object was accomplished ; nothing but the greatest exertions of industry and talent could have ensured success . It was a singular mark of the confidence reposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept any office under the new Government , which he might prefer . The station which proved most agreeable to his inclination was that of Chief Justice of the United States : and it was one , for which the vigor of his intellect , the soundness of his judgment , and the extent of his legal attainments , eminently fitted him . The Supreme Court was organized in April , 1790 , and it is unnecessary to say , with what dignity he presided over it , during the few years that he continued to retain the office . In 1792 , he was induced to consent to be nominated as a candidate for the office of Governor of his native State . Governor Clinton was the opposing candidate . A majority of the votes of the people was given in favor of the election of Mr. Jay ; but a majority of the committee , appointed by the Legislature to examine them , were political friends of Mr. Clinton . This committee , on the ground that the votes of three counties were not constitutionally returned , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been very common for such officers to act after the expiration of their commissions , consigned these votes to the flames , and declared Mr. Clinton elected by a small majority . The intelligence of this result was thus received by Mr. Jay . Hay // irig nothing to reproach myself with , ' said he , in a letter to Mrs. Jay , in relation to this event , it shall neither discompose my temper nor postpone my sleep . A few years will put us all in the dust , and it will then be of more importance to me to have governed myself , than to have governed the State . ' The people of the State were somewhat less patient , but the decision of the Legislature , at their meeting , was favorable to the conduct of the canvassers . The relations between this country and Great Britain were now assuming the aspect of open hostility ; and , with the view of averting war , if possible , it was resolved by President Washington to commission a special envoy , to ascertain what effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of the English Government . His choice fell upon Mr. Jay ; who , if we may judge from his private correspondence , was reluctantly induced to accept the nomination . It was , however , made by the President , and confirmed by a large majority in the Senate , and , in a few weeks afterwards , he embarked for England . In June , 1794 , he arrived in Falmouth , and immediately commenced the negotiation , which resulted in the conclusion of the famous British treaty . On the 19th of November the treaty was signed , and in the following August received the signature of Washington . It would lead us into too wide a field of observation , to relate the circumstances of this memorable portion of our history . It appears that the opposition to the treaty in this country , which , as is well known , was very violent , was not unexpected by Mr. Jay . In a private letter , written during the progress of the negotiation , and addressed to Washington , he says : That attempts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not the most distant shadow of a doubt . I brought this belief and opinion with me ; and my dependence then was , and still is , on the wisdom , firmness anJ integrity of the Government ; on the general good sense of our people ; and on those enlightened and virtuous characters among them , who regard the peace , honor arid welfare of their country as primary objects . These men regret the differences which subsist between this country and their own , and sincerely desire to see mutual animosities give way to mutual goodwill . As to a political connexion with any country , I hope it will never be judged necessary , for I very much doubt , whether it would ultimately be found useful ; it would , in my opinion , introdace foreign influence , which I consider as the worst of political plagues . ' // Mr. Jay returned to this country in May , 1795 . During his absence , the term for which Mr. Clinton had been elected Governor being about to expire , the public sentiment again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he was accordingly , without consultation with him , nominated , and elected by a large majority . On his arrival , he resigned his seat on the bench of the Supreme Court , and on the 1st of July took the oaths of office , as Governor of New York . He continued to hold this office for six years , having been elected for an additional term of three years , at the expiration of the first , in opposition to his old friend Mr. Livingston . It is recorded by his biographer , that not a single individual was dismissed by him from office on account of his political opinions. , had a Mr. 4ay now formed resolution to retire altogether from public life , and he was not induced to change it by the earnest solicitations of his friends , that he would once more become a candidate for the Chief Magistracy of the State . In 1800 , he was again appointed by the President and Senate , Chief Justice of the United States . In a letter , communicating the intelligence of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you to take this step , but it appeared to me that Providence had thrown in my way an opportunity , not only of marking to the public the spot where , in my opinion , the greatest mass of worth remained collected in one individual , but of furnishing my country with the best security its inhabi .. tants afforded against the increasing dissolution of morals . ' Notwithstanding the flattering manner in which this honor was conferred , Mr. Jay still adhered to his determination , and , in 1801 , at the age of fifty-six , took leave of public life forever . The residue of Mr. Jay 's life , which was passed in retirc* ment at his seat in Bedford , was marked with few events of much importance . Although he continued to feel *tn int*rest in public affairs , and to express his sentiments in regdrd to public measures whenever they were solicited by his friends , he viewed them rather as a spectator , than as one who wished to guide them . He was active in the discharge of his personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonic of the great associations , which have been instituted to promote the religious and moral welfare of our race . In 18*7 , be was attacked by a severe and dangerous illness , from which he partially recovered , though only to linger in a state of great // 338 Lift of John Jay . debility and suffering ; but on the 14th of May , 1829 , he was seized with a paralytic affection , which three days afterwards proved fatal . The unkind feeling , which had been inspired in some by a portion of his political career , had long ago subsided ; men of all parties combined to render to his memory the offering of respect and praise . The private qualities of Mr. Jay are dwelt upon with feeling and affectionate remembrance , by his son . Although naturally of an irritable temper , his passions were completely under the control of principle : he cherished no feeling of hostility towards those , who exhibited a wish to injure him . He was unaffectedly modest ; assuming no importance , and always adverting with reluctance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits , he was wholly free from ostentation ; without being parsimonious , he was strictly economical ; his dress , furniture and equipage were all as simple , as was consistent with propriety ; and , though he gave liberally to all religious and charitable objects , he expended nothing for the purposes of fashion or display . Of his kindness in all the domestic relations , the following extract from one of his letters gives a very agreeable picture . It was addressed to his father from Madrid , at a time when his own situation was not such , as to render it very convenient to administer to the necessities of others . The reflection , ' says he , that my absence may be the means of rendering the situation of the family less distressing , makes me more reconciled to it than I otherwise should be . You have denied yourself much for the sake of your children ; and I am much mistaken , if some of them have not inherited dispositions somewhat similar to those of their parents . Had you been less attentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where I am . Economy will enable me to give you aid , for though I shall spare no expense here which my situation may require , yet a tax upon avoidab*Je pleasures , amusements , and luxuries , will produce a little fmlnd , that may and shall be useful to you . ' In all his actions , a deep sense of responsibility , and the influence of religious principle , were ever present with him . Of the evidence of these , his letters to his private friends are full . In a letter addressed to his brother on the occasion of a recent loss , he says : I know , and that by experience , that more consolation is to be derived from a firm confidence in Hun who governs the world , and from resignation to His will who never errs , than from all other cir // cumstances and considerations united . Our departed friends are but gone home before us . ' Again : I feel fatigued in body and in mind . But reflections of this kind are not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part assigned me , and meet with composure and fortitude whatever disagreeable events may occur to counteract my wishes or increase my task . I shall have rest in time , and for that rest I will not cease to prepare. * Little needs be said of the public character of a man , who possessed the unlimited confidence of Washington , and of whom the late John Adams said , when my confidence in Mr. Jay shall cease , I must give up the cause of confidence and renounce it with all men . ' He must have been no common man , who , at the early age of thirty , could take his station by the side of a band of patriots and statesmen , inferior in foresight , prudence , wisdom and practical ability to none in any former age , and establish at once a reputation , which went on increasing as he advanced in years . There is a prevailing impression , that the habits of investigation , acquired in the practice of the law , are apt to disqualify the greatest minds for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of nations . Such certainly was not the case with Mr. Jay , and as little could it be affirmed of those with whom he was associated . Into all the stations he was called upon to fill , he carried with him those excellent moral qualities , which gave dignity and influence to his private character , and these , united as they were with exalted intellectual gifts , made him as respected as he was eminent in all . The selections from Mr. Jay 's correspondence , which fill the second volume of the work before us , are very interesting , and will attract the reader , as well by the light they throw upon some portions of our history , as on the character and feelings of the writer . We rejoice in every attempt to preserve these papers in a form less liable to destruction , than that in which they are too often suffered to remain . If our annals are to be , as we hope they will , free from the obscurity and doubt which rest on those of every other country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal and industry of a few ; among whom , if a fellow-citizen of our own may justly claim the most distinguished place , the author of this work is entitled to no small share of honor . If there be any thing in it // at all open to objection , it is perhaps the devoting of so much space to an investigation of charges made against his father 's fame by an unprincipled adventurer . We need not say , that the vindication is triumphant : the integrity of Mr. Jay is beyond the reach of such accusers . The author has ; however , without transgressing in any respect the limits pres*i'ibed by prepriety , in treating of the merits of a relative , done ample justice to the memory of a man of eminent ability and virtue.
