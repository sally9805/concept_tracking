txt The present age is honorably distinguished by that spirit of thorough investigation into the history of the past , of which Niebuhr and Sharon Turner afford the most remarkable , but by no means the only instances . The evidence upon which we formed our belief in the events of by-gone ages , has been carefully sifted by an accurate examination of original documents and contemporaneous authorities , and we have been taught to correct the erroneous impressions we had imbibed from the pages of popular historians . The consequences have , in some cases , been startling . We find that many insulated transactions have been greatly over-rated , as to the magnitude of their effects ; while in others , that have been regarded as little more than mere personal anecdotes , we can now trace the germs of changes , which have affected the destinies of millions . The agency of distinguished men in the events of their time has been incorrectly estimated ; the profound and just thinkers have passed for visionaries and dreamers , while the weak and VOL. xxxIv. - No. 75. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' . - have received the honors due to wisdom and sagacity . And most of all , we have been mistaken in our opinions of character . The names of good men and patriots have called forth undeserved execration , while knaves and traitors have been buried and embalmed in the hearts of an admiring posterity . For all this we have generally to thank the poets and novelists , who fill up the outlines which history draws , with the shades and colors which best suit their own purposes . It is to be lamented that there is so much error on record , which must first be expunged , before the truth can be written down ; and there are some who , from an indolent aversion to engage in the painful search and comparison of facts and dates , or from a wayward peculiarity of mind , sit down with the conclusion that there is not , after all , so much difference between truth and falsehood as the world thinks , and that the safest plan is to feel a wholesome doubt about every thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it presents us with conflicting statements , shows an ignorance of the human mind , which he may correct at any time , by walking into a court-room , and listening to the evidence presented to the jury by the two parties at issue . Truth both claims and deserves severe application ; she is to be wooed and won in the patriarchal fashion , by years of hard labor . It is only by the light of the stu(lent 's lamp , that the dark places of the past are to be illumined . In all matters of fact , though the forms of error may be infinite , the truth must he one and the same ; your glass may be blue and mine may be green , ' but the object continues unaltered by the different media , through which we contemplate it . So far as mental development is concerned , it can not be doubted , that a superficial acquaintance with history in general is less to be valued , than an accurate and profound knowledge of one of its minute departments or separate portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become so prevalent , from their being recorded by men of genius , who have hastily and carelessly admitted facts , and devoted their principal efforts to those original speculations which are most conducive to their own fame , that it is hardly possible to disabuse the public mind . Falsehood has gone about the world with the graces in her train , while truth has lagged behind with no attendant , but the drooping form of modesty . These remarks have been naturally suggested by the perusal // of the work now under consideration , which is a most elaborate and successful examination into the records of the past , for the sake of doing justice to the character of an eminent man , whose merits have been strangely overlooked by most historians and biographers . The author has accomplished his task with signal ability , and has dispelled the darkness , which prejudice and carelessness had suffered to gather over the fair fame of a great navigator . He apologizes in his preface , for the somewhat repulsive form in which he has presented to the world the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in so satisfactory a manner , that we should do him injustice not to quote his words . What is now submitted made part , originally , of a much more extensive plan . But there was found , at every time , so much to clear up , and the materials for rectification were so multiplied , that it seemed impossible to treat the subject , without giving to it in connexion with any other , a cumbrous and disproportioned air . To hazard assertions , and to venture on the requisite plainness of criticism , without producing the evidence which justified a departure from received opinions , could have effected no good purpose , and would justly have incurred the charge of presumption . Error was too deeply intrenched to permit a hope of dislodging it , unless through the regular , though tedious forms of investment . The author is very sensible of the dry and argumentative manner here imparted to topics , which have usually been viewed , and treated , as susceptible of the highest embellishment . He can only hope that others may catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every step , which , in the disentanglement of facts , rejects impatiently , rather than solicits , whatever does not conduce directly to the result . The mind seems to demand , with sternness , that this labor shall first be gone through , as the eye requires a solid fhundation , and an assured elevation , before it can rest with complacency on the decorative acanthus . ' The author has well kent the honorable promise , which he has thus virtually made . He never points out an error where he is not able to substitute the truth , and never sets up a theory or a conjecture , till he has a solid foundation of fact for it to rest upon . The field of his researches is not a very extensive one , but the light he is enabled to shed upon it , is proportionally intense . In his search after materials , he has shewn an untiring industry and perseverance , which remind us of the finest efforts of German scholarship . He seems perfectly ecquainted with the contents of many rare and curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably new to ninetynine out of a hundred of his readers . He has dragged into light manuscripts , with the mould of centuries upon them , and forced them to give their tardy testimony in favor of the truth . Nor is it alone from works directly bearing upon the subject , that he has gathered his facts and drawn his proofs . From the copious stores of information derived from an extensive acquaintance with the whole subject of maritime discovery , he has drawn a multitude of indirect and collateral arguments , the value of which is greatly enhanced , by their being pressed into a service for which they were not originally destined . Nothing escapes his acuteness and penetration . Hints carelessly dropt , loose opinions thrown out at random , minute contradictions and inconsistencies become , in his hands , the successive links of a perfect and continuous chain of reasoning . The skill with which he builds up an important argument out of a few detached fragments of evidence , reminds us of that power , by which the philosopher is enabled , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain , to construct the entire skeleton of the animal , and to ascertain the genus and species to which it belongs . Even the enemies and detractors of Cabot are forced to give their testimony in his favor ; and their own works are made to furnish an antidote for the mischief they have done . The book is indeed unrivalled in its way , and is well worth the attentive study of a young lawyer , as a model of a learned , acute , and profound argument upon certain obscure and disputed points of history , which admits nothing that is irrelevant , and rejects nothing that is important , and by which a cause that looks desperate at first is so triumphantly supported , that we wonder how the contrary impression could ever have prevailed . His ingenuity , indeed , is sometimes pushed to an extreme , and his reasoning weakened by the means he takes to make it doubly strong . The result of his labors has filled us with surprise , and almost alarm . The amount of the errors and misrepresentations current upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice done him , not only by foreigners but by his own countrymen , must go a great way to confirm the scepticism of those who agree with Sir Robert Walpole , in his well-known opinion of history . That the notice of Cabot , in a work which lays claim to such uncommon and incontrovertible accuracy as the French Biograpitie Universelle , should contain the most cx-. // travagant blunders , does not greatly surprise us ; for with relation to the English character and history , there seems to be that defect in the minds of most Frenchmen , that there is in their organs , when they attempt to pronounce the language ; but that the popular writers of a people so fond of truth as the English , so commercial , so proud of their past annals , should have been so indifferent to the reputation of so great a navigator , a leading spirit in his own time , and one to whom the interests of trade and commerce are so largely indebted , does indeed fill us with amazement . Our wonder , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work before us , we are enabled to trace most of the errors Co obvious sources . Many of them are drawn from the pages of Hakluyt , whose collection of voyages in three volumes folio was published in London at the close of the sixteenth century , and has become so much the standard work upon the subject , that his statements have been generally adopted , without taking the trouble to refer to the sources from which he drew them . Many circumstances have tended to give him this elevation . He was a clergyman , and a man of education , patronized and assisted by Sir Walter Raleigh and other distinguished men , and be devoted his whole life to labors connected with the splendid maritime discoveries of the English people , in which he was such an enthusiast , that he once rode two hundred miles , to obtain from an eye-witness the particulars of an unfortunate expedition to Newfoundland , in the time of Henry the Eighth . His work , too , is one of great value , though in this case certainly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erroneous statements , and untenable positions . We have been somewhat particular in stating the merits of the work before us , because it is one of those books which will repose on the shelf of a library , to be occasionally referred to , and not lie on the table to be read through . The author is one of that rare class , who love truth for her own sake , and the possession of her seems to be a sufficient reward , for all the toil and anxiety of the pursuit . He has evidently been more anxious about the fame of Sebastian Cabot , than his own . As we have followed the thread of the elaborate argument , which he seems to be addressing to the world as to a jury , in behalf of an injured client , caring about nothing but to gain a just verdict , and disdaining the tricks of rhetoric , by which the wrong side may be varnished and gilded , so as to seem to the taste , // what the right one does to the understanding , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ball , who , he remarks , derived a keen pleasure from clear and power-. ful reasoning for its own sake , a quality in the intellect , which is nearly connected with veracity and a love of justice in the moral character . ' This quality the author seems to have in a great degree , and no one could derive any pleasure from the work , who had it not in some measure . To the miscellaneous reader , to whom one book is as good as another if it only amuse him , the log-book of the old navigator himself would hardly be less valuable . Wordsworth says of one of his friends , that to be known he must first be loved ; ' and we may say of the Life of Cabot , that we must be determined to like it before we attempt to read it . We read it ourselves attentively , and with deep interest , not only from the inge-. nuity of the argument , but from the great number of new and interesting facts , which it made known to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two or three chapters somewhat repulsive . The arrangement of the hook is puzzling and unsatisfactory . Instead of beginning with the birth of Sebastian Cabot , and going on with a regular narrative of his life , the author plunges in the very first chapter into a discussion as to the highest point of latitude reached by him , and most of his readers will open the book , entirely ignorant of the preparatory knowledge necessary to understand it . Duriug several succeeding chapters , he discusses insulated questions , and rectifies the erroneous state-. ments , which would tend to detract from his hero a portion of his fame . It is not until after some hundred pages , that we begin to feel that we are upon a vantage-ground , and can look down upon his life as an entire whole , and compare the relation of its several parts to one another . Many of the single chapters are hard to be understood , and must he read over more than once , as there is such an accumulation of names , dates , and authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must begin anew . The author does not seem to be thinking of his reader , or rather he expects that his reader will take the same absorbing interest in the subject that he does himself , and does not allow him any of those stopping-places , where , by means of a summary recapitulation , he is enabled to pause and look back at what he has been over . Indeed , both the writer and his book seem to belong to // another age* The tendency of the times is to theory and speculation . We demand works of a comprehensive character , in which the author must take upon himself the task of arranging and digesting his materials in such a way , that we may see a great deal at a single glance . There is so much to be known , that on many subjects We must be content with the bare outlines . Many bulky folios must be condensed into a single duodecimo , which may serve as a sort of catalogue raesonne6 of their contents . We do not want facts so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are willing to dispense with the processes , by which they are obtained . But our author has by no means adjusted his sails , so as to catch the gale of popular favor . He appears to have engaged in the work , and to have gone on with it , actuated solely by a love of the subject , and a wish to bestow honor , where honor was due . The thought that his book might not be a popular one , and that it might not sell well , seems never to have entered - his mind . And what makes this more striking is , that he is not a mere plodding drudge , that gropes about the nooks and corners of libraries and spends his days in poring over half-defaced manuscripts , and volumes brown with age , and capable of no higher effort of mind , than that of transcribing and collecting . He shews himself in his preface , and also in many remarks which fall from him , half unconsciously , it would seem , in the work itself , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupts the toilsome narrative by any more matter of his own , than is necessary to give cohesion to his argument . The tempting nature of his subject never for a moment seduces him into declamation , nor does he ever amuse himself or his readers with fanciful speculations and theories , beautiful and baseless as the clouds of summer . In another point , his forbearance is peculiar and highly honorable to him . His indefatigable researches have enabled him to correct many errors , some of them of no slight magnitude , in the works of those who have hitherto written upon the subject of mantime discovery . This he ( loes in that calm and unostentatious manner , which grows out of a confidence in the power of truth to maintain her own cause , without the aid of flippancy or satire . There is none of that insolent tone of superiority and disgusting self-conceit , so often observable in those who have detected errors in writers of great reputation , and which make us grudge the praises due to industry and research . He does // not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fame are the best materials with which to build up his own . When a writer is wrong , he sets him right , very simply and directly , sometimes not without an expression of surprise and even indignation , but it is all for truth 's sake and not his own . He passes , in his preface , a severe rebuke upon the compilers of the Biographie Universelle , who , after giving a notice of Cabot , which is a continued string of errors , gravely tell us that his discoveries ought not to be considered altogether fabulous , as some historians would represent them ; but he does this , not on account of their ignorance alone , but because of their unbounded pretensions to the most perfect accuracy . Having thus , in some imperfect measure , done justice to the merits of the book , we feel that we owe the same duty to the eminent navigator , whose cause it so successfully pleads . We propose , therefore , to give a short sketch of the life of Sebastian Cabot . Very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of the country he discovered , and , as we have before said , the work is not of that popular character which would make an epitome of its contents unnecessary , either for the sake of the writer or of his subject . We shall endeavor to make our readers understand , as far as is consistent with our limits , how much error and confusion there has been heretofore on the subject of his discoveries , and how much light has been shed upon them by the labors of our countryman . In doing this , we shall without hesitation confine ourselves principally to the materials furnished by the book itself , for though it bears a somewhat controversial character , there is an air of candor and high moral principle running through it , which would make us confident of the truth of every assertion , even if the author did not ( as he always does ) point us to the book and page , whence he derives his authority for what he says . Indeed , we could not do otherwise , without taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the Atlantic , the means of even verifying his accounts , much less of contradicting them . Sebastian Cabot was born at Bristol , in England , about the year 1475 , for the date of his birth is not exactly known . When he was four years old , he was taken by his father to Venice , the city of his ancestors , where he resided some years . In consequence of this , it has been generally believed and stated by many writers , that he was a Yenetian by birth , though // strange to say , we have his own words to the contrary. * The precise time of his return to England is also not known , though it was while he was yet quite young . About the time when Cabot was entering upon his manhood , the subject of maritime adventure was the all-engrossing one , throughout the civilized world . Europe was then ringing from side to side ' with the discoveries of the Portuguese in the East , and the still more brilliant and important ones of Columbus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the imagination has so little that is dimly known , to work upon ,  --  when the veil of mystery is lifted from the hieroglyphics of Egypt , and the course of the Niger ,  --  can hardly conceive of the electric impulse that must have thrilled through Europe , when the tidings came of the New World , made known by the enterprising Genoese . What a renewed youth it must have kindled up in the veins of the old , while to the young , the ardent and the imaginative , it clothed the worn and familiar forms of life with the beauty and attractiveness of romance ! Rumor , without doubt , exaggerated the glowing accounts of Columbus to that degree , that the ancient fables of the Islands of the Blessed seemed tame in comparison . There , the imagination of the poet had a range as boundless as the intervening ocean . There were groves of aromatic woods , whose fragrant breath was wafted far out to sea , and made old ocean smile ' for many a league . There was the darling region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efflulgent blaze of beauty , through earth , air , and sea , than was vouchsafed to the churlish North , on which he peered with cold and half-averted eye . The groves were populous with birds , of strange and dazzling plumage ; and glittering fishes darted , like flashes of light , through the waves . Flowers of every hue and form made the air faint with their odors , and the most delicious fruits hung in prodigal luxuriance , to refresh the languid senses . The natives , too , seemed not unworthy of the Paradise they inhabited . Their fine climate and simple habits gave grace and beauty to their forms , and an instinctive taste taught them , the use of natural and becoming * In Richard Eden 's Decades of the New World , ' page 255 , a rare and curious black-letter volume , published in 1555 , consisting partly of translations and partly of original matter , of which the author makes a great deal of use , and from which he has made many interesting extracts . vor*. xxxiv. - *o. 7* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gentleness and their love of peace , realized the fables of the golden age . They were also of an affectionate , grateful and social nature ; and welcomed , with open arms , the wonderful strangers , whose coming was so pregnant with mournful consequences to them . The mineral wealth of these regions was unbounded ; the precious metals were unvalued toys ; and avarice might grow w*nton in its visions of Eldorado cities , paved with emeralds , and with their golden tiles , glittering in the sun with the gorgeousness of a dream . The turbulent and adventurous , that felt the old world too narrow for them , were tempted , by vast leagues of territory yet to be explored , and populous nations yet to be conquered . The uneasy spirits , that thought whatever was , was wrong ,  --  the Jack Cades of the day ,  --  could find here the stuff , out of which they might cut as many Commonwealths as they pleased , and make a world after their own fashion . And the zealous and devoted Christian felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending the hounds of the Redeemer 's kingdom , and of sending the light of the Gospel to illumine the nations , that were sitting in the gross darkness of idolatry . The enthusiastic character of Cabot made him share largely in this general feeling . He himself , speaking of the effect produced in England by the news of the discovery , says , all men , with great admiration , affirm it to be a thing more divine than human ; ' and afterwards , he adds , by this fame and report , there increased in my heart a great flame of desire to attempt some notable thing . ' Fortunately , this flame was not permitted to burn out for want of fuel . A patent , dated March 5,1496 , was granted by Henry VII . to John Cabot and his three sons , Lewis , Sebastian and Sancius , which authorized them , their heirs or deputies , to sail to all parts , countries , and seas of the East , and of the West and of the North , under our banners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity soever they may be ; to seek out , discover and find whatsoever isles , countries , regions or provinces of the heathen and infidels , whatsoever they be , and in what part of the world soever they be , which before this time have been unknown to all Christians . ' We quote the words of the patent , since they are incompatible with the supposition that a previous voyage had been made , and that the patent was granted in consequence of it , as is by some // writers maintained. * The monarch , with his usual thrift , stipulated for one fifth of the clear profit of the enterprise . From the fact that the name of Cabot , the father , is found in this patent , as well as from a passage in Hakluyt ( vol. 3 , p. 9 ) , it has been confidently asserted by later writers , that he also was a distinguished navigator ; but of this there is no contemporary evidence . All that we know of him , is , that he came to England to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably introduced into the patent , that the king might have , in his wealth , a security for his portion . The argument of the author in the fifth chapter , in which he overthrows the testimony of Hakluyt upon this point , is one of great ingenuity and conclusiveness . The expedition set sail from Bristol , in the spring of 1497 . Cabot directed his course to Iceland , that by stopping there he might break the monotony of a long seavoyage ; and thence he launched out into the unknown seas of the West . On the 24th of June , 1497 , he came in sight of the continent of North America , to his great surprise , not thinking to find any other land than that of Cathay . ' The voyage had been made for the purpose of finding a northern passage to India . With regard to its results , there has been a great deal of confusion , much of which has been cleared up by the researches of the present writer ; and many erroneous statements concerning them are found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Newfoundland was the portion of the coast first seen by him , and that he named it Prima Vista for that reason , t but there is every reason to believe , that it was Labrador . The praise due to him as an intrepid and bold navigator has been in a great measure denied , by an attempt to make the extreme point of latitude which be reached , much less far to the North than was really the case . Relying upon a carelessly translated passage from the second volume of Ramusio 's Collection of Voyages contained in Hakluyt , such respectable authorities as Mr. Barrow , and the writer of the History of Maritimo and Inland Discovery in Dr. Lardner 's Cabinet Cyclopa*dia , assert , that Cabot went no farther North , than the latitude of 56* though in the preface to the * Harris 's Collection of Voyages . Barrow 's Chronological History of Voyages into the Arctie Regions . t Dr. Lardner 's Cabinet Cyclop*dia . History of Maritime and Inland Discovery , vol. 2 , p. 137. // third volume of Ramusio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67* and a half , and although this testimony is confirmed by the authority of Lord Bacon , in his History of Henry VII . He even sailed a considerable distance into Hud .. son 's Bay , and was pressing on with undiminished energies , confident in the belief that he had at length reached the long sought passage to India , when he was forced to return by the discontent of his crew , who , wearied with their long and perilous voyage , disheartened by the cheerless appearance of the country , and wanting the support of the intense enthusiasm which sustained their youthful commander , determined to follow no longer a phantom , that was visible to his heated and boyish imagination alone . This disappointment , bitter as it must have been at the time , did not in the least damp his ardor . Immediately upon his return to England , he made application for another patent , which was granted . It is dated February 3,1498 . It is made to our well-beloved John Kabotto , Venecian , sufficiente auctorite and power , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may take at his pleasure VI . English shippes , in any porte or portes or other place within this our realme of England or obeisance , so that and if the said shippes be of the burden of CC. tonnes or under , with their apparail requisite and necessarie for the safe conduct of the said shippes , and them convey and lede to the Lande and Isles of late found by the said John in oure name and by our commandmente . ' The patent , it will be seen , was made out to John Cabot , but it was wholly by the representations and on the account of Sebastian , since , though the death of the former took place soon after its date , the son proceeded directly upon his contemplated voyage . Of the results of this expedition little is known . It has been supposed , that he made an attempt to colonize the northern portion of this country , which failed , from the rigor of the climate , but this rests U*Ofl evidence too slight to command belief . ( pp. 87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not on the former , that he sailed to the South and explored the coast , as far as about the latitude of 35o* when a failure of provisions obliged him to return to England . Every thing relating to these two voyages has hitherto been attended with perplexity , confusion and error . We have seen already what contradictory accounts are on record , with regard to their details and results . Some writers suppose there was but one // voyage made , and that the expedition of 1498 is to be referred to the patent of 1496 , while others contend , that one voyage must have been made previously to this latter date . Much of this darkness has been dispelled , by the author 's having brought to light the original patent of February 3d , 1498 , which was found at the Rolls Chapel , after a tedious search of more than two weeks . Its testimony is highly important and conclusive , particularly as to the fact , that the discovery of the continent had been made previously to its date , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief statement of what it takes the author some hundred pages to establish . It would , of course , be impossible to give an abstract of an argument which inves-. tigates every point with such extreme minuteness , and which , so far from being open to the charge of unnecessary diffuseness , is sometimes obscure and involved from a want of it . We would refer those who yet feel any doubt , and wish to examine the evidence for themselves , to the book itself , promising them entire satisfaction ; with this precautionary remark , however , that they must read thoroughly , if they read at all . To the general reader , the minor details of these voyages , including the point of northern latitude which he reached , and the portion of the coast he first saw , can not but be matters of secondary interest . But no one can be indifferent to the great fact , that Sebastian Cabot was the first discoverer of the con-. tinent of America. * To be assured of this , we need attend but for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made , as we have seen , on the 24th of June , 1497 . Columbus , as is well known , did not discover the continent of America , till his third voyage , upon which he set sail , May 30 , 1498 . Amerigo *Perhaps it would be more correct and certainly more safe to say , that Cabot was the first civilized European , whose discovery of the continent of America is a matter of history . It is well known , that there is strong evidence that America was discovered by the Northmen , in the eleventh century . See Wheaton 's History of the Northmen . In the History of Maritime and Inland Discovery , in Dr. Lardner 's Cabinet Cyclopa*dia , Vol . II . p. 138 , the remarkable assertion is made , that Newfoundland was discovered about the year 1463 , by Cortereal , a Portuguese navigator . But the biographer of Cabot , in the second part of his work , shows the absurdity of this notion in a very few words . The mistake probably arose from the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , under the command of a person named Cortereal , in 1574 . See Book II . Cli. 11. // Vespucci crossed the Atlantic for the first time , with Alonzo de Hojeda , one of the companions of Columbus , who sailed from Spain , May 20 , 1499 . Thus the honor indisputably belongs to the English navigator ; but how capriciously has fame assigned the prize . The name of the lucky Florentine is written in everlasting characters upon the boundless page of the continent , while that of the other is a strange sound to nine tenths of its inhabitants . Indeed , Cabot 's claim to the gratitude and admiration of posterity has never been allowed a fair hearing , till now . The laurels which he gathered have been transferred to the brows of others . We have seen Englishmen denying his claim to be their countryman . Gloom and mystery have hitherto hung over the whole of his life ; ignorance and malice have united to cheat him of his fair fame ; his own maps and discourses , which might have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The strange misrepresentations about him and his discoveries , in the pages of those who have no excuse for their carelessness , will amaze any one who will take the trouble to examine the subject . The author of his life , in the only sentence where he indulges in any thing like petulance , justly remarks , that it is indeed a singular fact , that writers , who on most topics are dull , common-place , and safe ,  --  who might be trusted , one would think , in poetry itself , without peril to their matter-of-fact charncter ,  --  instantly become imaginative , on touching any part of Cabot 's history . ' After his return from his second voyage , there is a period in his life of fourteen or fifteen years , during which we lose sight of him , and know nothing of his employments . His reputation was probably extending itself in the mean while all over Europe , and was , perhaps , greater in other countries than his own . In 1512 , he was induced by the offers of Ferdinand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately admitted into confidence , and treated with such consideration as to awaken that paltry jealousy , which is too apt to visit merit of foreign growth , especially among that haughty and bigoted people . He was made a member of the Council of the Indies , and destined to be the commander of an expedition to discover the north-west passage , which was probably put an end to by the death of King Ferdinand , on the 23d of January , 1516 . On the accession of Charles V. , finding himselfoverlooked , and suffering perhaps from that opposition which was now un // checked by the support of his patron , the former monarch , he returned to England . There his active spirit immediately found employment . He set sail from England , in J 517 , on an expedition , concerning the destination of which there are two accounts ; one , that it was to the Spanish settlements in the West Indies , and the other , that it was to discover the north-west passage . The weight of evidence inclines to the latter presumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the cowardice of his second in command . It seems doubtfulwhether it was not on this voyage , rather than on his first one , in 1497 , that he reached the latitude of 67* , and penetrated into Hudson 's Bay . ( Chap . XV . ) In 1518 , we find him again in Spain , with the highly honorable office of Pilot Major . He attended the famous council held at Badajos in 1524 , to settle the boundaries of the Spanish and Portuguese empires . This had been called , in consequence of an attempt by Spain to carry on a commerce with the Molucca islands , which the Portuguese claimed as falling within their limits . The decision was in favor of Spain , so far as these islands were concerned . A company was immediately formed at Seville to prosecute the trade , and Cabot was invited to take the command of the expedition , which he accepted . The news of this project excited the utmost alarm in Portugal , which had long enjoyed a monopoly of the trade in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to no purpose . Cabot had originally requested that four ships , properly armed and equipped , should be furnished at the expense of the Treasury , but this was not granted . Three ships were provided by the Emperor , and a small barque by an individual . After repeated delays , they at length set sail in the beginning of April , 1526 . Immediately upon his departure he was followed by Diego Garcia , a Porniguese , in a squadron of three vessels , whose sole purpose seems to have been to watch his movements ; and who , if not avowedly employed by Portugal , was at least aided and encouraged by her . The sailing of the fleet had been retarded , among other things , by disputes between Cabot and the agents appointed by the merchants , who had freighted the vessel . They had thwarted and controlled him in every possible respect , and left him no more room than they could not well avoid for the w // ercise of his own judgment . They had differed upon one important point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appoint one of his personal friends , that he might be sure of something more than official regard , from his seCond in command . But the agents insisted upon choosing Martin Mendez , on account of their differences with Cabot , as Herrera states . From this we may infer that Mendez was no friend of Cabot , as the sequel indeed will show . One singular precaution was taken , which is highly characteristic of the nation , and shews their jealous suspicion of Cabot . The commander of every vessel was furnished with sealed orders , to be opened soon after leaving the port , and which were found to provide for the case of the death of Cabot ; eleven persons being named , upon whom in succession the command was to devolve . At the head of the list were Mendez himself and two brothers by the name of Rojas , men of skill and reputation , one of them the commander of one of the ships , but zealous partisans of the Lieutenant General . One can hardly conceive of a plan more calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a premium to disaffection , than this . For let it be remembered , that Cabot and Mendez were so far from being on a friendly footing , that before they left the port , they entered into a written agreement , by which Cabot secured himself against any usurpation of his authority by his deputy . The melancholy anticipations , with which we view the departure of a fleet so fraught with the elements of moral evil , are soon to be realized . On the coast of Brazil , the sparks of disaffection were kindled into an open blaze of mutiny , at the head of which , as might be expected , we find Mendez and the two brothers Rojas . The situation of Cabot seemed a desperate one , and there are few who would not have yielded without a struggle to such immense odds . Let it be remembered that he was a foreigner , with but two of his countrymen with him , in the midst of men remarkable for their national exclusiveness , and ready to view him with suspicion and dislike , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had also as yet performed no distinguished service for Spain . Mendez , on the other hand , and one of the two brothers , in addition to their being Spaniards , had been with Magellan in that famous expedition of his , which had redounded so much to the honor of their country , and they doubtless made use of their influence with the ships ' companies , to prejudice them // against their commander . But Cabot was one of those characters , who can always summon up an amount of internal energy , proportioned to the urgency of the demand upon it . Seamen are remarkable for the promptness , energy and intrepidity with which they prepare to meet danger , and guard against it when it comes . The constant struggle with such terrible agents as winds and waves , and the use of the despotic authority which is of necessity entrusted to the commander of a vessel , seems to produce that robur et es triplex circa pectus , which the Roman poet thinks must have belonged to him , who first launched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sent them on shore in an open boat , and left them ; and by this resolute act , not only suppressed the mutiny , but created such an impression of his courage and energy , that in the five toilsome and perilous years , during which the expedition lasted , not a murmur of discontent was afterwards breathed . Southey , in his History of Brazil , ( p. 52 , ) calls this proceeding an act of cruelty ; ' one would have thought , that an exertion of lawful authority and a necessary act of self-defence , might have been spared so harsh a designation . We have every reason to suppose , that the conduct of Cabot met with the approbation of the authorities at home for though the mutineers were soon taken off by a Portuguese vessel and carried to Spain , where they made a most indignant statement of the treatment they had received , we do not hear that any censure was ever passed upon him . The Spanish historians would have taken good care to record it , if there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cooperation of the three persons next in rank to himself , he did not feel himself at liberty to proceed on his original voyage , without further orders from Spain . Another reason for delay was , that lie had lost one of his vessels by shipwreck . He accordingly entered the river La Plata , and proceeded as far as a small island , nearly opposite where Buenos Ayres now stands , to which he gave the name of Gabriel , which it yet bears . He afterwards went some leagues farther and erected a fort , about the precise situation of which there is some doubt , but the author supposes it to have been upon a small island , near the mouth of the Parana . Leaving here his ships and a small garrison , he proceeded to explore the Parana in boats . He built another fort on the south bank of the Parana , near a small river named Terceiro , where he also left a garrison . This fort // was first called Sanctus Spiritus , and afterwards Fort Cabot . The details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the translation of Ramusio contained in Richard Eden 's Decades , he is represented as fyndinge it every where verye fayre and inhabited with infinite people , which with admyration came runnynge dayly to our shyppes . ' On reaching the point where the Parana joins with the Paraguay , he left it and proceeded thirty-four leagues up the latter river . Here , three of his men incautiously strayed from the main body to gather the fruit of the palm-tree , and were seized by the natives . A sanguinary battle immediately took place , in which twenty-five of Cabot 's party and three hundred of the natives were killed . He seems to have kept his position , and to have remained thereabouts some time , collecting information about the region from which the precious metals , which he saw , had been brought . Soon after , he was joined by that Diego Garcia , who , as the reader will recollect , sailed from Spain immediately after him , and who had traced his steps over so many leagues of ocean and river , to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabot immediately transmitted to the Emperor an account of his discoveries , as well as a narrative of the whole voyage , and the motives which induced him to change his original destination . Among these communications , there is reason to think , was a plan for the conquest of Peru , from which country the natives of the extreme region he had visited derived their gold and silver . The Emperor resolved to fit out a great expedition , but was prevented by pecuniary embarrassment , till Pizarro offered to conquer the country at his own expense , to whom permission was accordingly given . It seems childish to wish to unravel and weave anew the web of the past ; but one can not help lamenting that the conquest of Peru had not fallen to the lot of Cabot , instead of the unlettered ruffian , who bathed its peaceful soil so deeply in innocent blood . We should have been spared the ghastly record of treachery and cruelty , written on one of the darkest pages , not only of history , but of human nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer , during which he diligently explored the country , and noted down every thing worthy of observation . The misconduct of some of the followers of Garcia led to a general attack upon him by the natives , of which we have no particulars . It // must have been eventually repelled , since he soon after put to sea with the requisite supplies for the voyage , and returned to Spain , where he arrived in 1531 , after an absence of five years . Cabot 's residence in South America constitutes the most romantic and adventurous portion of his life , and that in which his great and heroic qualities were called into the most constant exercise . It is to be regretted , that we have such meagre and partial accounts of it , for he has had his usual hard fate of falling into the hands of careless and prejudiced historians . A manifest dislike to him is visible in the Spanish writers . They never seem to forget that he was a foreigner , and his putting three of their mutinous countrymen on shore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult . His own records and memorials are lost ; though the author thinks that much valuable matter might be found in the Spanish archives . But it is out of the quivers of his own countrymen , that the sharpest arrows come . We will mention two instances , partly by way of example , and partly on account of the popularity of the works , in which they are contained . In the history of maritime and inland discovery contained in Dr. Lardner 's Cyc1op*edia , vol. 2 , page 89 , it is stated , * that Cabot gave the name of Rio de la Plata , or River of Silver , that he might represent the country as abounding in precious metals , which is well known not to be the case . But will it be believed , that this charge is not brought against him by any of the Spanish writers , and that two of them , ( Gomara , chap . 89 , and Lopez Vaz , in Hakluyt , vol. 3 , p. 788 , ) expressly state , that the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office of Pilot Major , and who lost his life upon its banks ? A far more atrocious calumny against him is contained in the History of Brazil , by Mr. Southey , ( p. 52 , ) who not only brings the charge against the individual , but makes one of those sweeping reflections , that men of genius , who write histories , are so fond of , and which is as untrue as it is coarse and unsoldierlike ( we had almost said , ungentlemanly ) , in its tone . Cabot , ' he says , touched at an island on the coast called Ilha dos Patos , or Dutch Island , and there took in supplies ; requiting the goodwill which the natives had manifested , with the usual villany // of an old discoverer , by forcibly carrying away four of them . ' We should require the most conclusive evidence , ere we gave our belief to a charge of such inhuman cruelty and unexampled baseness , so inconsistent not only with the uprightness of Cabot 's public life , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends delighted to speak of him . But this story rests entirely upon the report of that Diego Garcia , whom we have already mentioned ; who stands convicted of a gross fraud upon the owners of the vessels in which he sailed after Cabot , and who appears to have been an unprincipled knave . It is in the highest degree improbable ; and is contradicted by negative and indirect testimony , which our limits do not enable us to present , but which may be examined in chapters XVII. and XIX . Cabot returned to Spain , with a character developed and a reputation increased , by the trying and chequered scenes he had passed through . He resumed his office of Pilot Major , resided many years there in great repute , and made several voyages . An interesting tribute is paid to his high reputation and amiable character , in a conversation reported in the first volume of Ramusio 's Voyages , * in which one of the speakers ( whose name is not given , ) says , that being in Seville some years before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spaniards , the public voice directed him to Sebastian Cabot , as a very valiant man , who had charge of those things . ' He accordingly went to see him , and gives a very pleasing account of his interview . He found him a most gentle and courteous person , who treated me with great kindness , and shewed me a great many things ; among the rest , a great map of the world , on which the several voyages of the Portuguese and Spaniards were laid down . ' In 1548 , he returned to England . We are not acquainted with the motives , which induced him to leave his lucrative and honorable situation in Spain . Probably , as he was now an old man , he felt the wish of the dying Patriarch stirring in his heart , and desired to lay his bones in his own land . We have a most convincing proof of the high consideration in which he was held in Spain ; for soon after his return , a formal and * The account of this conversation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , been the progenitor of a long line of errors in the pages of succeeding writers , who have copied him without consuiting the original work . // urgent demand was made by the Spanish Ambassador , that Sebastian Cabot , Grand Pilot of the Emperor 's Indies , then in England , might be sent over to Spain , as a very necessary man for the Emperor , whose servant he was , and had a pension of him . ' This demand was not complied with . He received from Edward VI . a pension of two hundred and fifty marks ( 1661. 13s. 6d . ) . It is usually stated that he was created Grand Pilot of England , and knighted ; but this the author seems to doubt . He was in reality , however , at the head of the maritime concerns of the country , whatever might have been bis nominal dignity . He had the honor of explaining in public , to the king , the subject of the variation of the needle . That youthful monarch , so full of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to naval affairs . Even when a child , ' says Burnet , he knew all the harbors and ports , both of ' his own dominions and of France and Scotland ; and how much water they bad , and what was the way of coming into them . ' Cabot 's long and honorable labors were fitly closed , by a service of the greatest importance to the commercial interests of Great Britain ,  --  and for which to this day the people of that country owe him a debt of gratitude . It seems that this was a period of great commercial distress ; and the London merchants applied to Cabot , as to the possibility of opening new vents for their commodities . His advice was , that an expedition should be sent to the north of Europe , in search of a market . This plan was adopted , and carried into immediate execution . Great care was taken to make the ships as staunch and strong as possible ; and for the first time in England , the keels were sheathed with lead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth and military reputation , was appointed commander . Next to him , and in cornmand of one of the ships , was Richard Chancellor , a skilful seaman , who proved himself , in the sequel , to be a man of no ordinary intellect or character . They were furnished with copious instructions by Cabot , which may be found in the first volume of Hakluyt . They give directions , not only relating to their general conduct , but even to the minutest points of discipline and internal arrangement . They do great honor to his good sense and the moral elevation of his character , and make us regret , that so few of the products of his mind have come down to us . They are full of that penetrating wisdom , which // 426 April , is the fruit of a long course of observation and reflection upon men and manners . They inculcate a strict attention to moral and religious duties , and direct that all disorderly conduct should be promptly checked . On the 20th of May , the squadron , consisting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic account of the pomp and circumstance ' that attended their departure . These , however , could not chase those melancholy feelings with which the crews looked forward to their perilous and untried'voyage , and bade adieu to that pleasant land , which they might never see again . Our sympathies are strongly enlisted in favor of Chancellor , of whom Haklnyt says , with a touching simplicity and beauty , which make us inclined to forget half his mistakes : his natural and fatherly affection , also , somewhat troubled him ; for he left behind him two l*ttIe sonnes , which were in the case of orphans , if he spedde not well . ' The fate of this expedition may be told in a few words . The fleet was separated in a storm , and Sir Hugh Willoughby , with two of the ships , was obliged to pass the winter in Lapland , where , from the rigor of the climate , he and both the crews perished . Chancellor was more fortunate ; he arrived at Archangel and journeyed over land to Moscow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements for an advantageous and permanent commercial intercourse . A charter of incorporation was given to the company of merchants in London , and Cabot was named Governor for life . Chancellor was destined never to behold again the two little sonnes , ' the thoughts of whom had cast a shade over his heart at the time of his departure . On his return , he brought with him an ambassador from the emperor of Russia . His ship was wrecked upon the north of Scotland , and he , with a great part of the crew , was lost , from his neglect to provide for his own safety , in his anxiety for that of the ambassador , who escaped . The little that we know of him gives us a high opinion of his character , not only as an unrivalled seaman , hut as a man of enlarged and cultivated intellect . The final results of this expedition do great honor to Cabot 's sagacity and comprehensive genius . Not only was a lucrative trade opened with Russia , but new life was infused into every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which to this day has never slept . The whale and Newfoundland fisheries may be said to owe their existence to this northem // voyage ; and the language used by Campbell , in his Lives of the Admirals , in speaking of this eminent man , is but his just praise , when he says , so that , with strict justice , it may be said of Sebastian Cabot , that he was the author of our man-. time strength , and opened the way to those improvements , which have rendered us so great , so eminent , so flourishing a people . ' In 1553 , Edward VI. , the patron and personal friend of Cabot , died , and his last years were made gloomy by the neglect of Mary , who held the English throne as a sort of trustee for Spain . His death took place about the year 1557 , and his friend Richard Eden has recorded some particulars of his dying moments , which *how the ruling passion keeping its throne to the last . He laments , that even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all worldlie vaine glorie ; ' for he talked flightily about a divine revelation to him , of a new and infallible method of finding the longitude , which he was not permitted to disclose to any mortal . ' The spirit of the dying man was hovering , like a sea-bird , over that ocean , which had been the scene of his dangers , and the field from which he had reaped his harvest of glory ; and the stirring music of its billows fell with vivid distinctness upon that inner ear , whose perception grew more acute , as the outward organ ceased by degrees to exercise its functions . Neither the place where he died , nor the spot in which he was buried , is known . Sebastian Cabot seems to have belonged to a rare class of men , whose characters combine many seemingly inconsistent qualities , which are found united only in those commanding spirits , who stamp their own image deeply and broadly upon their age , and exert a lasting influence upon the destinies of mankind . He had the originating genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical sagacity , which , in their execution , foresaw every possible danger , and omitted not the least precaution . He had the courage to undertake , and the perseverance to carry through , the most difficult enterprises . He had that enthusiasm of temperament , before which obstacles melted like wreaths of mist before the sun ; but his judgment was never tainted by the ardor of his blood . It was cool , discriminating , and deliberate . He saw things afar off , as if they were near , but he made no miscalculation of the intermediate distance . Perhaps the most prominent trait in his character was that lion-like decision , which adopts its course // instantly , and speeds right onward to it like an arrow , as swiftly and as directly . But with an abundant share of the qualities which ensure respect from the evidence of power which they give , he was not without those which win affection , from the sympathy with humanity which they evince . He seems to have been of the most gentle , courteous , and confiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strong personal attachment , and the kind-hearted Richard Eden delights to call him the good old man . ' Till the death of Edward VI. , one can hardly conceive of a more happy old age than his . He was honored at home and abroad , and awakened that romantic interest , which his perils and enterprises must have called forth in those , whose own lives had been of an unbroken tenor . All the young and adventurous spirits sat at his feet , and he was as ready to communicate to others the treasures of his experience and wisdom , as they were to receive them . He was beloved and esteemed by his sovereign , and the object of enthusiastic attachment to his friends . The young men saw him , and hid themselves ; and the aged arose and stood up ; when the ear heard him it blessed him , and when the eye saw him it gave witness to him . ' Cabot 's services to England , even taking the accounts of those who have been least favorable to him , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in grateful and honoring remembrance . He is as much more deserving of a statue in Westminster Abbey or St. Paul 's , than any of her naval heroes , as the extension of empire , by the right of discovery , and the opening of new markets by honorable enterprise , are more to be desired than provinces wrested from rival nations by the iron hand of war , and commercial privileges enforced at the point of the bayonet . The volume contains , in addition to the life of Cabot , a review of the history of the efforts made at subsequent periods to follow up his discoveries , down to the time of Hudson , and in which it is shown that an attempt has been made to diminish his fame , by exaggerating the merits of subsequent navigators . In point of learning and ingenuity , it is fully equal to the memoir of Cabot , and completes a vindication of a great man , triumphantly successful with regard to him , and highly honorable to its author.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
