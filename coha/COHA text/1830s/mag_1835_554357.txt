txt IT is well to take every opportunity to extend a taste for the study of Natural History ; for popular as it is , compared with former days , it does not yet inspire a general interest at all proportionate to its importance . Doubtless it is made the subject of lectures in all the cities , and most of the villages of our land ; and we could not say that anything was wanting , if a taste for // the results of study were all that is necessary to form . These are so brilliant and striking , that they can not be set before the most unintellectual of men , without producing in them emotions of delight . But , unfortunately , a taste for such results is one thing , and a taste for the study is another ; and out of the thousands who enjoy such displays of the treasures of science , there may not be one who is disposed to submit to the labor , self-denial and sacrifice , which science requires of its disciples ; neither have such displays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that thirst for searching and exploring , - which bears men up in the laborious process by which discoveries are made . If we rememher aright , Rousseau pointed out this error in education many years ago . It is forming a taste for having , where the object is to form the taste for earning ; the former is mere indulgence , the latter is exertion . Such exertion gives health to the mind , while the enjoyment of which we speak soon becomes satiety , and in a short time , the power to enjoy is lost . The object of such discourses as this , then , should be to shew that there is pleasure , not only in knowing but in learning ; and that every intelligent man will enjoy what he has learned by his own efforts , far more than that which is supplied to his hand . There is no doubt that the man who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow , enjoys it more than he who sets in luxurious repose , to be served by others ; considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest ; but this is not the only circumstance to be regarded ; there is another question , which tends most to confirm the health and vigor of the physical system , and to prepare it to resist the waste of time and the infirmity of declining years . So there is no doubt , that he who travels patiently over the field of natural science , enjoys his accessions of knowledge , far more than if he had them all spread out before him without any labor of his own ; and , so far as respects the health and vigor of his mind , it is exceedingly important that he should deal more with processes than results , and find his happiness in the excitement of the race , and not the value of the prize . We are inclined on this account as well as others , to think well of such discourses as this . They show by the spirit with which they are written , what kinds of interest and devotion these pursuits are able to inspire . It is not their object to shew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left for him to discover ; they would rather convince him that the // pursuit itself , apart from the consideration of its success , will be its own reward . No evidence can be more convincing for this purpose than that of those veterans in the science , who have undertaken pilgrimages and encountered hardships in a spirit of deep devotion to the study ; sustained in it , not by encouragement nor by applause , but by the self-rewarding principle , which ensures that services and sacrifices in a disinterested pursuit shall always be overpaid . It is not every one who will become a scientific naturalist ; nor is this necessary ; without mastering the details of science , men may become useful observers ; and in this way , be able , without pretension and almost unconsciously , to socure improvement for themselves , and render service to the world . White of Selborne is a familiar example ; he never pretended to be a scientific naturalist ; his whole ambition was to furnish observations to those who would be able to arrange and use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has done more to extend the taste for natural science than he . There was nothing in his situation peculiarly favorable to such pursuits ; he had no more leisure to devote to them than most men may secure to themselves , if they will . As to his field of observation , it was nature ; the same nature which is spread out under every eye ; and no man can say that the place where he dwells is barren , till ho has ascertained by actual observation that it affords nothing to reward attention , or to inspire thoughtfulness in the mind . The frozen plains of the north , and the fiery regions of Africa , have rewarded investigation with treasures , which have been thought cheaply purchased , by encountering hardships and dangers ; if so , it is not likely that any part of the inhabited world will be found , which does*not merit , and will not reward the attention of observers . Since the number of scientific naturalists must be small , it is very desirable to form a class of observers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it the business of their lives . But what good will the study of Natural History do ? It is a fair question ; and no general interest can ever be awakened in the pursuit , till it is answered to the satisfaction of those who ask it . At the same time this is no easy matter ; since what will interest one mind to the full extent of its powers , may not be able to make the least impression on another . If any one after reading the Iliad , ask what good it will do , the proper answer would be , that it would do very little good to him . If // any one , looking over the face of nature , can see nothing inspiring in its beauty , it will be of little service for him to keep looking on in the hope of enjoying it more . If any one , however , should ask the same question before reading it , there would be some hope of answering it to his satisfaction . And thus , if any who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us , ask concerning their utility , it will be a waste of time to endeavor to point it out ; the book of nature is one which they will never learn to read . There are those who really desire to engage in every liberal pursuit , and whose minds and hearts are open to everything which promises unprovement or delight . These are the persons whom the naturalist should endeavor to engage in the service of science ; he may endeavor to convince them ; and he may enter upon the undertaking with a confidence like that which , in former days , we have heard teachers of youth express , on occasions when we thought the oracle more doubtful ; " that they will remember it , and thank him for it , to the longest day they have to live . " It will not be difficult to shew to every one who asks the question , whatever his age , profession , or pursuit may be , some benefit which these studies can bestow . They have one decided advantage over almost all others ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , since every one who has anything of the naturalist about him , lcaves his books and the narrow enclosure of his study , and goes forth into the open fields of nature . It is manifest that pursuits , which thus excite the physical and intellectual powers , remove the unnatural inconsistency , which perverted education has established between study and action . It certainly never was intended , that while the mind is exerted , the body should be palsied by disease , nor was it any part of the design of Providence , that those who live by the labor of their hands , should leave their minds forever inactive and barren . It seems to us , that the studies in question reunite what man has unwisely separated , and are , therefore , best suited to our nature . Those who , like the author of this discourse , are desirous to extend a taste for these liberal studies , have a great encouragement in the fact , that they are everywhere met and welcomed by a deep and strong love of nature . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his strength ; it has much power where it has never found a voice , among those who are thrown into familiar inter // course with nature . Even among those who have no such advantage , - even under the exhausted receivers in the depths of the city , there are many indications which shew that this passion can never be rooted out from the breast . It is manifested by deeds , not words ; those in whom it exists may not be able to talk in sentimental phrase concerning the beautiful and picturesque , and will , therefore , be set down as wholly insensible ; but any one , who knows how to touch the spring of feeling in their soul , can appeal to it , and awaken it with power . In the darkest lanes of the city , bright flowers look out from the window , and bear witness that the love of nature is there . If there be a garden , like that commemorated by Martial , where nec cucumis possit jacere rectus , not even a cucumber has room to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungrateful air , which returns any thing but incense to them . Even boys , the most merciless of all destroyers , have their pet animal , and are subdued into something like humanity by their regard for their playful charge . The birds , too , - not only the familiar robin , but the wild baltimore and the retiring warbler , sing with confidence , believing that some will listen to them in the rattling street , as well as in the Sabbath stillness of the village . Who does not rejoice in the spirit-like song of the bird , when he comes to assure us that spring has released the sweet influences of Pleiades , and bound Orion in chains ; or when he hurries from the north , as soon as he hears afar off in the mountains the first murmurs of the winter storm ? He seems conscious of man 's attachment ; he lingers long after the leaf has fallen , - till the winds of autumn are singing their vesper hymn . Wilson expressed a natural sentiment , when he desired to be buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , this love of nature , in all its forms , is universal as the human heart . Mrs. Hemans , in her beautiful invocation , calls for flowers for the festival , for the conqueror and the bride . But nature had already taken this in charge . At her suggestion , flowers from the earliest ages have crowned the celebrations of joy , of glory , and of love . She would have found them also in places of sorrow ; in the captive 's lonely cell ; in the field where the weary are at rest ; for there , perhaps her own grave may bear witness , the love of nature suggests the last proof of delicate attachment , and flowers bloom upon the grave . The tastes of childhood , to which we have just alluded , // shew that the feeling is as general as we have represented it . The very infant delights in the young animal , and watches its motions with an interest which makes him quite forget the plaything in his hands . He holds the shell to his ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would whisper something of the mysteries of the deep from which it came . Can any reader of Wilson forget the child who came with a glowing face to his mother , saying , " Look , my dear mother , what beautiful flowers 1 have found growing on our place ! Why ! all the woods are full of them ! Red , orange , blue , and most every color . Oh ! I can gather you a whole parcel of them , much prettier than these , all growing in our own woods ! Shall I , mother ? shall I go and gather more ? " The naturalist said , that the feeling of the boy precisely resembled his own . Would it not he easy to cherish that fine enthusiasm , whether in youth or age , till it becomes an intellectual thirst for knowledge ? There is no doubt of it . This pleasure , in beholding such objects , inspires the wish to know more of them , and to ask those questions which science offers to answer . It would be easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eye glides naturally over a sweet evening prospect to the clear heaven beyond ; so it passes , of itself , and without effort , from the contemplation of nature up to nature 's God . But it may be said , that there are some , practical and intellectual men too , who are wholly indifferent to these things . It is true that there are men , like the geometrician of Montesquieu , who , describing a lovely countryseat , said it was a house thirty-five feet by sixty , with a garden of ten acres . There are some also , who , as Voltaire irreverently described a great English divine , are " reasoning mills , " with eyes habitually turned inward , and , of course , incapable of seeing the world about them . There are some men , like Johnson , who , from defect of the senses , can not see such things , and , of course , can hardly be expected to enjoy them . But except where there is physical disability , or when the course of life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sure to find it . It may not , as English travellers expect , be paraded in the chance company of a steamboat or stage coach , nor will one who feels it , speak of it quite as freely as of the politics of the day . Still it exists in all cultivated minds , with very few exceptions ; and to those we may apply Locke 's remark concerning the oyster , which he says is // lashed to the rock , and obliged to take whatever the sea washes into its shell . " Hence we see the goodness of Providence , in making its sensations so few and dull . " The few who are wholly indifferent prove nothing against the general truth , that the love of nature belongs to the human heart . Uncultivated men , who have no system to guide them , are often attentive and accurate observers , and those who make inquiries of them are surprised at the amount of information which they are able to give . Men of business , worn with their cares , always look upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to retire into the country ; and if , when they retire , they find that the habit of business has destroyed their relish for it , still the desire of such retirement , kept up through so much laborious excitement , shews how strong it must be . Those who plunge into the stirring concerns of public life , have always counted it a privilege , as well they may , to retreat from the dusty strife to the passionless excitement of the world of nature . And how can it be otherwise ? There is an expression in the face of nature , that can be seen by every eye , a gentle and gracious expression , which inspires confidence and love . We know not why it is , that divines have found so much fault with the doctrine of Pope 's Essay on Man , that " the body nature is , and God the soul ; " philosophical examination it may not bear ; but considered as poetry , it well expresses the truth , that nature is not inanimate nor unmeaning ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and expression ; and that this soul of the universe is no other than the Being whose power created , whose wisdom sustains , whose goodness crowns it all . This love of nature as a " thing of life " explains the fact , which is well known to many who are unaware of the cause , that in our communion with nature , we never feel alone . We feel solitary when we do not find man among the works of man . A deserted house is one of the dreariest places in the world ; it is more dreary than the raw chillness of a new-made grave ; and so is a deserted city , till nature has covered its ruins with verdure , and made it her own again . But we feel no such overpowering sense of loneliness among the works of God ; there is reverence and awe indeed , when man stands on the sea-shore , - when he gazes on the expanse of the desert , - or when he stands at midnight on the deck of a vessel in the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the forsaken works of man we feel solitary , because man is not there . Among the works of God we never feel so desolate , because he is there . We find this confirmed by the adventurers of the West ; they have complained of loneliness only when in presence of men . So in the Arabian deserts , Ch*tteaubriand found an intelligent young countryman of his own , who was so enchanted with their sublime solitudes , that he had given up his friends and his home . How powerfully this sentiment can some tunes act upon the heart , we see in one of the most striking of Park 's adventures . He was in an African wilderness , far from any abodes of men , overcome with weariness , and alarmed by beasts of prey . He felt as if all was over with him , and was on the point of lyin* , down in despair , when his eye rested *n a little flower , blooming alone amidst the desert sands . It carried his thoughts upward at once to Him that made it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being who sustained that little flower in existence , could withdraw his presence from suffering man . He no longer felt helpless and alone ; he went his way with new vigor , and soon reached a place of relief and repose . Had he felt deserted , he would in an hour have been torn by the beasts of the desert , and to this day his bones would have whitened in the sun . So far from being an uncommon thing , the love of nature often manifests itself on a large scale with the intensity and power of the strongest passions . For in this , we take it , are we to look for an explanation of the mystery of that patriotic feeling , which has sometimes wrought so powerfully in the hearts of those who are absent from their native country . The love of country is founded in local attachment ; it is found clinging to the scenery and natural objects of the father-land . No man ever forgets the tree that shaded the home of his childhood , nor the stream that ran near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the mountains of Switzerland , they take firmer hold upon the memory ; the images are more vivid , and the associations are proportionally strong . This was the case with the Hebrews ; on the dry plains and beside the slow rivers of Babylon , they were haunted with the vision of the hills and valleys of their own romantic land . Such examples have been found in our own country , little as it may be credited by those who believe that human nature differs in different regions of the earth . During the revolutionary war , there was a time , when some of the best and bravest men in // the southern army actually died , man after man , in consequence of that sickness of heart , produced by absence from their borne . Nor is this to be ascribed to the strength of domestic attach .. ment ; it is a more expansive feeling ; it attaches itself not so much to the fireside , as to the " blue hills of our native country . " The savage , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion ; all his eloquence consists of images which shew that nature is before his mind ; and there can be no doubt that the love of nature is one of the chief elements of that love of country which , in numberless memorable examples , has shewn itself able to bid defiance to the grave . We have said so much , - perhaps more than will be read ,  - -  concerning the love of nature , because it is the cause and spring of all improvement in these studies ; and if it exist so generally , it can not be hard to inspire that interest in these pursuits , which they require and deserve . But some may doubt whether this feeling , of which we have spoken , will accept the guidance of science , and submit to its restraints ; whether it can be elevated from an imaginative sentiment into a steady and well-governed enthusiasm , such as improvement in science requires . On this point it can be easily shewn , that wherever there is scientific zeal , it is invariably associated with a strong attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples to shew , that those who have made themselves illustrious in these pursuits , had their attention turned to the subject by the early love of nature . Linna*us himself is believed to have formed the taste , which afterwards made him so illustrious , from his delight in the flowers of his father 's garden . The elder Bartram , who stood so high in the estimation of the naturalists of his day , was an entire stranger to science , though a thoughtful and observing man . In the early part of his life , - indeed , through all his life , - he was a husbandman . One day when , weary with ploughing , he rested under a tree , he observed a flower , one of those things on which he had often loved to look . He longed to know something of its history ; - then he determined to know all that could be learned concerning it . This was the spring that required to be touched ; in the same hour the lover of nature became a naturalist , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the age of threescore and ten , he was exploring the wilds of Florida . then a country as dangerous and inaccessible , as could now be // found in North America . Wilson is another example . He loved nature so well that he became a pedler for the sake of enjoying it , and with the exception of Wordsworth 's friend , was probably the only one of that calling , in whom this passion overpowered the love of gain . The vocation , as he pursued it , was not easy nor profitable ; still , it served to nourish the taste which he afterwards indulged in this country with so much renown . We wish we could say , happiness ; but it is ordered that these pursuits shall be their own reward , and that the prize , immortality , shall not come till the mortal life , with its many sorrows , is past . There is another heresy of precisely the opposite description ; it is the doubt whether science will not quench the love of nature ; whether there is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this animated feeling . It evidently had no such effect in the men just mentioned . True ; but it may be said , they persevered in the hope of glory ; it may not be so with those who study for pleasure and improvement alone . This impression is founded on the precious maxim , that ignorance is the mother of devotion ; and truly nature and religion both are little beholden to those who make this their creed . Perhaps it is not easy to explain the self-sustaining principle , which induces men to devote themselves to a favorite pursuit , and repays them for all their labors . But they can easily see its effects ; they can see how soon a burning thirst for knowledge takes possession of their souls . There is no danger which they will not face ; there is no hardship which they will not undergo , if it will enable them to solve those mysteries which , of all things , they desire to know . There was , no doubt , a dun magnificence in the imagination which an ancient Magian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandeur with the view of Newton , who looked through the system with the searching brightness of an archangel 's eye ? It would be hard indeed to believe , that we shall love nature less in proportion as we know it better . It is not the love of nature , which refuses to be enlightened . It is a superstitious feeling , which would be more properly called the fear of nature . The Bramin , when the English officer shewed him with his microscope that he must needs destroy life in eating , was miserable to find that he was always violating that Pythagorean law , which it was the glory of his // life to observe . He should , however , have been grateful ; for the information which he had thus gained , sorely against his will , might have opened his mind to the teaching of a better philosophy and a better religion . What can be the charm of error ? Why so strong dislike of the revolutionary spirit of science , which restrains the power of the moon , disarms the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its terrors , and sends back the ghost to its grave ? What satisfaction can there be in believing that serpents have power to fascinate , or that birds can foretell the destinies of men ? There are many to this day , who are provoked to hear it denied that house sparrows change into snowbirds in the winter , or that the swallow , a bird of most untiring wing , instead of retreating before the storm , escapes it by diving into the mud . The true lover of nature is a lover of truth , and as Johnson said of Sir Thomas Brown , is willing to pay labor for it ; though he may not manifest it precisely like that eminent man , who , " having heard a rumor of sympathetic needles by which , suspended over circular alphabets , distant friends or lovers might converse , procured two such alphabets , and placed them on the proper spindles . The result was , that when he moved one , the other , instead of taking by sympathy the same direction , stood like the pillars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , allowing there is no reason to expect to find men indifferent to these sciences , we see in point of fact , that they are so ; not that they do not take pleasure in results , but there are few who give much attention to them , and hardly three or four in a nation who make them the business of their lives . But to say that these studies inspire no general interest , is only sayin0 in other words that they are not generally known . Knowledge is the cure for indifference ; that which one does not know , of course , he does not care for ; but as we grow acquainted with the subject , our interest is excited in one way or another . We may not like it more ; if not , we shall dislike it more ; our feeling will take decided forms , either of partiality or aversion . It is always found by experience , that the more one knows of these things , the more he will desire to know . The facts at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the labor ; but as we go on the field enlarges , and we begin to ask where nature can have hidden these surprising things , while the wonder is that we have not noticed these things which have lain close under our // eyes . We have heard divines say , that in another world , the wonders of Providence will be unfolded to view . Another world ? What world do they live in ? At the moment while they are saying it , they are surrounded with unexplored and unsuspected wonders . Another would ! Why , this becomes another world to the man who opens his eyes . Science breathes life and light into it ; it kindles with glory , happiness , *nd praise ; there is no one who can not feel its inspirations if he will . Some naturalists of the present day , as Linnams did before them , complain that the science is not even held in reverence , and they hardly mention the subject without a reproof to those who treat it with levity and scorn . Something , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon a smile when the naturalist is descanting on the wonders of an insect s wing , for those who are guilty of this irreverence , only smile at the physical disproportion between his subject and himself , and they do not doubt that he has found something in it worthy the attention of enlightened minds . Are we to suppose that Franklin raising his kite , or Newton blowing his soap bubbles , was secure from this kind of martyrdom ? Those who saw them thus employed , must have thought , to say the least , that the sages were engaged in very singular recreations . Naturalists sometimes bring ridicule upon themselves , by affecting a magnificence not called for by the occasion . Thus Kirby and Spence were so transported at witnessing the evolutions of a party of gnats upon the wing , - their celestial dances , as they called them , in which they were " rising and falling , transparent and glorious , " that they could think of nothing but " angels and glorified spirits , drinking life and joy from the effulgence of divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such lucubrations ? Those able naturalists should have remembered , that for one instance in which such language would exalt a mortal 's devotion to the skies , there would be hundreds in which it would be more likely to draw an angel 's down . But passing from these more general views of the subject , we will attempt to direct attention to some of the purposes to which these studies should be applied . First of all , to the purpose of improving the minds of the young , and a more important purpose we do not kno*v* They should be instructed in Natural History , not because it may lead to something useful , but because , with // out looking to any other result , the mere pursuit is improving to the mind and heart . We will not contend for the pr*eminence of these studies . Every one , which brings the mind into action , will do good . But the great thing is to find such studies , as may bring the mind into willing and cheerful action ; if they do not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for real improvement , while it is , in fact , injurious to the intellectual powers . There are too many studies , which their minds play upon , - perhaps work upon , while they are dealing all the time with words and not with things . " Words , " it has been said , " are the daughters of earth ; things are the sons of heaven ; " but in many studies , the mortal claims and receives what belongs to the immortal . The observation of children needs to be cultivated more than the memory ; the habit of remembering is in great part mechanical and easily brought to perfection ; the habit of observing with the mind open as well as the eye , is not so easily formed ; but it is so important to all kinds of success in later years , that the science which will do most to form it in the young , carries with it its own recommendation . We think that Natural History will be found , more than any other , to fasten itself upon the mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have never seen anything more beautiful , than the desire of knowledge which the young sometimes discover ; " the soft , dark , earnest eye " turned in breathless attention upon him who endeavors to instruct them . There is something fresh and animating in their view of the creation ; they long to know everything within their sphere ; the world seems enchanted ; it awakens trains of thought and feeling , which , to them , are glorious and unbounded . As they grow older , this curiosity subsides ; indifference grows and gains upon them , till , when they are men , they stand without interest amidst the beautiful and grand of nature , conscious of their ignorance , and yet not desiring to know . Verily , the doctrine that man must be born again , is philosophically as well as religiously true ; he must renew the childhood of his soul , before he can ever desire to learn what it is shameful not to know . Restore him his childlike feelings , and his cold heart will kindle with new intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing , - of every delicate flower on the earth , and every bright star in the sky ; and when he sees the countless multitude of wonders that solicit his attention , he will begin to // value the hope , perhaps we should call it something more than hope , - that he may walk forever in the same path of knowledge , of light shining brighter and brighter , which he is travelling in this world below . Children , then , are not only proper subjects , they are by far the best subjects of this kind of instruction . Instruction we call it , though it depends on themselves far more than others ; these are pursuits in which the schoolmaster , whether abroad or at home , can do but little to aid them . The strong heart and active mind work out their own improvement , or nothing is done . They must , indeed , leave the schoolmaster within his narrow prison , and go out into the fields to strengthen their physical powers by exercise , and their minds by observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thus pursued ; but those which will , afford a relief from the unnatural confinement which our systems of education impose on their disciples or victims . They supply that nervous impulse , without which , physiologists tell us , we may exercise forever with very little advantage . We are not about to declaim concerning these systems ; there may be some danger of their improving the intellectual at the expense of the physical powers . But it seems to us , that the greatest danger is , that they will improve neither ; if the body loses strength , the mind will sympathize with it . In a gre at proportion of those cases , in which the young mind is thought to be making ruinous efforts , the mind is as inactive as the form . There is some easy play of memory which counterfeits mental exertion ; or the look of lassitude passes for an intensely thoughtful expression . Though there are cases of disease in which the mind is preternaturally developed , in general it is true , that the mind can not be improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to account for the manner in which these studies have been neglected in youthful education . It certainly is not owing to want of means and advantages ; for no one is so situated that he can not give them some attention . A residence in the country is , doubtless , most favorable ; but we find more instances in the city than the country , of those who pursue them with vigor and success . The truth is , that there are no disadvantages which resolution can not overcome . When Sir Joseph Banks , with Dr. Solander , arrived at Rio de Janeiro , nothing doubting that he should enjoy the happiness // of bringing to light the rich treasures of the country , the Portuguese authorities would not suffer any one of the party to land . This was sufficiently mortifying ; but the naturalists , having some live stock on hoard , bethought themselves that the jealousy of that enlightened government possibly might not e : : tend to them ; and under color of procuring fodder for the animals , they received every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little money , judiciously applied , taught the purveyers to consult the taste of the botanists as well as of the cattle ; and thus by this simple expedient , they were able to make a considerable collection of Brazilian plants , without setting their feet upon the soil of the country . iVJr . Swainson himself : , while exploring the forests of South America , was troubled with a complaint which prevented him from walking . Meantime he despatched the three Indians who were with him in search of insects , birds , and other animals , while he remained at home . Thus every day added something to his collections , besides providing food for the party . He passed the morning in preparing the skins of the birds , and arranging the insects , and the evening in looking over the new acquisitions brought in by his men ; and thus was able not only to amuse the tedious hours of his confinement , but to continue his pursuits with vigor and success . Such examples shew , that there is nosituation in which these studies can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can do these things ; it does not require the knowledge of a master to begin with ; the author mentions the case of a female friend , who , during a long illness , employed herself in making a collection of English plants . An intelligent servant was sent out to collect them ; feeble though she was , she examined and arranged then ) ; and in this way passed years in happiness and improvement , which otherwise would have been entirely lost . When these studies can thus be attended to under many disadvantages , it seems strange that , even if neglected in youthful education , they should not have formed a part of that process of self-education , which every cultivated mind passes through . The reason of their forming no part of youthful instruction is , that they do not appear to be an essential preparation for any business in life ; a test which would , if followed out , put to Right many of those branches of learning that are most important to the interests of the mind . The meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to the mer // chant , the lawyer , the clergyman , the mechanic , but only to the man . And really one is tempted to ask , if the man is not to be regarded ? Is there no such thing as improvement , which can not be estimated by the bearing it will have on our prosperity and success in life ? Must not every one who has a heart and soul acknowledge , that to strike out new sources of intellectual enjoyment , - enjoyment which rests not in itself , but carries the soul onward and upward , - enjoyment which is of itself improvement , is as great a service as can be rendered to man , considering him not as a being placed here to travel to the tomb , hut as one who has a character to form , for an eternal existence ? We have many false standards to cast away , before we shall be able to tell discerningly what objects in life we should most earnestly pursue . But , admitting that immediate results , bearing on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only to look back upon the progress of natural science , another name for the investigation of nature , to see what it has done for the benefit of men . What is there , from the reader 's spectacles to the reviewer 's paper and pen , which observation has not drawn out from the great treasures of the natural world ? Does any one think that the world is travelled over , so that nothing remains to be explored ? So far from it , the spirit of observation , when under the direction of science , labors with tenfold more success , and unfolds , even in the most beaten paths , a thousand resources of which man never dreamed . Look , for example , at the progress of horticulture . How many would have laughed at the idea of forming societies in reference to fruit trees , of which all the kinds were so familiarly known ? And yet , who does not know , that science is creating new varieties , by following out the suggestions of nature ? There can be no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the vegetable world . Fruits that are now thought worthless will be multiplied , like the crab-apple , into rich and various kinds ; roots , like the potato and mandioca , which were poisonous in their natural state , will be disarmed of their venom , and tamed for the service of mankind . It may be true , that no new animals may be acclimated and employed in our service ; this only proves that we do not want them ; hut we fully believe that animated nature will furnish resources for the comfort and subsistence of man in future ages , which are little dreatned of now . The whole insect race is passed // over as worthless and contemptible ; we are content to wonder at the Roman supper of snails , the Arab feasting on his locusts , the South African with his roasted ants , and the South American negro with his luxury of grubs . Among us insects have an immunity , of which we trust the advance of science will deprive them . The moschetto winds his horn triumphantly in our ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety nets for half the year ; the fly revels in every apartrnent of our houses , as familiarly as if they were his own . The time may come , when the innumerable pests which now murder our sleep , infest our houses , plunder our fruit , and destroy the beauty of our gardens , may appear to more advantage on our tables . There is certainly some prejudice , which must first be overcome ; but it can not require more courage in the first instance to swallow a snail , than an oyster . Those who can not rejoice in this application of insects to the purposes of life , may be tau , ht at least how to remove them . The fact is , that every man , woman , and child has a direct interest in these studies . Every man who owns a beast , a field or a tree ; every woman who lives where moths corrupt a garment ; every child who rambles in his holidays , and returns , burning with poison from the hedge , has a direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a moral lesson , which can be learned from the contemplation of nature . Solomon is good authority on this subject , though some have thought that lie shone more in morals than in Natural History , when he directed the idle to the ant to learn the lesson of prudent labor . They are pleased to say that the ant does not prepare its food for the winter , inasmuch as it is torpid throughout that season . In defence of Solomon , we can only say , that he never said that it did ; all he said was , that it prepared its food when it wanted it , and he thought that in that respect , it offered a good example to men . The Oriental taste goes very far in search of such illustrations . Sir William Jones translates from the Persian , " Learn from yon orient shell to love thy foe , And store with gems the hand that brings thee woe ; Free , like yon rock , from base , vindictive pride , Emblaze with gems the arm that rends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower With fruit n*ctareous , or the balmy flower ; All nature cries aloud , shall man do less , Than heal the railer and the smiter bless ? ' " // These analogies are sufficiently far-fetched , it is true ; still , they are founded on the right principle , which is that of cultivating the faculty of association , one of those parts of education , which have been strongly recommended , hut steadily and almost systematically neglected . It is not , however , a business of the schools , it belongs more properly to self-education ; if any one will regard it , he may smite his own rock in the wilderness , and supply that thirst of enjoyment , whichotherwise will prey upon the soul . In this country , we often lament that our soil is wanting in powerful associations . Other lands have their ruins , which inspire an interest of the most exciting kind , and men of taste sometimes complain that ours is barren . But what are those ruins ? Are they not monuments of barbarism ? Are they not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tide of time ? They commemorate a social system , which , though it was gilded by a few beams of honor and humanity , was in reality a curse to the world , and which those who suf .. fered and mourned under it rejoiced to see passing away . A few associations of generous chivalry , manly spirit and romantic self-devotion , make men cling to these monuments of dark and bloody times . But is it not possible to associate thoughts quite as delightful and inspiring with the works of nature ? Most certainly it is . It is not nature that is wanting ; she spreads out her forms of beauty and grandeur before us , but they excite little interest , because we are wanting to ourselves . We expect to find these associations already existing , while it depends on us to form them . Our eyes do not see , - our imagination must create them ; and if we have the right heart and the right spirit , we can easily and almost without effort create " tongues in the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the running brooks , " where we can learn more than we ever have known , and " sermons in stones , " the lastly of which no one shall be impatient to hear . This is the work of poetry , - that is , creation ; where this quickening power exists , the desert need not be barren ; and there is an inviting field for its action in a land like ours . Though the improvement of our condition is not the most important thing , still it is important , and natural science enables us to secure and advance it . We call ourselves lords of the creation ; but we little know the resources of our dominions ; every year is bringing to light some new treasures ; and , moreover , while // we boast of this aristocracy on earth , there are creatures which threaten to abolish our peerage , unless natural science discovers the means to put them down . The larger animals are subdued to our purposes , or driven out from our bounds ; our vegetable enemies , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reasonable care ; but , meantime , insects , creatures which man can engage single-handed , threaten to ovorwhelm him with their numbers . Some explore our mansions to prey upon our food , dividing their labor on the most approved principle , to make the destruction sure . Others pay their attention to our wardrobes , and work upon our clothes in silence and darkness ; deathwatches drum upon our headboards to enjoy our fright ; rosebuds , sawflies and caterpillars of all descriptions lay our gardens and flower beds waste ; cankerworms leave our fruit trees barren of every leaf ; curculios gather the fruit , and the borer comes to put the finishing stroke to the tree . They seem to ascertain what man values most , and then they know where to commence their depredations . Our only consolation is , that others suffer even more than we ; in South America there are tribes which are obliged to bury themselves in the ground , as if for their long sleep , before venomous insects will suffer them to close theireyes . All kinds of historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future historian of that continent will doubtless remember them in his benedictions . In India , matters are still worse ; the ants have been known to board a ship of the line and sink it in the Ganges ; the palace of the Governor General at Calcutta is now under their hands , and all the conservatives in the British empire will not save it from the dust . And now what is to be done ? It is true , as we have suggested , that if they eat us and ours , we can take revenge by eating them ; and this would seem to be a fair and natural retribution , by which we may punish their transgressions and reduce their numbers . But there is an unhappy prejudice against this course , with which we confess that we sympathize , though against our judgment and conviction . Our only hope then , is in the progress of natural science , which in this and other departments must step forward to remove existing evils . It must beard these minute lions in their den . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will not eat them , it is foolish in the extreme to quarrel with creatures that will . They // are active against their own interest when they allow idle boys to shoot birds , under pretence of protecting fruit , which those same boys are a thousand times more likely to steal and devour . A great point will be gained , when the farmer is able and willing to distinguish his friends from his foes . Natural History , though it holds out no splendid rewards to those who pursue its studies , will not fail to supply its fair proportion of contributions to the general welfare . Natural Philosophy has furnished its lighthouses and lifeboats for the ocean , its lightning rods and steam engines for the land , and its safety lamp for those who explore the regions below . Chemistry has supplied its bleaching inventions and its medicines , not to speak of the more questionable blessings of dry bone soup , linen rag sugar , and sawdust bread . Natural History , though it seems to content itself with simple descriptions of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers upon each other , will continually unfold new productions and properties in all its departments ; - new uses for animals , vegetables and minerals , and ways in which they can be applied to the benefit of man . It will teach men to employ nature a crainst itself , and so to neutralize many of its evils , shewing how it furnishes the antidote as well as the bane ; shewing , in fact , that it never puts difficulties in the way of man , without some corresponding advantage which it rests with them to discover . Of course it will exact something in return ; it will require men to look round them with observing eyes , and to pay at least sufficient attention to nature , to know how to estimate the blessings which it bestows . But , for all this , it will abundantly reward him ; it will make him happy , by affording something to fill up the vacancy of his mind and heart . If the mind ever rests , its calm is not clear , transparent repose , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which men are exposed much oftener than they know . We are unconscious of our inaction of mind , because revery is mistaken for thought ; a man never looks so profoundly intellectual as when he is thinking of nothing . A solitary walk , - a seat by an evening fire , are said to be favorable to thought , when sometimes , on such occasions , not a thought passes through the mind for hours ; thought being the action , and not the dreamy repose of the mind . Now when this science changes the thoughtless into observers ; when it teaches them to look with interest upon the insect , whose instinct is so perfect and sure in all its op // erations ; when it makes them see beauty in the frail loveliness of the flower , which now they crush beneath their feet ; when it leads them to examine the rich plumage or listen to the song of the bird , instead of destroying it with wanton cruelty , it renders them a service which can not he over-estimated ; it opens fountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow . In this point of view , we have no doubt that these studies might he employed as efficient instruments of moral reform . For it can not be questioned , that most men are driven to lawless indulgence , not by their love of it , - not by the strength of the temptation , - but by the horrors of a vacant mind , which induce them to seek this relief from themselves . The force and resistlessness of the temptation consist , not in its own attraction , but in the unhappiness of a mind preying upon itself , which eagerly catches at any means of relief for the moment , without thinking of the consequences . It is in such vacant and unguarded hours , that the evil spirit of sensual indulgence attracts and secures its victims . Now those pursuits , which furnish an excitement to the mind , will arm it against such fascination , by keeping it in that action , which is as essential to virtue , as it was to eloquence in the opinion of the great master of the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , which remove one set of evils by substituting another ; but whoever supplies subjects of engagin0 intellectual interest to the minds of men , goes to the root of the evil , while others are hewing at the branches which spring again as fast as they are cut away . This science renders usno small service , when it shews us the unbounded liberality of nature , and the readiness with which she surrenders her treasures to man . Trusting in this liberality , man goes forth into the wilderness , such as this country was two centuries ago , taking with him his axe and rifle , and little else beside the strpng hand and the strong heart ; for he knows , that if he is true to himself and does his own part , nature will never be found wanting . He chooses the place for his habitation ; nature furnishes The tree for his building , its stem for the walls , its evergreen thatch for his roof , its pitchy splinter for his candle , and its branches for his fire . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pigeon , the pheasant , and the deer , or to the streams crowded with fish , where his wants are supplied without destroying his patient // laborer the ox , whose services he can not spare . If he is thirsty , he goes to the spring that rises near his door . Before the earth , then broken for the first time , supplies him with its harvests , he is sheltered , warmed and fed by the bounty of nature . If we look at the scene again , after a generation has passed away , the place is as different from what it was , as civilized from savage man . Here and there a blackened stump , a memorial of the ancient forest , is seen , but the raw desolation is gone , the rich cornfield waves in the breeze , the yellow grain heaves like the ocean , and the garden is sprinkled with fruits and flowers . The wild stream is tamed , and labors like a servant in the factory and mill ; the woods retreat from around him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade . That his children may not be lempted to idleness , the fish are withdrawn from the rivers , the bird from the forest , and the wolf and the bear unwillingly retreat from a place which is no longer for them . Thus provided with the means of subsistence , comfort , and even luxury , we might suppose that nature would leave him there . But no ; she teaches him to build a more durable habitation from the clay or the stone ; the sheepfold and the cotton-plant supply him with clothing ; in place of the smoking torch , his lamp is filled from the depths of the Northern Ocean , and when the trees of the forest begin to fail , he is taught to prepare a fire with the fossil from her mines . The earth brings forth so abundantly , that he has leisure for the cultivation of his mind . The result appears in his ingenious inventions , reducing still lower the amount of labor , and placing in the hands of all the luxuries which were for only a few ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , the research , the habits of thoughtfulness , which are essential to the intellectual and moral being , and which are necessary to give him a full title to the name of man . In this country , it is exceedin0ly important that a taste for these studies should be generally spread . We have already far too much of that excitement , which grows out of the quick sympathy of party associations ; an excitement which grows by indulgence , till communities , like men under the same circumstances , are unable to take any deliberate view of the great questions which it rests with them to decide . This is the great disadvantage of popular institutions ; they imply a thoughtfulness and judgment in the people , while , by placing everything // in their power , they excite them in a manner unknown in other lands . A disadvantage it certainly is ; but it is the disadvantage which attends a great and acknowledged blessing ; and it is made ten times greater than it need be , by the enginery of selfish men , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ; - to blind the Samson , that they may force him to work in their mill . We formerly believed ourselves to be a cool and unimflammable people . It would be strange enough had it been so , considering the race from which we are descended ; it now appears in a thousand indications , that we resemble the anthracite , which , a few years ago , it was thought could not be kindled by the united powers of hurricane and conflagration . The reason was , that the means of igniting it had not then been discovered . So was it with the American character ; it was cool and unexcitable , only because the means of exciting it had not then been learned and arranged into a system , as they are now . The best , perhaps the only remedy , is to supply resources , and engage as many minds as possible in pursuits of a less stirring description ; science , literature , and all the elegant arts , will be so many calm and unpretending , but still efficient means for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is endangered only from within , and which will die by suicide if it perish , and not by any foreign blow . Mr. Swainson gives no very cheering account of the state of natural science in England , and mentions as one reason of its decline , that it is not honored as it should be , and that literature and science are no passport to public honors and rewards . As for titles and similar small matters , these are unimportant enough in themselves ; there is something supremely ludicrous in the idea of George IV . conferring honor on Walter Scott and John Herschel . But , when a country abounds in such distinctions , which are properly regarded as rewards for services that do credit to the country , if a large class of eminent men are excluded from them , it certainly gives the impression that others are preferred before them , and that their services and exertions are not appreciated nor understood . It will not do for a people , who make so much of such concerns as rewards for political services , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are not for them , and that they must find their reward in their own pursuits and the general applause of men ; for such language will apply as well to one class of men as another , and the fact that it is not thought sufficient in the case // of military and political services , shew that it has not much meaning in such a country , though it would be perfectly satisfactory in ours . We do riot suppose that the titles of Cuvier , Laplace and Humboldt were any honor to them ; they were only the signs that their merit was understood , and therefore were an honor to the governments which bestowed them . Great men are m*ot insensible to applause ; they like to know that their country thinks them deserving of honor ; and it is natural enough that they should feel neglected ; if they see re* spect paid to the services of others which is denied to them These are matters , however , with which , in this country , we have very little to do . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might be of service to us . The recommendation that naturalists should be appointed to attend our naval expeditions , might easily be adopted here . They might not go under that designation , perhaps , but some appointment might be secured for them , which would put them beyond the reach of want , and enable them fo pursue their researches under more favorable circumstances than when they go forth alone . The military parties , sent so often into our western regions , might be made far more serviceable than they are , to the cause of science . Much indirect and yet effectual patronage might be extended to able men , by adminjstrations composed of persons who know the value of intellectual things . Something of this kind has already been . done ; but much more remains to do ; and no public men will secure to themselves a more honorable remembrance , than those who add the treasures of other lands to those of our own country . It is for the sake of the country , that we would recommend that such patronage should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be sure of all the respect which they can desire , either for themselves or their favorite pursuits ; but the country ought to secure the benefit and honor to itself as far as possible . Whether it does or not , the pursuits will be followed and discoveries will be made . The studies are too fascinating to need the excitement of external rewards , and , as we have expressly said , it is not on this ground that we think governments would be wise to give them . Those sciences , which make us acquainted with the liberality of nature , are embraced within the province of religion . Those who engage in them most devotedly , have their religious feelings quickened by their familiarity with nature . For science , in our day , // is not satisfied with investigating properties , laws and powers , it insists on looking for benevolent design ; it considers its work unfinished , till it ascertains the purpose of kindness with which everything was created . Thus it is , that religion exerts a commanding influence over all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in the religious direction , that they can travel from glory to glory.
