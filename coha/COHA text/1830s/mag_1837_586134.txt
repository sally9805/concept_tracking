txt ON the seventeenth of January , eighteen hundred and thirtyseven , at the close of the long debate which had taken place in the Senate of the United States on the famous " expunging resolution , " shortly before the vote was to be taken ,  --  of which the issue had not been left doubtful by the previous imperative decision of public opinion ,  --  Col. Benton , of Missouri , rose in his place , and addressing himself to the Vice President in the chair , in the course of a brief but emphatic speech , referring back to the scene which had been enacted on the same spot three eventful years before , on the adoption of Mr. Clay 's memorable resolution of condemnation of the late President for the removal of the deposits , and to his own prophecy , then fearlessly hazarded , that that resolution should be " expunged " by the People of the United States from the journal of the Senate , uttered the following well-known words , which have become imperishably associated with his name : " SOLITARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the moment that the artist has selected as the most strikingly illustrative of the character of the Senator from Missouri ; and no one who has ever seen and heard Col. Benton will hesitate in recognising the features , air , and attitude , of the " Great Expunger . " It is not our design to write a life-much less an eulogy-of Col , lienton . In presenting him as the first of the series of personal sketches of our most conspicuous public men , ( of all parties ) which is to be continued Ltd infinitum in our succeeding numbers , he is selected chiefly on account of the very remarkable position of prominence which he occupies , in connection with the great financial reform of the Government now in progress . Col. Benton is about fifty-four years of age . His senatorial life dates from the year 1820 , when he was elected by the legislature of Missouri , before the formal admission of that State into the Union by Congress . He had removed to Missouri about five years before , from Tennessee ; where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be remembered that the representatives from that State were not admitted to their seats in Congress till the succeeding year . The interval Col. Benton devoted to study , , in preparation for the career which a worthy ambition had already , doubtless , marked out before him , in public life . Within that time he made himself master , in particular , of the Spanish language , and , to a considerable extent , of its literature . He early rose to a prominent // position in the Senate ; and his speech at the session of 1823-4 , on the bill which ( as chairman of a select committee ) he introduced , to amend the Constitution with respect to the mode of the presidential election , was one of remarkable ability and force . It is replete with sound and ar'lent democrati sentiment , and may perhaps be said to contain the key to his subsequent political life . It contained but one erroneous position , of which experience was not long in demonstrating the fallacy . Though he was opposed to the practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislatures of the States , as he was , in fact , to the whole system of an intermediate electoral body between the people themselves and the object of their choice for that high dignity , yet he was in favor of the umpirage of Congress , in the case of a failure to elect a majority candidate by the people on the first trial , with a single equal vote to every State , without reference to population . This was , in our opinion , carrying the State-Rights principle ( our sheet-anchor when not abused ) to an improper extreme , and implied a confidence in Congress , for the exercise of that dangerous power , neither justified by first principles nor by subsequent experience . On this latter point he found himself in natural opposition to Mr. Van Buren , being representatives the one from one of the largest , and the other from one of the least populous , States of the Union . Mr. Van Buren was then , as he has ever since been , in favor of a second appeal to the popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Benton paid a handsome personal tribute to his eminent opponent . Col. Benton sat on the same committee ( Military Affairs ) with Gen. Jackson , of which they were both very industrious and valuable members , the latter being the chairman . Here was necessarily renewed some portion of that intercourse which had in former years been of the most friendly and intimate character , but which had received an unhappy interruption from an occurrence too well known to the public to need further allusion . It was still many years , however , before it did or could resume a tone at all resembling its former character ; and , in fact , no personal explanation of that occurrence , nor allusion to it , ever l ) assed between them until one or two evenings before President Jackson 's departure from this city to the Hermitage last March . That conversation was of a very solemn and affecting character . Long since , indeed , had every trace disappeared from the bosom of each , of that hostile feeling which had had its origin , on Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brother , and the pernicious influence of that pest of society-mischiefmakers ; and which , on the part of Gen. Jackson , the frank , manly , warm-hearted soldier , may be said never to have had an existence ; and its place had been resumed by the memory of early friendship , mutual services , and the equal confidence of each in the honor and integrity of the other . // Col. Benton continued a determined member of the Opposition during the term of Mr. A*dams , as he has been one of the main pillars of support to the demo ratic Administration which succeeded it . It is not necessary to specify the particular occasions on which he has distinguished himself in his parliamentary life . The events are so recent , as they were striking , that they are doubtless fresh within the memory of most of our readers . The panic session can not , however , be passed without a brief notice . In this Col. Benton sustained , unaided , except by the support of two or three gallant friends , ( of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I* ost effective in impromptu debate , ) the whole brunt of the tremendous attack with which the Administration was then assailed , with a fury and powerful array of talent and eloquence never before witnessed in any legislative body . His services then rendered to the democratic cause can never be forgotten , and never repaid , except by the proud consciousness of the eventual triumph by which they have been so signally crowned . 1-lis controversy with Mr. Clay , in the famous Veto debate in 1832 , affords , perhaps , as striking a specimen of his powers in this kind of gladiatorial encounter , as any that could be selected . If on that famous fieldeither party may be said to have been borne worsted to the ground , it certainly was not the democratic orator , whose panache rode proudly , like that of Henri IV , above the tide of the battle , unb'oxved and unsullied . Col. Benton is by birth a North Carolinian , being a native of the county of Orange , and sprung emphatically from the people of that sound republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrious in the number of great men that she has contributed to the young States of the west and south . At various periods within the history of the Government , she has been able to claim as her native sons more than half a dozen of the Senators in Congress ; and at this time she has on the same floor not less than eight members , who may be fairly estimated as among the first men of the day . Even Ohio , in the person of the youngest Senator , has sent a North Carolinian ; and Alabama , Mississippi , and Tennessee would seem almost to believe that none other than a native of that State can do justice to the dignified functions of an American Senator . The ancestors of Col. Benton were among the leaders of the Revolution of 1775 , and contributed in every way to the service of their country . The family of the Hart 's , from which he is descended on the mother 's side , was one of the most active in the State in furtherance of the settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the name of the Transylvania Colony ; and it is sometimes cited by North Carolinians , with no little pride , that the people of that State ( and among them the Hart 's ) were the real backers of the famous Daniel Boon . Col. // Benton may thus claim to be a hereditary defender of the liberties and the rights of the people ; and for this purpose , a reference back to a man 's ancestry may be not only proper , even for a democrat , but praiseworthy , as an honorable incentive to zeal and devotion to . the same good old cause . He is , and has ever been , most emphatically a democrat . He has been faithful to this principle from the outset of his public life , as it will prove faithful to him before its close . He has been a deep student of the history of our Government , as of all ancient and odern times ' , for the great purpose of sustaining the popular cause against all aristocratic usurpation , under whatever form disguised* lie is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palaces of cities , or the elegantly furnished chambers of Offices of Discount and Deposite . ' His constituency is to be found among the hardy and true-hearted pioneers of civilization , in the farthest south and west . His earliest sympathies are with the ploughman and planter of the land , and his political creed is embued with the honesty and simplicity of their lives . His eloquence in debate he caught from the strong native feeling and sagacity of those who till the soil , and substantially produce all the annual w*alth of the nation , and not from the specious sophistries which so many of our American statesmen imbibe insensibly from the legions of speculators of every hue and variety- .. si*hsisting in reality on that great producing masswith which our ciiies swarm . We repeat that it is this arduous devotion to the service of the democratic cause , in opposition to all encroachments on the plain original principle of equality of rights , which has gradually raised the Missouri Senator to his present commanding position , and has given such distinguished *c1at to his name throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all truly great and powerful minds , has through life been a remarkable trait of Col. Benton 's character . Establishing his principles at the outset , basing them all on an unwavering faith in the intelligence and integrity of the people , and guiding his course by the single polar star of the democratic principle , he goes fearlessly forward on his own path , equally unmindful who may oppose or who may follow . He reaches hi 's position , and takes his stand there , waiting for public opinion to come up to him , however far distant it may seem to lag behind ; he does not go back and linger and hesitate with it , but devotes himself , with all his energies and industry , to hasten it forward and quicken its developement . Such a man must necessarily for a long time stand alone ; and it requires a high degree of moral courage , firmness of purpose , and conscientious belief of the truth of his principles , to maintain such a position . He is for a long time regarded , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visionary ultra-as a theorist whose views are too wild for practicability ; enemies will // doubtless christen him and his ideas as a stupendous ltumb g ; ' but in the end the progress of events and of public opinion will probably come up to his position , and the consequence will be that he will then stand forward as its most prominent representative . Such are the men that work great revolutions and reforms ; Though whether , when they have achieved that their mission , they are found to combine with that impulsive energy , which has thus far been their leading attribute , those other qualities suitable to the regulation and conduct of affairs afterwards , on which alone a perfect and safe public confidence can be based , remains a question to be dispassionately considered , and on which we do not pretend to pass an opinion . It is very certain that the authors of revolutions have not unfrequently been those on whom the public confi*dence would be the last to fix as the most suitable persons to preside over the action of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be pointed to in which , after having been so selected by the generous impulse o* popular gratitude , they have proved far from competent to this new an 'd widely different duty . Of this , however , the pubUc opinion , the vox populi , is the best and the only proper judge , and it would ill become us to attempt to forestall it in the slightest degree . There is a great deal of popular misapprehension of Col. Ben*on 's views of fhiancial science , at present the principal question on which the two great parties of the country stand at issue . They hav*e been so long and so loudly denounced as violent andabsurd , in the extremes to which they go , that , notwithstanding our re*peated experience of the rule , that Opposition party clamor against a prominent man ought to work by inverse proportion , some considerable effect has certainly been produced unfavorable to the distinguished Senator , even upon his own party . This effect is somewhat analogous to the cases of Jefferson , whom some good people were honestly made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and private capacity-of General Jackson , whom many actually supposed an illiterate ignorant dotard , whose stubborn honesty was h'is only good quality - of the present incumbent of the same elevated office , whom not a few , even of his own party and friends , have been made , by dint of reiteration and positive assertion , in the very face of repeated facts , to believe a rather timid and time-serving politician , forgetful that moral courage is most concentrated when calmest , deepest when most quiet . Col. Benton 's views , though much misrepresented , have never pointed to a compulsory abolition of all paper money ,  --  or the destruction of banks . The disconnection of the Government from the banking interest  --  the restrictive influence which would be - exerted by confining the fiscal action of the Government to the currency contemplated by the constitution , to moderate the constant tendency of paper money to excess and abuse  --  and the reform // of the anti-republican monopoly feature of the system , as it has hitherto existed-comprise the substance of the views which have often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Benton . The constitutional currency for the minor purposes of life-credit paper for the larger operations of commerce , for those who choose to use its facilities with their eyes open and the privilege of choice-s acknowledged by all the divisions of the democratic party who have followed united under the flag of reform of the late administration , as the common creed ; the only difference of opinion is as to the mode of carrying it into effect  --  a difference of opinion which need not , and can not , long remain a subject of serious party division . We have devoted a former article to the life and character of Nathaniel Macon , one of the purest , wisest , and best democrats , both in theory and practice , that have ever lived . The confidence of such a man would be alone a sufficient testimonial of integrity and patriotic worth to any member of the great party of which he was long one of the most venerated patriarchs . Between him and Col. l3enton there subsisted the most cordial friendship . In Mr. Macon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been given him by his old friend John Randolph . There are some circumstances connected with this famous knife which attach a peculiar interest to the bequest , and which we shall be excused for detailing . The universally pacific character of Mr. Macon is well known ; and the good old man was wont frequently to say that he had passed through the whole course of his active life without a personal collision with any one of his fellow-citizens . To this there was but one single exception , when he was compelled to use a weapon in defence , not of himself , but of his friend Randolph . The occasion was at the theatre in Philadelphia , in 1799 , when several officers of the army made a personal assault on the Virginia orator , against whom they were ( naturally enough* exasperated , for having denounced them in debate , in one of his well known speeches of slashing sarcasm , as " a pack of ragamuffins ! " Mr. Macon , drawing a small pocket-knife , instantly sprang upon the assailants7 whom he routed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this incident , so strongly illustrative of his friendship , that Mr. Randolph presented him with this larger knife . It has " Nathaniel Macon " engraved on the handle ; and seems designed for the most substantial purposes . There were few things about his house that Mr. Macon prized so highly as this relic of his Virginia friend , of which he frequently spoke , recounting the various uses to which it might be put ; adding sometimes that it was a particularly good knife to " rip up " things , and was worthy of belonging to a man of work and courage ; and therefore he bequeathed it to his old friend Benton , who had likewise been the friend of Randolph . // In all the domestic relations of life , Col. Benton is a remarkably exemplary man ; he is highly fortunate and happy in his family . He mixes little in general society , being but rarely tempted by any of its attractions from his own fireside , his family , studies , and the public business to which his zealous attention is unremitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ florid complexion , and powerful frame , capable of endurinb fatig* e , both mental and physical , under which but few other men could bear up . His reputation has been frequently assailed , with reference to his early youth , with slanders utterly false and base , of which he has never condescended to take the slightest notice ,  --  imitating , in this self-confident scorn of such unworthy assailants , the example of the great founder of his political school , Jefferson . One remarkable trait of his public life deserving of notice is the elevation of his ambition above the attractions of office . No one can doubt that during the late administration , his wish could have readily commanded from Gen. Jackson , to whom he rendered a support made , by their peculiar personal relation , so honorable to both , almost any such gratification within the gift of the latter . lie has always , however , preferred to any other the seat which he has so long occupied in the Senate of the United States , as the post ( during all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his principles , and therefore of the highest honor . In the style of his oratory , Col. Benton is forcible , and very effective in the powerful struggle of debate . His manner is rhetorical , and he is at times too diffuse . He is often singularly happy in his metaphorical illustrations , in which he is very abundant , though he is sometimes hurried , in the flow of his language , into metaphors which , once entangled in them , it is not easy to manage very gracefully . A progressive improvement in his oratory has , however , been very evident within the last few years , his taste being purified from some bad habits of style by which it was formerly disfigured . He may be said literally , according to the well known maxim of Cicero , to have made himself , as an orator , having had to struggle against the apparently natural disadvantage of an incorrect and false taste . We have heard the remark made by one of his friends , that his best speech will not be delivered for ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained the age at which Cicero achieved his highest triumphs , before he will have brought out all the capacity of eloquence within him . lie is laborious in preparation of his materials , as he is usually luminous and forcible in their arrangement and use . Some of his best efforts have , however , been entirely extemporaneous . He has that faculty indispensable to greatness , a strong memory ; and his extensive reading , and particularly his familiarity with all ancient and modern history , often supplies him with happy and strikLg illustrations of his positions . But his // great strength consists in the sincere force of his own convictions ; in his unhesitating confidence in the eventual support of his opinions by the verdict of the public judgment ; in the firmness and earnestness of his own will ; in the accumulation of facts which he brings to bear upon his subject , driving his nail home with repeated blows of a hammer that tells whenever it strikes . He is not generally esteemed a pleasing speaker , we believe , by the frequenters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries great weight , and there can be no doubt that his speeches within the last six or eight years have told with a more abiding effect on the mind of the country at large than those of any other individual.
