txt When Dr. Clarke , the traveller , was entering the waters of Egypt , he saw the corpse of one who had fallen in the battle of thi Nile , rise from its grave in the ocean , and move slowly past the vessels of the fleet . It was with somewhat similar misgivings , that we saw the resurrection of Lord Byron from the waves of time , which soon close over the noblest wreck , und leave no trace of the spot where it went down . Unless there were something new to be said in his favor , it seemed needless to bring him again before the public eye . The world // was as well acquainted with his frailties as with his transcendent powers ; the sentence of the general voice , which is not often reversed , had been pronounced , though with much hesitation ; he was declared entitled to a place among the great ; but , though he had the elements of a noble nature , no one , so far as we know , claimed for him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have his name and character brought up again for judgment , unless for the purpose of vindication . Such is not the effect , whatever may have been the design of the volume before us . Mr. Moore , though he loved and honored Byron , has , iu thus gratifying the public curiosity , rendered no service to the memory of his friend . We are disposed to rank high among the better feelings of our nature the one which leads us to spare and respect the dead , and makes us indignant at every attempt to draw their frailties to the light , which can not plead necessity in its justification . We feel grateful to those who have delighted us , even when they have done so with their enchantments ; we are beholden to them for whiling away some of the drearier hours of existence ; and when they are gone , where our gratitude or censure can no longer reach them , we feel as if their memory were left in our charge , to be guarded from wanton condemnation . We could see their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more patience , than we can see their reputation made the sport and gain of mercenary writers . We know that the Life of Johnson is a standing excuse for authors of this description , though we see not why ; for Boswell would sooner have cut off his hand , than have wilfully disparaged his illustrious friend ; ' and through all his defects of judgment and style his great subject towers , like Westminster Abbey , whose melancholy grandeur is not destroyed by the meanness of the objects round it . In his work , there is no violation of that sacred law of human feeling , which , like the geutle process of nature , seals up the grave , and covers it with verdure and flowers . But this law has been , sadly broken in the case of Byron ; a man , who , with all his faults  --  and we have no disposition to deny them-was never wanting in generosity to his friends . Some of them have preyed on his memory like vultures ; from the religious Mr. Dallas , who was dissatisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leigh Hunt , who intimated his independence of the commonplace opinion , which iqsists on gratitude for golden favors . Others , also , of the // strange companions among whom the chances of his life and the waywardness of his temper threw him , retailed his most unguarded words and actions , subjecting him to a scrutiny which few men 's lives and language will bear . But the public feeling , which is not apt to be permanently misled , had settled down into the conviction , that Byron , with all his failings , was to be admired and pitied as well as censured ; that he was an unfortunate man of genius , made up originally of strong powers and passions ; obliged to pass through the double trial of prosperity and misfortune , both perhaps equally severe ; and by these disturbing forces , drawn aside from the orbit , in which , with a happicr destiny , he might still have been shining as brilliantly as any great light of the world . We do not , of course , mean to rank the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this publication . In his case , something of this kind was necessary ; it was understood that Lord Byron made him the residuary legatee of his infirmities and errors , leaving in his charge a manuscript journal , which , it was said , Mi ' . Moore thought proper to destroy . Such was the prevailing impression , whatever the facts may have been ; and this act , dictated doubtless by the most honorable feelings , was justly thought to bear severely on the character of his noble friend . It gave indulgence and encouragement to the most unfavorable imaginations ; it was declaring that the pages on which Byron poured out his thoughts and feelings , were only worthy of the flames . It was expected , that , if this registry was not so thoroughly disgraceful , Mr. Moore would come forward to declare it ; he has accordingly done so , and given us parts of this same journal , recovered from its ashes , with various original letters ; he has , so far as was possible , made Byron the historian of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own words ; he feels obliged , however , to caution us against being misled by the poet 's statements , because , with a strange inverted ambition , he took pleasure in representing himself as worse than he really was . This is no doubt true ; but one may doubt whether it will do much to exalt Byron *hove the level where he chose to stand ; this self-misrepresentation would imply some want of reverence for truth , and it would seem as if the moral sentiment must be not alittle corrupted when a man glories in his shame . Still , it would be wrong to lay much stress on these avowals , which , wherever they appear , are partly jesting and partly penitential ; meant to // bear either aspect , as the case may be : the language of confession is apt to be exaggerated ; jests are not to be weighed like scripture ; and as most men in their confessions meant for the public eye , with the contrition alluded to by Chesterfield , confess themselves guilty of what they consider the cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Moore does not attempt to give any regular examination of Byron 's character , aware , perhaps , that the thing was imnpossible ; for , if by character be meant the decided leaning of the habits and feelings towards good or evil , it would be no more correct to speak of his character , than of the bearing of a vessel drifting on the sea ; or if we mean by character , the general impression received by one who reads his history , it is evident that such an one could gather no single impression . Every change in Byron 's life was a new experiment or adventure suggested by the moment 's whims ; each new deed contradicted the report of the one that went before it ; like the mercury in the xveather-glass , he varied with the changes of the air . Sometimes he rose to a noble height of virtue ; then sunk low in degradation : sometimes he breathed out noble sentiment in inspired language ; then profaned his lips with the dialect of hell : sometimes he practised a hermit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion . The very climate of the country where he happened to he , seemed to spread its inQuence over him . All his manliness melted away into effeminacy under an Italian sun ; all the strength of his mind and heart seemed to revive among the living shores and mountains of Greece ; and this , while it shows that he had great and active energies within , proves also , that , like others who want principles of action , he needed something external to excite them . In him , these principles , and the unconquerable will , were entirely wanting ; the rough hands of others struck out the fire from his soul . His inconsistencies arising from this cause , are equally perplexing to his enemies and admirers ; each falter in making up their judgment ; the former hesitate in the midst of their sternest condemnation , conscious that all was not evil , and doubtful , whether they are not more just to his vices than his virtues ; while his admirers , in the moments of their warmest enthusiasm , find recollections stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , too , doubt sometimes whether they are not misled by their reverence for Genius , and hardly know whether they feel most sorrow for its perversion or wonder at its power . // His biographer was evidently perplexed with this difficulty , and has therefore left the private character of Byron to be inferred from facts and letters , with here and there some pages of comment and explanation . lie does not bring the subject to any full discussion , but praises his friend wherever he can do so with justice , and defends him where his conduct seems to require defending . His remarks are written with more than his usual simplicity ; in fact , with very little of . the glowing ornament in which his other writings abound ; but , notwithstanding this improvement , the work is not likely to be a favorite with either class of readers . The poet 's admirers will think that more discretion should have been used in selecting private letters , and that the follies of his youth should , like those of others , be forgotten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder why the biographer could not communicate to others the feelings with which , according to his own account , his friend 's talents and virtues inspired him . On the other hand , a large class will accuse Mr. Moore , not only of suppressing , but of making rather too light of the poet 's misdeeds ; of treating as a trifling offence in him , what would have been severely visited upon any other ; as in the case of his brother , for example ( p. 118 ) , they will charge him with making the flower-gardens of poetry a sanctuary for transgressors of moral and social law . Both these faults , inconsistent with each other , as they seem , will be alleged against him . On the whole , the effect of his book will be to lower the character of Byron in the public esteem . No one can charge him with a want of partiality to his subject , and yet , with every disposition to cover the poet 's errors , he finds much that he can not explain away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candor for which none of Byron 's admirers will thank him ; for , in the common estimation , follies bring one into contempt much sooner than vices ; men can find something great and commanding in the one , while it is impossible to respect the other . The literary fate of Byron is a remarkable example of the indulgence shown to men of genius . The world is apt to be rigid enough in its exactions from others , but it off3ws them a perpetual absolution for all offences , even for their waste of those powers by which it wishes and hopes to be delighted ; it receives these spendthrifts of talent with unwearied forgiveness , however far they may have wandered ; it permits them , like conquerors , // to trample on all rights and laws ; it finds something beautiful in their very scorn ; nations worship them in the blaze of their fame , and weep with mournful sensibility over their fall . We rejoice to see that the world can transfer its enthusiasm in any degree from military to intellectual greatness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of adoration . In the unguarded moments of rapture it may place its honors on unworthy brows , and thus hold out an encouragement to all kinds of perversion . Intellectual men should read their duty as well as triumph in a nation 's eyes ; and whenever , in their writings , they pass the limits of decency and moral restraint , instead of doing it with the confidence that great errors will be pardoned to great genius , should feel themselves driven back by a lightning glance of indignation . When the power of the mind is growing so fast , it is of immense importance to make the feeling of literary obligation firm and strong , and to enforce it with an authority which will neither he defied hor resisted and this can be done without difficulty , because men of taste , and poets more than others , have their intellectual being in the world 's good opinion . The poet , more than all , needs this restraint of general opinion . The historian makes a slow and patient impression on others ; the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is felt in a space hardly broader than the thunder-cloud of the storm ; hut the works of Byron , like those of Scott , not confined to the bounds of their language , bave been read , we have no doubt , by the northern light at Tornea , and by the pine-torch under the Rocky Mountains ; and in all the various regions between made the wayfaring forget their weariness , and the lonely their solitude , bearing enjoynient to a million of hearts at once , as if by supernatural power . No human power can rival that of the great poet of the day , and , should it become wild and lawless , no despotism under which the earth suffers and mourns is half so fatal to the interests of men . Perhaps there never was one , to whom the right direction which the world thus has it in its power to give , was more important than to Byron ; for as may appear in what we shall say of him , he was remarkably deficient in self-dependence , except when wrought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his genius . Powerful , indeed , he was ; he came not at a time when the field of success was open ; perhaps there has not been a period , when a greater // number of bright stars were met in the heavens . Campbell was shining in the pure brilliancy of his stainless fame ; Sonthey was pouring out his wild and beautiful epics with a happy disregard of party censure ; Wordsworth was pleading , as he believed , for neglected nature , with a gentle and unregarded voice ; Moore was reposing , like an eastern sovereign in his sultry halls ; at this moment , apparently most inauspicious for his rising , did this new and eccentric orb shoot from the horizon to the upper sky , and in every step of his ascension held men breathless with admiration , till his brightness was changed into blood . ' But he seemed to take a perverse delight in trifling with his own power , and showing that he valued an imagination as splendid as ever was lighted in the soul , no more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deafened him with applause , even when he poured out strains of sensuality in music worthy of an angel 's tongue . Nothing would convince men of his dishonor ; they still believed in his integrity , as they insisted on regarding Napoleon as a friend of freedom , long after he had worn the crown . Let it not be thought strange , that we associate these two names ; for great as Napoleon was , Byron was absolute and undisputed sovereign of the heart  --  a region in which the other had no power . Byron could send to millions the highest enjoyment , with a few rapid touches of his celestial pen ; and while the throne of the oppressor is broken , he still exerts a mastery which grows and widens as the brass and marble decay . They were not wholly unlike in their destinies ; deluded by the reverence of men , each became a suicide of his own welfare ; and , remembering that they are great examples to all future ambition , we regret the less that they perished as they did ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one as the bravest warrior that ever fought the battles of freedom , the other as the greatest poet of his age . Any observer of human nature may be interested in the fact , that men are always most zealous in their enthusiasm for characters , which are somewhat doubtful , as well as great . The admirers of a man like Washington criticise him with freedom , knowing that he can only gain by discussion ; but the partisans of eminent characters like those I have mentioned , as if conscious that any opening for inquiry would overthrow their favorite passion , meet every suggestion of the kind , with an outcry pi*ecisely resembling that with which the worm-eaten governments // of Europe welcome every proposal of reform . This fervor is not so flattering to such men as is generally imagined ; it implies that their admirers are far from being persuaded of their real excellence , though they are resolute in maintaining their own opinion . This is illustrated by the passion for Byron . When he first became generally known , which was not till after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surrounded with a colored cloud of romantic associations ; and perceiving the charm to he derived from the slight mystery then resting on his condition and character , he kept up the allusion by all the means in his power ; new portraits of himself in striking attitudes and drapery , were perpetually held before the public eye ; and by these means he inspired a deep feeling , not precisely of respect or regard , but of something more tenacious than either ; so that now his admirers hold fast their early opinions of him , as a lover clings to his first irupressbus ; determined to maintain them right or wrong , and resenting as a personal affront every attempt to exhibit his character in its true light . this hook will give an unpleasant shock to their imaginations ; but at the same time , they have seen his character in a glass so darkly-there is so little distinctness iii their conceptions of him , that like the spirits in Milton 's battle , his existen*e can not be endangered hy any mortal blow-he is a vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opinion of him is not a judgment , but a feeling , which neither argument nor evidence can overthrow . But there are others , who never have thought it necessary to give up their hearts to the great poet of the day-who have neither taken part with Byron nor against him ; to them , this book will wear a very different aspect ; they will receive it as the deliherate testimony of a friend , of course as partial as truth and justice will allow , and will see with some surprise , that the strongest feelings awakened by it are those of sorrow and shame . It is painful to see this disproportion between the moral and intellectual characters of distinguished men ; and though history might prepare them for such disappointment , they are always dismayed to find those , to whom heaven has been most liberal of its gifts , unfaithful in the use of them . Their kind feeling will be severely tried by this Life of Byron ; they will say of his mind , as he did of Greece , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the residence of the gods , man should take a mad delight in making a wilderness and a ruin . // For witbout overstating his defects , it is true , that they will look in vain through this work for any traces of a sense of duty , either in the use of his social privileges or his intellectual powers ; they will see too much levity and profaneness , without wit or humor to cover its grossness ; they will see something offensive at times in the style of the biographer 's apologies for him , when they are made , not as if necessary , but in deference to common opinion ; they will find , that he went through the world at the wind 's pleasure , and that his path , though occasionally lighted up with flashes of good feeling , was not such as his friends love to remember . In the natural regret for this waste of life and talent , they may chance to visit his memory with even more severity than it deserves ; and therefore we take the opportunity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his merits can not be understood , and which will show , that with all his apparent felicity of birth and fortune , he was more to be pitied than condemned . The chief misfortune of Byron was bis want of early kindness and instruction . The mind resembles a garden , in which flowers and fruit must be cultivated , or weeds will grow ; and few could be found , even among vagrants and outcasts , more unfortunate than Byron in the guardians of his tender years . His father was a worthless libertine , who , after the death of his first victim , married Miss Gordon , the poet 's mother , with a view to her property , which was large , but soon wasted . His great uncle , from whom he inherited his title , was a man of savage and unsocial character , who was believed to have murdered a gentleman in a quarrel . With him , however , he had no intercourse , nor even with his father , who was soon separated from his wife ; so that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more injudicious guide of a youth so wild and passionate , could not have been any where found . It has been generally thought that she was fondly indulgent ; but the present work effectually clears her memory from any such imputation : she was a woman of violent temper , and rendered still more irritable by her husband 's treatment , though she seems to have loved him affectionately after all her wrongs . If to leave her child ungoverned was indulgence , she was guilty ; but it could not be expected , that , having no rule over her own spirit , she should be equal to the harder duty of governing her son . Neglect , however , was not the worst offence for which she is answerable ; she was the author of that bitterness of spirit , which // made him , though at some times mild and affectionate , at others so sullen and ferociaus ; for it seems that she forgot herself so far as to taunt him with that slight lameness , which caused him so much misery in his after years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his feeling ; the truth is , that in almost any young person , such vulgar allusions to a personal defect , however trifling , xviii awaken an exccssive sensibility amounting to horror : all the self-torturing energy of the soul will he concentrated on that single point ; and if the wound ever heals in the coldness of manhood or age , it leaves a quick and homing scar . I his disease of the affections extended throughout his mind and heart ; and to this we are hound to attribute that jealousy which occasionally seemed like madness : and that unsparing resentment of injury which sometimes raged like a flame of fire . Knowing this , we can not wonder that he regarded his mother without affection , alone as they were in the world . At the same time he discovers in his letters a respect and attention , which clear him from all reproach on this subject she could expect nothing more of him ; for love is the price of love . Neither were the defects of his domestic education repaired by schools . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , and he was passed from hand to hand with a view to save expense rather than give instruction . None of his various masters had time to become acquainted with his mind ; and without such an acquaintance with the tastes and powers of the young , teachers are often like unskilful gardeners , who destroy hy watering in the sunshine , those blossoms whose habit is to close in preparation for a shower . None of them retained their charge long enough to gain an influence over him . Altogether he had none to lean upon , and no worthy object for his affections to cling to , which is one of the greatest wants of the young and tender heart . This sufficiently accounts for many of his faults ; it explains where his careless desolation began : it shows why he placed so little confidence in the merit and affection of others , why he was so unbelieving in their virtue , and afterwards so indifferent to his own . It accounts for that misanthropy which some suppose was affected , but which there is every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he depended on others , ardently as he thirsted for their applause , still , like all others who have no faith in human virtue he held them in light esteem . Those who can not live xvithout the world 's flattery , sometimes despise the incense-bearers ; // and the person who depends least upon others , is not the misanthrope , but he who takes a manly and generous interest in all around him . Thus melancholy and disheartening was his childhood . Instead of being the gallant bark that Gray describes , standing bravely out to the summer sea , it was the one built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark , ' whose destiny was foreseen by the thoughtful before it left the shore . It may be said , that he might have done like many others whose parents have been unfaithful , and who , by this misfortune , have been driven to that self-education , which Gibbon considers more important than any other . But Lord Byron was most unfavorably situated : this self-discipline is seldom enforced with vigor or success without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition combining with a sense of duty . But Byron was above the reach of that necessity , which drives so many to great and fortunate exertions . Though poor in childhood , when his wants were few , he had before him what seemed a prospect of unbounded wealth ; and the same expectation of rank and honor made him insensible to the call of intellectual glory . He knew that his title would secure him respect , and in this confidence was unambitious of any thing higher ; it see med to be the brightest point in all his visions of future greatness . Those , who , born in humble life , feel the stirrings of ambition , and have no path to eminence open but such as they clear with their own hands , enter upon the work with a vigor which at once gives and strengthens character , and ensures success . Byron , on the contrary , believed from his childhood that he should be respected for his rank alone : it was not till he had reached this treat object of desire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish or hope for any other distinction . The effect of this want of education in mind and character , may be seen in almost every part of his life ; even in those illuminated pages which display the triumphs of his genius . He never seems to have had the least confidence in his own taste or judgment with respect to his own prod uctions or those of others . We find him on his return from his first voyage , talking with delight of an imitation of Horace , which his biographer is too conscientious to praise , and at the same time , hardly prevailed upon by the most earnest intreaty , to publish Childe Harold , the work on which his fame is built . A taste of this kind is as much formed by society , as by reading and medita // tion ; but he had acquired a bashful reserve in his childhood , which prevented his reading the eyes or minds of others ; and yet , as the public opinion is the tribunal to which all must how , he never felt confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . In his judgment of others , he seemed governed by the partiality of the moment . We find him speaking with delight of Coleridge 's Christabel , or praising Leigh Hunt 's affectations , which he was the first to ridicule shortly after . The same wavering appears in his judgment of the English Bards and Scotch Reviewers  --  a work which he afterwards recanted for no other reason than that his humor had altered . The entire history of this work of wholesale vengeance illustrates the indccision of his mind . In his first indignation at an attack which was certainly enough to irritate a meeker spirit , he forthwith drew his sxvord and commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of all about him ; but as soon as the moment 's madness had passed away , he began to bind up their wounds , at the same time exulting that he had made them feel his power . But the want of every thing like discipline was more plainly manifested in his character ; it was left to itself ; so far as he ever had a character it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings and passions . These feelings and passions were suffered to grow and take their own direction , without the least care or control from any hand . What affectionate instruction might have done , we do not know ;  --  the experiment was never tried ; he was left to his own guidance , and by feeding on extravagant hopes , he prepared himself to be hurt and disappointed by the ordinary changes of life . Never having been taught what to expect and what he might reasonably demand from others , he received every slight neglect as an injury , put the worst construction on every word and deed , and required of the world what it never gave to any mortal man . In Scotland , his fancy was excited with tales and examples of high ancestral pride ; - rank became , in his eyes , something sacred and cornmanding ; and there was enough in the history of the Byrons to encourage his loftiness of feeling ; hut he was morPfied as he came forward into life , to find that the respect paid to it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lords with as little ceremony as at Eton or Harrow ; and this , though probably a thing of course , was resented by him as an unexampled wrong , for which he insulted the Lord Chancellor at the time , and afterwards impaled Lord Carlisle in various // satirical lines ; though the only crime of the former was , that he did not dispense with legal forms in bis favor , and Lord Carlisle 's transgression , that he did not come at a call . He was still more painfully taught how little could be claimed on the score of rank , by the attack of the Edinburgh Review . He could not plead privilege before that bar ; a republican from the United States could not have been treated with less ceremony than the English Baron ; and it appeared in evidence , that with a regard for principle , of which that work has given more than one example , it abused the poetry for the sake of the man , though his rank was all the provocation . He was also constantly wounded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion , cherished for reasons which he would have found it hard to assign ; in its objects , there was no particular merit , save what was generously given them by his active imagination ; his little foot-page and his Athenian protege were of this description ; yet he expected of these and others , selected with even less discretion , all the delicacy and ardor of attachment , which might belong to superior natures . He was of course disappointed ; and by a process of abstraction found sufficient reasons to libel and detest mankind . Thus in almost every year some favorite charm was broken-some vision dispelled ; lie came forward into life , like one seeing from afar the family mansion of his race , with its windows kindled by the setting sun  --  and who , as he approached it , looking for life and hospitality withinfound with dismay , as he entered the gate , that all was dark , cold , and deserted . Byron 's melancholy seems to have been owing to these peculiar circumstances of his life . Bright hopes and painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that which attends the gratified desireof all others , he most difficult to bear . He was his own master , and had all that men commonly wish for ; lie was thus in a condition where , so far as resources of happiness were concerned , he had nothing more to hope from the world , and that state in which any change must be for the worse , is found by experience to be more intolerable than that in which any change must be for the better . How far his depression was owing to any thing constitutional , we can not attempt to say , being less acquainted with the nerves of poets than with those of reviewers ; but we believe that there are few cases in which // the evil spirit may not be successfully resisted by a resolute will . Unfortunately , those unused to trouble , real or imaginary , become desperate at once , and are ready to make trial of any remedy , to drive the moment 's uneasiness axvay ; by dissipation and violent cxcitement they remove its pressure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns with heavier weight ; and at last , like the cottager who burns the thatch and rafters of his cabin to relieve the cold of a winter day , they are left without the least chance of shelter ; to supply the vacancy of hope , they consume the materials of happiness at once , and then travel from desolation to desolation , having no resource left , but to become miserable self-destroyers of their own peace , character , and not unfrequently lives . We regret to find the vulgar impression that this melancholy was owing to his poetical talent , countenanced by such authority as Mr. Moore 's ; though he does not openly declare that such is his opinion , he intimates that faults and sorrows both were owing to the restless fire of genius . ' This we believe to be one of the worst heresies in public opinion ; beside being dangerous and misleading , it is unjust to the noblest of all arts . Were there no other young men of rank and fortune , equally dissipated with Lord Byron , or did all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ? Why need we assign more refined causes for his corruption than for theirs ? And more than all , xvhy offer this immunity to those who waste the talent , which was given to bless the world , which we deny to the inferior prodigals of wealth and time ? It is unquestionably true , that a quick imagination gives a sharper edge to sorrow , by multiplying , changing , and coloring its images , but it has equal power over images of joy , if the poet can be made to look upon the bright side ; and as this depends on his own choice , we can not sympathise with him very deeply if he insist on being unhappy ; we will not throw the blame , which belongs to himself , either on poetry or nature . It is time that justice in this respect were done to poetry ; it is a full fountain of consolation ; so far from being a Marah in the wilderness of life , there is healing in its waters . The greatest masters of the lyre have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers ; and while poetry doubles their happiness by its inspirations , it has been found effectual , from the days of Saul till the present , to drive dark thoughts from the soul . No man was ever more indebted to poetry than Lord Byron ; we say // nothing of his reputation , though without poetry , he would have left no more name than a thousand other lords ; but we consider him indebted to poetry for all the bright hours that silvered his path of life . That he was a miserable man , no one can doubt , who knows any thing of the effect of distempered fancy and ungovernable pass*ns ; but while he was wildly sacrificing one after another the resources for happiness which surrounded him , and seemed to take an insane pleasure in seeing those treasures melted down in the fires of passionwhile he was surrounded by associates , who were enough to put to flight all those better feelings , which could not quite forsake him , even when he seemed most resolute to let them go-while in self-inflicted banishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke of it with hatred and scorn-while his xvild , fierce , and riotous mirth , only manifested the self-condemnation and torture within-he was indebted to poetry , for fanning the embers of his better naturefor kindling up those flashes of manly and generous emotion , which , trausient and wavering though they were , have been enough to secure for him the admiring compassion of the world . Nothing can extinguish this sacred light of the soul ; it is an immortal element , which floods can not drown ; it often revealed to him the true character of his companions , and his own conduct , making him heart-sick of the scenes in which his life was wasted , and the associates among whom he was thrown ; it led him to all the excellence which he ever knew ; and when weary of degradation , he made one last effort with his foot on the native soil of inspiration , to rise to his proper place among the sons of light , it was evidently owing to poetry , that any thing worthy to redeem , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to poetry , by saying , as is often said , in the case of Byron , that misery is the parent of its inspirations . Poetry is the work , not of circumstances , hut of mind ; of disciplined and poxverfnl mind ; which so far from being the sport of circumstances , makes them bend to its power . There is neither romance , nor elegance in real distress ; it is too real , oppressive , and disheartening ; the mind , so far from dwelling upon it , turns away with disgust and aversion . The person in suffering of body or mind , no more thinks of the fine emotions his situation awakens , than the soldier bleeding on the plain , who would exchange the fame of C*sar for a drop of water to cool his burning tongue . It is true , that such a person often ex // presses himself in poetical , that is , in strong language ; but this is not poetry , which expresses a vivid imagination of the sorrow , rather than the reality , and implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depth and power of language , to which real suffering is a stranger . The whole advantage which a poet derives from accjuaintanc e with grief , is the same he might borrow from being present in a storm at sea ; he could no more describe his emotions , at the moment when every nerve is strained and wrung with grief , than he could sit down to paint the sublimity of the tempest , when the vessel lets in water at every seam . Afterwards , he may remember the circumstances , and recall the feelings ; and if he do it with judgment and selection , may affect the minds of his readers with impressions similar to his own . But he can not do this , till the fear and anguish are gone ; or at least , till he finds a consolation in the exercise of his mind , which makes him forget his sorrows . No stronger confirmation of this can be given than the lines addressed to Thyrza , which exceed all lyrical poetry in the language for the deep feeling which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the emotions , if he ever had felt them , were at the moment of writing , dictated by the fancy rather than the heart . While therefore we believe that Byron was melancholy in his temperament , we do not believe that poetry was either the cause or the effect of his depression ; his sadness was owing to the circumstances of his life ; but whether natural or accidental , it must be admitted in extenuation of his faults , because even if accidental , it was formed at an early period by events , over which he had but little control . We make these remarks , not by any means because we consider these circumstances as a full justification of Byron 's character ; but because this book will give a very unfavorable impression ; and as title and fortune are generally thought to be names for happiness , it may chance to be forgotten , that there was any thing in his condition to be pleaded in excuse for his transgressions . His reputation needs the apology , and he has a right to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some may wonder to hear the name unfortunate ' applied to this great favorite of the world ; and yet , whoever reads his life with any attention , will feel that there are few so little to be envied as he . There is something inexpressibly dreary in his history . He never knew any thing of a father 's kindness , nor in truth of // 1830 . Moore 's Life of Byron . 183 a mother 's love ; there was no hand to point out to him the right way , and no strong arm on which his own might lean : his was no school to prepare him for a virtuous life ; and perhaps such a life would not have been expected of him , if his mind , undisciplined as his character , had not displayed such remarkable vigor . Expected or not , such a life is not here recorded ; and all we ask is , that whoever is painfully struck with this account of his conduct , would take all its palliations , such as they are , into view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this work ; and as this volume must have been in the hands of nearly all our readers , we shall not give the particulars of his life , though many are curious and interesting ; particularly such as show how comfortless a splendid life may be . Much light is thrown upon the promise of his youth ; the strong testimonials of affection given by some of his companions , show that he had warm and generous feelings to those whom he loved , but that he was sufficiently haughty and sour to others , with or without provocation . He was in no wise ambitious of improvement in the schools ; but rather made it a point of honor to rebel against their discipline , which he ever afterwards held in contempt , as men hate that which they have injured . His biographer considers this impatience of restraint an evidence of genius , which , in his opinion , needs no such aids nor laws , and is therefore at liberty to defy them . If the remarks made on this subject were intended to hear upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they seem meant as a reflection upon all classical studies pursued in schools . The writer quotes Lord Byron 's saying of Virgil and Horace-that his school acquaintance with those classics gave him a distaste for them ever after . The whole truth probably was , that he never troubled himself to ascertain the strength and fidelity of his early associations . Had he read them in maturer years , it is impossible that such boyish recollections should have made him insensible to their beauties ; and he would at least have felt , that such a defect of taste and judgment is what one should sooner confess than avow . He could have meant nothing more than to express in a decided manner his aversion to schools ; and in this his biographer goes with him , bringing forward great examples of those who felt the same aversion . But it happens , unfortunately for the argument , that these were , most of them , such as had been censured and disgraced at such institutions . It // is not probable that it was a deliberate conviction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate its laws ; the irregularities of youth are more easily accounted for ; but those who know how long resentment for such disgrace endures , will not wonder that it influenced their judgment in manhood and age . But this , their partial evidence , is carried further than it was meant to go . We can not say that Milton was in favor of anarchy , hecause he wrote against oppression ; nor that he was opposed to religion , because he rejected certain doctrines . There may have been many defects in the education of his day , which revealed themselves to his prophetic eye before they were seen by others ; but this is an argument not for destruction but reform . We regret to see such intimations in this work ; deliberate opinions we can not suppose them to be . We do not believe that the writer , though he thinks that the Greeks wrote their language in such purity because they abstained from every other , would recommend a similar abstinence to his readers ; when it was owing in them to the want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor of acquiting it . Nor do we suppose that he would seriously advise us to break up such institutions , and leave the young to forage in the fields of learning and science for a precarious subsistence . To resist the authorities of the schools was not a sure way to make a lXlilton , nor is every one likely to become a Franklin who runs away from home . But he should have guarded against perversion of his opinions ; that they might not countenance the irregularities of genius ; that idle impression , which has kept so many fine minds from feeling the necessity of improvement , and inspired so many dunces with a sweet confidence in their own talents , founded on their defiance of all control . Byron and many others became great , not by their transgressions , but in spite of them ; had he submitted to the usual discipline of youth , or , more properly speaking , had he enjoyed it , he might have led a better and happier life , and left no cause for his admirers to blush for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished the world less , he might have secured a more enviable immortality . In speaking of Byron 's infidelity , Mr. Moore indulges in a fanciful speculation on unbelief in general , regarding it as a fortunate ciicumstance , that si*ch skepticism does not begin till the character is already formed . We can not easily persuade // ourselves that the character is ever formed without some dcci-. sion of the mind and heart either for or against religion . The character may begin to lean in one or another direction ; but religion , if it have any power , must exert it in fixing that direction , and its mere absence from the heart may have the same effect with infidelity . But we can not conceive of any one groxving up to the age of thoughtfulness , to the time when tastes are decided and hahits fully formed , without asking himself whether he believes in his own immortality , if he grow up under religious influences , and afterwards become persuaded that religion is not sustained by evidence , his infidelity may be less injurious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Christianity , whatever he may think of its divine origin . But with respect to Byron , as his biographer testifies , and we believe with respect to others , the case is different ; infidelity begins at an earlier a * e-th eage when the mind first discovers its own powers , and exults in its conscious freedom  --  the age when it has not yet learned that the trodden path is not to he despised , and takes pride in defying common opinion-at such an age , the mind is much more likely to shape its religion to its wishes , than to submit its wishes to religion ; and it is easier for LiS to believe , that Lord Byron , and others like him , fashioned their faith after the taste of the moment , than that they reasoned on the subject after the manner of Herbert and Hume . Byron had become associated at such an age as this with a number of young men , who , taking his own description , were not likely to exert a happy influence over a lawless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom he has paid so beautifbl a tribute in Childe Harold  --  a man of remarkable promise , if xve may judge from the eulogies of his friends , but a professed atheist , and fond of employing his wit on subjects which any man of principle , whether atheist or Christian , would have kept apart from profanation . Byron held him in great respect , and was doubtless injured by his influence ; the more so from his having previously thought , or at least expressed himself with some interest on religious subjects ; having at no period of his life any great confidence in himself , he was easily laughed out of his religion , and , to show the sincerity of his contempt for it , may have made a show of indifference to it which he did not really feel ; at any rate , it was driven from his thoughts ; and he seldom speaks of it at // all , except when he paints the desolation of his feeling ; and the very dreariness which he ascribes to him , who can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the hope of immortality , though he felt that the wilderness about him would not be complete , if any shoot from the tree of life were seen to grow . But there was nothing in his habits of life , which could make this a welcome subject , except for the poetical interest which it afforded ; and therefore he dismissed it , as one parts from a stranger , not as he tears from his heart the friend whom he is compelled to believe untrue . It is in this way , that young infidels are generally formed . Unbelief is too strong a word for their state of mind , if it mean that they have rejected Christianity from want of evidence to satisfy their minds ; for there is so little to make this a pleasing subject of contemplation to them-so little in it that flatters , and so much that condemns-they have learned so little of the importance of its hopes , having never yet found the springs of common enjoyment dry , that they do not suffer it to come near enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rest in that state of unbelief which amounts to indifference , and , though they sometimes startle others by a parade of infidelity , do not differ from thousands who call themselves believers ; and they are not worse than they would be , if they bore the name of Christians . Mr. Moore has given a very liberal account of the attack of the Edinburgh Review ; which , however painful to Byron at the time , was a fortunate humiliation for him , as it taught him the secret of his own powers . Mr. Moore thinks that we judge these poems more favorably from our impressions received from his later writings ; but we suspect that the association of the splendid efforts of later years with his imperfect beginnings would not tend to raise the latter in our estimation . The effect would be that of contrast , and would make us think of the first attempts more meanly than they deserve . The question , however , is not , whether the poems were good or bad ; we think that many of them are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such a severe infliction , which , to Byron , who had high ideas of the majesty of reviews , was a tremendous blow . Whether the attack was jusfiflable or not-the manner no one will defend  --  the review had no reason to boast its success . For , though Byron retorted in a poem , which , with all its excellence and vigor , is wanting in consistency and // justice-which , iii many parts was unpardonably insulting to those , who , like Scott , had never offended him-though he goes far beyond the review in the very transgression of which he complained-still , so heartily did the public feeling go with him in his resentment , that his work was received with unbounded applause . The whole history of this affair deserves attention , as showing how little there was fixed and decided in Byron 's character . XVhen the review took the only ground that was left it after his Childe Harold appeared , and with amiable unconsciousness professed its surprise that he should have suspected it of unkind intentions , he was melted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he hastened to repair the injury lie bad done by suppressing the English Bards and Scotch Reviewers . All this was well ; for he did it on his own account more than theirs ; what we xvouid remark , is the confidence in his own powers which sprang from his success on this occasion , when the fires of genius were kindled by those of passion . It was a limited confidence ; though he knew himself mighty , he did not judge with more confidence than before , of the respective merits of his different productions . As far as it went , it was sustained by the general feeling ; and when that foundation gave way , or rather , when in their dislike for his person , his countrymen began to underrate his mind , abusing him with zeal proportioned to their former idolatry , he , with his usual recklessness , set the general feeling at defiance : not because he had laid any deep plans of revenge , or approved at heart of profaneness and sensuality , but because he felt for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could no longer entertain , he would defy the world . We do not believe that he could have given a reason why he attacked so many unoffending poets in his satire ; we do not believe that he could have drawn the poisoned element of Don Juan from any deep fountains in his own heart ; we do not believe that he could have explained much of the conduct of his life , except by saying that such was his humor : it had been freely indulged through all his youth , and this was the reason that he would do and say what he could not justify , rather than seem under any control ; this was the reason , that , when he had no longer a home , but was , like his Cain , a wanderer , he put on this resolute air of independence , to show that he could take his ease in his own inn . ' Such characters are never resolute , but when they take their stand against others-so long as the // opposition lasts , their firmness endures ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xvhat is right or wrong , they go as far beyond their own feelings as those of others , treating every thing unworthy , as justified by the rules of war . Here we may as well say that we must be careful not to give too much weight to little incidents and expressions in forming our opinion of such characters . Mr. Moore occasionally errs in this respect ; attaching an unnecessary importance to some of his sayings and actions , which , however they might bear upon his character , supposing them to be deliberate and meditated , are evidently vacant and unmeaning . For example , Byron , once holding the point of a dagger to his breast , was overheard to say , 1 should like to know how a person feels after committing a murder . ' Here , ' says his biographer , we may discover the germs of his future Ginours and Corsairs . ' This is certainly magnifying an idle word and action ; hundreds of youths , who could as soon have written the Prirtc*pia as the Corsair , have done and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring that discovers the dark passions of the soul . Such indicati9ns as this amount to nothing ; and it is difficult to judge from others of more importance , because young men born to no restraint and exempt by privilege , or misfortune , as it should be called , of birth , from those weights which regulate the motions of others , are apt to consider what others call serious things as trifles , and to exalt trifles into absurd huportance : so that it is difficult to judge of their feeling from their conduct , beyond the main fact that the moral sentiment is inactive and perverted . Byron was certainly one of this class . He has left some sad examples of his talent at degrading into trifles what others hold in respect : saying that they were thoughtless , is not excusing them , for he was of an age to know what he was doing , and thoughtlessness is a crime if it lead to sacrilege and sensuality . That he made trifles important , appears from the influence he gave to his imagination in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his destiny from the communion of mankind-among them , hut not of them : he was really desolate , but he imagined himself more so  --  and though one like him , might , by effort , have mastered all the unfavorable circumstances of his life , and have risen at any time from weakness to power , and from dishonor to glory , he imagined that nature and man conspired to keep him an alien from his race . rjj7**5 all his feelings were fancies-and // the day-dreams of imagination grew into the circumstances by which his life was governed . No one can account for his movements , without being in the same condition or under the same delusions : he sees a hand we can not see , he hears a voice we can not hear . ' We do not believe that he could have explained to himself half the actions of his life ; he could not remember the impulse by which he acted , after the fancy had died away ; he had no conception of himself , except as a Harold or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no original in any men that ever existed . No wonder that he should be still more unaccountable to others ; sometimes lie seems to us to move as much without reason as the wayfarer , who turns aside , mistaking the western clouds for mountains . Those who regard him as acting like other men in the same condition , will have but little forgiveness for his errors ; while those who know the power of a busy imagination to suggest various courses of action  --  to conjure up obstacles or inducements , and to give the color of right to that which is wrong , will feel , as if , though they may not defend his words and deeds , there may be palliations visible to that eye that reads the heart . The effect of his first travels is beautifully described by Mr. Moore , and may serve as a confirmation of what we have said respecting his want of energy within , and the manner in which be required to be sustained by lateral pressure . Strength of mind he possessed in abundance , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling that satiety which always follows a surrender of the soul to pleasure , going out as it seemed , with little more than change of place in view ; but his wanderings led him through regions where travel abounds , not merely as in more civilised regions , in vexation , but also in hardship and adventure . Every thing that he saw was new , and calculated to awaken the imaginalion , from the barbaric power of Ali Pacha , to the eloquent ruins of Athens ; like all who have breathed the air of classical literature , the love of Greece lay deep in his soul ; and when he traversed her blue waters and lonely mountains , he heard the voice of ages fast calling on him to secure a glorious immortality in all that were to come . He listened and his spirit was stirred in him , ' his mind was excited to manly and vigorous actions , and he poured out his soul in strains never exceeded for the depth and fulness of their meaning or the bold music of their flow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , that the inspiration which he borrowed from the land of recollections was afterwards splendidly repaid ? The variety of scenes through which he passed  --  the persons he encountered and the places full of interest , which he saw , produced the effect of discipline and education ; his mind learned to act with spirit and decision ; and as he became fitted for intellectual duties and pleasures , he acquired a self-sustaining force , which rightly directed might have made him not merely eminent , hut useful and happy . Before that time , he had been an entire stranger to intellectual exertion ; though he had read much , it was with irregular and aimless range ; whatever may be said of the improvement derived from his cultivated society at Newstead , is frilly answered by their own descriptions of the engagements of a day ; beside them , his associates were dogs , bears , and professors of pugilism , the most brutal of all arts . It was a fortunate hour when he grew weary of his pleasures , and fled to regions where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his powers . For even in poetry , up to this time he was inclined to an imitative style , which was to his faculties like the cramp of artificial gracefulness to the limbs , preventing all free action , except when as in the case of the review his momentary passion burst the cords with which his hands were bound . It was not , as his biographer supposes , that he grew more in love with solitude ; solitude would not have invigorated a mind like his ; it would have been stagnation to the fountains of his genius , and it needed all his activity in travel to trouble the waters ; activity of the frame was essential to that of his mind ; and thus quickened , he broke , in spite of himself , the chain of old poetical practice , and while he retained all his reverence for the classical form and his resolution to excel in it , indulged himself in other writings more suited to his taste ; regarding the latter as the play and the former as his high ambition . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetical journal of his thoughts and feelings , taken down in the moment 's glow ; he hardly considered it worthy the name of poetry , and yet nothing ever more surprised and delighted the world . This was xvhat travel had done for him-it taught him to throw off his literary distrust and reserve , and to speak with ease and energy the native language of his heart . There are few more interesting facts in literary history than this ; Mr. Dallas saw Lord Byron immediately after his return and heard him speak with enthusiasm of a work , which he // believed would add much to his fame . This he put into Mr. Dallas 's hands , who read it with dism&amp;y , and ventured to ask his Lordship if this was all the result of two interesting years . He said in reply , that he had some other short poems occasionally written during his absence , but they were not worth attention , and while he gave these carelessly to Mr. Dallas he insisted on the immediate publication of the other . Fortunately , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand their value and immediately told Lord Byron of the treasure he had found ; but it was with the utmost difficulty he could prevail on the author to give it to the world . There are several such instances on record of the little power of authors to judge of their own productions , but none so remarkable as this . We allude to it as showing the manner in which he estimated the merit of his works by the labor with which they were written . He learned the right practice before he acquired the right taste ; like the waking giant he threw off the bands which could only hold him while sleeping ; and yet , had he remained in the Abbey where external influence could not he brought to bear upon his mind , he might have lived and died , leaving no more to he remembered than one of the monks that slept under its floors . When Lord Byron returned to England , after his first travels , he felt as if he were going back , without pleasure , to a land which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he had few of those attractions at home ; but how many there are who have none of the enjoyments embraced in that inspiring word ; and how many more whose home is only a distant and painful recollection He had no friends either , except such as were ready-made ; as he was prevented by pride and reserve from cultivating new attachments , there were few to welcome his return . Beside this , his circumstances were so unpromising , that Newstead had been entered with an execution . Such anticipations may have made him look forward at times to his return with a feeling of dread . It must be allowed too , that he overrated his own misery ; he fixed his eyes on dark points , such as are found in every man 's prospect , till there seemed to be nothing bright for him to hope or enjoy . He insisted on being miserable , as if it were a sacred duty , and there are many passages in his letters of most humorous sadness , ' which remind us of Cowper 's penitential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetually breaking through the // artificial cloud . The very circumstance that he cherished so much the acquaintance of grief , proves that it could not have sunk so deep as he imagined , for sorrows always present , soon become , like the skulls on his table , too familiar to excite the least emotion . Altogether , it seems evident to us that Byron 's heart was set on England ; it certainly was so far as this ,  --  that he found neither home nor rest in any other country . And how could it be otherwise ? Lord Byron was thoroughly English in all his habits , tastes , and feelings ; not only in his occasional courage , manliness and generosity , but in his haughtiness , caprice , and suspicion . His favorite amusements were of the rough and active kind , and some of his pleasures we must say , hore an English taint of grossness . He was English in his jealous and defensive pride , which could not pardon slight neglect , so easily as serious wrongs . There was no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he left it at last , with expressions of hatred and defiance , it is evident that his xvrath was fiercer , because he felt that he could not cease to love the land he had abandoned . While he lived abroad , he welcomed associates who had nothing hut the name of English to recommend them , with as much delight , as Capt . Cooke saw the leaden spoon with the mark of London on one of the Sandwich Islands . It was the indignation and despair occasioned by his loss of popularity in England , which made him descend to low and licentious satire , in order to show that indifference which he never felt to England 's good opinion . The fierce violence of disappointed pride is not to be hidden under a jesting tone . He seemed to act with the feeling of a lover to an unkind mistress-plunging into dissipation , with the wish and hope of giving her pain by his vices . Byron in like manner trusted that when England heard his voice echoing in riotous mirth from a foreign land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so much power was lost , or worse than lost to the world . He felt all the while , as if the English public were the arbiters of his fame ; and probably , when he left England the second time , he would have chosen rather to remain , and face the changed wind of popular feeling which beat in a perfect storm upon him , had he not felt as if his poetical fame was waning , and his circumstances in hopeless confusion . But wherever he went , What will they say of us in England ? was the uppermost question , asked partly in tenderness , partly in scorn ; - it had its share in // the impulse which drove him to Greece , and when he perished there we believe that England ,  --  we know that his wife , child , and sister ,  --  were the last mortal vision that faded from his soul . Lord Byron never appeared in so interesting a light , as at the time when Childe Harold had made him the gaze of every eye . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; indeed the only portion to which those words can properly be applied . Beside his literary pretensions , he had begun to aspire to the fame of an orator , and had already spoken once or twice , with promising success . But all other hopes were dimmed by his poetical triumph , and seldom has there broken on the eye of man a scene of equal glory . He had not anticiJ ) ated this ; he had reproached himself with relying so far on the opinion of his friends , as to give his poem to the press ; his success therefore was made more xvelcome by surprise ; and woen we remember that in addition to this he had the charms of high birth , renowned ancestry , and uncommon beauty of person , it is not strange that the public with its English enthusiasm , should have been transported with admiration . Wherever he went he was received with rapture ; nobility , fashion , even royalty itself united in the general acclamation ; his natural shyness passed for the absence of genius ; his constraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his brow was supposed to be overcast by a melancholy imagination ; his faults , so far as known , gave an air of romantic wildness to his character , though they were generally veiled by the clouds of incense that rose from every side and gathered round him . Those who had suffered from his sarcasm laid their resentment by ; and came manfully forward to offer at once their forgiveness and applause ; sensitive as he was on the subject of seW he had every thing to keep him in a state of perpetual excitement , delightful , no doubt for a time , but calculated , when its first freshness was over , to bring more uneasiness than gratification ; and a poor preparation for that hour when the sounds of applause were to die away , and nothing to be heard but the murmur of condemnation , that reached him even across the deep . As we have said , he appears more amiable at this period of his life than at any other ; for a time , he is at peace with himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the compliments paid him by Jeffrey on that occasion , completed his exultation . But while it is pleasant to witness the // rejoicing of success , Byron 's friends , had they known his nature , would have trusted but little to the promise of that hour . We can not judge of a dwelling by its appearance when illuminated for a victory , nor of any character by the happiness produced by circumstances ; for such happiness can not last , and when it goes , it leaves the heart more desolate than it was before . If the world 's favor did not change , it was almost certain that he himself would alter ; after living on this exciting element for a while , it would naturally lose its power ; the fountain having been drained in the beginning could not be filled anew ; and as nothing less luxurious would satisfy his desires , he must of course return to his old state of depression , sinking low in proportion to the height from which he fell . Such was the result ; we soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anticipate the time when the popular interest should fail him , and therefore kept himself as much apart as possible ; still the change was to come in the order of nature , and it came first in him ; he grew weary of receiving sooner than the world of giving its praise . He says of Sheridan , What a xvreck is that man and all from bad pilotage ; for no one had ever better gales. * The same might be said of himself at this time ; but the truth is , that no winds are favorable to those who are not made in a measure independent of circumstances by something firm within ; when energy at heart is wanting , it requires a miraculous combination of circum-. stances to keep one good , prosperous or happy . This brings us to Lord Byron 's marriage and separation ; a piece of history which has long been publicly discussed , and with a freedom unusual in such cases ; it was investigated perhaps with the more earnestness from its being carefully hidden ; but now , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore 's publication , and a statement from Lady Byron , which has followed it , and which reveals all the circumstances that the public are likely ever to know . This is the first time she has ever appealed to the public against the charm of her husband 's poetical insinuations ; silence was certainly the more dignified course , and no explanation from her was called for ; the public feeling in the circle round them was all on her side , and Lord Byron was visited with a sentence of outlawry , which made him an exile ever after . There was a stern cry of indignation against him , which indicated either that the English fashionable world had been suddenly converted to rigid morality , or that his popu // larity was on the wane , and enemies of all descriptions , literary and political , took advantage of the moment to give him a fatal blow . The history of the separation , as given in this work , leaves a charge of duplicity on Lady Byron , which she did wisely to repel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she went to visit her parents ; they parted in the utmost kindness ; she wrote him a letter on the way full of playfulness and affection , and as soon as she arrived at Kirkby Mallory , her father wrote to inform Lord Byron that she would never return . This was at a time when his pecuniary embarrassments had become intolerably pressing ; executions had been repeatedly in his house ; and for a wife to choose this time and manner to leave her husband would inspire a natural prejudice against her , unless there were grave reasons to justify her apparent want of sincerity and good feeling . Lady Byron explains her conduct in a letter written to justify her parents from the charge of interfering on this occasion . She states that she believed her husband insane , and acted upon that impression , both in leaving him and in writing her letter , choosing the tone and manner least likely to irritate his passions . She states that had she not considered him insane , she could not have borne with him so long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not thought sufficient to make out the case of insanity . We are not surprised that such was her impression . Mr. Moore mentions that Byron was in the habit of keeping fire-arms in his carriage and near his bed . Such extravagance was enough to excite her suspicion of his soundness of mind ; and there was nothing to quiet her apprehensions in his temper , which was grown irresistible by long indulgence of self-will ; he was wholly untaught to submit to those mutual concessions , which domestic happiness and harmony require . When we remember that his passions , which he himself describes as occasionally savage , were incensed by seeing his house repeatedly in possession of officers of the law , no wonder that all should have seemed like madness , to her even spirit and uniform feelings . We do not know how any one acquainted with the history of their attachment , could have anticipated any other result . The first mention of Lady Byron is found in the Journal . A very pretty letter from Annabella , which I answered . What an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love on either side , and produced by circumstances which in // general lead to coldness on one side and aversion on the other . She is a very superior woman , and very little spoiled , which is strange in an heiress  --  a girl of twenty  --  a peeress that is to be in her own right , an only child , and a savante , who has always had her own way . She is a **35;379;TOOLONG , and yet very kind , generous , and gentle , with very little pretension. ' p. 331. here it seems there was no love on either side . He says in another place , a wife would he the salvation of me ; ' *nd this Mr. Moore explains , by his conviction that it was prudent to take refuge in marriage from those perplexities , which form the sequel of all less regular ties . ' These are ominous words . He offered hitnself at that time to lX*iss Milbanke , and was rejected ; on neither side was love eiher felt , or professed . ' In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the willing dupe of his fancy and vanity , came to engross the young poet ; and still , as the usual penalties of such pursuits followed , he found himsc*f sighing for the sober yoke of wedlock as some security against their recurrence . ' Such is his friend 's aecount of the reasons of this connex*on . Some time after this a friend advised him to marry , to which he assented , after much discussion . ' He himself was for another application to Miss Milbanke , but his friend dissuaded him , on the ground that she was learned , and had then no fortune . He at last agreed that his friend should write a proposal to another lady ; it was rejected . You see , ' said Lord Byron , that Miss Milbanke is to be the person . ' lie immediately wrote to her , and his friend reading what he had written , said , this is really a very pretty letter ; it is a pity it should not go . ' Then it shall go , ' said Lord Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this way the most important action of his life was done . He said , I must of course reform , ' and with this shadow of a resolution , he went through the ceremony in a kind of 6htless heaviness , which he was at no pains to conceal . What induced Lady Byron to risk her happiness in such an adventure , we can not tell , unless she was ambitious of the glory of reforming such a tnan . If so , she did her part , by his own acknowledgment . I do not believe , and I must say it , in the dress of this bitter business , that there ever was a better , or even a brighter , kinder , more agreeable or more amiable being than Lady B. I never had , nor can have , any reproach to make her while with me. ' // Such hopes are invariably disappointed ; their only chance of success consists in a strong bold upon the afl*ctions , which she never had on his . Such a marriage contract , like the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with lamentation , mourning , and woe . Mr. Moore is inclined to attribute all this to the incapacity of men of genius to enjoy domestic peace . He forgets that in defending his friend , he does injustice to talent as well as to Him who gave it . Examples may be found among poets of such unfortunate marriages , but there is no connexioii of cause and effect between their genius and their guilt or calamity , which ever it may be . We do not believe a single word of his refined speculation on this subject . We can not believe that poetical inspiration , that glorious gift of God , can ever be a curse to its innocent possessor . Like every thing else , it may be abused ; and then the greater the power the xvider will be the destruction . But there is no tendency to abase in its nature . There is no need of giving the reins to imagination . Where this power is strong , the judgment , if encouraged , will be strong in full proportion , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy from excesses as well as the passions . So far from giving even a distaste for reality , it will give a charm to reality by surrounding it with elevating associations , it will raise its possessor above the common level of life , not too high to see all things distinctly , and yet so high that he can look over and beyond them . Man is made lord of all his passionsinvested with power over all the elements of his nature . He may keep or he may resi*n it ; he may cast the crown from his head-he may make himself the slave of those affections which he is hound to govern ; but let him not libel his nature , for he makes himself weak when heaven meant bim to be strong ; he sinks himself into degradation and sorrow where Providence would never have placed him . The fault is all in his own infirmity of purpose and will . XVe shall not probably have another opportunity of speaking of Lord Byron , and we can not leave the subject without saying a word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his works are registered in the treasures of Eng ! ish poetry . Now , if ever , they can be fairly judged . The enthusiasm in favor of the writer has nearly died away ; and , as usual in cases of reaction , begins to be succeeded by an indifference , which is more fatal than any other infliction to a poet 's fame . // His works are not so much read at present as they will be some years hence , when what is obscure and prosaic about them will be passed by , the grosser parts dismissed to oblivion , and that which is great and excellent be read with an unmingled pleasure , which his readers can not now enjoy . Childe Harold is his most important work , and on this and his lyrical poems his fame must ultimately depend . It was a secret outpouring of his soul , deeply colored by his peculiar genius and feeling . It hears no marks of that constraint and adaptation produced by a consciousness that the public eye was upon him . The Childe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by the poet , allowing for a little overstatement , nearly resembled his own . It was a happy imagination to represent only the more striking scenes , such as would be likely to fix the attention of an uninterested wanderer . It affords an excuse for passing over what is unsuited to poetical description , and for giving bold relief to such as could kindle the vacant pilgrim 's heart and eye . All about the poem , even its abruptness and disorder , is brought into keeping , so that irregularity becomes a beauty . But the character of the Childe was so successful , and he was so much flattered by its being taken for a likeness of his own , that , instead of imagining new , he was tempted to draw it again . In the Giaour , Corsair , and other poems , he multiplies copies of this original ; but in attempting to give them additional effect , he has gone beyond the bounds of truth and nature . We can imagine some good feelings lingering in the ruins of a libertine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness ; but to transfer the same affections to pirates and murderers is so shocking to probability , that none but very young readers can be interested . It is surprising that he should not have felt , th*iit to ascribe habitual good feeling to such a character is quite as unnatural , as to imagine good men living in the practice of robbery and murder . Still these works abound in traits of great loveliness and power ; and though they did not injure his fame , could not prevent its natural decline  --  a decline which must come unless every new effort of a poet transcend the last . It was an indifference which he could not well bear . Though he constantly declared his weariness of the world and the men of it , he could not endure that the world should grow weary of him . We must say that we consider some of his lyrical poems // as the finest in the language . The deep feeling which he delighted to express was better suited to short pieces than to long poems . For though in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they give the humble aspect of prose to all that comes between . But many of them are out of the reach of criticism or of praise . The allusions to lost friends which close the two first cantos of Childe Harold never will be read without emotion . His Night before Waterloo ' will make hearts thrill longer than the victory , and his Thunder Storm in the Alps ' will be remembered as long as thunders roll . We are bound to say of this work , that the moral tone is not what it should have been . Not that the writer endeavors to conceal Lord Byron 's faults-he tells them without reserve ; nor that he flatters the moral character of his subject . So far as he had any clear conceptions of a character so unformed , he gives them with great impartiality . But he speaks of vices at times with a light and careless air , as if they were harmless if not discovered . Still the moral effect of his work will not be so unfavorable as might be feared ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , envy is the very last feeling which his account of Lord Byron would inspire . Never was there a more striking picture of a man splendidly unhappy ; weak in character , though mighty in his powers ; solitary as a hermit , though born to rank and fortune ; wandering without pleasure and reposing without rest ; admired by millions and loved by very few ; able to move the spirit of nations , and himself like the great ocean lifted and broken by gales that would not have agitated humbler waters . We freely confess that we read his history with compassion ; feeling as if one who was never directed in the right way , could hardly be said to have wandered . But no such feelings can deceive us into an approbation of his character ; we hold him up as a warning , not as an example . We might have waited for the conclusion of this Life , ' but for various reasons thought it better to notice the first volume . There can be nothing to make us regret that we have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall began after his separation from his wife and his retreat from England . We have followed him to the edge of the cataract , and have no disposition to see him dash below.
