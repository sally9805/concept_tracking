txt THE history of the present century offers no subject of inquiry more curious and interesting , than that series of con- * While the proof sheets of this article are on our tahie , we learn that the Sloop-of-war Vincerines has arrived at Norfolk , having on hoaid Davis and Meader , two of the three seamen of the Mentor , who were left in the Pelew Island as hostages The Vincennes also found the Pelew , Kohac , alive on Lord North 's Island , and conveyed him to his home . The newspapers state other particulars respecting the negotiation at the Pelew Isliinds , which we refuse to credit , till they come to us on some less questionable authority . We wait for a sight of the orders given to Captain Aulick , and his report to the Navy department , before we will believe that our government sent to higgle for a reduction of the stipulated ransom of American citizens , with the hattery of a man-of-war for the negotiator . As a matter of thrift , if that were all , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would become of the next unfortunate countrymen of ours , who should fall into the savages ' hands ? // vulsions and revolutions , which have agitated and still continue to agitate the former dominions of Spain and Portugal on this continent . From the pampas of La Plata to the confines of Louisiana , on both sides of the great chain of the Andes , and on either ocean , through the whole extent of the southern continent , its plains , its mountains , and its valleys have been , with short intervals of repose , during the last twenty-five years , the theatre of continual revolutionary struggles or civil discord . The vibrations of those tremendous earthquakes are still felt , and continue to excite new interest , not unmixed with alarm , as they touch the southwestern border of the Union . The moment appears to us not inappropriate , to invite the attention of our readers to the past and existing state of things , more particularly in the portion of Mexico in our immediate neighbourhood . In Texas , the emigrants from the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mexican Republic , have taken up arms against what they call the usurpation of the central government , and a declaration of Independence has been published to the world . On the other hand , the Mexican commander 's proclamation , at the commencement of the present extraordinary campaign , denounced the insurgents as a mob of ungrateful adventurers , on whom the authorities of Mexico have incautiously lavished favors which they had failed to bestow on Mexicans , and who have raised the standard of rebellion in order that that extensive and fertile department may be detached from the Republic . In order to understand and appreciate the state of the question , it is proper to go back and take a view of the remarkable events which have occurred in Mexico within the period above mentioned , from the first rising under Hidalgo to the present day , and more particularly of some occurrences in the internal provinces of New Spain , of which no authentic account has ever been given . Hidalgo , the curate of Dolores , it is well known , was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as 1810 . Failing , through an unaccountable infatuation , to take advantage of the first panic , produced by his rising and the first partial triumphs of his arms , by advancing on the capital and taking possession , partly paralyzed by the terrors of an excommunication denounced against him , and ultimately defeated and betrayed , he fled to the internal provinces , and in // the following year was executed at Chihuakua , in the province of New Biscay . Some of his followers and associates in different parts of the Vice-royalty , particularly Morelos and Rayon , still held out at the head of small bands . Ultimately in 1814 , after the defeat of Toledo , to whose part in those transactions we shall soon have occasion to advert , all opposition was put down , and Mexico sunk back into its former state of dependence upon Spain . The gloom which ensued was unbroken save by the meteor inroad of Mina , until the celebrated plan of Ignala , which ended in the independence of Mexico and the elevation of Iturbide to the imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary . He was driven from his throne into exile , and the Federal Republican Constitution was established in 1824 , and Guadaloupe Victoria was elected the first President of the Republic . The devoted patriotism of Victoria , and the eminent services rendered by him to his country in its struggle for independence , gave assurances of tranquillity and freedom . The first Congress of Mexico under the federal constitution assembled on the 1st of January , 1825 . The continued agitations and repeated revolutions by force of arms in the administration of the government , since that period and up to the present time , induce us to pause for a moment , and to consider whether it he not , after all , questionable , how far the model of a federal government adopted in our happy country , and we may add the only one to wbich the people would submit , was adapted to the habits , genius , and intelligence of the people of Mexico , and whether a more simple machinery would not have been better calculated to secure their happiness as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations were totally different . In each of the British colonies before the revolution there existed a separate local legislature ; each had its chartered privileges and rights ; the laws , which regulated hereditary succession and other important matters , differed in the several colonies . When the connexion , which hound them to the mother country was severed , they were distinct communities , except so far as they had united by common consent to repel a common danger . The federal form of government was therefore the natural result ; any other form would have been incongruous in the extreme . In Mexico it was far otherwise . The whole population was governed by the same laws , emanating from the same // source , whether in the Vice-royalty , or the Captain-generalship of the Internal provinces . The division of provinces was for the greater facility of governing the subject multitude . The people had no voice in the making of their laws , and even the Cabildos and Ayuntarnientos were mere machines for the better regulating the local police . The Viceroy was the supreme head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was therefore an apparent incongruity. in cutting up the wlole territory into States , in order to reunite them under a federal head , and in assigning to the separate States the power to legislate on certain matters of local concern , to which they had been previously strangers . It was a blind imitation of the United States , under circumstances totally different . After more than three centuries of the most debasing servitude and misrule , it could not be expected that sufficient materials would he found among the people ) le , to form , in the first place , a State legislature with two branches for each State , executive magistrates , and a judiciary , and then representatives to both branches of a federal congress . The enjoyment of regulated freedom and the distinct exercise of political powers require a kind of apprenticeship . The great mass of the population of Mexico were absolutely ignorant of the simplest elemet ; ts of popular selfgovernment . It was difficult to make them comprehend what an election meant . The very best form of government for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although centralism is now in unretlecting minds confounded with despotism , we are by no means satisfied that the Federal , as contradistinguished from the Central , or simple Republic , was adapted to the condition of the Mexican people . In mechanism , that machinery is not necessarily the best which is the most complicated , and most difficult to understand , or most difficult to repair , when deranged ; but that which is best calculated to attain the end for which it is designed . We are sensible that there is in politics , as well as religion , a species of bigotry and spirit of exclusiveness , if we may so express ourselves ; and yet we should question the wisdom of any constitution of government , which should pay no regard to the actual condition and habits of the governed . It is at all events certain , that the same system , in its general features , which has for nearly half a century secured the greatest tranquillity and prosperity to the United States , has failed to produce the same results in Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by a cursory review of the principal disturbances and insurrections which have not ceased to distract the country , since the second year of the administration of Victoria . To the essential weakness of the executive head , the bitter animosities against the European Spaniards or Gachupines , and the rival lodges of Escoseses and Yorkinos , by which names the supposed aristocratic and democratic parties were designated , may be attributed most of the disorders and horrors which have n ) arked this period of Mexican history . We will not dwell on the cruel expulsion of the Spaniards , the sack of the capital by an unbridled mob , the repeated triumphs of brutal force over regularly constituted authority , and the frequent executions for suspected treasons or conspiracies ; but proceed to examine those movements , which have prevented any regular election of President according to the forms of the Constitution . Since the success of what was called the " Plan " of Iguala , every new project or scheme of reform , either in the organic laws or their administration , has been styled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the visionary but harmless propositions to amend the constitution of the United States . The first of these plans , which disturbed the administration of Victoria , was set on foot in 1827 , by Montano , at Ottumba . He proposed the total suppression of secret societies , an entire change in the administrative functions of the government , and the expulsion of the Minister Resident of the United States . This blow aimed at Mr. Poinsett , at that time our Minister in Mexico , was attributed to the part taken by him in aiding to establish the Yorkino Lodge . Early in January , 1828 , Colonel Rinero attempted to excite a revolt against the government , in support of Montano ; but be was put down by a proclamation , declaring Montano guilty of treasonable designs . Don Nicholas Bravo , Vice-President of the Republic , became involved in these intrigues . He suddenly left the capital , and , stationing himself at Zalancingo , published a manifesto , in which he avowed himself in favor of the plan of Montano , although he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitor , and , although at the head of a considerable military force , he surrendered without any serious opposition to Guerrero , who had been sent to suppress the revolt . Bravo was found guilty of treasonable // designs against the government , and was banished for a period of seven years . The time was now approaching when it became necessary to find a successor to Victoria as President of the Republic . Two candidates presented themselves , General Guerrero and Gomez Pedraza ; the former supported by the Yorkinos , and the latter , who was at the time Minister of War and Marine , by the Escoseses . The canvass was conducted with the greatest zeal and even rancor on both sides . Pedraza was elected by a majority of two votes . The disappointed party were loud in their denunciation of the successful candidate ; his friends were charged with bribery and corruption , and even with procuring the interference of the military in some of the States ; and there is no doubt a resort to arms was concerted , if necessary to annul the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to play a distinguished part in public affairs . He was popular with the army and the people , and had been previously driven from the office of Vice-Governor of the State of Vera Cruz , and had taken refuge in Jalapa . As soon as he learned the result of the election , he seduced the troops at that place , and marched early in September to Perote , having previously seized upon the military chest and stores . Finding himself in possession of Perote , at the head of about eight hundred troops , he issued his manifesto in the shape of an address from the liberating army to the people of Anahuac . He denounced the legislature as secret abettors of the plan of Montano , and as intricruing against the liberties of the people in favor of a Bourbon prince . He charged Pedraza with having , while Minister of War , and even previously , shown himself inimical to the interest of the people , with having succeeded in his election by fraudulent means , and contrary to the wishes of the majority and declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guerrero should be placed at the head of the executive government . His " plan " recommended no middle course . It proposed that the people and army should annul the election of Pedraza , and that the Spanish residents should be banished that Guerrero should be declared President , and that the legislature should proceed to a new election . It is hardly necessary to add , that this daring revolt was crowned with success . Pedraza fled , Guerrero was proclaimed President after being at first appointed Minister of War and Marine , // Victoria resigned the Presidency , Bustamante was continued as Vice-President , and Santa Anna was appointed commander-in-chief . This revolution was not effected without the perpetration of the most frightful disorders . Mexico was given up to pillage ; and it has been estimated that property was plundered or destroyed to the value of five millions of dollars , principally belonging to the European Spaniards , who , in consequence of this revolution , were expelled from the country . It is not a little remarkable that Santa Anna , the prime mover of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution , but remained besieged at the head of the liberating army until the revolution was completed , and then laid down his arms to General Calderon , to be immediately invested with the supreme military command of the Republic . In the summer of 1829 , the invasion of Mexico by Barradas , induced the legislature to invest the President , Guerrero , with extraordinary powers . Barradas was captured by Santa Anna , as is well known , and thus ended the hopes of Spain to recover her lost possessions in Mexico . But Guerrero was destined to taste the cup he had mixed for his predecessor and rival . His alleged reluctance to lay down the powers of dictator , which had been conferred on him on the emergency above alluded to , led to various revolts and insurrections in different parts of the Republic . The State of Yucatan declared against the Federal Government , and in favor of the Central system . Early in December , 1829 , Bu*tamante , then Vice-President , flew to arms , and , placing himself at the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vera Cruz , advanced upon the capital , denouncin* tI ) e abuses and usurpations of Guerrero . Santa Anna , b the commander-in-chief , issued a proclamation in support of the government ; but long before he could reach Mexico the revolution was complete . Guerrero first laid down his dictatorial powers , then convoked the Congress , and appealed to it for support . But he was at last compelled to abdicate . Bustarnante was elected by the army , as the successor of Guerrero , and Santa Anna followed the example of Guerrero , and retired to his estates . Tranquillity was soon restored . It was not at this period hazardous to predict , that even the shadow of the constitution of 18.24 would not long survive . Mexico had already the substance of a military despotism and a pretext or a cause for prostrating Bustamante in his turn // could not long be wanting . It was enough , that the daring , the crafty Santa Anna , the conqueror of il3arradas , was in disgrace at his favorite Manga de Clavo . From that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kaleidoscope of factions and parties . We will not pretend to detail the series of nianceuvres , of gritos , and insurrections , which seated Santa Anna ultimately in power , and made him the representative of that amalgam of parties , which has been aptly called the **30;573;TOOLONG . In May , 1833 , Santa Anna assumed the reins of government . In April following , he drove out the Congress ; and in 1835 the good Gomez Farias , who had been elected Vice-President , was forced into exile , and the revolution was completed by creating a new office , - that of president ad interim . Another individual was designated for that office , but all the effective power of the state was confided to Santa Anna ; centralism and a dictatorship succeeded de facto to the Federal Republic . Since that period Santa Anna has been , down to the time of his late disaster , the undisputed master of the destinies of Mexico ; the States were converted into departments , and the legislatures cut down to a council of five . it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the Americans settled there , took sides with Santa Anna in putting down Bustamante . Such was the infatuation which prevailed , that while it was apparent to indifferent spectators , acquainted with the character of Santa Anna , that he aimed at the assumption of all power , and that he was opposed to all the great reforms which had been projected for the country , yet those who were just now struggling for their existence against h ni , cobperated with him in prostrating , by force of intrigues and arms , the administration of Bustamante , and in fact the constitution of 1824 . In July , 1832 , the Ayuntamiento and people of San Felipe de Austin unanimously gave in their adherence to the plan of Vera Cruz , and to the principles of the Republican party , headed by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna . So zealous indeed were they in anticipating the wishes or designs of Santa Anna , and by force of arms expelling the troops in Texas then under the command of Bustamante , that their motives were suspected ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been sent to suppress any movement towards independence on the part of the American colonists . Such intention // was distinctly disclaimed at the time by the colonists , and tranquillity was restored . But before we proceed to an examination of the causes which led to the present position of things in Texas , we must take a hasty survey of the events which have occurred in that region , and , as intimated above , give some account of the military operations of which it was the scene during the struggle of Mexico for her independence , in which many citizens of the United States cooperated , and not a few sacrified their lives . It must not be forgotten that these transactions occurred previously to the treaty of 1819 with Spain ; at a period when the United States had not given up their pretensions , under the treaty of cession of Louisiana , to the sovereignty of the country , as far as the Rio del Norte . We will not assert that the administration of that day ( 1812 and 1813 ) were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as soon as it should have been wrested from the dominion of Spain ; but thus much we assert as a fact , that William Shaler , afterwards the Consul-general at Algiers , did , after the fall of San Antonio , in the spring of 1813 , proceed into the territory , and , under the flag of the United States , assumed and acted in the official character of " agent of the United States near the constituted authorities of New Spain . " At that time , the American people and government were wearied with the protracted negotiation with Spain , its interminable delays , and the evident reluctance of the cabinet of Madrid , to do justice to the United States ; ' and there was a strong disposition among the people to seize upon that part of the territory which was still in dispute . But these considerations are nothing to our present purpose , and are mentioned only to explain why so many of our citizens were engaged in that conflict . Among the followers of Hidalgo , who found themselves exposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernardo Gutierrez . He had been a white-smith in Revilla , near the Rio Grande , and had accumulated a handsome estate . All his property was confiscated , but he effected his escape to the United States . He was a man of perseverance and enterprise , but without the qualities necessary for a military commander ; rather savage than brave , and of a stern and revengeful disposition . He was however devoted to his native country , and vindictive against its oppressors . His first object , on reaching the United States , was to create an interest // in the cause of Mexican independence . Although he labored under great disadvantages , being rather uncouth in his manners , and speaking no language but Spanish , he at last succeeded in inducing many Americans to join him in an enterprise , having for its object to create a division on the side of Texas in favor of Morelos and Rayon , then in arms in the interior . Having visited Washington , he returned to Natchitoches early in the year 1812 , and with a few followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American volunteers , who had rallied to his standard , elected as their first immediate commander , Lieutenant Magee , who had served in the American army , and at the time of his election was the cornmanding officer at Fort Claiborne in Natchitoches . Gutierrez was invested with the command in chief . The little army , thus organized , raised the standard of Mexican Independence , and pushed forward into the interior of Texas . Nacogdoches was first taken , and the few Spanish troops stationed there joined the army of Gutierrez . They marched forward to the river Trinity , and took the small town of Salcedo . From that point to San Antonio de Bejar , there were two routes ; the one passing by La Bahia del Espiritu Santo , now called Goliad , and the other more direct , and higher up the river . The army , increasing daily by the arrival of fresh volunteers , took the lower route and arrived at La Bahia . This town stands on an eminence upon the right bank of the San Antonio river , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Bay of Metagorda . A little stone fort stands , or stood at that time , in the centre of the town , having four bastions , and one of the curtains consisting of a stone church . The garrison was taken by surprise ; or , being composed of Mexicans disaffected to the existing government , yielded without a struggle . The principal military force of Spain in Texas , was stationed at San Antonio de Bejar , under the immediate command of Don Simon Herrera . Don Manuel Salcedo was at that period governor of the province . Soon after the capture of La Bahia , the governor and the military chief of the province left San Antonio , and advanced to the siege of La Bahia . With vastly superior forces , all their attempts to carry the place by assault , or reduce it in any other way , were fruitless ; and , after a siege of several months , they were compelled to retreat upon the capital . // During the siege , Colonel Magee , who commanded the American volunteers , died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Republican army shortly afterwards marched upon San Antonio . The whole royal forces came out to meet the enemy , and they met at the Salado , about two leagues from the town . The royalists were defeated with great slaughter , and in a few days the capital of Texas surrendered upon capitulation . Salcedo , Herrera and his brother , and all the officers under the Spanish authorities , gave up their swords , under a solemn promise that they should he treated with the urbanity usual among civilized nations . This pledge was most barbarously violated . Thirteen prisoneis of distinction , at the head of whom was Don Manuel Salcedo , were sent off under a strong guard mounted on horseback , and under pretext of putting them on board a vessel at Metagorda , bound for New Orleans , were taken a short distance from San Antonio to a retired place , and inhumanly butchered in cold blood . Most of them had their throats cut . Their bodies , after being rifled of their watches and trinkets , were thrown into a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of whom were men of honor and character , to say that they were ignorant of any design to commit so foul an outrage on the part of Gutierrez , and that they resented it , some hy immediately returning to the United States , and others by subsequently depriving Don Bernardo of the command and conferring it on Don Jose Alvarez de Toledo . Most of the royal troops captured at San Antonio , together with many of the subaltern officers , were natives of Mexico , and readily joined the Republican army . The fall of San Antonio , by adding greatly to the force of the liberators , not only in men , but a train of artillery , military stores , and horses , might have led to important results , if it had not been followed bya relaxation of discipline and a spirit of insuhordination , which proved ultimately fatal to the cause . Instead of I ushing forward to the Rio Grande , and raising the revolutionary standard in the populous parts of the Internal provinces , in which the people were deeply disaffected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the commander-in-chief appears to have considered the great object accomplished . A provisional government was organized , at the head of which Don Bernardo was placed as governor , assisted by a Junta composed of a few Creoles and two Americans , chosen by the people of the // capital and the army . In the mean time , the volunteers began to abseut themselves , xvhile no adequate preparations were made to repel any further attack , which might have been anticipated . Notwithstanding the disorder and laxity of discipline , a considerable force of provincial troops , under the command of Colonel Ilisonda , which had been raised in New Biscay , was repulsed and completely routed within two miles of San Antonio . The exultation and confidence , which followed this victory , were ultimately fatal to the ex 1 ) edition . The army , thinking itself invincible , made no preparations to meet any further efforts on the part of Spain ; and time was given to the Viceroy , and the Captain-General of the Internal provinces , to organize and concentrate a force sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2OLh of June , 1813 ; and was shortly afterwards followed by the expulsion of Don Bernardo from the command , and the promotion of Toledo . The circumstances attending this change require some notice . The butchery of the Spanish prisoners by Don Bernardo , had created a feeling of horror and disgust in the United States , and great disaffection in the arniy ; and , without a prosl ) ect of speedy change , it is probable the volunteers would have abandoned an enterprise stained with so foul a crime . The army , the Jtinta , and the most respectable people of the province were prepared for a change . Don Jose Alvarez de Toledo , who was destined to succeed Don Bernardo in the command , was a native of the Island of Cuba . Very early in life he received a warrant of midshipman in the Spanish navy , and continued in that service until he was appointed a lieutenant . During the invasion of the Peninsula , he joined the land service , and acted as the aid-decamp of General Blake , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his seat in the Cortes of Cadiz , as the supplying member for the Spanish part of St. Domingo , and being detected in some correspondence with the governor of that Island , in which he advocated the independence of Spanish America , he was compelled to fly . He took refuge in the United States , and arrived at Philadelphia in 1812 . He brought with him an authority , signed by many of the members of the Cortes , who represented the Spanish provinces on this continent , to take command of any forces which might be in arms to sustain the independence of Spanish America . lie was authorized at the same time to draw // on Cadiz for such sums as he might need . He did draw bills of exchange at Philadelphia for some thousands of dollars , which were duly honored . Having learned the auspicious commencement of the enterprise under Don Bernardo , and being disposed to coöperate with him , Toledo , after visiting Washington City with a view of propitiatine the government , set forward towards Pittsburg with a few followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , a printing-press and a font of types , and the printer himself formed one of the party . His name was Moore , a man of singular versatility of talent , possessing a vast amount of practical knowledge , and at the same time brave , enthusiastic , and enterprising . This little party embarked at Pittsburg for Natchez in the month of December , on board a small flat-boat , which had been constructed for that purpose . Nothing can be conceived more heterogeneous than this little party . There were Toledo , and his two aids , the one an American , and the other a Frenchman . Don Juan Picornel was an old Spaniard , a native of Majorca , who had been buried in the dungeons of the Inquisition ; whose ankles had been rendered callous by chains , with which he had been loaded as the conspicuous enemy of Godoy ; who had been engaged in the first revolution in Caraccas , and had escaped from the earthquake and the counter revolution wrinkled with age , and yet full of zeal in the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the name of Colonie . He boasted of having been a chef de brigade in the republican armies of France ; but , such was his ardor in the cause , that he accepted the humble rank of chef de cuisine in the service of Toledo . These , together with an honest , intrepid , and faithful Gallician boy , and an American shoemerchant , who had advanced some funds for the enterprise , and who accompanied the general by way of collateral security , formed the personnel of the outfit . The materiel consisted of provisions , a few arms , baggage , and some books . It was not until the month of March , 1813 , that Toledo and his party reached Natchez , after suffering greatly from cold , and from the breaking up of the ice on the Ohio . From Natchez he proceeded by land to Natchitoches . From that point a messenger was despatched to San Antonio with letters to Don Bernardo , tendering to him the coLiperation of Toledo and his friends , in the enterprise in which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , in company with William Shaler , Esquire , proceeded to Nacogdoches , and established his head-quarters . Here the printing-press was set up ; and the first paper ever published in the Internal provinces of Mexico was issued in Spanish and English early in May , 1813 . The party of Toledo increased daily by the arrival of fresh volunteers , and he was already at the head of a considerable reinforcement , carefully organized and disciplined , and making preparations to proceed to San Antonio , when , to the utter amazement of everybody , an express arrived from Don Bernardo , with letters for Toledo , together with a formal and peremptory order to him to quit forthwith the territory of the Republic . This repulse , from such a quarter , was an enigma which none could explain at the time . Toledo , after consulting his friends , determined to obey , rather than hazard the success of the enterprise by pushing forward in despite of Don Bernardo . While he retired across the Sabine , his friends organized themselves into a company of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his aids , and took up the march for San Antonio . On their arrival , the mystery which accompanied the expulsion of Toledo was soon explained . It appeared that one Cogswell , who had been discarded by Toledo and his party at Pittsburg on account of some dishonorable intrigues , had written to Don Bernardo in terms highly derogatory to the character of Toledo , representing him as secretly in the pay of the Spanish minister at Washington , and on his way to the Internal provinces for the purpose of betraying the cause . Although Don Bernardo knew that the whole story was false , yet he thought it a good pretext to rid himself of a rival , whose influence he dreaded . The persons who had accompanied Toledo from Philadelphia , and who knew the motives of Cogswell and the falsity of his statements , represented to Gutierrez the truth of the case , and urged him to revoke the order expelling Toledo from Texas . He peremptorily refused , still persisting in charging Toledo with correspondence with the enemy . The officers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention to abandon the enterprise , unless Gutierrez would retire from the command . After a variety of movements , it was finally determined that an election of a commander-in-chief should be // held , in which the officers of the army , the members of the Junta , and the notables of the capital should vote . The resuit was the election of Don Jose Alvarez de Toledo , and Gutierrez immediately retired to the United States . Toledo , having in the mean time approached near San Antonio , then made his appearance , and was invested with the command in chief . This change took place in July , 1813 . Preparations were immediately made to meet any further force which might he sent from the interior , and for this purpose the train of artillery was mounted and fitted for service , and the troops reviewed and better organized . While these preparations were making , a rumor reached head-quarters that the regular garrison at Vera Cruz , composed of the regiment of Estramadura , had landed at Tampico , and was about to advance on San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Biscay and Coahuila , destined to coöperate with Arredondo , the commander of the fijos of Vera Cruz . Their plan of operation was readily apprehended . Their intention was to concentrate their force at the distance of three or four days ' march from San Antonio , Arredondo crossing the Rio Grande at Laredo , and Ilisonda at the Paso del Norte ; the point of concentration being the junction of the two roads , leading to the capital of Texas from those two places . In this state of things , the Republicans had the choice of only two courses . The one was to put San Antonio in a state of defence , and await the arrival of the combined forces of Arredondo and Ilisonda ; the other to advance at once towards the Rio Grande , and attack them in detail before they could form a junction . It was confidently thought that the forces of the Republican army were more than a match for either division of the royalists , if not sufficient to offer battle to both united . The latter plan was agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio Grande . The army marched early in August , with a train of eight pieces of artillery . Its force amounted to about fifteen hundred , of which about four hundred were American volunteers . But it was soon ascertained , that the two divisions of the Spanish army had formed their junction , and were advancing on San Antonio . Under these circumstances , it became necessary to change the plan of operations , and to place the Medina , a small branch of the San Antonio river , between the army and // the town . The Medina is rather a deep ravine than a river , and at that season is almost dry ; but its banks are so steep , and the passes so narrow , as to impede the crossing of artillery . The republican army crossed this stream , and occupied such a position as to watch the only two fords , by which San Antonio could he approached from that quarter . No sooner had Toledo crossed the Medina , than it was ascertained by the report of the scouts , that Arredondo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the great road . Toledo advanced about two miles , and on the morning of the 13th of August the army was drawn out in oider of hattie , having the road in the centre , the artillery on each side , and a corps of cavalry and some friendly Indians on each wing , concealed in skirts of woods . In front of the line was a small prairie ; and such was the position of the troops , that the enemy might approach within rifle shot without suspecting their presence . The intention of Toledo was to take Arredondo by surprise on his march , while encumbered with a train , which always accompanies a Spanish army . At daybreak the enemy 's drum was beard ; it was known that they had taken up the line of march , and confident expectations were entertained that the plan would succeed . It was defeated by an untoward accident . While waiting anxiously for the approach of the royalists , a single horseman , well mounted , rode slowly through the centre of the prairie , and approached within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion of finding an enemy there . As soon as he perceived his situation , be turned suddenly and disappeared , notwithstanding many rifles were discharged at him . It was then concluded , that , as the position of the republican army was discovered and would immediately be reported , it would lead to no result if they continued in the same position , as the enemy would certainly have time to form in battle . It was consequently concluded to advance , and endeavour to attack them before they could make any new disposition of their forces . The whole line advanced at the same moment , and very soon after the right wing engaged the enemy . It proved to be an advance party , and was soon dispersed . The republican army continued to advance , and soon after encountered another force , which was confidently believed to be the main body of Arredondo 's army . A smart skirmish ensued , during which a few prisoners were taken , together with two or three pieces of artillery . // 242 July , The rest effected their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the republicans by sending forward these two parties with a view to check their advance , while he prepared for their reception in a position more favorable to his views . His true position was then ascertained at a distance of two or three miles , and that the intervening space was so sandy as to render it almost impossible to drag along the cannon , and that there was no water to be had . Under these circumstances a council was called on the field , and it was determined that the army should retire to the position first occupied in the morning , and await the movements of the enemy , and at all events attack them if they should attempt to cross tl ) e Medina . This plan , the only one which could have saved the army , was thwarted by the obstinacy of Colonel Manchaca , who commanded the provincial cavalry , a brave , but headstrong man , who had great influence over his countrymen . He positively refused to obey the order ; and such was the danger to be apprehended from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the officers , and the impetuosity of his troops , and gave orders to advance upon the enemy at all hazards . The battle which ensued was obstinately contested ; and although the republicans fought under great disadvantages , being already exhausted with heat and want of water , and obliged to leave several pieces of artillery behind on account of the sandy nature of the ground , yet the battery of the enemy was twice silenced by the American rifles , and the singular spectacle l ) resented itself of two armies flying from each other , each thinking itself defeated . The defection of one Muscjuis , with a squadron of provincial horsemen , late in the afternoon , changed the fate of the day . Turning the left of the enemy 's line , he advanced to the rear , and surrendered to Arredondo , whom he found mounted on a fresh horse , having already given orders to retreat . The information conveyed by Musquis induced him to return to the charge ; the whole line advanced with little fur* ther opposition , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to rally the flying republicans . A feeble remnant of the American volunteers escaped to tbe United States , and the province was almost depopulated . The following spring ( 1814 ) , an attempt was made to renew the enterprise , but it totally failed , and after the restoration of Ferdinand the Seventh , no hope was entertained of securing // the independence of Mexico until the plan of Iguala was formed , In Texas the settlements were almost entirely abandoned and there only remained a scanty population , dependent almost exclusively on the military force , in San Antonio , La Ba his , and Nacogdoches . The region which formed the theatre of these operations , extending from the Sabine to the Rio del Norte , is one of great natural beauty and fertility . It is intersected by the Trinity , the Brazos , the Colorado , the Guadaloupe , and some smaller streams , which rise in the springs of the Rocky Mountains , forming a ridge generally called the Sierra Morena , and , after a comparatively short course , fall into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being principally composed of extensive prairies ; hut the alluvion upon the watercourses , covered with wood or cane , is admirably adapted to the culture of cotton and sugar , and the open plains to the raising of cattle to an unlimited extent . During the existence of the Spanish Government , the natural resources of this beautiful country appear to have been wholly unknown , or never appreciated . The Mexican people do not possess the enterprise and industry , necessary to profit by such decided natural advantages of soil and climate . At the period we speak of , those extensive and woodless l ) lains were the haunts of innumerable droves of horses " desert-born " ; and nothing can be imagined more grand than their movements in squadrons of thousands , when frightened by the approach of the solitary traveller . " A thousand horse , and none to ride , - With flowing tail and flying mane , Wide nostrils , never stretched with pain , Mouths bloodless by the bit or rein , And feet that iron never shod , And flanks unscarr 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild , the free , Like waves that follow o'er the sea , Come thi6kly thundering on " The scanty population of this beautiful province , after the counter-revolution in 1813 , remained for many years subject to the constant depredations of the Camanche Indians , encouraged by traders from Natchitoches , who furnished them with arms and ammunition , and took in exchange the horses and // mules , and , in some instances , captive Mexicans , plundered from the defenceless inhabitants . This trade was prosecuted by none with more avidity , than by some Mexicans , who had taken refuge in Louisiana ; and Don Bernardo Gutierrez himself was engaged for several years in fabricating spear points for those Indians . The lately flourishing colonies of Texas owe their origin to the perseverance and enterprise of Colonel S. T. Austin . His father was in treaty with the Spanish authorities of the Internal provinces , before the revolution in Mexico ; and , early in the year 1821 , he was authorized to introduce and settle three hundred families on favorable conditions . But he died before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his son succeeded to his right , and prosecuted his enterprise . The first settlement was made on the Brazos , in December , 1821 . The original grant was confirmed by the new government of Mexico in 1824 . Since that period , Colonel Austin has entered into several new contracts for establishing colonies . All the other grants in Texas , except a few in favor of Mexican citizens , were modelled upon those of Austin . The nominal grantee is called the empresario . He is considered , by the terms of the contract , merely as a trustee of the government , having no title himself to the land within the limits of his future colony , except upon condition of settling a certain number of families . The settlers themselves receive a title for each family , for a league square , upon the express condition of settlement and cultivation , and the payment of certain very moderate charges , within a limited period . It is believed that these conditions were , by the colonization laws of Mexico , the basis of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition that all right and title should he forfeited , if the grantee should abandon the country , or sell his land , before having cultivated it . An inspection of the various maps of Texas will show how numerous have been these privileges conceded to various empresarios . The face of the province from the Nueces to Red River , and from the Gulf to the mountains , is nearly covered by them . It became at last a matter of greedy speculation ; and it is a notorious fact , that many of the empresarios , forgetting the contingent character of their own rights to the soil , and the conditions upon which their future colonists were to receive allotments of land , proceeded at once to make out scrip , which has been // sold in the United States to an incalculable amount. * In addition to this we are informed , on the best autbority , that the manufacture of land titles , having no foundation whatever , has been carried on as a regular business . That frauds of these different kinds have been practised on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , is beyond doubt . Had the close of the present campaign been what its opening seemed to portend , and the colonies been broken up , it would be impossible to calculate the losses which would be sustained , by those who have never seen the land which they bave bought . It is not hazarding too much to say , that millions have been expended in the southern and south-western States . Among the exciting causes of the present troubles in Texas , may be set down the unsuccessful efforts of the colonists to separate themselves from Coahuila , and to establish a constitution of government for Texas alone . The Union of Coahuila and Texas as a State of the Mexican federal republic , had become odious to the colonists of American origin , who were now numerous , because the seat of government was too remote , being fixed at Saltillo , and the inhabitants of that part of the State were almost exclusively of Spanish descent . The Americans began to think and to feel , that they were strong enough to manage their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can not be denied , that they had been treated with great liberality and indulgence . They were entrusted with the administration of their laws , and it is difficult to say xvhat laws they did administer ; it was , certainly , any thing but the ancient laws of Mexico . But they felt that a separation from Coahuila was essential to their prosperity . Ultimately a constitution was adopted for Texas alone , and submitted to the general government in Mexico . Colonel Austin was charged with this negotiation . Finding it difficult , if not impossible , to effect the object , he wrote a letter to some of his friends in Texas , ( which was intercepted , ) in which he intimated that it was time for Texas to * The production first mentioned , at the head of this article , gives many curious details on the subject of these speculations by agents and assignees of the emprcserios , in New York , and extensive sales of scrip , a kind of stock which some of them told the disappointed purchasers was deliverable not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no space for quotations , but refer our readers generally to the work in question . // take matters into her own hands , and do herself justice . The consequence of this indiscretion was the immediate imprisonment of Austin , charged with treasonable designs . The scheme was defeated , and Austin was released . It is certain , that this attempt on the part of the American colonists excited the jealousy of the Mexican government . Before we mention the next link in the chain of events , it is necessary to premise , that the unappropriated lands , although the property of the State , can not be granted without the sanction of the general government . At the time we speak of , the rage for land speculation , having " grown by what it fed on , " was insatiable . The seat of the State government had been changed , and the archives removed from Saltillo to Manclova , a position more central , on the xvcst of the Rio Del Norte . In 1S34 , a company of land speculators , by means never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grant them , in consideration of twenty thousand dollars , the extent of four hundred square leagues of public land . This transaction was disavowed , and the grant annulled , by the Mexican government ; and led to the dispersion of the legislature , and the imprisonment of the Governor , Viesca . And yet this unauthorized , and , perhaps , corrupt grant of public lands formed the basis of new speculation and frauds . A new scrip was formed ; and , according to the best information we have been able to obtain , four hundred leagues became , in the hands of speculators , as many thousands . The extent of these frauds is yet to be ascertained ; for such is the blindness of cupidity , that any thing , which looks fair on paper , passes without scrutiny , for a land title in Texas . This interest in the soil of Texas , whether real or fictitious , so widely diffused among a speculating people , extending from Boston to New Orleans , could not fail to create a sympathy and a bias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonists and the government of Santa Anna , might compromise the neutrality of the United States . Such a rupture was soon brought about , and the colonists flew to arms . It would be altogether premature , at this time , to give any thing like a history of even the comparatively early incidents of the present struggle . We content ourselves with a few leading facts , about which there can be no mistake . An attempt to establish custom-houses on the expiration of the privilege of exemption from the payment of duties for two // years , granted to the colonists , which was forcibly resisted by them , and a demand for the persons concerned in tile grant of the FOIII ' hundred leagues of land , were the immediate precursors of hostilities . Colonel Gonsales had been first sent , with orders to arrest tile obnoxious members of the legislature , and others concerned in that proceeding ; but is said to have be trayed his trust . General Cos , the confidential friend and brother-in-law of Santa Anna , was next despatched for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of the Brazos , at the head of four hundred men , destined to reinforce the garrison of San Antonio , and to accomplish the purpose first announced . General Cos , Oil his arrival , disclaimed any intention to disturb the great body of the colonists . But his proceedings roused the people to arms , and the war began in earnest . These events , as we remarked , are so recent , and the particulars rest so much upon rumors , or ex prtrte statements , made in the heat of the moment , that it would be idle to attempt to give any thing like a connected narration of them . Nor is it at all material to our preseilt purpose . It seems to have been the intent of the colonists to prevent the junction of Cos with the troops already at San Antonio . La Bahia or Goliad was first taken by them ; but they failed of interceptillg the march of Cos , will finally reached his point of destination . He immediately prepared for the defence of the capital , by establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texas , with even a smaller force than the enemy , finally succeeded in carrying the place ; General Cos , late in October , capitulated ; and his troops , as well as himself , were permitted to retire from the province . He has been accused of violating the terms of the capitulation , and of forfeiting his parole . It is certain that he has been engaged in the second invasion of Texas . The expulsion of Cos , with the fall of San Antonio de Bejar , was considered by many as an event of the greatest importance . But it is certain that it had , for a time , its unfavorable effects on the cause of the colonists . It emboldened the leaders of the army , and produced that confidence in their own courage , and inspired them with that contempt for their enemy , which often lead to the most fatal consequences . The military force began to melt away . They had assembled for a coup de main , and could not be brought upon a regular // military establishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexico , supposing that Santa Anna would find constant employment in repressing the spirit of revolt against his authority , which had been manifest in some of the central States . There was one consideration , which never seems to have entered into their calculation that there exists in Mexico an inveterate prejudice against the American colonists , if not against the whole people of the United States , and that , if any thing could unite the Mexicans , it would probably be the success which had at first attended the struggle of the colonists , and the growing suspicion that they intended to strike for a total separation from Mexico , instead of adhering to their first claim , - the re*stablis1iment of the constitution of 1824 . It soon became apparent , that the authority and influence of Santa Anna were actually strengthened by the recent defeat of Cos , and that he would be enabled to bring to bear on the revolted colonies all the resources of Mexico . Whatever differences of opinion might exist as to the form of government , one feeling at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to dismemberment , and that strangers professing a different religion , and who had been treated at first with great liberality and indulgence , should not be suffered , without a vigorous struggle , to seize upon one of the most fertile provinces of the Republic . It is well known , that there existed a strict alliance between Santa Anna and the clergy ; and it was not to be expected , that a body of Protestants would be permitted with impunity to the national relioion It 5001 became apparent , that oppose b religious intolerance was mixed up with political animosity against the American colonists , and thus they had every reason to expect a furious*and desperate conflict . Whatever may have been said to the contrary , it is certain there were great differences of opinion among the colonists , and even violent party dissensions . Many , who were in the quiet enjoyment of their property , were opposed to all these hostile movements ; some were in favor of the constitution of 1824 , and some for a total separation and independence . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 7th of November , was adopted in December , 1835 , at La Bahia or Goliad , not by persons assuming to act in a representative capacity , but by about ninety individuals , all , except two , Americans , if we may // judge by their names , acting for themselves , and recommending a similar course to their fellow citizens . That declaration furnishes proofs of the dissensions and jealousies of which we have spoken , as the following extract will show . " They have seen the enthusiasm and the heroic toils of an army bartered for a capitulation humiliating in itself , repugnant in the extreme to the pride and to the honor of the most lenient , and no sooner framed than evaded or insultingly violated . They have seen their camp thronged , but too frequently , with those who were more anxious to he served by , than to serve their country ; with men more desirous of being honored with command , than capable of commanding . They have seen the energies , the prowess , and the achievements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and worthy to participate in the inheritance of the sons of such a father , frittered , dissipated , and evaporated away , for want of that energy , union , and decision in council , which , although it must emanate from the many , can only be exercised efficiently when concentrated in a single mind . They have witnessed these evils with bitter regrets , with swollen hearts , and indignant bosoms . They have seen the busy aspirants for office running from the field to the council-hall , and from this back to the camp , seeking emolument and not service , and swarming , like hungry flies , around the body politic . " This document proves another fact ; that the ancient population of the province was favorable to the views of the new government of Mexico . The authors of this declaration recommend the convocation of a convention for the whole province , for the purpose of deciding upon ulterior measures , and the formation of a constitution . They seem to have had a correct View of the probable future operations of Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the favorable capitulation which Cos had obtained , and proceed to say , " An army recently powerless , and literally imprisoned , is now emancipated from a comparatively harmless , passive , and inactive attitude ; they have been transferred to one preeminently commanding , active , and imposing . The north and east of Mexico will now become the strong-hold of centralism . Thence it can sally , in whatever direction its arch-deviser may prefer to employ its weapons . The counter-revolution in the interior smothered , the whole fury of the contest will be poured on Texas . " // It is matter of amazement , that , with such forebodings , with such a knowledge of the views of Santa Anna , and of his resources , the early operations of the Americans of Texas were so feeble and ill-advised ; that they neglected to make the most obvious provisions and preparations for the contest that no line of defensive operations was established , but , on the contrary , the military force was divided for the purpose , worse than useless , of maintaining the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each other to afford mutual support , too remote from the settlements of American origin to promise any thing like protection , and themselves in the centre of a population hostile to the views of the colonists . Instead of concentrating the whole effective force on some natural line of defence , withdrawing the artillery and ammunition , and dismantling the little forts which were equally useless to them and to the enemy , *hey persisted , as the storm approached , in cooping themselves up in these two places , cut off from reinforcements and supplies , and left the colonies themselves exposed to the attacks of the invaders , who might with perfect impunity have left La Bahia and San Antonio in the rear . As soon as it was ascertained that the Dictator was preparing for the invasion of Texas , it was obviously the policy of the colonists , to secure , for the defence of the important settlements on the Brazos , the cannon and military stores in the two forts above mentioned , which could not long be maintained , and to establish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the double view of covering the settlements , and of keeping up a communication with the Gulf of Mexico . No precautions of that kind were adopted , and the most fatal consequences were to be anticipated ,  --  the speedy reduction of those two forts , and the total loss of the feeble detached garrisons , and of all the valuable mat *riel so important for the successful defence of the country . It was soon ascertained , that Santa Anna was on his march , at the bead of a powerful army , towards the Rio del Norte , and early in February , 1836 , he established his head-quarters on the River Nueces , on the east of that river , and there issued the proclamation alluded to in the commencement of this article . His plan of operations , so far as it could be divined or learned by the first steps taken by him , was precisely what the Americans , as we remarked above , ought to // have counteracted in anticipation . It was to advance in two columns , one directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast to La Bahia , thence to cut off the Americans from all communication with the Gulf . His effective force has been variously estimated , from five to ten thousand , including a fine corps of cavalry , believed to be under the immediate command of Felisola , an Italian officer of experience , and himself an cmpresario in Texas . Early in March , a convention of delegates , from the various settlements of Texas , assembled at a place called Washington , and issued a more formal declaration of independence , setting forth the grievances which impelled the people to take that step , to some of which we have already alluded . This declaration is signed by forty-four delegates , of whom three or four appear to he Mexicans , arid particularly Don Lorcuzo de Zavala , who has given to the world a history of Mexican affairs , and who has himself participated in some of its revolutions . The convention prefaced the detail of their grievances by a general assertion , that , " The Mexican government , by its colonization laws , invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness , under the pledged faith of a written constitution , that they should continue to enjoy that constitutional liberty and republican government , to which they had been habituated in the land of their birth , the United States of America . In this expectation they have been cruelly disappointed , as the Mexican nation has acquiesced in the late changes made in the government , by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna ; who , having overturned the constitution of this country , now offers the cruel alternative , either to abandon our homes , acquired by so many privations , or submit to the most intolerable of all tyranny , the despotism of the sword and the priesthood . " With every sympathy for suffering countrymen who have become citizens of a foreign state , we can not forbear saying , that there is in this sentence something which requires to be analyzed . They admit , that the people of Mexico have acquiesced in the late changes , and that they are citizens of Mexico . They will probably not contest the principle , that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see nothing in the colonization laws , which promises to the colonists the perpetuity of the Constitution of 1824 , which // they themselves had aided in prostrating , as we have already remarked . If a majority of the people of Mexico has preferred a different form of government , we always supposed that in a republican government the majority must govern . By those same colonization laws , it was distinctly provided that the Catholic religion alone should be tolerated . The colonists subscribed , either expressly or tacitly , to that condition ; and their complaints on this head appear to us further unreasonable , inasmuch as it is well known that no persecution has ever taken place , on account of the profession , on the part of the colonists , of a different creed . Another subject of complaint was the failure , and refusal , " to secure on a finn basis , the right of trial by jury ; that palladium of civil liberty , and only safe guarantee for life , liberty , and property , to the citizen . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law of the trial by jury , a thing utterly unknown to their jurisprudence , the complaint would be just . But we are not aware of any such assurance , and we do know that tbe colonists , in the administration of justice among themselves , have been tolerated in that mode of trial . The convention enumerated , as among their grievances , and the causes going to justify their separation from Mexico , the refusal to separate Texas from Coahuila ; the forcible dispersion of the legislature ; the imprisonment of Colonel Austin , to which we bave already alluded ; that the military commandant among them had been suffered to exercise arbitrary acts of oppression and tyranny ; that the government had demanded the surrender of a number of citizens , and ordered military detachments to secure them , and carry them into the interior for trial ; that they had made piratical attacks upon their commerce , and had demanded a surrender of their arms ; that their country was invaded by sea and by land ; and that attempts had been made to excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With respect to the justice of these complaints , we have nothing to say . We are sensible that no calculations can be made , in such a country as Mexico , upon the durability of any particular form of government , much less upon the manner in which it will be administered . With such a people , the written constitution is but little better than a dead letter the government , as administered , is essentially military ; and // it was amusing to see Santa Anna reporting to the minister of war , to be laid before the nominal President , the details of his military movements , as Augustus kept up the show of consuls and a senate , long after he had become master of the destinies of Rome . But , whether reasonable or not , these complaints , and the redress they claim , now seem likely enough to be enforced by the ultima ratio . That which seemed hardly possible , a few weeks ago , has come to be among the most probable things . That the extraordinary victory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is much more than , with our present information , we would venture to predict . The best opinions appear , as yet , even to be divided on the question , whether the capture of Santa Anna will strengthen or enfeeble the Mexican cause . But the check , which has been given , allows time for volunteers to pour in ; and that it is to be presumed they will , in great numbers . The attraction , which for various causes is felt towards that field of gain and glory , extends widely into the neighbouring regions of our territory . The indignation , which was excited through the whole country at the atrocities committed by Santa Anna in the flush of his short-lived victories , naturally was accompanied by the strongest sympathy with the sufferers , and seemed to supersede the consideration of the original grounds of dispute , making resistance to him , in that stage at least , an honorable cause ; though it is true , that this rising of outraged humanity against a savage thirst of blood will not take part against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained currency in the newspapers should be confirmed , that the victory was decided within twenty minutes , and that all of six or seven hundred Mexicans , who had not fallen in that time , were the victims of a mere butchery afterwards . When our government is satisfied that the revolutionary party is in possession , de facto , of the sovereignty of Texas , it will of course be at liberty to enter into relations with it , and be released from the obligation to restrain its citizens from volunteering in the war . But , before and until it is so satisfied , volunteers will continue to go , whether with its connivance , or in its despite . They will go , we say , because they have gone , under circumstances less favorable , as to their impunity , than what now exist . They have gone , in great numbers , on the self-same errand for which Burr , in 1807 , was brought to his trial for high treason ; in numbers // so great , that ( according to a responsible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less , who won General Houston 's victory , not more than fifty were citizens of Texas , having grievances of their own to seek relief from , on that field . The sacred obligation imposed on the United States , by the Law of Nations , to maintain , and compel its citizens to maintain , a strict neutrality in that contest , was enforced , if possible , by the spirit of their treaty stipulation with Mexico , to restrain Indians , within their limits , from committing acts of hostility to that government . The obligation was acknowledged in Mr. Forsyth 's notes to Mr. Gorostiza . It was the ground of the circulars from the State office to the District Marshals , directing the prosecution of offenders . The government had some strong selfish motives for strictness and decision in the case . The contest in rrexas weighed heavily on the prosperity of our contiguous States . Until recently , New Orleans was the focal specie market of the South . At the period of the late crisis in Texas , its supplies were extremely scanty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enormous amount , there were not two millions of specie in the vaults of all the banks of that city . In the mean time , volunteers had been leaving it openly , with the avowed design of engaging in the contest against Mexico , and armed vessels had been fitting out for the purpose of cruising against her commerce . What has been , in this thing , will continue to be . The volunteers , under existing circumstances , will not be less eager for the enterprise than they have been , nor will the government find itself under stronger motives to exercise a rigid restraint . Nothing , then , is more likely , in our view , than that Texas will be overrun by a volunteer American force . It may be , after all , that Mexico will make exertions which are not generally anticipated . It would be mere folly to suppose , that her resources have been exhausted in her late disastrous campaign ; the feeling of religious.rancor is as strong as ever ; the national pride is quite as likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat as has been sustained ; and if accounts are to be credited , which come in no particularly questionable shape , the course , in which Santa Anna has just been arrested , was not so much his own , as one that was demanded of him by the popular voice . But we can not but think , that , as things stand , the most she can be expected to do is to prolong the struggle . // The late occurrences can not have failed to give strength to the settlers in Texas , by putting to rest the lately existing causes of dissension . Many of the leading men were of opinion , that the contest was engaged in prematurely ; that , however Just were the complaints which had been urged , however severely the colonists might have been made to feel the weight of power , and the caprices of a revolutionary government and bigoted people , they were now putting every thing at hazard on too small chances of success ; and that , if they had contented themselves for the present with demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made common cause with them , and created such a diversion as to paralyze all the efforts of the Dictator . An end being put to these questions , - the war being entered on , and already successfully waged , - that vigor which comes with unanimity may be looked for in the councils of Texas . It is true , that its population , not exceeding , according to the highest estimate , twenty thousand persons of all ages and both sexes , of American origin , would still seem to have a desperate enterprise in hand , if they were left to fight their own battles . But that they will be so left , there is , for reasons which we just now glanced at , extremely little reason to suppose . But will not our Government arrest further operations , by treating with Mexico for the purchase of Texas ? Mexico , if she had the best good-will for such a treaty , is not competent to enter into the negotiation . According to the theory of her government , the Congress and President of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President and Senate of the United States have to cede to her the State of Louisiana or Missouri . But to speak of xvhat , as things now are , is more to the purpose , what do the United States want of Texas , that they should be willing to pay money for it ? What great national interest would its purchase subserve ? It contains , it is true , large bodies of fine land , enjoys a temperate climate , and is , in every way , worthy of being inhabited by an industrious and free people . But , on the other hand , it is remote , and without a single seaport , into which a sloop-of-war could enter . Many wise and reflecting statesmen are fully persuaded , that the territory of the United States is now sufficiently extended . Great national objects were attained by the acquisition of Louisiana and of Florida ; - the free navigation of the Mississippi , and the best naval station on // the Gulf of Mexico , the port of Pensacola . But , if Texas should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , already made , be recognised as valid ? and if so , of what great value is the residuum ? Is the treasury of the Union to be drained for the exclusive use of the numerous speculators in those lands ? - An important consideration , touching this policy , relates to the Indians . We have already mentioned that there exist , within the territory extending from the Red River to the Rio del Norte , numerous tribes of Indians , some of them powerful and warlike ; the Camanches , the Conshattees , the Taneahuas . All these are , as it were , appendages to Texas , and , in the event of its acquisition by the United States , would pass with the territory . Our Indian relations are already sufficiently embarrassing , and our line of frontier too extensive for any thing like adequate protection .  --  and further , it may be , that the question would revive an old , and not altogether settled controversy . At the time Louisiana was acquired , Mr. Jefferson himself was deliberately of opinion , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was incompetent to make such an acquisition from a foreign power , and annex it to the Union ; and that an amendment of the Constitution would he necessary to sanction it . In a letter to Governor Lincoln , he even furnishes the formula of a proposed amendment , for the purpose of adrnitting Louisiana into the Union ; but adds , that the less that is said about the constitutional difficulty the better . Very little was said about it , and there was a general and tacit acquiescence , in consequence of the great and incalculable advantages expected from the acquisition in a national point of view . The purchase of Texas , under existing circumstances , might present a very different question . But will not our government acknowledge the independeice of Texas ? Yes , when that independence is established , if it pursues its ancient policy ; soon after it is established ; and not an hour before . When it is to be rightfully held to be established , may possibly become a delicate question of fact ; hut the principle , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our government , as it is unquestionably sound . And then , when Texas is an independent power , and shall ask for admission into our Union as a State or States , if so it should , grave questions will be raised , touching the balance of power between the different portions of our confederacy , // as obvious as they are likely to he exciting ; and the bearings of the measure upon our relations to foreign powers , may prove to he of the most complicated character . If we are to discuss matters of the import last intimated , it must be at some future time . The publications , of which we have given the titles above , throw hut little light on the political events of the day . Mrs. Jiolley has given an agreeable account of her visit , in her own femininely graceful style , yet by no means destitute of expression and force ; and her statements , as to the natural features of the country , are , in substance , correct . In support of the statements made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to the first-named production , written by a sufferer ; and we have other proofs , that his statements , so far as they go , are true . We wish there was less , in the authentic story of the transactions we have had in view , of a nature to damp the ardor we should feel in the cause of free principles , struggling against antiquated bigotry and the grasping ambition of a ferocious soldier.
