txt We consider this one of the most extraordinary works which has ever emanated from the American press . Possessed in extreme youth of great mathematical powers , Zerah Colburn excited , from his really wonderful calculations , a great degree of interest . Twenty years ago , he was considered the most remarkable phenomenon of the age-an eighth wonder of the world . Carried round the country by his father for exhibition , he received a great deal of attention ; men of worth and character were desirous that his talents , improved by education , should be of some use to the world . But he left this country for a number of years , and was forgotten . Unmindful that he is not still the wonderful boy that he was twenty years ago-that many of those , who then were willing to assist him , have left this world for anotherpuffed up with overmuch vanity , from the notice then taken of him , he has written his life . He seems to have imagined that the public were actually in a state of excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of his book , that a desire of making money prompted him to write his life , yet he talks all the way through the work , as if he did it only to confer an obligation on others , and to relieve the anxiety , which , in his opinion , they have felt . We must confess that we think he has made a mistake in saying that he does not " imagine himself to be the first of the manifestations of the power of the Deity ; " after reading his Life , we should never have imagined that he had any doubt of it . Zerah Colburn was born in the town of Cabot , Vermont , on the 1st day of September , 1804 . When about six years of age , his remarkable faculty first began to develope itself . As he was playing among the chips in the shop of his father , ( who was a joiner , ) he was suddenly // heard to say to himself-5 times 7 are 35-6 times 8 are 43 , &amp;c . Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had acttially taken place ; " and , as appears from the facts , thence resolved that this faculty of multiplication should be of some use to him . He immediately carried Zerah round for exhibition and patronage . After going to different places in Vermont and New-Hampshire , he proceeded to Boston , where the boy soon attracted much notice . Mr. Culburn appears to have been always trying to make the best bargain for himself . Many persons offered to bring up and educate his son free of expense , but this did not suit his purposes . " The friends of science , connected with Dartmouth College , desired to retain the boy and educate him . Dr. Wheelock , President of that Institution , made a very generous offer , intending to take upon himself the care and expense of his studies ; and , " continues our author , " it may be no more than a reasonable supposition that , if Mr. Colburn had acceded to these kind overtures , his wishes would have been eventually fulfilled . ' if we may judge from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that , by taking such a course , they would have been fulfilled . A foolish desire of displaying his really wonderful son ,  --  as if it were by any merit of his , that he was so ,  --  and a wish to make money , were evidently his ruling motives , lie was possessed of an idea that it was the absolute duty of others to support the boy , because he had a genius ; - not that talents were given him for the good of mankind , but to increase their burdens . If we knew nothing about him except from his son 's account , we should judge him to have been , in plain terms , the most impudent beggar of whom we have ever heard ; - that is , if he may be called a beggar who makes a demand and not a request . Several liberal gentlemen , in Boston , thinking that the boy 's mathematical talent might , if properly cultivated , become of great benefit , and understanding the disposition of the father " to feather his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition or subscription ; - $2,500 to be given to the father , if he would relinquish all claim to the boy , and $* , 500 to be applied to the education of the latter , under their own direction . ' This offer was , most unaccountably , not acceded to ; and after neglecting similar ones from other quarters , thus exciting much anger at his impudence and foolishness , he embarked for England ; - not forgetting , before he went , to demand assistance again , from those very gentl*mnen , whose liberality he had once refused . They landed at Liverpool May 11 , 18112 , and proceeded immediately to London . The fame of the boy , though not the character of the father , had preceded them ; and they found here ,  --  as they did every where else before they became known ,  --  friends exceedingly liberal . Many projects were started by men , by no means of little note , such as Davy , Mackintosh , &amp;c.  --  and as promptly rejected , for no assignable cause . We will here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the author , to throw the blame of all his father 's foolish conduct on his advisers and friends-preferring to have * For tile information of our readers , we must state that the story , as here told , though bad enough , is much more favorable to Mr. Colburn than any which we have before heard . We do not suppose the Autobiographer to be guilty of an inteutional misrepresentation ; - he probably tells it as it was told to him ;  --  but common report at the time , 1811 , attributed conduct to his father with reference to this transaction , for which he would find it much more difficult to make an excu e. // him stupid by other people 's advice , rather than his own will  --  a species of ingratitude which we can not sufficiently blame ; and a statement which we do not believe . Expensive rooms were hired , and an exhibition opened in London . Not succeeding according to his wish , he went to Dublin , Edinburgh , &amp;c. ; but without any better success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves for him , because they did not accomplish more . A portrait of the boy was taken , and many copies sold at a guinea each . He acknowledges that money was made by this ; and it is the only occasion , on which he does not complain of ill success and poverty ; though continually boasting of such visiters as would not be likely to see him want . Encouraged by the success of this enterprise , a committee was appointed to obtain subscriptions for a memoir ; though , as the author wisely and modestly remarks , " it must take a genius indeed to write a memoir of three years of a boy 's life , which should be worth eight dollars , even if that boy was Zerak Colburn . " " Concluding , after this unavailing attempt , that no efficient patronage was to be expected , " they left London for Paris , in the month of July , 1814 . Here , after exhibition , the like proposals were made for publishing his life , with like encouragement . The failure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frivolity of the French people , as gravely as if any one ever weighed the matter a moment before refusing . Mr. Colburn , with his characteristic want of judgement , engaged a dwelling at the rent of*2,000 francs per annum , and purchased furniture to the amount of 1600 more . With the author , we are at a loss to discover the meaning of this expenditure . After being examined before the Institute , through the interest of Washington Irving , he was placed , at the expense of the government , at the Royal College , founded by Napoleon , and formerly called after him . " The prospect was now more flattering than it had ever been before , for Zerah Colburn to receive such an education as would qualify him , if education could do it , to be useful in the scientific world . " Yet , after staying here less than a year , his father removed him again to England , where he expected to have a more advantageous offer . In this , however , he was mistaken . He repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Earl of Bristol , who , at his own expense , placed Zerah at the Westminster School . The son being thus provided for , the father began to look out for himself ; and we have an evidence how soon an honest man may become degraded to a knave , by following a degrading profession . Being in pecuniary difficulty , Mr. Colburn scrupled not to inform the old subscribers to the memoir of his son , that it was already in press , when not a line of it was yet in manuscript . Failing of obtaining , by this means , the support in idleness which he wished , he withdre his son , as a whole boarder , from Westminster , and was thus able to appropriate a part of the money to his own use . The Earl of Bristol having done every thing , which a father could have done for a child , for the support of Zerah , even to providing a place for his residence ( luring the vacations , had left the country for Germany . Dreading , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not well pleased at the distribution made of his bounty , he wrote over to England to have Zerah taken from Westminster and placed under a private instructer , offering to Mr. Colburn , who // complained of this new arrangement , ? 50 a year for his own support . This , however , he would not accept , hut removed his son from Westminster , and was thrown upon the world again . Imagining that his son had a taste for the stage , though there is no evidence that he had ever displayed any talent for such a pursuit , he engaged a tutor for him in this profession . As might have been expected , he had no success . The son then turned author , and began to write dramatic pieces ; - of five , which he composed , none were ever either acted or printed . After lingering in extreme poverty for two years , " the boy , " - as he continues to call himself through the work ,  --  began to he a schoolmaster . In the course of these two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not tell what , but probably some impudent demand ,  --  to Basil Montague , Esq . who he d assisted them with money to a great extent . Whatever it may have been , " it was evidently displeasing to his former friend , " who , to use the phrase of the author , " formally ejected him from his tenement ; " or , in other words , as may he supposed , " kicked him out . " We can only wonder that the same exemplary punishment was not hestowed on both father and son , in numberless other instances . In December , l8*25 , Mr. Colburn died ; and it would have been a happy circumstance for the son , if this had happened many , years before . The son soon returned to America , where he has since remained ,  --  teaching and preaching . We should have some compunction at expressing ourselves as we feel , after having read this Life , had it been written by any one but the hero of it . As it is , we consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to signify our indignation . From his own account , Zerah Colburn has lost all the talent which he ever had . He shows himself to be ungrateful for the efforts of his friends , by the complaints which he is continually urging upon them for not doing more . He seems to have followed his father 's practice ; and , after receiving money several times from the Earl of Bristol , complains of not having had answers to two or three letters to him , which , we think ourselves authorized in concluding , were applications of the same sort . He is now a Methodist minister , , , and if his sermons are written in no better style than his book , we pity his parishioners . His father , in order to make a fortune by the exhibition of one son , left a wife and five other children , for ten years , without contributing in the least to their support . He wa* , therefore , by his own son 's account , a bad husband and a bad father . The circumstances related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most impudent character-w antin g in judgment-always a fool-and , finally , a knave . And all these terms-except the last , of which we can not accuse him-apply equally well to the son . At the close of the volume , the author explains the mode of mental operation , by which he answered the ( luestions in mathematics , when a child . The process is simple , hut the disclosure will not , probably , enable others to carry on the operations in the same manner and with like facility . The power of calculation with such rapidity is a peculiar gift , or talent , which has been rarely bestowed ; we should more properly say the power in question was a gift-for it seems that even Zerah Colburn has lost the possession , or , at least , the capacity to a ) ply it to any useful purpose . There are , also , at the end of the // book , " a few pieces in rhyme , " but they will not gain immortality for their author . On the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life . For him , we feel less respect than before we read it , and for his father , unutterable contempt . Intraductory Discourse , delivered before the American Institute of Instruction , at Boston , August 2* , 1833 . By William Sullivan , one of the OJicers of the Institution . Mr. Sullivan states , in the first paragraph of his Discourse , its subject , which is an inquiry into the means , by which intelligence and happiness may be promoted . The consideration of this subject , involves an answer to the question , " In what manner should an American youth be educated ? " The proper education of an American youth may comprise , 1st . Whatsoever pertains to his person as an animal being ; 52d . Whatsoever belongs to the development and use of his understanding ; 3d . Whatsoever belongs to the motives , and to the object of all the acts , which he may justly do ; 4th . Whatsoever is involved in the duties of a citizen , in a free popular government . These subjects are then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many evils are pointed out in our present system of education . Among these are the neglect of moral and religious principles , and an inordinate respect for wealth , rank , and station . The future prospects of our own country are touched upon , our duties with regard to slavery and the stand which young men are taking in society . A variety of other topics is introduced , and many valuable reflections made . The discourse is the work of a man who observes and thinks much ; is liberal and patriotic in its spirit ; and highly moral and religious in its tone . The following paragraphs are striking and just By what means national perils , and sufferings can be averted , met , or remedied , and by what means the highest degree of security , and happiness may be had in a nation , must depend on human agency to some extent . But the wisest agents , in the space of time in which they can exercise power , can rarely foresee all the consequences of the measures , which they may order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Americans , who have far more power to order and accomplish , for their own good , than any people have ever had , to study the course of social action , and to learn how this has been over-ruled , by the power that can order , and accomplish , throughout the long series of ages . An example may be found in the question , what the fanatical warfare , which begun with the thirteenth century , had to do with the rational liberty and equality , which are now practically known to the people of the United States ? The military genius , the powers of sovereignty , the physical force , and the riches of Europe were then suddenly devoted to the remote and impracticable purpose of expelling the Saracens from the Holy Land . This was a surprising change from the desolating feudal warfare , mingled with barbarous magnificence , and abject vassalage , which had constituted , for ages , the principal elements of society . The human purpose , in this case , arose from a perverted and absurd sense of religious duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the condition of society , by giving new and better objects of desire to the human mind . Among the unforeseen consequences of the Holy Wars , as they are called , were more expanded views arising from the collisions of able minds , the enlightening and refining influences of commerce , the accidental discovery of the long-forgotten , and still admirable code * It is somewhere said , that civil goverunent is only a course of expedients ; each day bringing its own evils , which , in each day , must be remedied , if they can be ; and that a statesman must content himseif with doing this , if he can . But this ought not to be considered so , in this country.
