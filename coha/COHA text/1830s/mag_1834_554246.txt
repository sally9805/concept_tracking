txt II*HE ' botanical student , who has rambled over mountain and marsh7 with a box under his ' arm , and a ' bundl*e of grass or a shrub in his hands , must have been conscious how like one demented ' he often appeared to the ' unlettered rustics ; and while the query , so invariably put to him , What is that good received no satisfactory reply , . how plainly their iooks* // more expressive than language , told him , that he had better stop gathering good-for-nothing weeds , and take to some honest and profitable employment . This thing is too common to be wondered at , and is moreover easily enough explained on the ground of ignorance of any end or object in science , save that of the most direct practical utility . But how is it to be accounted for that men , whose education and intelligence , we should suppose , must have carried them beyond such unworthy views of the nature of science , too often entertain notions respecting botany , as confused and mean as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they can look on the plants of the field , clothed in the rich garniture of a summer month ,  --  in spite of the beauty that allures their gaze , and the admirable arrangement of organs , whereby the whole economy of vegetation is maintained ,  --  without receiving any uncommon ideas of wisdom or power , and perhaps turn away from them all , as unworthy of a passing notice ? Why is it that they can hear of the labors of botanists , of their travels by sea and land , amid suffering and privation , with no other effect , perhaps , than to call up more vividly to their imagination the picture of Obed Battius , or some other equally miserable caricature of enthusiastic devotion to a favorite science ? The truth , indeed , is too obvious to be questioned , that botany does not bear that character of dignity and importance in the public view , which has long since been obtained by many other of the natural sciences . This may be sufficiently explained ,  --  at least , we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single fact , that very little has been done by its friends towards introducing to general attention the more elevated and philosophical portions of the science ,  --  those only that can make it respectable with thinking and well educated minds . When a person lights upon a botanical book , and finds it ,  --  as nineteen times out of twenty he will find it ,  --  a catalogue of hard names , followed by still harder descriptions in an unknown tongue , or it may be designed for juvenile minds , and of course presenting nothing to him very striking in point of novelty or importance , it is not to be wondered at that he should imbibe no favorable impressions concerning it . From such we might reasonably expect to hear the complaint , that botany has furnished none of the useful and astonishing results of chemistry ; that it gives rise to none of those grand and * // powering conceptions , which the study of astronomy crowds upon the mind ; that we find in it little of the strong dramatic interest , so powerfully awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays . In short , however well calculated its study may be considered to arrest the attention and induce good habits of observation in the young , or to afford those of riper age a pleasing relaxation from other pursuits , it is too commonly regarded as destitute of those general views and profound discussions that require much thinking , or the exercise of a severe and precise logic . It may be said , and no doubt with justice , that such erroneous notions are the fault of those who entertain them , and that little knowledge of any subject can ever be expected , if a man can be turned from its pursuit at the first appearance of a technical word , or confine himself to the pages of a school-book . This may be true enough , but it is our business at present to show the cause of this prejudice , not its unreasonableness . The books ; that are put into the hands of beginners in this country , contain chiefly the merest elementary descriptions of the organs of plants , and perhaps a meagre account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapable , from their limited attainments , of conveying the slightest idea of the more elevated parts of the science . Books of a higher order , we know , have been occasionally published here ; but without a single exception that we can think of at this moment , they have been the productioiis of authors who have not attained the highest rank in the science , nor been duly sensible of the advances made in it by others . While the works of Sir J. B. Smith have found editors and puhlishers with us , the masterly writings of Decandolle and Brown have been suffered to remain under the veil of a foreign or dead tongue , unheard of by the great mass of botanical students . Had half the efforts been inade to present the science in a light at all worthy of its real merits , that have been used in teaching words , or disseminating loose and superficial views , its pretensions to a high character would long since have been seen and acknowledged . We should not now be obliged to say , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more distinguished than botany for the enlargement and permanence of its general views , for the strictness and accuracy of its reasonings , for the sure and cautious deductions on which its great principles are established , // for the demonstrations of the harmony and contrivance with which the organic world is ordered , and especially for a spirit of patient and profound philosophy , which alone can confer upon a science real dignity arid value . To obtain a rank among the most distinguished botanists of the present day , demands not only long and laborious investigation , but the exercise of talents that belong to the highest order of mind ; 4*r the relations to be discovered , and the principles to be deduced , must be the result of profound and untiring reflection . The laws whereby the vegetable economy is regulated , those which govern the affinities and differences of its various members , their distribution over the surface of the earth , and their connexion with the physical agents around them , are just beginning to be discerned , and their study will long present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius may find ample scope for the exercise of its powers . The whole end of botany is not accomplished , when we have accurately described the characters of plants by which they are distinguished from one another. , and given them a name and a place in the great register of nature ; for we are thereby furnished with no better knowledge of the plants *themselves , than we could obtain of the propensities and mental faculties of a runaway , from the advertisement that describes his clothes and person . Neither does the branch of physiology which teaches us the functions and general economy of plants , furnish us with that particular knowledge of the plant that we wish , any more than the most intimate acquaintance with metaphysics or human anatomy would enable us to pronounce at sight upon the mental or physical habits of an individual man . The noblest end of botany , now , is to ascertain the points of resemblance and difference between plants , which associate them with and remove them from one another , to trace the progress of organization through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , to lay open the operation of all the causes which modify the cQnditions of their existence . This is that philosophy of botany , to the advancement of which the most eminent in its pursuit are directing their utmost efforts , and some more adequate notions of which are necessary to gain for it the general respect that it really deserves . The great , the essential preliminary towards the attainment of this end ,  --  if indeed it may not be more properly considered // ag comprising the end itself ,  --  is to improve our classifications ; for these involve so many considerations ,  --  have reference to so many points in the history of the plant ,  --  that when it is once fixed in the place to which it most naturally belongs , we are thus made acquainted with the most valuable knowledge concerning it , always excepting its practical uses , which are determined by experiment . Had this truth been generally recognised , and made the basis of improvement in botanical science , we should now be spared the regret that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how much labor and zeal have been expended on points of comparatively small or secondary importance , to the neglect of those that deserved the first and closest attention . We should not have to deplore that common misapprehension of the true nature and purposes of botanical classification , which has given rise to a fatal jealousy among men zealously devoted to the cultivation of the same pursuit , and lain like a blight on the growth of this beautiful science . While the number of described plants was small , and those but imperfectly known , the only motive that led to their systematic arrangement was the greater convenience it afforded of ascertaining their names , and , in the facilities which it supplied for this object , consisted the sole merit of the arrangement . The principle thus laid down , and which was well enough in the commencement of the science , continued , however , to maintain all its force long after the accumulated results of discovery demanded more ample and accurate information , more enlarged views , and a spirit of philosophizing that should concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger still , after this kind of classification had been carried to its highest possible degree of perfection , and every thing been accomplished by it that could have been anticipated , it was looked upon as rendering any other on different principles and for different purposes altogether unnecessary , and all that remained for botanists was to add to the existing heap of crude and barren materials . The object indeed was an important , an indispensable one , and the mind that best accomplished it was one of no ordinary capacity , but after all , it is only a means and not an end , for which it seems to have been generally mistaken . It is to be understood , that the difficulty under which naturalists labored for a long time , and which operated as a serious check on the progress of science , was the want of a system , whereby // the contributions to the common fund of information could be easily arranged and readily referred to by others . Without this their researches were almost vain , and their results unprofitable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have now been discovered , every one of which has been examined , its characters set down , its relations unfolded , and of many , the properties and uses have been ascertained . But how is this knowledge to be referred to ? With one of this immense multitude in our hands for the first time , how are we to ascertain a single fact concerning it , without previously making ourselves acquainted with its name ? What clue is to guide us through the vast labyrinth of genera and species , and bring us at last to the very plant in question ? Some system of arrangement or classification , of course , is the only thing that will remove the difficulty , and those that have been constructed in direct reference to this point , viz , for ascertaining the names of plants , are called artificial or arbitrary methods , in contradistinction to the natural methods founded on the relations of plants , and indicated by nature itself . Each of these methods has distinct and peculiar purposes of its own , and when these are understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question with those in the least qualified to judge , that both have a utility that is indispensable to the interests of the science . Simple and intelligible as this appears , yet an unaccountable delusion seems to have prevailed , that they are not merely different from , hut opposed to each other ; that their ends are the same , but attained by different routes ; that their merits are conflicting , and are to be weighed in the same scales together . Opposition , jealousy , and party-spirit have thus been excited , where naturally no foundation for them ever existed in difference of opinion or interest . Bearing in mind the fact above stated , that in the artificial method the object is merely to ascertain the names of plants , we , of course , should not expect to find them arranged according to their general affinities , for a single organ may be assumed , and the differences which it presents in different species be made the basis of the classification . Thus , if we class plants according to the form , absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Tournefort , or of the stamens , with Linnms , we shall bring species together , agreeing in respect to these organs , while in every other particular , there // may be the utmost possible difference between them . Plants , between which the most obvious family likeness exists , may be torn asunder , and placed in classes far remote from one another , the object being not to ascertain relations but names . Though any part or quality of the plant may be made the basis of this method , yet its design will be best fulfilled when this basis is something inherent in the plant , easy to be observed , found in the greatest number of plants , and presenting sufficient variation in different species to make in easily and clearly expressed . The artificial methods were exceedingly defective , and about as numerous as the botanists who used them , till binn*us , after devoting all his energies to their improvement , finally succeeded in constructing one which superseded every other , and has maintained its superiority to the present day , unrivalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just mentioned to the greatest extent , lie fixed upon these organs as the ground of his classification , and certainly no man , starting from a single idea , was ever conducted to more brilliant and durable results . His first eleven classes were founded on the number of stamens ; the two next , on their insertion ; the two next , on their comparative length ; the five next , on their union ; the three next , on their separation from the pistils ; and the last , on their absence or obscurity . The remarkable facility which this method afforded for ascertaining the names of plants , and its admirable flexibility under difficulties , were so strongly contrasted with the deficiency and awkwardness of all previous contrivances , that we can not wonder at all at the universal acclamation that greeted its announcement , or the hearty tribute of homage and thanksgiving bestowed upon its author . And still we ought not to forget the numerous other circumstances , that contributed at the time to give popularity to the new system . Within a short period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the defects of other systems more apparent and onerous than ever ; the credit of discovering the functions of the stamens had just been given to its author ; science was incalculably benefited by his introduction of specific names and characteristic phrases , and in his hands botanical nomenclature was endowed with a precision and force it had never before known . Add to this , that he had rendered important services to every other branch of natural history ; the whole domain of nature had been subject to his researches , and he had // everywhere left the impressions of his comprehensive mind . We mention this , not in disparagement of the sexual system , for we have no wish to detract in the slightest degree from its merits , but in order to account for the common disposition of its followers to give to it merits that it neither does nor can possess , and pertinaciously to claim for it an end never thought of by its author himself . It is not the first time that a man , who has done one thing well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing . In the natural method , plants are arranged according to their natural relations ; those being associated together , which most nearly resemble one another in the whole of their structure and appearance . They are expected to agree not in one particular only , but in many ; all minute and trivial characters are disregarded , while the prominent and striking features , being indicative of family resemblance , and connected with the general economy of the plant , are assumed as furnishing the only ground that should determine their relations . Every plant stands by the side of those it most resembles , and if our classes and orders are not defined by well-marked limits , but gradually blend together on their outskirts , it certainly is not our fault , for we do no more than preserve those family resemblances ,  --  in fact , copy that arrangement of the vegetable tribes , which nature itself has made . So plain and numerous are the affinities that exist between certain plants , that little betanical tact is required to discern them ; they are evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see this strong family likeness between the different species of the Grasses , and of the Palms , for instance , and would expect to find them , in a natural classification , arranged by the side of one another . Let us not he misunderstood ; nature has instituted neither classes , orders , nor genera . She has done nothing more than to throw together the various members of the vegetable kingdom , in groups of more or less distinctness and extent . It is our business to ascertain and define the particular conditions on which their affinities depend . They must necessarily be less obvious in some cases than in others , but are not on that account the less real and strong . Inasmuch as traits of consanguinity between different men may be discerned in their moral and intellectual resemblance , when their features and complexion would never betray the fact , so to discern the affinities of plants and animals , we must often go beneath the surface , // and find , in more important parts of their structure , marks of relationship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects of the artificial and natural methods of classification , will show well enough their several uses in the study of hotany , and enable our readers to see that while both are indispensable , the latter can not he neglected , without entirely overlooking the grandest views and deepest principles that the science contains . An exclusive attachment to the artificial method accustoms the mind to partial observation and superficial views ; for as the attention is directed solely to the sexual organs , and that only for the purpose of finding the name of the plant , it is perfectly obvious , that much in its history must go unknown and unstudied . The very convenience and facility which it continually affords , incline the mind more and more to look at vegetables in a single point of view , and finally to regard this single object of finding their names , as constituting the whole science of botafly . Incorrect notions relative to the nature of organs , and the force of characters , are insensibly imbibed ; and while exaggerated estimates are made of the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained of the insignificance of others . In the natural method , on the contrary , not one , but all the organs pass under review , and are submitted to close examination , before the plant can be traced to its place in the general arrangement , so that the process of finding its name acquaints one with the most valuable points in its whole history . Instead of referring directly to the specific description , after a hasty glance at the stamens and pistils , the calyx , corolla , seedvessel , seed , and general aspect are also considered ; and thereby the student becomes better acquainted not only with the plant , but with a variety of properties which it possesses in common with a great many others . The study of affinities , when applied to particular species , necessarily throws light on other species ; a knowledge of one constantly illustrating and increasing that of others . On the , score of convenience , too , the artificial has but little advantage over the natural method , to one who is already acquainted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly trouble himself to count the exact number of stamens , in order to ascertain its name , for the first glance would show him its affinities with others that he has previously examined , and consequently lead // him , at once , to its place in the natural system . Thus the relations that the plant possesses with other plants , and which form the most valuable part of its history , are already manifest before he has found its name ; while be who neglects the study of the natural system is unable to advance a single step in the knowledge of the plant , till he is master of this fact . The decided and emphatic testimony in its favor of Linninus himself , is a striking proof of the comprehensiveness and impartiality of his views , and is singularly contrasted with the misplaced jealousy of some of his disciples . He declares , that the natural method is the first and last object of botany ; ' that its fragments even should be diligently studied ; ' that none but poor botanists think it of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own labors and of those of every accomplished naturalist ; ' that he had made some discoveries , and that the man who would remove his few remaining doubts , should be his Magnus Apollo . ' 1/lany attempts have been made to arrange the vegetable kingdom according to a natural system of classification ; but Jussieu was the first to develope its true principles and construct its foundations and frame-work , to be enlarged and completed by the labors and superior knowledge of succeeding botanists . Considering the immense researches that were required tG bring the undertaking to any thing like a finished condition , and the disadvantages which naturalists of those days labored under , we have more reason to be surprised at its excellence than its imperfections , and feel constrained to look on it as one of the noblest monuments ever erected by human industry and genius in the great temple of nature . Many and important as are the changes it has suffered since its commencement , the impress of its original author is visible at every step , and time has not withered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fundamental principle of his system is , that all the organs and likewise all the points of view under which they may be considered , have not an , equal degree of importance or permanence ; that some control the others and necessarily determine their relations . It is this principle of the subordination of characters , first distinctly set forth by Jussieu , and now applied in the classification of every departrhent of natural history , which drew from Cuvier the splendid and merited eulogium , that in the sciences of observation it created an epoch as important as the chemistry of Lavoisier in the // sciences of experiment . ' To the development of this great idea , the labors of botanists have been principally directed in their endeavors to bring the natural method to the highest possible degree of perfection , and though genius and devotion have been brought to the work in no stinted measure , yet to Decandolle we believe is assigned the palm of undisputed preeminence . His Th6orie El*rnentaire de la Botanique , which contains a masterly exposition of the principles of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philosophy of Botany , and justly entitles its author to a place among the Newtons and Galileos of science . It is the production of a mind , that could dwell pith minuteness on the smallest details without narrowing its range , and raise itself to the contemplation of the newest and boldest truths , without risk of yielding to the allurements of baseless hypothesis . If we are sometimes startled at the wonderful boldness and originality of his views , we are no less surprised , as we follow him in his course , to behold the caution and security with which every step to their attainment is effected , and are obliged to acknowledge in his reasonings the power of that logic of facts , in which no flaw nor sophistry can be detected . Ever treading on the utmost verge of truth , he never oversteps its confines to lose himself in the bewildering regions of theoretical speculation . His reasonings , though eminently acute and profound , are characterized by a remarkable simplicity , and presenting a noble specimen of philosophical induction , they proclaim their author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the naturalists , of whatever age or experience , to whom the pages of this work will not furnish through life , inexhaustible materials for study and reflection . As it is little known , however , in this country , and as little ' studied , we suspect , in England , we have thought we might do an acceptable service to such of our readers as are interested in Natural History , by presenting them not exactly an abridgment of its contents , but an analysis of its general principles. , The theory of natural classification consists essentially of three parts ; which treat respectively of the comparative importance of the organs of plants , of the circumstances that may deceive the observer as to their true nature , and of the importance of each point of view under which an organ may be considered . // I. Comparison of otgans. in order to ascertain the relaLive importance of the organs , it is necessary to compare them in reference to theh* functions . We say , for instance , that the brain holds a higher rank than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this does not decide the relative rank of the brain and heart . Or , to adduce an illustration of a different kind , a general is higher than a captain , and a governor of a province than the mayor of a town , but the arbitrary laws of etiquette alone decide , whether the general or governor be entitled to precedence . The first general principle in the classification of organized beings is , that the importance of each organ can be calculated only when compared with those organs , which relate to the same class of functions . In the vugetable organization there are two classes of functions , one destined to the preservation of the individual , the other to that of the species . These , no doubt , are of equal importance , and always possess corresponding degrees of perfection . Hence , we deduce another general principle of classification , viz , that systems , established upon either of these two grand classes of functions , would be equally natural , provided they were constructed with the same care . The preference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because differences in the vegetable organ zation are more perceptible in them than in the nutritive organs , and more especially too , because the latter have been comparatively but little studied . Were they both equally well understood , without doubt a system founded on one , would be identical with one established on the other ; for every thing leads us to believe , that any complication , or other modification in one class of functions , is attended by a similar one in the other . Cesalpinus had established certain classes upon the structure of the embryo alone , many centuries before Desfontaines was conducted to the same result by mak .. ing use of the nutritive organs . Hence also we make the division of plants into Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons with so much the more confidence , because we are equally led to it , whether we assume as the basis of our reasonings , the reproductive or nutritive organs . In order to estimate the importance of each organ in a given function , we must ascertain what is essential to its performance , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of repro4iuction is fecundation , and the fecundating organs are consequently // of higher importance than all their envelopes . At first , the sexual organs are equally indispensable , but the duty of the male parts is of short continuance , and they , together with a portion of the female parts , are destroyed after fecundation . But as the female organ , beside this short-lived part , includes another for which all the rest are constructed , its importance is obviously greater than that of the male . Again : in the part of the female organ that remains , the integuments or fruit may be separated from the seed , and exist but for it . The seed has thus a higher value than its envelopes ; and continuing the same reasoning , we at last find the embryo performing the most important part in the whole function of reproduction . If , now , our conclusions be just , the organs may be arranged , in regard to their relative importance , in the following order . 1 . The embryo , the great end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are only the means . 3 . The envelopes of the embryo , viz , the integuments of the seed and the pericarp. 4 . The envelopes of the sexual organs , viz , the corolla , calyx and involucre. 5 . The nectaries and other accessory organs . Another means of judging of the relative importance of organs , is by the degree of constancy with which they appear in the vegetable organization . Some , we know , are frequently absent , some , not so often , while others are almost always present . Hence we infer , that the stamens and pistils have a higher rank than the calyx and corolla , and these latter than the nectaries ; the filaments of the stamen and pistil are thus shown to be of less consequence , than the anthers and stigmas. *A third means of judging is , to observe to what point a given organ is more or less intimately connected with the structure of certain groups , already acknowledged by naturalists . Thus , we conclude that stipules are more important than spines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stipules , while there are many in which we find indifferently species with or without spines . II . The circumstances that may deceive the observer as to the true nature of the organs . Before we can decide any question as to the relative importance of the organs , we need some means of distinguishing the organs themselves , and recognising their true nature , under all the modifications they are liable to experience . Looking at a single organ abstracted from the general structure , we can judge of its nature solely by its use , // *whrttever may be its position , form , or mode of action ; thus , the organ of vision is called the eye , and the part that bears the flower is called the peduncle . But when we examine beings as a whole , and judge of the nature of the organs in reference to the symmetrical plan on which they are constructed , this method will lead us into grievous errors . The *tail of the kangaroo serves the animal as a leg , yet nobody denies that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prolonged to a great length , performs the office of a true hand ; and The teeth implanted in the incisive bone , serve a purpose entirely foreign to mastication , yet none pretend to dispute the anaiomical analogy of these organs with the nose and teeth of other mammifers . So too , we see the leaves of plants sometimes prolonged and changed into tendrils for the purpose of supporting the stem , though their primitive function is to elaborate the nutritious juices . The stipules , the peduncles , and even the lobes of the corolla may be converted to the same use , and every body is familiar with the leafy appearance and structure of the branches of the Indian Fig , or Prickly Pear , ( Cactus Opuntia ) . From these examples and a host more that we might mention , we deduce the general conclusion , that it frequently happens , in consequence of a given system of structure , that a certain function , not being sufficiently performed by the organ ordinarily allotted to it , is discharged wholly or in part by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetry of the organs as compared with one another , of which a knowledge is essentially necessary to a perception of the general harmony and natural classification of beings . This symmetry of parts , which should be a prominent object of the naturalist 's studies , is , in one word , the result of their idative disposition ; and therefore , whenever this disposition is the same , no matter how various may be the form of particular organs in other respects , the subjects present a kind of general resemblance , that strikes the least practised eye . Among the causes of error that are liable to mislead us in ascertaining the true nature of the organs , the principal is abortion , more or less complete , which alters their symmetry . Every body knows , that sometimes certain parts of organized beings do not receive that increase and development for which they were evidently destined , owing either to the compression of a foreign body , or a loss of part of their nourishment . This // effect may be produced by internal causes , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but among those which prevent certain organs from receiving their frill increase , it iS possible that some may be the necessary consequences of the growth of another part , and will , of course , constantly occur in a given system of organization . We may , therefore , admit in theory the constant and predisposed abortion of certain organs , either wholly or in part . This is a startling doctrine to those yet uninitiated into a knowledge of the more hidden laws of organization , but is , nevertheless , as easy of proof as an abundance of the clearest facts can make it . Whoever will take the trouble to cut across the ovary of a horse-chestnut flower , soon after the petals have fallen , will find three cells and two seeds in each cell ; but let him look a few weeks afterwards , when the fruit has attained its perfect growth , and three seeds or nuts are the most that can ever be found ,  - -  sometimes but one . But to remove all doubt as to the fact and nature of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day after the period of flowering , to see some of the seeds gradually increasing , while the others are observed to remain stationary , and finally to be completely choked by the development of the first . Now , when we bear in mind that this phenomenon is constant and takes place in trees perfectly sound , are we not forced to believe , that it is owing to some circumstance in the very system of the organization of this tree ? In the oak , too , we have another familiar instance of a three-celled and six-seeded ovary finally resulting in one perfect seed only . The disappearance of the sexual organs is a very common occurrence , of which an example may be witnessed in the marginal florets of the snow-ball genus , and many other plants whose flowers grow together in large masses . The question then recurs , how shall we recognise the general symmetry of plants , amid the confusion produced by these partial abortions ? Some light may be obtained on this point from observing appearances denominated monstrous ,  --  an epithet commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organs , though many of them are returns of nature to the symmetrical order . Thus , to recur to an example already cited , if by some accidental cause , the six little seeds of the horse-chestnut or oak should obtain their full growth , and present us with a fruit of six nuts or acorns , we should call it monstrous , while , in truth , it is the single-seeded fruit // that is the real monster . The Antirrhinum or Toad-flax has a personate corolla , the lower segment of which sends out a long spur , with four stamens of unequal length , and the rudiment of a fifth . In a variety of this plant called Peloria , the flower is perfectly regular , having an equal fivelobed corolla sending out five equidistant spurs , in which are five equal stamens . Here is a most singular case of a return of nature to her favorite symmetry , and no doubt can he left as to which is the real monster . The rare example of certain compound flowers , where we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true calyx , is a strong proof of the egret 's being , in fact , an abortive calyx . It is well known also , that trees which have spinous branches in a dry soil , cease to have them in a fertile one ,  --  a sufficient proof that spines are ahortive branches . Another guide , less sure perhaps , hut adapted to more general use , is analogy or induction . It is found solely in a knowledge of the respective positions of organs . In an Albuca , for instance , we find the entire structure of a liliaceous plant , excepting that it has only three stamens bearing anthers , while between them we observe three filaments placed precisely where stamens would be , and very similar to the existing stamens . Hence , we conclude that these filaments are abortive stamens . In the Ice-plant ( Mesembryanthemum , ) we find a great number of filaments disposed in several ranks , but all adhering by their bases , and attached to the same point of the calyx , the interior bearing fertile anthers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the exterior being true petals . We conclude then , that in this genus , the petals are naturally abortive stamens , and from a crowd of similar facts we are led by a very powerful analogy to the belief , that the petals of all plants , as a general theorem , are only filaments of stamens , whose development is in the relation of cause or effect to the abortion of the anther . When too we see the calyx of a Valerian or Scabious evidently assuming the form of an egret or pappus , we are induced by analogy to extend this result to the compound flowers , and conclude that their pappus is only an abortive calyx . Finally , by analogy alone , we judge in a host of cases of the natural number of the parts of flowers and fruits , and are led to look carefully for those whose abortion we suspect . It is the successful use of this principle which , more than any thing else , facilitates the // study of nature , while the number of its objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the true genius for Natural History . The proximate cause of abortion is principally defect or excess of nourishment , and it may be well to consider a little fartlier the operation of these causes ; and first , the effect of abortion by defect on the organ itself . When partial , it gives rise to inequalities between organs naturally similar , and this is the principal ifuot the only cause of the irregularities presented in the structure of vegetables . Every thing which has any bearing on this subject , goes to establish the conclusion , that all organized beings are regular in their intimate nature , and that abortions , variously combined , produce all the irregularities that . arrest our observation . In this point of view , the slightest inequalities between organs of the . same name in a plant , are ' important , because they tell us in language plainer than words , that we may find analogous plants where this meqi*ality is still greater , and others where these organs , thus subject to partial abortion , have entirely disappeared . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in any given system of organization , there is inequality between organs of the same name , this inequality may attain its maximum , viz. the annihilation of the smallest part . When the abortion of an organ has proceeded so far as to prevent it from discharging its functions , it may he enabled , by this very circumstance , to fulfil some other functions . The abortion of the extremity of the leaf in vetches renders this part capable of performing the functions of a tendril , , and abortion of the flowers of the Vine turns the peduncle to a similar use . In the same way , . branches are changed into spines , and serve as defences to the ' plant , and the calyx of compound flowers into a pappus , which ' is useful , not more to the protection of the sexual organs , than the dispersion of the seed . It may happen , however , that an abortive ' organ , having lost the power of performing its proper function , . never becomes adapted to any other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a multitude of vegetables , we find abortive stamens and pistils reduced to simple filaments or stumps , and evidently useless . Petals are sometimes found so small that they can hardly be discovered , and can not protect the sexual organs . What purpose can those florets of certain compound flowers serve , which are invariably sterile ? In ' the animal kingdom , the nipples of ' // males , the rudiments of clavicles in the Cats , and of digits in the Ruminants , present us instances of a similar kind . These useless parts are the result of the primitive symmetry of the organization , and so far is their existence from being an argument against the general order of nature , that it furnishes one of the most striking demonstrations in its favor . Finally , abortion may be so complete as to leave no trace whatever of the organ . Sometimes , it may be discovered , as in the seed of the oak , in the earliest periods of its existence , and observed to be gradually diminishing , while , in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of growth . Here abortion is determined by causes so remote , that it is completed before it could be visible to us , although it may nevertheless have once existed . To illustrate this idea , let us suppose a branch of a palm , cut open from top to bottom , and our attention directed to the bunch or cluster in the centre of the section near the top , which is destined to expand the following year , then , a little lower down to the one that is to expand the second year , below that to one of the third year , and so on till we arrive at that which will expand seven years hence . Now , in certain palms , there is an entire abortion of some parts of the flower , and though this part may never he visible when the flower is developed , yet no one can deny that it may have existed in the bunch of the proximate year , or in one of the following , and that with the aid of proper instruments we might have discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidental or natural : when the former , we may observe the part unaffected by abortion in other individuals of the same species ; when natural , predisposed as it were by the march of vegetation , we recognise the abortion only by the analogy of neighboring species . The effects of abortion on other organs will differ according to the degree to which it is carried . If it be considerable , or if the nourishment be thrown upon organs of a more variable nature , there results , not only a change of size , but of function . In double flowers , which present a remarkable example of this kind , the abortion of the anthers permits the filaments to be developed beyond measure , and become transformed into veritable petals . All that has been said of abortions by defect is equally true of abortions by excess , but in an inverse sense ; and thus , while one necessarily produces the other , and both exist together , it is impossible in most cases to determine which is the cause , and which the effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abortion , we see in it , first , an explanation of a multitude of anomalies in the number of the parts of plants ; secondly , of many , perhaps all , the inequalities of proportion in similar parts ; thirdly , of the changes of form , and consequently of use , so frequent in organization , and incomprehensible without this theory . The next source of error to be considered , is the adhesion or engrafting of organs . Every body knows that a bud or shoot , placed upon another tree under certain conditions , is united to it in such a manner as to form a part of it and grow as if it were on its own stern . Every body knows , too , that in forests we find trees of the same or analogous species , which having been accidentally approximated , are united together so as to form but one trunk , and many have observed that certain organs of plants ; that have been brought near one another , are united in a most intimate manner ; that two neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having a double number of parts , and that two leaves may also adhere together , so as to form but one of a singular shape . So long as these adhesions take place rarely , they are considered , and justly too , as simple accidents , and no importance is attached to them in classification . But let us suppose that two ovaries , for instance , stand very close to each other from their origin , as in the case of the Pigeen-berry , ( Mitchella Repens ) ; it is clear , that by reason of this approximation , the opportunity of coalescing is so great , that union will always take place and we shall never see them separate . Now , this adhesion is nothing more than an accident , but it is one which is determined by causes belonging to organization , and as constant as the or*an itself insomuch that we have what may be called a constant accident , and though these terms seem contradictory , this kind of phenomenon is still very common in nature . Not only may similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to grow without adhering together , but the same thing takes place in different organs ; and it is remarkable , that while this phenomenon has been recognised under certain circumstances , it has , in analogous cages , been entirely overlooked or denied . Any organ , a calyx or corolla , for instance , may be described in two ways ; either analytically , by considering it as an unique whole divided into parts more or less distinct , or synthetically , as an aggregate of parts essentially distinct , but more or less approx // iniated or united . In the first method , we are bound to render an explanation of the causes and laws of the separation of the parts ; in the second , to give a similar explanation as to their approximation or union .. Both methods involve some hypothetical considerations , and yet , we must follow one or the other . If we are describing a Hollyhock , we must either regard the corolla as an unique whole , divided into several portions called petals , or the petals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corolla . Each of these modes of reasoning may possibly have some good foundation , but certainly it can not be right to adopt one in the case of the Hollyhock , and the other , when treating of a different flower . We must be consistent , and a method being once admitted , it must be adhered to in all analogous cases . The phenomena of crystallization , to borrow an illustration from a neighboring science , were explained by Rome de l'Isle , by considering crystals as integral bodies , which , in consequence of different truncations , assume all the secondary forms . The Abb6 Hauy , on the contrary , explained the same facts , by supposing primitive molecules , which , aggregriting after particular laws , determine all the secondary forms . Either theory may be adopted , though the former is now abandoned ; but what would be thought of a mineralogist , who should describe one crystal after Rome de l'Isle 's method , and another , after Ha.uy 's ? And yet , such is the state of botany , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes , therefore , a matter of serious inquiry , which of these two methods best expresses the whole of the facts , and whether there be cases where they may be blended together . When we speak of the perfoliated leaves of the Honeysuckle , the idea meant to be conveyed is , that an unique or orbicular leaf is traversed or enfiladed by the stem that bears it , yet no one at the present day hesitates to consider this pretended perfoliated leaf as composed of two opposite leaves united at their base . In precisely similar cases we use the term connate leaves , which expresses nearly enough the idea of union ; we follow all its degrees from the slightest to the most intimate kind , and when we perceive an interval towards the point of junction , we still consider it as two leaves imperfectly united , not as an unique leaf deeply gashed . The reason is , that at the base of the plant the two opposite leaves are separate and distinct , and that as we approach the summit , they tend more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each half of the perfoliate leaf unique in appearance , and possessing all the organization of one of the inferior leaves . Thus , though the phenomenon is constant , no one hesitates to consider it as a kind of accident , determined by the organization itself . The law here recognised is applicable to every case of connate leaves , and we must admit the general conclusion , that as leaves may adhere together accidentally , there are cases in which this phenomenon occurs constantly , in consequence of their nature and position . All that has been said of leaves must be readily admitted of stipules , which resemble them so closely ; so that when we see all the Leguminosae having a stipule on each side of the petiole , we may conceive that , if these two stipules should be so large as to touch on the side farthest from the petiole , they might be united , and consequently assume the appearance of an unique stipule opposite the leaf . The involucres , too , are subject to the same law of adhesion , as might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now universally regarded as only assemblages of floral leaves . In the Umbelliferae , the involucre generally consists of a certain number of whorled and separate leaflets , but in some species of this order , there is found instead of this whorl , a leafy disk , presenting as many teeth and furrows , as there are leaflets in the neighboring species . We are therefore constrained to regard this disk as formed by the natural union , more or less complete , of many leaflets , and not as a single-leaved involucre . If then the leaves and involucres be so readily regarded as subject to this law of adhesion ,  --  of the union of several distinct parts into one ,  --  why should not the fact of its operation be admitted in regard to the calyx ? This organ resembles the involucre in every respect ; the anatomy of the sepals shows that they are entirely leafy organs ; they are green and decompose carbonic acid like the leaves ; they are almost always furnished with the same hairs , glands , and sacks as the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accidental or habitual , we see them developed into true leaves . If then the calyx is of a leafy nature and so very analogous to the involucre , why describe it on a diametrically opposite plan ? Why consider it as a unique organ , more or less divided , instead of saying , as in the preceding cases , that it is formed of pieces more or less united together ? Besides , the latter method involves no more hypothe // sis than the former ; since , in a very considerable number of plants , the sepals are completely distinct from one another , and even attached separately to the peduncles . It is best supported too by their anatomy , for all the nerves of the calyx are directed from the base to the summit , as in leaves , though constantly described as if they proceeded from the summiL to the base , and since all modem botanists admit the *union of the calyx to the ovary , it would be strangely inconsistent to imagine , that the sepals could not be united as easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saying *of a calyx , that it is deeply cleft , the most proper language *obviously is , that the sepals are united only at the base ; instead of describing it as lobed and toothed , the sepals should be considered as united half or more of their length ; instead of distinguishing calices into polysepalous and monosepalous , we are bound to use the distinctions of polysepalous , or free sepals , and gamasepalous , or sepals more or less united , and reserve the term monosepalous for the rare cases , where there really exists but one lateral sepal . The same reasoning , the same analogies are applicable with perhaps still greater force , to the operation of the same law upon the corolla . This is not an unique whole , more or less divided , any more than the calyx , but an assemblage or whorl t*f petals , sometimes perfectly free and sometimes more or less united . In many cases this union is in a manner manifest to the eye , while in others , it is indicated by the disposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tubes are continuous , it may be conjectured by analogy , and by the insensible gradations to be observed between corollas with petals entirely free , and those with petals united . The corolla of the clover is formed of but one piece , instead of four separate and distinct petals , as in all the rest of the Leguminosae ; yet who , on that account , would deny its analogy to that order , and that it differs only in the natural adhesion of its petals ? Adopting the ordinary way of distinguishing corollas into monopetalous and polypetalous , we must suppose an organization entirely difli*rent , for what analogy is there between a flat petal associated with several others in a whorl , each attached to a single point , and a circular tubular petal , with many points of attachment and a sinuated margin ? Such a fact can be considered as hardly possible , when we recollect bow many families there are , in which we see plants with monopetalous // and polypetalous corollas , indiscriminately mingled together . And what are we to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vine , are separate at their base , but united at the summit ? This reasoning becomes still more striking , when we consider the light in which stamens have been viewed . These parts possess an extraordinary analogy to petals ; their point of attachment is constantly the same ; their number and position are generally symmetrical ; the anatomy and physiology of the filament of the stamen is perfectly similar to that of the claxvs of the petals , and in some flowers , they pass into each other by such insensible gradations , that it is impossible to say where one begins and the other ends . This being the case , we ought certainly to expect that the same mode of reasoning in regard to the adhesion of one should be equally applicable to that of the other . Now , however much the stamens may be united together , they never are considered in the light of an unique organ , divided more or less deeply into several parts , but always as separate and distinct organs , united according to the law of adhesion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent than that of the petals ? Are not the two phenomena equally constant in the same species ? Are any more evident traces of it left in one than in the other ? These two organs are of the same nature , and we must either consider the whorl of stamens as an unique whole , deeply cleft , or the whorl of petals as formed of many pieces more or less united . What would be thought of a zoblogist , who should describe the feet of the web-footed birds as orbicular disks , divided to a greater or less extent ? All naturalists regard them as distinct digits , united by a membrane , and this manner of considering organs as compound bodies , is the only one that represents the natural state of things ,  --  the only one that admits of clear expressions and exact comparisons . The truth of this theory becomes still more manifest , when we attend to the manner in which petals adhere at their base . In a * ) olypetalous flower we see that generally each petal is fixed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that if its base be very large , the rest adheres only by cellular tissue . Every family has thus a certain disposition in the vessels of the petals , and it is always the same , whether they be united or not . This analogy is equally striking , when considered in another point of view . Petals are composed generally of a claw and limb , as stamens are of filament and anther , and // adhesion ordinarily takes place by beginning at the base and finishing at the upper part , so that most petals , when they unite , adhere by their claws while the limb is free . In the same manner , most adhering stamens have the filaments joined and the anthers distinct . We come now to the pistil , or what , in this relation , is the same thing , the fruit . In the Ranunculaceae , we generally find the fruit composed of a considerable number of partial carpels , united in some species only at their base , in others half their length , in others , nearly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural than that ovaries , apparently unique but divided internally into *many cells , are in reality formed by the constant and natural adhesion of many carpels . Sometimes the partitions between the cells are formed by the reëntering valves , the carpels being plainly united by their lateral faces ,  --  a fact which beautifully illustrates this theory . We would say more on this point , but as it would be difficult to render our language intelligible to any but practical botanists , we are reluctantly obliged to dismiss thus briefly the most interesting among all the discussions on this subject . If the above reasoning be correct , it appears that the adhesion of different organs takes place as a necessary consequence of primitive contiguity , constituting what is called predisposed adhesion . It is easily conceived that it may mislead us in regard to the number , position and nature of the organs , and that it constitutes a subject of considerable importance in classification . Every case of adhesion can not be of equal consequence , and we are therefore led to adopt the following general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the adhesion of the different organs of fructification is so much the more important , as it takes place between parts in which this operation is most difficult . Secondly , the adhesion of these organs is so much the more important , as it is necessarily connected with the greatest changes in the general symmetry . Thus the union of the petals and stamens , of the filaments and styles , of the anthers and stigmas , of the ovary and calyx , in consequence of the great anatomical similarity of these parts , are phenomena of easy and frequent occurrence , and therefore of no great importance ; while for the very opposite reason , the union of the corolla and calyx , of the stamens and calyx , of the corolla and ovary , must be regarded as instances of adhesion of the highest importance . // We are not to suppose , however , that whenever two organs adhere together , they necessarily preserve all the parts of which they were originally composed . When two labiate flowers are united , we rarely find eight stamens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of ten lobes , their corolla may present indifferently all the numbers between five and ten . hi fact , the union of two regular flowers is seldom recognisable except by an augmentation of the number of their parts , some of each being lost by abortion . This theoretical consideration may be applied , in many cases , for the purpose of recognising* the affinities of certain plants . The Cruciferne , for example , , have naturally four petals and six stamens , which inequality in the number of parts indicating a loss of the original symmetry of the flower , we wish to determine , whether they are related to plants whose number of stamens is double that of the petals , or to those where these numbers are equal . If to the former , we must suppose them in their primitive state to have had eight stamens , two of which have aborted ; if to the latter , that each flower is originally composed of four petals and four stamens , but that they grow in threes , and that there is a union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , excepting a single stamen in each . This latter hypothesis implies a more complicated operation than the former , but still appears to approach nearer the truth , for cases have been found where the flowers possessed four petals and four stamens , and where , in place of the two lateral stamens , there was on each side a flower with the same number of parts . We are still farther confirmed in the belief that this is the primitive state of the Cruciferae , because the position of the two lateral stamens is always below that of the others , because they are very constantly wanting in many species , and because the Hypecoum , the only genus with which the Cruciferae have any marked relation , has four stamens and four petals .. This single case must suffice to show the practical application of the theory of abortion and adhesion , in unravellipg the natural affinities of plants . III . Having now exposed the principal difficulties in the way of recognising the symmetry of the organs , we shall show very briefly , in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most important of these elements is the existence or absence of organs , and on this point , we must beware of some powerful causes of error . Two organs // really existing may be so united and assume such an appearance , that the presence of one becomes problematical . Thus , the union of the calyx and corolla has given rise to the idea that one or the other of these organs is wanting in plants , where both really exist , and the union of the pericarp and spermoderm has sometimes induced the belief ; that the seeds had no proper envelope , or that the pericarp was wanting . Certain organs may fail also , in consequence of abortion ; and it is only by means of an acquaintance with the general symmetry of the plant , that we can distinguish between this phenomenon and that , where the organ is naturally wanting . After the presence or absence of organs , the next most important element of their symmetry is their absolute and relative position , for here we expect the greatest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be determined in relation to that which serves as its real support , that is , fiorn which it receives its origin and nourishment , and not organs foreign to its existence . This it is frequently very difficult to recognise , but their relative position , though less important , may be oftener and more surely employed . In all vascular vegetables , which comprise all with whose symmetry we are acquainted , we remark that their organs are placed relatively to one another in a general order . In the flower , the pistil occupies the centre , and the stamens , petals and sepals , composed of a certain number of parts , are disposed around the pistil according to different symmetries . They may he placed directly before or alternate with one another ; they may correspond with the parts of the pericarp , or have no relation whatever with them . These different combinations possess considerable importance in classification , provided that we avoid the two sources of error already exposed , adhesion and abortion , which , by diminishing the number of the parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the symmetry of the Leguminosae to have the petals alternate with the sepals , but if the two inferior petals he united , or if one of the petals prove abortive , the number is reduced , and the symmetry is masked to the eyes of the superficial observer . The absolute or relative number of organs is a character , whose importance has been very differently estimated , but which , like many others , varies under different circumstances . The absolute number of organs is liable to be modified by a variety of causes , such as abortion , adhesion , &amp;c. , but where // all these sources of error are avoided , we can not deny that this character is one of considerable importance , though subject to certain conditions . We may say , first , that the absolute number of organs in every plant is generally more fixed , and conse ( Iuently so much the more important , the smaller that number is ; secondly , that unity never exists naturally in any of the reproductive organs , except the pistil ,  - -  whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or adhesion ,  --  and in the conservative organs , unity of the leaves exists only in the Monocotyledons ; thirdly , to ascertain the true absolute number of organs in a plant , it is necessary to go back , by means of the theory of abortion and adhesion , to the number that appears to be the primitive type of the class , or to one of its multiples . The numbers 4 , 5 , and their multiples seem to belong to the Dicotyledons , and 3 , with its multiples , to the Monocotyledons , while 2 and its multiples are very permanent among the Acotyledons . Characters drawn from the relative number of organs , that is , from a comparison of the proportional number of the parts of the different systems of a compound organ , may be relied on with considerable confidence . Thus , the absolute number of stamens in the Epilobium is 8 , the relative number twice that of the petals . Under this point of view , we are obliged to distinguish between multiple , determinate , and indeterminate relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epilobiurn , where the parts of the calyx are 4 , corolla 4 , stamens 8 , and pistil 4 ; of the second in the Violet , where th' parts of the flower are as 5 to 3 compared to those of the pistil ; of the last , in the Magnolias , where the number is not fixed in the petals , stamens , or pistils . If now abortion take place in all the four systems of a flower at once , their relative numbers may remain the same , while their absolute number will be changed ; but how are we to distinguish between these two kinds of numbers ? If we consider that when a single system is altered , the flower becomes necessarily irregular , and that in all cases , where every system is affected at the same time , it remains regular , we arrive at a simple and exact theorem : viz.-In all regular flowers , the relative number of the parts of each system should be the first object of our research ; in all irregular flowers , we begin by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduce their relative // numbers . When one or more parts of a system are so numerous as to present many ranks , the relations of number , though still existing , are difficult to be perceived , though by care and diligence we may sometimes find them . An oriental Poppy has been observed , which had 3 sepals , 6 petals , and 564 stamens , that is , 94 rauks of 6 . The next element of symmetry to be considered , is the absolute , relative and proportional size of the parts ; and here we may compare together , in regard to size , two systems , or their parts . The proportional dimensions of the parts of a system are frequently a matter of great interest , for the whole study of irregular plants , and consequently , the whole art of referring them to the regular symmetries of which they form a part , rests upon the examination of the inequality of the parts of a system . The fundamental principle of this examination appears to be , that among vascular , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are naturally of equal size , and become otherwise only in consequence of phenomena , more or less intimately connected with the general structure of the plant . The causes of these phenomena we are not always able to specify , but the position of the flower on the stem undoubtedly determines a great many inequalities . When solitary , erect , and terminal , it is equally nourished , and will of course be regular , insomuch that it may be considered as an unexceptionable general law , that flowers thus situated are regular , even when they belong to a family ordinarily irregular . If other flowers spring up arouud it , forming a head , their equilibrium is disturbed ; those in the middle , being equally pressed , will become abortive or change their form , though still continuing regular ; the lateral ones , being unequally pressed by their neighbors , will have a tendency to increase on their external side , where the pressure is least . All families with a peculiarly irregular flower , are never observed to have the flowers terminal , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluster . Sometimes , in the Labiat* , we find terminal flowers , but then they are always regular . An important result of these considerations is , that since the primitive symmetry of each system may be deranged by accidental causes , it becomes necessary , before we can establish a good classification , to trace hack all irregular plants to their primitive and regular types , though these types may be rarely encountered , aud sometimes // are even ideal . Thus the Personatae are found to be only alterations from the type of Solaneae . We have thus exposed very briefly the principles which determine the comparative importance of organs , and the method whereby we may graduate the degree of importance , presented by the different points of view , under which each organ may he studied . It is also requisite to show how these two modes of reasoning may he combined , or in other words , how we are o arrive at a proper appreciation of characters ; for a character , in fact , is one manner of considering organs generally , applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of characters is in a ratio composed of the importance of the organ , and of the point of view under which we may consider it ; so that characters , drawn from a particular organ , will have a value proportioned to that of the modification , and when drawn from the modification , it will he proportioned to the importance of the organs . Though the organs have different degrees of relative importance , yet the value of characters drawn from them will depend on the importance of the modification , for a very trivial one in a very important organ may furnish a character of less consequence , than a greater in a far less important organ . The results of the combination of these two elements will he equal or unequal . They will be equal , first , when the same modification is common to two organs of the same physiological rank ; secondly , when two modifications of the same rank exist in one or two organs of the same rank ; thirdly , when the importance of the organ is counterbalanced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensible qualities of the embryo , the highest of all the organs in the scale of importance , with the existence of the *n ectary ; or in other words , if we compare the least important modification of the most important organ with the most important point of view under which the least important organ can be considered , we shall have two analogous results , as theory and observation both testify . Here we must close our notice of the Tlm6orie El*mentaire . Though many points have been left untouched , and though we are sensible that general principles must lose much of their force and clearness when presented without the proper illustrations and discussions , yet we trust that a worthier idea of philosophical botany has been conveyed , than is generally obtained // from the common books on this science . The want of a work , in which the principles of the natural system should be made accessible to the English student , and which is capable of a practical application in the examination of plants , has long been painfully felt by those , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them aware of the deficiencies of the Linnaean school , but who have no means of becoming acquainted with more enlarged and philosophical views . All our Floras and similar works , to which the botanical student is referred for the description of plants , are arranged according to the sexual method , and not a word perhaps meets his eye concerning their natural relations . In our schools and academies , the science , we believe , is taught in a similar spirit . The organs of fructification are pointed out in such a manner that they may be recognised under the most ordinary conditions , while the structure of the seed , and its changes during growth and germination , and especially the laws of the variation of the organs , are about as little regarded as if they never existed . An attempt was made a few years since to supply the deficiency in question , by Sir James Edward Smith , in a work whose title we have quoted at the head of this article ; but which does not , in our opinion , merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From this , we turn with satisfaction to the Introduction ' of Professor Lindley , which , though it may not have accomplished quite all that we could have wished , will prove an invaluable work for the young student , for which he can never feel too thankful . A vast amount of information relative to the natural orders is here brought together from a multitude of sources , systematically arranged , and agreeably disposed . The plan adopted , ' to use the author 's own words , is this : To every collection of orders , whether called class , division , subdivision , tribe , section , or otherwise , such remarks upon the value of the characters assigned to it are prefixed , as the personal experience of the author , or that of others , shows them to deserve . To every order the Name is given which is most generally adopted , or which appears most unexceptionable , with its Synonymes , a citation of a few authorities connected with each , and their date : so that , from these quotations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first noticed , and also in what works he is to look // for further information upon it . To this succeeds the Diagnosis , which comprehends the distinctive characters of the order , reduced to their hriefest form , and its most remarkable features , without reference to exceptions . The latter are adverted to in what are called Anomalies . Then follow the Essential Characters ; a brief description of the order , in all its most important particulars . This is succeeded by a paragraph styled Affinities , in which are discussed the relations which the order bears to others , and the most remarkable circumstances connected with its structure , in case it exhibits any particular instance of anomalous organization . Geography points out the distribution of the genera and species over the surface of the globe : and the head Properties comprehends all that is certainly known of the use of the species in medicine , the arts , domestic or rural economy , &amp;c . A few genera are finally named , as Examples of each order . ' We have no fault whatever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , that the account of the Properties is disproportionately long ; especially in a work like this , to most of the readers of which it must necessarily prove the least interesting portion of the work . Medical Botany is too important a branch of knowledge , to be treated of at great length in a work which has a far different design in view . We could have wished , that much of the room occupied by this head had been given to that of Affinities ; for the valuable extracts from Decandolle , Brown , and some others , with which the latter is enriched , have made us regret that they were not even more numerous . The writings of botanists who have illustrated the affinities of plants are so scattered over periodical journals , transactions of societies , and other works , that they are almost inaccessible to the young student , particularly in this country , where these works are rarely seen . The introduction , besides some remarks on the comparative merits of the different systems of classification , contains a short exposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present day ; but as this is insufficient for the proper understanding of the work , the American editor has very judiciously prefixed an excellent treatise published by Professor Lindley not long since , entitled , An Outline of the First Principles of Botany . It may be considered an epitome of vegetable organography , divested of all theoretical considerations , // and expressing only such views as are well established by observation . In conclusion , we cordially thank Dr. Torrey for his agency in the re-publication of this work , for we trust it will give an impulse and direction to the study of botany which it has yet to receive on this side of the Atlantic.
