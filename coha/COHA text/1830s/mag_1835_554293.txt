txt THIs book is a curiosity ; an anomaly iii literature . It is the only autobiography of an Indian extant , for we do not consider Mr. Apes and a few other persons of unmixed Indian blood , who have written books , to be Indians . They were indeed born of aboriginal parents , but their tastes , feelings and train of ideas , were derived from the whites , and they were and are , in all essential particulars , civilized men . Human // nature is substantially thesame every where . Tk nd aneiaan child from his parents , in the hope of making him useful as a missionary or instructer , give him an insight into the truths of religion , and a competent knowledge of the benefits of art , science , and literature , and his expected usefulness is destroyed by the very means used to increase it . He returns to his connections in every respect but color a white man , and is to them what any other white man would be . If he writes , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an autobio0raphy of a wild , unadulterated savage , gall yet fermenting in his veins , his heart still burning with the sense of wrong , the words of wrath and scorn yet scarce cold upon his lips , ( If you xvish to fight us , come on , ' ) and his hands still reeking with recent slau* , hter . This book is also an anomaly in literature in another sense . It is almost the only one we have ever read , in which we feel perfect confidence , that the author sincerely believes that every thing he has set down is the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . That it is the bon&amp; Jide work of Black Hawk , we have the respectable testimony of Antoine Le Clair , the government interpreter for the Sacs and Foxes , and what ( as we have not the honor of being acquainted with that gentleman , ) we deem more conclusive , the intrinsic evidence of the work itself . We will venture to affirm , and ( having long dwelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , ) that no one but a Sac Indian could have written or dictated such a composition . No white man , however great his ability may be , could have executed a work so thoroughly and truly Indian . Many of the facts therein contained are , moreover , known to us to be true , and of many others we have the testimony of the oral tradition of the country . We think , therefore , we may say that the authenticity of the work is unquestionable . As for the truth of the facts related , who ever knew an Indian warrior to boast of feats he never achieved ? Indians will , indeed , lie , steal and cheat , but when put upon honor , as Black Haxvk is in the present case , their word is as good authority as the white man 's oath . The only drawback upon our credence is the intermixture of courtly phrases , and the figures of speech , which our novelists are so fond of putting into the mouths of Indians . These are , doubtless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's amanuensis. // No Indian , for example , would think of a formal dedication , yet we find the memoirs of Black Hawk inscribed to General Atkinson . rrlle term pale faces , often applied to the whites in this book , was , we think , never in the mouth of any American savage , excepting in the fanciful pages of Mr. Cooper . There are many more phrases and epithets of the like nature , and we only mention them , because we think it is time that authors should cease to make Indians talk sentiment . A synopsis of this singular work will not , perhaps , be unacceptable to our readers . It begins with an account of the traditions of the Sacs , for which , in their minute particulars , little credit is due . It appears , however , that the tribe were originally settled in the neighborhood of Montreal , and that they were driven back , step by step , to the western shores of Lake Michigan , and thence to the Mississippi . This statement is corroborated by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , at a place , thence called the Hillock of the Dead . ' In this battle , the French and their native allies nearly exterminated the Sacs , who , reduced to a few families , retreated to the Mississippi . Here they joined the Foxes , a kindred tribe , drove the Kas-kas-kias from the country , and founded several villages . Black hawk was born rather more than half a century ago , at the mouth of Rock River . We have seen Black Hawk in that country , and have always heard him mentioned as a dangerous and formidable warrior ; but we were not prepared for such a detail of exploits as he himself has given , nor should we believe it , had it come from any mouth but his own . At the age of fifteen , he wounded an enemy in battle ; soon after , he slew an Osage , in a manner which gives a vivid and true idea of the horrors of Indian warfare . Standing by my father 's side I saw him kill his antagonist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ambition , I rushed furiously upon another , smote him to the earth with my tomahawk , ran my lance through his body , took off his scalp , and returned in triumph to my father . He said nothing , but looked pleased . ' This may serve to show in what manner an Indian boy is educated , and the spirit by which he is animated . After a // few moons , ' Black Hawk , with seven folloxvers , attacked a hundred Osages , killed one and came off without losing a man . He next led a party of a hundred and egbty men against the same enemy . All his xvarriors but five deserted him , hut he persevered , thanking the Great Spirit that so many remained . ' His patience was rewarded with the slaughter of two persons , a man and a boy . The Osages retaliated , and in his nineteenth year , Black Hawk went against them with two hundred warriors . They met the enemy , and a desperate hattle ensued . Our hero killed five men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all . This account is subject to some deduction . General accounts of hattles are usually founded , ( especially among Indians ) upon conjecture and rumor , but what the old man says he did , may he received as certain . In a battle with the Cherokees , the father of Black Hawk was mortally wounded , hut had the pleasure of killing his adversary , and of seeing his son take his place as leader of the hand . The son slew three men in the conflict ; then returned sad and sorroxvful to his native village , went into mourning , ( which means , that he blackened his face with soot , suffered his hair to grow , fasted and prayed , ) and remained quiet five years . The details of this petty , dangerous warfare , are scarcely more important , inasmuch as they led to no important result , than the squahhles of wolves and foxes , hut they serve to convey some idea of Indian life . In the conflicts ahove-mentioned and in others , Black llau k states , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , women , and children , with his own hand . If it should he supposed that his personal prowess is thus intended to he made a matter of hoast , the reader would he egregiously deceived . Physical force , or even animal hravery , is not the quality most essential to renown in Indian wars . Prudence , cunning , and adroitness , are the preeminent characteristics of the indian warrior . To strike the enemy without risk to his own person , and to Injure him in every possible manner , is the main object . To destroy many of a hostile tribe is reckoned a glorious act in a war party , hut to do it without loss on their own side , is incomparahly more glorious . Thoogh hrave enough , and , indeed , too brave for the good of mankind and l1imself , the Indian warrior takes every imaginable care of his own person . To fight hand to hand , or expose himself to the shot of a foe , // would win him little praise , for admiration of his bravery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called his folly . Few , probably , of the victims of Black Hawk were slain in fair combat . We did not see , nor have we heard the particulars of any of the battles in which he acquired his distinction , but we think we can describe the way in which they were gained . The enemy were taken by surprise , and a few were slain before they were aware of an attack . While the battle lasted , there was little harm done . Each combatant availed himself of every bush , every tree , every cover that could protect his person . When the day was decided , the confusion and slaughter began , and the victims fell unresisting . In this view of the matter , the statement of Black Hawk , which might otherwise seem an empty boast , is easily credited . Nor is his moral character to he judged by the rules of Christianity , of which he knew nothing , or by the principles which govern the chivalry of civilized nations . Like other Indians , with whom revenge is virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indict , and stubborn to endure . He was told by his father , that to take two lives for one was a duty he owed to his tribe . All who spoke to him told him , that the destruction of all unfriendly to his country was the height of glory , and that to injure them in any way , was but a lawful spoiling of the Egyptians . If a man child fell into their hands they slew it , not because it was capable of doing them any harm , but because it might one day attain the strength and stature of a dangerous ene my.A woman was put to death , because she might become the mother of childven , who might destroy their own . The refinements of modern chivalry , the tenderness due to the weaker sex , are things of which Black Hawk never heard . Such principles are the natural consequence of the state of aboriginal society . Divided into small tribes , each of which is at enmity with its neighbors , the loss of a man is a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and justly thinks he has inflicted a severe blow on the enemy , when lie has destroyed one of their number , no matter how treacherously . But they are by no means deFicient in courage when circumstances demand its exercise , nor is there a people under the sun , who hold a coward in greater contempt . There was , probably , not one of the warriors who fought with and under Black Hawk , who , if brought to the stake , would not have died mocking his // tormentors , or who would have surrendered to any odds , under circumstances which would have degraded him in the estimation of his compeers . Yet it is pleasant and honorable to human nature , to see that these savage warriors are sometimes compassionate and magnanimous . Let a man declare himself ' worthy of pity , ' and he disarms their resentment at once . We have known several instances , where a defenceless individual has gone among them in search of a captive wife or daughter , and has not only been spared by them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been dismissed iii safety and honor , and loaded with presents . Every one , who has been practically acquainted with Indian society , will recollect cases of this kind . Black Hawk himself , ruthless as he has often been , is an exemplification of this rude feeling of chivalry . Having led a party against the Osages , and finding but six men , he thought it cowardly to kill them . ' He therefore made them prisoners and delivered them to the Spanish governor at St. Louis . At another time he made an inroad into the Cherokee country , and took five prisoners , four of whom , being males , he relcased . Great as was his hatred to this people ( who had slain his father ) , he could not kill so small a party . Once , having a very serious injury to avenge , and having already commenced hostilities * la mode des Sacs , he had an opportunity to destroy two little boys without danger to himself ; but he thought of his own children and passed on without noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , though Black Hawk was a thorough savage , he had yet a strong sense of honor , personal dignity , and generosity . On many occasions he was an advocate for mercy . When Black Hawk heard that the Spanish settlers of Missouri were to be superseded by Americans , it made him sad , because he had always heard bad accounts of the Americans from the indians who had lived near them . ' Let us observe that this feeling of dislike to our countrymen is by no means confined to the Sacs and Foxes , and that it is not altogether without reason . The cause is plain . Our settlers , always advancing into the forest , encroach upon the Indians , and establish themselves too near them . The good qualities of the savages are only apparent in their intercourse with each other ; all their bad ones operate upon the stranger , who is not // usually slow to annoy as he is annoyed . Petty disputes arise , ill blood is engendered , mutual wrong is done , and as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Indians are driven from the laud of their fathers . They have no historians to record their grievances , and we believe the case before us is the only one , where the vanquished lion ha found a voice to tell what wrong aroused his angry might , or by xvhat means he was taken in the toils . What follows will be a sufficient corroboration of the remarks . It was not so when the officers of Spain , France , and Britain had some degree of power in the Indian countries , and it will be found that the name of Frenchman , or Englishman , is a passport to the good will of the natives , while that of American is the direct contrary . When General Pike ( then a captain ) ascended the Mississippi , in 1801 , he desired Black Hawk 's people to give up their British flags and medals and receive others in exchange ; they declined , because they wished to have two fathers . ' Soon after an affair took place , which was the original cause of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Foxes , and the United States . We shall endeavor to make it as clear as possible . An American borderer was killed by a Sac , who was taken to St. Louis for trial . The chiefs sent a deputation of four persons to St. Louis to release the murderer , by paying the price of blood , which is a practice among themselves , and which they fondly thought was also the law of the whites . They explained their business to the governor , who immediately availed himself of the circumstance to accomplish the desire of the government . He pressed them to cede a large tract of land , and they complied , expecting that their friend would be released in order to his return home with them . The promise was kept to the ear and broken to the sense . The Indian was indeed released from prison , hut had not gone many yards from it , when he was shot dead by one of the friends of the man he had slain . This was the true commencement of hostilities with the Sacs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but the circumstances , which are very minutely related , correspond strictly with In4ian manners and habits of thinking . We know that compensation for murder or vicarious punishment has been often proffered by them to the whites in perfect good faith and sincerity . We // know that the white man was murdered , that the treaty was made , and that the offending Sac was murdered in his turn . The government , we know , is not responsible for the lawless acts of individuals , unless it neglect to employ the means , fairly within its control , to restrain and punish them . Neither is there any thing inconsistent with justice or morality , in holdin , out the pardon of an Indian , who has forfeited his life to our laws , as an inducement , among other considerations , of a cession of land ; hut a cession thus obtained probably leaves behind it a root of hitteruess , in the Indian mind . But this is not the most objectionable mode , in which their lands have been acquired . What our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we state the folloxving as the means by which cessions of land are usually obtained of the Indians . The xvhites encroach and settle upon their territory . They increase greatly in number in a short time , and representations are soon made to the government , concerning the value of the land and the necessity of buying it . Commissioners are sent , large presents are made to the chiefs , ( formerly whisky was copiously distrihuted , ) and their ears are filled with the glory and power of the whites . Such representations are not , however , needed to convince them either of the ability or the will of the United States to oppress them , and they usually sell , what they think would otherwise be taken by force . Should they prove refractory , however , a staff is quickly found to beat a dog . ' Indians are disagreeable neighbors ; when they are hungry , they do not think it sin to steal a barn-door fowl , a basket of corn , nor even a swine from the enemy . Both parties hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider us tyrants and robbers ; we hate them as troublesome , and sometimes drunken rogues , who stand in the way of our interest , and whose enmity we have good reason to fear . Petty aggression and retaliation become the order of the day . Neither party has any , court to appeal to , and the Indians would not , probably , appeal to ours if they could . Blood is finally shed , and the newspapers are speedily filled with tales of savage barbarity . The arm of government is called to the aid of the whites . The Indians have no advocates , know not how to plead their own cause , and would not be regarded if they did . They resist , are beaten , ( well if they are not exterminated ) , they sue for peace , their lands pay the expenses of the war , and thus the object of the settlers is gained . We do not believe // that we have given this picture a shadoxv of color too strong . If any one thinks that we have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , and he will find that both parties concerned hold each other in the most deadly hatred and if he want facts , let him apply to some one acquainted with the history of the Winnebago war ; let him read the biography of Black Hawk ,  --  let him study the printed volume of Indian treatics . In the treaty entered into by Black Hawk 's deputation , to which we have already alluded , the Sacs and Foxes got , besides the pardon of their countrymen ( which was nullified as soon as granted , ) a thousand dollars a year , for a tract of country greater in extent than very many of the States in the Union , and as fertile and rich in natural resources as almost any of them . It was made and signed by four persons only , and those not authorized by the nation . this was in eighteen hundred and four , at which time the most remote American settlements were but a few miles above St. Louis . They now extend to Prairie du Chien , a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , the band of Black Hawk formed the only interruption to their continuity , and the opinion was then publicly expressed by the writer of this article , that within five years , some pretext would be found to dispossess the Sacs and Foxes of their lead mines . Three had not elapsed when the prophecy had been accomplished . Soon after the negotiation of the treaty , Fort Madison was built below the Des Moine rapids , much to the dissatisfaction of Black Hawk and his people . Each party seems to have been afraid of the other , and though there was some show of hostilities , none actually took place . It was not till he had been wrought upon by the celebrated prophet , brother of Tecumseh , and till the Winneba oes had made several successful butchering excursions , that Black Hawk joined the latter . They laid siege to Fort Madison , which was gallantly defended by Lieutenant Hamilton , for several days , against a great disparity of force . Black Hawk 's account of this transaction does not strictly agree with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , and he says nothing of the measures taken by the American authorities to compel the Indians to remain at peace , hut of which the effect was to drive them to war . Indeed , the old man seems to have thought every thing , not directly relative to himself , out of his province // as a biographer . He admits , also , that his memory has not been very good , since his late visit to the East , and truly his misfortunes might well have injured the faculties of a younger man . About this time an occurrence happened , that laid the whole Sac nation under the absolute necessity of making war on the United States , which only a small part of them were seriously resolved to do before . This matter would be wholly incomprehensible to most readers with only the words of Black Hawk for their guidance , and we shall therefore endeavor to explain them . The system of Indian trade , which had long obtained in the country , had been established by the British traders , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wants of the savages . *fl custom was to supply each hunter , at the commencement of the hunting season , with such goods , arms , and ammunition , as would enable him to support his family during the winter , and payment was rendered in the spring . But , as the life of the hunter is precarious , some were disqualified from hunting by sickness , the annoyance of Indian enemies , and various causes , and as many proved lazy and dishonest , the trader could not reasonably calculate on receiving more than about two-thirds of his due . To prevent certain loss , therefore , he charged his Indian debtor fifty per cent . advance on cost , charges and profit , by which means the honest paid for the dishonest , the industrious for the idle , and the well for the sick , and the trader got his due . This system of trade was radically bad ; - it became known to those who had the management of Indian affairs , and their benevolence suggested a remedy which was certainly well meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease . It was certain , however , that every Indian hunter paid for every gull , axe , or other article he bought , just twice as much as it was worth . It was therefore determined to establish certain trading houses in the country , to be called Factories , at which the savages were to be supplied at cost and charges , and no more . For several reasons , this apparently excellent scheme was productive of evil . The persons employed to procure goods for the Factories were wholly ignorant of the wants of the Indians . The guns , blankets , and many other articles furnished , were of very inferior quality to those sold by the British traders . Loads of goods were sent , for which the Indians had no use . We have seen , on the shelves of a Factory // store , cow-bells , pen-knives , infant 's laced caps , and snuffboxes , intended for the use of people to whom a cow was a curiosity , who knew not what a pen was , whose infants went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinch of snuff on any account . Add to this that an Indian seldom or never has the means of paying for an article on the spot , and that the factors might charge xvhat advance they pleased on their goods without the possibility of detection , a facility , of which it is shrewdly suspected that some of them largely availed themselves , and it will not appear strange that the Sacs found the Factories but a poor substitute for the stores of their old traders , who knew their wants , tastes , and capabilities to pay , as well as the best manner of conciliating their good will , a matter in which American traders are marvellously deficient even to this day . The British traders had left the lower Mississippi . A delegation of the Sacs and Foxes went to Washington to see their Great Father , ' the President , at the request of the authorities . He informed them that the British traders would no more be permitted to come among them , but that they should be well supplied by an American , meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were answered , according to Black Haxvk , that they should be so supplied . It is probable that the President was wholly ignorant of the manner in which the Indian trade was conducted , or that the conference was very loosely interpreted . The neglect to fulfil this promise , real or supposed , cost the lives of hundreds of brave men , whites and Indians . The Sacs and Foxes were well pleased with the words of their Great Father , as they received them , and resolved to refrain from war . When , in the autumn , they repaired to the Factor , and asked for supplies , he denied them ; he had received no orders , he had heard nothing of their Great Father 's promise . With the prospect of absolute starvation before them , all was gloom and discontent . Their intercourse with the British had been cut off they could get no hope of relief from the Americans . It was , in fact , declarinrr war upon them to deprive them of the means by which they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In their state of discontent and resentment , believing , not without cause , that the Americans were determined to starve them , and that their Great Father had told them a wilful falsehood , they were found // by the emissaries of the British government , the principal of whom was the celebrated Colonel Robert Dixon , a man of education , the most polished manners , of good fain y , of undaunted courage , of nohie and generous feelings , and who had proved himself their sinbere friend through a long course of years . Such as we descrihe him , and as we knew him , this gentleman had thrown off the manners of civilized life , which he never resumed , excepting when in company with whites , had married a squaw , hy whom he had a large family , and was almost idolized hy several tribes , to whom he taught the first lesson of humanity in war . By his own personal influence , the weight of his British commission , and the large presents he made them , Colonel Dixon found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join the British standard . Our hero immediately collected two hundred of his warriors for that purpose . Before the disastrous mismanagement which thus drove this gallant tribe into belligerent alliance with England , they had been , for Indians , very peaceahly disposed . it would appear that the fatal hattie of the Butte des Morts had broken their spirit as well as their strength , for it was the habit of the neighhoring trihes to call them women . Now they proved themselves men , - they fought in every hattie . They were at Sandusky , where Black Hawk found occasion to disapprove of the foolish mode of fighting of the British and Americans . He was disgusted with the had success of the campaign , and the lack of plunder , and returned to his own country . Here he found an old and dear friend , who had preserved his neutrality and had given no offence to the Americans . But white savages are to he found on the frontier , as well as red , and some of these had butchered this old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , in a manner at which Black Hawk would have shuddered . The old savage had scarcely finished his tale when he expired of grief , hardship and hunger . Black Hawk took his hand and pledged himself to avenge the death of his son , his own adopted . He did revenge tt ; - . the battle of the Sink Holes will long be remembered for the desperate bravery with which the Indians defended themselves , though there was not much loss on either side . After several adventures Black Haxvk and his people remained tolerahly quiet , till five gun-boats came up the Mississippi from St. Louis . They were full of soldiers who were // intended to reinforce the garrison at Prairie du Chien . They were too late , however . The British forces had already taken possession of that post . Black Hawk was apprised of this fact by messengers , who solicited him and his warriors to aid the arms of their old allies . They consented and pursued the boats by land . He overtook them in the Rock River Rapids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Great Spirit gave this boat to Black Hawk . ' He attacked her , set her on fire , and slew more than half the crew . The Indians put out the fire and took possession of the boat and cargo . It consisted of whisky , which our hero caused to he spilled , and a hox of such bad medicine as the medicine men kill the white people with when they get sick . ' There was also a considerable quantity of other plunder . This exploit was achieved with the loss of only two Sacs . The day after , other gun-boats appeared , bringing the American garrison down the river , and Black Hawk , having been supplied with a big gun ' by his allies , cannonaded her with some success . At the conclusion of the war Black Hawk , like other Indians who had done us a great deal of mischief , made his peace with the United States , and signed the treaty without knowing what he did . What do we know of the laws and customs of the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies for dissection , and we would touch the goose-quill to confirm it , without knowing what we are doing . ' Here follows such a description of the manners of his tribe , as an Indian only could give . Harder times approached . The vicinity of the whites had , as usual , a bad effect on the morals and happiness of his band . They drank more whisky than formerly , and became dishonest . Two of our hero 's children died , and he mourned for them for two years , that is , he painted his face black , gave away all his property , and fasted rigidly for that time . After this he renewed his acquaintance with 1 ) i5 former allies by going to IVialden in Canada , where he received some gifts , and was promised more . The whites were fast settling his country , and abused him and his people . On one occasion , he was seized by three of them and severely beaten with sticks . How , ' says he , could we like people who treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to him , and he was told for the first time , that he must leave his village and lands . // Keokuck , a prudent and crafty chief , who acted more for the advantage of his tribe than Black Hawk , by keeping well with the whites , and increasing his influence by their countenance , consented to go , but the sjzArit of the old warrior revolted at the idea . Being assured by one of the deputation formerly mentioned , that when he signed the treaty , it was not explained to him as it was now interpreted , he raised the standard of opposition to Keokuck . While the tribe was thus divided , white people arrived among them , settled in their very villages , and quarrelled among themselves respecting the boundary lines of lands to which , whatever might be the case with the United States , they had not the shadow of a moral or legal right . Black Hawk ordered them off , and complained to the Indian agents , but in vain . Other intruders appeared and settled . Keokuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirous of supplanting Black Hawk in the estimation of the tribe , temporised ; whereat the aged hero was exceedingly indignant . He considered him a coward and no brave man , thus to abandon his native village to strangers , and there was no more friendship between them . ' There is a good deal of homely pathos in the pages in which he broods over his wrongs . What right , ' says he , had these people to our village and our fields , which the Great Spirit had given us to live upon ? ' Whoever wishes to see an exemplification of the system of petty grievances , by which Indians are driven to despair , by their white neighbors , will do well to read this part of the volume attentively . It will show him the truth of the remarks we have made on the subject in another page . Beaten , plundered and abused by their neighbors , Black Hawk and his party complained to the authorities again and again without success . At the same time the whites complained of them , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruders , and called on the government to protect their property . Let the result show and the reader judge , which was the right side . There was undoubtedly a great deal of mutual wrong , but the whites only were believed , and their complaints alone regarded . Black Hawk 's village and grounds were sold to individuals , and his people were told that if they did not remove peaceably they should be compelled . The chief stated his case to several agents and governors , British and American , saying that he had never sold his lands . They all told him that his Great Father would do him justice , // and that if he had not alienated his property , it would not be taken from him . They spoke , probably , on a*proper sense of the broad principles of justice which regulated the dealings of civilized people among themselves , forgetting that the Indians had neither the knowledge nor the means to state and urge their claims , and that they had no advocate . Their opinions , bowever , determined Black Hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place , . which sadly puzzAed Black Hawk . A small fraction of the territory ceded by the treaty so often mentioned , to the United States , for a thousand dollars per annum , had been given to the Pottawattamies . The United States now bought this fraction back again for sixteen thousand dollars a year . Black Hawk was wholly unable to comprehend that a small part could be worth more than the whole , for it never entered into his mind that the settlement of a territory could increase its value a hundred fold . He began to doubt whether the Americans had any standard of right and wrong . ' Even now the Hawk was willing to give up the ground he had taken , if he could have done it honorably , for the sake of the women and children . ' He made some overtures to the officers of government , which were rejected , whereupon he resolved to remain in his village , and if the military should come , to submit to his fate without resistance . Some new aggressIons made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ploughing up his corn-fields , to remove by violent threats . General Gaines came up the Mississippi with troops , and a council was held . The Indians were told that if they did not cross the river within two days , they should be compelled . They did cross it , and Black Hawk again touched the goose quill , ' and determined to remain at peace . Corn was given them in lieu of that which they had left growing , but it proved inadequate to their wants . The women and children clamored for their roasting ears , beans and squashes . ' A party went back to get these desiderata , but were fired on for attempting to steal from the very fields they had planted . In all these transactions , there was undoubtedly much misapprehension on both sides . The whites could not see why compliance with what was considered a fair treaty was refused . The Indians could not believe that such a treaty had ever been made , or , if it had been made , that it could possibly be just and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // that neither party could understand the other . We are persuaded that , could Black Hawk and his counsellors have been permitted to plead their own cause on the floor of Congress , attended with a competent interpreter , all the misery , expense , and bloodshed which ensued , might have been prevented . Neapope , one of Black Hawk 's band , who bad been sent to Malden on a mission to the British agent , now returned . The answer he brought from that functionary must either have been dictated by the spirit of falsehood , ( which is not likely , as the Indian had no motive to deceive ) or the conference must have been misinterpreted or misunderstood . He brought word , that if the Americans should make war on the Sacs , the latter should be assisted . This answer never could have been given by the English officer . The British government bad no interest whatever in stirring up a petty war , far within our borders , and the agent could have had neither authority to make such a promise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have been a lying knave , as most Indian prophets are , gave further assurances of aid from the British , and from four of the neighboring tribes . Keok*ick told the old chief that he had been imposed upon by liars , and had better remain quiet , and so it proved . Black Hawk mustered all his forces and ascended the Mississippi , and demonstrations of approaching war were made on both sides . The chief bade General Atkinson defiance , and moved up Rock river to join the prophet . He soon learned , that the promises of foreign aid which he had received were delusive . The Pottawattai*nies and Winnebagoes were not disposed to render him any assistance . They even refused him provisions for his followers . The first blood appears to have been shed by the wbites . Seeing a party of mounted militia approaching him , Black Hawk sent three messengers to desire a conference . They were taken prisoners , and , if the Indian account is to be believed , one of them was treacherously murdered . The Sacs immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some loss on their own part . This statement differs essentially from that in the newspapers only in one particular . It was said that the Sacs were the first to begin the fight . Black Hawk does not pretend to speak from his own knowledge , and we have no means of coming at the exact truth . // War was thus commenced . Several skirmishes took place , and many persons were killed , because , having neither resources nor strength , the Hawk n*s unwilling to adopt any decisive measures . It is a sufficient testimonial of his courage and military talent to say , that with a half-starved band of about five hundred men , encumbered with women and children , he eluded a much larger force , supplied with food , cavalry and all the munitions of war , and never came in contact with the whites , x ithout giving them some cause to regret the meeting . His skill and bravery , however , availed him nothing ,  --  he was hemmed in on all sides , and hunger made fearful deductions from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually perished of starvation . The scene of this campaign , which proved so terrible to the Sacs , was the country between the Rock and Wisconsin rivers , *n the cast side of the Mississippi . Inland , the country about the Four Lakes is swampy , and full of ponds and thickets. rro this position Black Hawk at first retreated , rightly judging that it would cost the pursuing enemy much trouble to get at him . Here he remained till hunger drove him out , when he moved upon the Wisconsin , intending to recross the Mississippi , which done , he would have been in comparative safety . The white army pursued , and overtook him at the Wisconsin , but he covered the retreat of his party with a band of fifty of his most determined warriors , and effected his passage with little loss . His forces now began to break up . He himself gained the Mississippi , with many followers . Seeing the steamboat Warrior approaching , he hoisted a white flag and would have surrendered , but those on board , mistaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only chance that now remained for his party was to cross the great river . While they were making rafts for this purpose , the pursuing army came upon them , and , accordin* to Black Hawk , refused them quarter . Many were slain , and many perished in the attempt to swim across . Of those who did cross , many were starving women and children , and their ancient enemies , the Dahcotahs , took advantage of their distress to slaughter a great number of them . This final battle was fought at the mouth of the River Bad Axe . This was probably , the most disastrous indian campaign of modern times . It was begun in delusion and continued without hope . It ended in misery and horror inexpressible ; half // the Sac tribe are supposed to have perished , but not in vain . It has taught the tribes of the north-west a lesson which they never can forget . It was a bloody one , but , like the invention of fire-arms , it will ultimately save much blood . The Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not but see , that resistance against any claim of the United States , just or unjust , is the very worst policy they can pursue . Hereafter , it is probable , that whenever a wish is expressed to remove them from their lands , they will readily comply on the best terms they can make , since any resistance they can offer will but protract the catastrophe and render it more appalling . They have long known that they are no match for us in negotiation ; they are now convinced that they are no match for us in arms . The barbarous chivalry of the race will decay ; for they can not but see that it leads to certain ruin , and few men , however brave or obstinate , will rush to inevitable destruction . Such men as Black Haxvk will no longer be their objects of emulation . They will rather place their trust in the pacific wisdom of such as Keokuck , because they see that it is their present , if not their ultimate safety . We think , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilization of the remnant of his people . They have had enough of glory , their spirit is broken . They were ever more settled in their habits than their neighbors , and have had , ever since we knew them , a better sense of a distinction of property , which we take to be the corner-stone of the system of social improvement . Certainly no Indian tribe has for many years offered so fair a field to the missionary , as the Sacs and Foxes do now . It is a little singular that in almost every tribe who have had dealings with us , there should be men of characters similar to those of Keokuck and Black Hawk ; but the matter may be easily explained . Before they have the misfortune to become intimately acquainted with us , military abilities are most useful , and are consequently held most honorable in the tribe . When they come in contact with the whites , seine individual , more crafty and less energetic than the war chief , finds another read to influence and distinction . He finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ncigbbers , he obtains more means of increasing the number of his partisans . The war chief has the sympathies of the people on his side , the peace chief has their judgment . Many instances might be // given . Sassacus , the war chief of the Pequods , resisted , and his tribe perished . Uncas , chief of a branch of the same tribe , truckled to the whites , and saved himself and his followers for a while . MacIntosh was the Keokuck of the Creeks . There are many peace chiefs among the Dahcotahs , but they have a war chief named Wapahshah , who is body and soul an Indian , and cares not a straw for all the whites on earth . To return to the narrative style : Black Hawk escaped from the battle of the Bad Axe , and took refuge among the Winnebagoes . He there expressed his intention to surrender to the whites , and his hosts made a merit of delivering him up . He was taken down the Mississippi and confined for a while in Jefferson barracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the badge of a military felon . Some of our readers may not know what this equipment is ; it is easily explained . A twelve inch shell is attached to the ankle of the convict , by a chain some six feet long . We perfectly agree with what Black Hawk says of this dishonorable treatment of a vanquished foe , and we know enough of Indian character to be sure that his words are strict truth , so far as they express his feelings and opinions . We would have been answerable for him , body for body , when once he had given his word not to escape . We were now confined to the barracks , ' says he , and forced to wear the ball and chain . This was extremely ruortifying and altogether useless . Was the White Beaver ( General Atkinson ) afraid that I would break out of his barracks and run away ? Or was he ordered to inflict this punishment upon me ? If I had taken him prisoner on the field of battle , I would not have wounded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a brave war chief would prefer death to dishonor . But I do not blame the White Beaver for the course he pursued ; - it is the custom among white soldiers , and , I suppose , was a part of his duty . ' The Hawk is mistaken ; - it was no part of his duty , nor is it the custom of white soldiers . The ball and chain are attached to convicts and never to prisoners of war . We may say here , that no knight who ever wore spurs could have felt anything approaching an indignity more keenly than an Indian chief does . We dare aver that the Hawk would rather have died , than have suffered the disgraceful iron to touch him . The rest of the story of Black Hawk is generally known . He has returned to his people degraded , as far as it is in the // power of the whites to degrade him . But no authority can hinder his tribe from regarding their last champion with respect and admiration , or diminish the influence which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from his rank was but a vain form . In the esteem of the Sacs he is still every inch a king . ' We think we may affirm that his death would occasion a much more lively and enduring sorrow , than that of the wiser Keokuck.
