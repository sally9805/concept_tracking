txt THE Whig Opposition of our day may be compared to that wonderful magician of the fiddle-stick , Paganini , with his single string . They have one perpetual note , on which , with every imaginable variety of voice and intonation , they are forever discoursing most eloquent music . Executive Usurpation is the incessant cry , in season and out of season , with which they pierce the vault profound ,  - -  in the hope , apparently , that clamorous perseverance may perchance accomplish what every other means have so long failed to effect , to destroy that foundation of popular confidence and affection upon which the present democratic Administration and its truly democratic policy are based . It seems that this is still to be the key-note of Opposition , though a new variation is to be played upon it , with all the brilliant fanta* sias and capriccios so readily at the command of the fertile imaginations of Congressional choristers . Heretofore , the particular subject of denunciation has been the direct usurpation of legislative powers in the exercise of the executive functions , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deposits , and the free use of the veto power-diversified with interludes of alarming committees of investigation into the corrupt mysteries supposed to exist in the secret recesses of all the Executive departments . Now , the same general idea is to be brought forward , and kept before the public eye in another point of view , namely , the corrupt influence exercised upon Congress itself by the wiles and power , half seduction and half force ' , of this same Executive monster . These efforts may very safely be left to share the same fate already so often and so emphatically adjudged , by the sagacity of public opinion , to those of a similar character , which have exhausted * SPEECH of Mr. Cushing , of Massachusetts , on the Executive Powers , delivered in the House of Representatives , December 19th , 1837. - Washington .

We have no fears they can ever prevail to shake the ascendericy of the Democratic infiuence* We feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , resting on the intelligence and integrity of the broad mass of the American peo* ple , far above the reach of the frothy waves of declamation which may toss and roar about its base . If the first premise of our political creed , confidence in the people , is not utterly falsv and void , we can have no apprehension as to the issue . The Whigs may make a very good Opposition ,  --  in which relation the diversity of elements of which they are composed has , perhaps , a beneficial effect in keeping the party in power in check on so many different points ,  --  but they can never succeed in a general contest for the possession of the administration of the Government . No party composed of such heterogeneous materials , and destitute of any other broad common principles , than the single bond of cobesion afforded by the com* mon interest of Opposition , can ever expect to accomplish the overthrow of the great Democratic Party . The only means promising a hope of compassing that object -- namely , a recourse to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle into the House of Representatives , where intrigue might afford a chance denied by the fair action of the popular xvillZ**is never , we trust , destined to be a0ain successful in this country . It is not , then , from alarm at any possible danger to be apprehended from this quarter of attack , that we make the little libellus , whose title is prefixed to this article , the occasion of a review . But rather because the subject is not only in itself one of deep interest to the student of the philosophy of our system of government , but at the present period  --  the commencement of posterity with respect to the administration of the extraordinary man who lately filled the Executive office -- it presents itself in a point of view of peculiar interest ; and the glorious though stormy history of that administration exhibits certain remarkable features to some of which we wish to direct attention . We concede the broad fact , that during the late administration the influence of the Executive branch of our complex system was developed to a degree of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep-seated distrust and dislike of excessive Executive influence-yet do we see nothing in this concession to sully one leaf of the crown of civic glory which that ' noble old chief has added to his well earned military laurels , nor to weaken the reverential gratitude due to his honored memory . This concession is not commonly made , from the habit into which our political controversies have run , of indiscriminate attack and denial ; each side placing itself sometimes in the wrong from the sole cause of its unwillingness to concede any portion of the right to its antagonist . There is no reason , however , to shrink from a frank avowal // of it ,  --  a sound and just cause has nothing to lose , but every thing to gain , in truth and candor . It may generally be taken for granted that in political parties , as in religious sects , there is some portion of truth , however overladen with error , in all ,  --   - -  - xvhich in fact constitutes the sole element of vitality that preserves the whole mass from immediate dissolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pluck from it that support of partial truth , to w ich it al - ays instinctively seeks to attach itself . There has , then , been some portion of truth-grossly , indeed , perverted and abused-in the charge of the extension of Executive power , which has of late years constituted the principal rallying cry of the Opposition . In this has consisted its strength and life ,  --  far more effective than even the potent moneyed interests which have been involved in it This has constituted its sole title to the venerable and no le old party name which it has so fraudulently usurped ; and it has been only by the use of an eloquent ophistry and dazzling declamation on this theme , appealing to our natural distrust of monarchical powers , that it has been able to delude so large a portion of the public mind in some sections of the country , into an unnatural hostility to an administration , than which our country has not seen a more honest , sound and purely democratic . The only way of effectually disarming the Opposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it openly and frankly . The truth is , that the Executive branch of our system was intended by itsauthors to possess a high degree of powerful , substantive , and original energy , as one of the three co-ordinate departments into which the system was divided . All familiar with the ideas and views which were compromised in the formation of the Constitution , know , that a large proportion of the most influential members of the Convention were in favor of even a far more powerful Executive , than was the result of the profound deliberations of that wonderful body of men . And such as it was , it is well known to all , that the preponderant monarchical character of the Executive , as created and endowed with power by that instrument , was perhaps the objection the most strenuously urged against it by the party which opposed its adoption . It was opposed by a large portion of the Democratic party of that day , with whom popular liberty was the cardinal idea ,  - -  from their distrust of the vast powers with which it armed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption was considered a triumph of the party which favored rather the strength and majesty of energetic , controlling , governmental power . This remark is true only in a broad sense , for-from its very character as a great compromise-it united in its behalf such a proportion of all parties and all views as to compose a large majority of the whole people ; and many eminent democrats were most earnest in their exertions for its adoption . rfhey knew the native might of the democratic element in every mixed system , however hampered with forrn5 // and controlling checks . They knew that , with all the aristocratic and monarchical features which x *ere conceded to satisfy the views of the different parties represented in the Convention , there was left a sufficient infusion of democracy to acquire , in the course of time , the ascendency and control over the who1e ; they knew that that would and must become the animating spirit of all its forms and checks , which it would conquer , in succession , to itself ; and that thus all would contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this reason it was that they did not fear to entrust large and a tive powers to the Executive ,  --  because they knew that those powers never could be abused to any very formidable extent , as they never could be efficient for any purpose , without the support of reason , wisdom , patriotism , and the approval of public opinion . They made the Exe*utive powerful for good , and impotent for e il . R sponsibility to public opinion was the all-sufficient check ( independently of the co-ordinate departments of the Government ) with which they paralysed its powers , whenever they should tend to a direction hostile to the democratic principles which must ever animate the mass of the people . And never , indeed , has a political system been contrived , in which , while an ample independent energy is infused into the executive arm , it has been so admirably regulated by all the most effectual restraints upon the possible abuse of its powers . Those powers are certainly vast . In some respects , we confess* the remark is not destitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they are renter than those possessed by the Executive in the constitutional monarchy of England ,  --  though on the whole , that assertion is imme*surably wide of the fact . The correct version of it is , that in all subjects of personal power , influence and splendorall that can tempt or gratify a corrupt ambition-our Executive is comparatively nothing ; while , in his proper sphere of public duty , as the representative and agent of the People , to carry fully and energetically into effect their will , the Law , his executive power not inferior , either in the the theory or the practical operation , to that of the constitutional monarch of Europe ,  --  and this is the highest eulobium that can he pronounced upon the admirable wisdom that orbanized the system . There can be no doubt that it was a primary idea with the framers of the Con stitution , to preserve widely and inviolably distinct the three departments of the Government , the Legislative , the Executive , and the Judicial ,  --  excepting only the points of mutual contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general rule , the strictest construction is to be applied . Without examining here the relations between the Executive and the Judiciary , we have now in view chiefly those subsisting between the former and the Legislature . The distiibution of power is unquestionably one of the essential principles on which , in connection with the kindred one of // frequent responsibility to the sovereign source of all , the healthy action of free institutions depends . The evil consequences of Lebislative encroachment on the Executive duties and rights , are certainly not less to be deprecated than those of Ex cutive influence over the independence of the Legislature . In point of weight , dignity , and independent responsibility , the respective departments , in their distinct constitutional spheres , stand on a footing of perfect equality and equilibrium . Both are equally agents and servants of the People , each independent of the other , and each responsible to the common origin of power alone . Each maintains the representative relation towards the People , determined by election , in different modes and with di erent respective terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they unite in concurrent action , both stand on distinct grounds of independent equality ,  --  each bound to obey the dictates of its own judgment and its own conscience , on its separate responsibility , to the People from the obligation of its representative character , and to God from the obligation of the constitutional oath ,  --  without any deference to the authority or influence of the other . The Constitution assigns to the President a participation in the legislative action of the Government , both in the right of recommendation and that of the veto ; nor can there be any question that uch a constitutional right is equally a duty . In exercise of that right , which is the performance of that duty ,  --  a duty not to be neglected without a clear faithlessness to his trust and his oath , the Executive is entitled and bound to judge for itself , from its own best wisdom and purest motive , of its course on each particular occasion . The veto power is no idle form . It is a substantive reality , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution bad a wholesome distrust of the infallibility of majorities in Congress , which are often not only in error , but far from being a correct representation of the existing state of the public opinion ; and they were wise in superadding a third revision of their legislation , in addition to the mutual check exercised by the two Houses upon each other . Conferring power , they intended it unquestionably to be used . It is , at the utmost , but a limited power . It is absolute only when it is supported by a large proportion of the legislative department itself , and even then its effect is merely suspensive , to refer the subject in ques ion back to the people  --  to whose hands none certainly ought to object to entrust any and every subjeeL If they do not approve of the grounds on which the Executive has ventured upon that responsibility , their breath can , after a delay that is entirely insignificant in legislation upon important public interests , control his opposition , by the constitutional means of a two-thirds vote , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his veto after a second decided expression of the will of the majority through the two Houses of Congress . The prejudice which has been raised in the minds of // many against the Executive veto is certainly a false idea . The attempt which has been so strenuously urged by the Opposition ( on the cue taken from the speeches of a very eminent Senator ) to cast odium upon it as a meaus of attack upon the late administration-on the ground of its being a monarchical feature borrowed from the English model-exhibits an equal ignorance of the true character of the British constitution , . and contempt for the intelligence of the American people . It is true that the King of England possesses the absolute veto power , intended as a last retreat for the defence of prerogative . It is also true that it is a power never used ,  --  and probable that , in such circumstances as should reduce the crown to that extremity* if attempted against the absolute omnipotence of the great aristocracy and the commonalty united , as embodied in the two houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown and his head . But the inference is utterly falla&amp;ous , that an odium of a nature at all similar ought jnstly to attach to its exercise in our system of government . The English Crown is never driven to that resort , by reason of the other ample powers with which it is clothe4 to control the action of Parliament ,  --  which are , the ability at any time to create a majority in the House-of Lords ( as was done by Queen Anne ) - thc immense powers of corruption at its disposal , made always effectual by the perpetual tenure of the upper , and the s*ptenn'ial tenure of the lower , House of Parliament ,  --  powers which have notoriously ( till within late years ) held the House of Commons in constant subserviency to the crown  --  and finally the powers of proro*ation and dissolution . But the Presidential veto of our system is of an entirely different nature . It is a democratic , and not a monarchical , power . It is the only means by which , on unexpected occasions which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the democratic influence of the Executive , upon improper legislation ; and if , in its adoption , a portion of the framers of the Constit'iition may have had an eye to their favorite English precedent , there can be no doubt that another portion looked farther back into history for a prototype , and found it in the veto power of the tribunes of ancient Rome ,  --  the especial representatives and guardians of the democracy of the state . We regard it as an invaluable feature of our system ,  --  without it where would the country now have been ? The tendency of unrestrained legislation to overaction is rapid enough , and is , we consider , one of the worst evils with which society is afflicted ; and we ought rather to desire to multiply suspensive restraints upon it , than object to those already imposed by the organic law of our system . We can not see with what shadow of justice the Executive can be arraigned for this legitimate exercise of a constitutional function . His legal and moral right to apply it , whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more open to question , // than that of either House of Congress upon the other ; and every such attack upon the Executive is a direct attack upon the Constitution itself  --  and upon a vital part-which comes with an ill grace from those who claim to be its especial defenders from innovation . The fact is , that from the Opposition have proceeded , and are proceeding , innovations upon the true and long established doctrines of the Constitution , which would prove most dangerous in practice , if adopted and permitted to be carried out to their consequences . We will here refer only to the doctrine on the subject of Executive powers , which has of late years been especially urged by some of their most eminent leaders , and which is embodied in the speech to which we have referred above , being adopted from the late expositions of " the ablest defender of the Constitution , " in the Senate . It is this : - that the idea of the independence of the Executive is a fallacy ; that it is only from Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various departments of the Exocutive admihistration ; and that he has no right to hold them amenable to his supervision by the power of removal ( for which the concurrence of the Senate is claimed ) , but that their relation of dependence is rather upon Congress than upon the Executive . To support this flagrant heresy of constitutional doctrine , they read in the clause which says that " the Executive power is vested in a President , " only a description of the person who is to exercise those executive functions which are afterwards enumerated , or which may be reposed in him by law for the execution of acts of Congress-as a mere caption to that portion of the instrument ; and ask whether , if any substantive rights are to be considered as involved in that designation , they are those of a British , a French , a Russian , or peradventure , a Turkish , Executive ? This doctrine centralizes in the Legislature all the distinct powers of the different departments of the Government , and the application of it was openly made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such provision in a law , as it might think proper , for its execution , by bestowing on the officer to be created under it a tenure of office independent of the President and responsible only to Congress . Another application of it subjects the President 's right of removal to the control of the Senate , as an implication from its right of negative upon his appointments to office . We shall not dwell upon the superfluous task of combatting such heresies ,  --  . fortunately they belong to that class which refute themselves in the statement of them , and that they should be seriously urged is only another evidence of the influence of the passion and prejudice of partisanship to mislead the judgment . It is sufficient to refer to the plain intent of the framers of the Constiti&gt; tion to distribute the powers of Government , and preserve them distinct in their respective spheres of action ,  --   --  to the contempora // neous exposition of the memorable debates in the first Congress , and the uniform established construction of nearly half a century ,  - -  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *terms , of seeing that all the laws be faithfully executed . It is a fallacy urged by all partisans of arbitrary government , that there is no possible line of demarcation between the executive and legislative functions , that the former word conveys no distinct and substantive idea ; while the opposite view , not only of the possibility of such a complete distinction , but of its necessity to any system of free institutions , has ever been a cardinal idea of liberal writers , and was perfectly familiar to the men of that day , and held in unquestioned reverence by them . Their creation of the American Executive was certainly a grand and noble performance . When we consider the liberal boldness with which they endowed it with independent power and energythe admirable restraints , both of a moral nature and the checks of the co-ordinate departments of the Government , by which they at the same time precluded all possibility of dangerous abuse-together with that stupendous idea , of his individual responsibility for the whole great scheme of executive administration of the laws , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us one of the most sublime monuments of the gigantic intellect* al stature of the men of those days that they have left behind them .. It is not easy for us to expand our vision so as to take in a complete view of this grand scheme , in its actual practical operation . Begin from the circumference of the circle , and gather up the leading threads of the ideas , till they classify themselves , in successive series , mutually connected and dependent , and finally meeting in the one common centre which is made to sustain the responsibility of the whole , directing and animating , by its supervision and control , the due action of each , in the discharge of its proper function . Consider first the manifold complexity of the foreign relations of the country , administered through the resident agents of various grades from the plenipotentiary to the consul , all under the control of the President , through the State Department , responsible to him , and receiving direct instructions for the conduct of all their various negotiations and business . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and details of administration , all under the vigilant supervision of those respective Departments , the heads of which are in close relation and daily intercourse with the President as their responsible chief . The vast Post Office system , forever throbbing , in its unresting circulation , through its myriad fibres , over the whole length and breadth of this mighty land . And finally the Treasury Department , through which the revenue which constitutes the sustaining aliment of the whole , is collected and administered . We have not space for more than this general allusion to // the broad outlines of the system ; the task of filling in the details must be left to the reader 's own imagination . And what is the animating principle which preserves all those complicated tens of thousands of details in that state of health and efficiency , which has been and is daily witnessed , in the highest degree compatible with the imperfection of human institutions ? It is the great principle of responsibility , diffused with equal energy throughout the whole , from apex to base , from centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another , a perpetual and prompt discipline keeping till in unrelaxing cheek , till finally the Atlantean burthen of the general responsibility of the whole rests on the shoulders of the one individual designated by the voice of his country to the nobly arduous duty . This idea has been made a subject of ridicule by some whose minds have not expanded to the comprehension of the sublime design of the authors of the system , asking how the individual can be held responsible for the working of every detail of such an enormous machine , so infinitely beyond the possibility of his own personal cognisance . But the answer is obvious , that that responsibility is not the less real and effectual that it is merely of a supervisory character , and subject , as of course , to the limitation of a common-sense understanding of its nature and extent . The President dictates the general principles on which the action of the whole is to be administered , and requires the faithful adherence to them of all his immediate agents , and their official subordinates , through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be practically and promptly enforced only by the ever impending check of removal and punishment . He is not of course held personally accountable for individual delinquencies ; but he is so accountable , for the principles on which the different departments of administration are conducted , as also for the selection of improper agents , or their continuance in office after evidence of disqualification , as to constitute precisely that real supe*visory responsibility which is necessary to secure the maintainance of a uniform and vigilant discipline throughout the whole . The responsibility of the President himself is to the People ,  --  4cr that to Congress , through the means of impeachment , we are willing here to put out of the question , as applicable only to extreme cases ; and the possibility is scarcely to be conceived of a President 's so far outraging the far more potent moral restraints which forever press upon him , from every direction , as a sort of atmosphere , as to become justly amenable to impeachment . In the first place , no man can ever hope to attain that position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public service , and full in the public eye , secured for himself an eminent character for wisdom , integrity and patriotism . And then , after he has reached that last crowning round of the ladder of ambition , how many and powerful the motives which must // combine to incite him to the purest devotion to his country 's best interests ,  --  his past character  --  the confidence of a noble and free nation to which his gratitude is so eminently due-his declining years  --  the example of his god-like predecessors-his individual responsibility  --  the unrelaxing vigilance with which he is watched and checked by the Opposition  --  the knowledge of the one broad fact , that his whole power consists in the support of public opinion , and that the slightest attempt to sacrifice the public interests , or the fundamental principles of liberty which lie at the heart 's core of the people , to any petty personal interests of his own , would not only blight his good fame through all posterity , and wither every pastearned laurel , but would at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives-these are restraints upon the misuse of Executive powers far more potent than even the most direct control of co-ordinate official checks . The nature and force of these were well appreciated by the creators of the office , when they did not fear to entrust to that department of the system , though vested in an individual-xvith all the unity of counsel , and energy of action , of the individual mind  --  the independent Executive function , with the whole military and naval powers , the treaty power , the power of official patronage , and the veto power , in the degrees in which those powers are vested in the Executive by the Constitution . Our principal intention was , however , rather to dwell upon some of the leading outlines of the history of the late Administration , than to discuss the subject of the Executive powers , in the abstract . It is one of great extent , and equal internst to the student of the noble science of politics ; and to be complete would involve necessarily a view of the powers and functions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual and correlative connection , - trict junctct in uno , Distinct as the billows , but one as the sea . To this view of the subject we are unable here to afford even a general allusion , as we have been precluded by our limits from more than a rapid and broad outline of the character of the Executive *zsfllce , regarded singly . We shall return to it on an early occasion . And to revert now to the point from which we set out , we repent the concession , that the energies native to the Executive department have been more fully developed , in greater activity and power , within the last two Presidential terms than they had ever been before . Its full capabilities had never before been called forth by the pressure of circumstances ; and it is , therefore , not surprisIng , that it was easy to make a considerable proportion of the people believe that Executive usurpation had encroached upon the constitutional // rights of the other departments , and had seized with violent hand upon new and arbitrary powers , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , it had only exercised , more actively than had before been rendered necessary by the course of events , the real powers clearly vested in it by the spirit and letter of the organic law . All know that that period was one of agitation between tremendous elements ,  --  of struggle between mighty principles and interests . Such periods bring out all existing powers , residing in the conflicting parties , though before perhaps dormant and latent , into full play and strife . It was a fearful contest-like a battle between armies of giants-between the democracy , and a vast centralized money power , possessing a strong influence over a large number of influential public men , over all the mercantile interests of the country , and over a large proportion of the press  --  and moreover , united in the closest bands of allianct* , offensive and defensive , with the great Opposition party of the country . It raged vehemently on both sides . The Bank was determined to wring a recharter perforce from the hands of the Federal Government . The Opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to crown its victory with a renewal of that charter , and the perpetuation of the system of which it was the corner-stone . These were the powers , this was the object , against which the democracy was arrayed for a struggle to the death . In this cause the President was the champion of the democracy , leading the centre van of the battle ; and it was equally a duty and a necessity to strain every nerve of the Executive arm , to maintain it , and lead it to victory . Yet did he never violate a single provision of the Constitution , or of any law . All the declamation which has been lavished upon that subject has failed to fasten that charge upon him , or prove a single specific instance . And all the energy which he wielded , in the powerful and daring blows which were struck in those times , was derived from the People alone . The democratic truth of the principles for which he was contending was the sign ' by which he conquered . Without that sympathy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been utterly impotent ,  --  it was but as their representative , worthily supported and cheered on by them , that he was mighty indeed . The Executive may , in a general sense , be considered as peculiarly representing the democracy of the country , viewed as a vast whole . The Senate represents peculiarly the State sovereignties . The lower House represents the several local constituencies of the respective districts . The Executive is chosen by the total mass of the people of the States , as a nation ; and it is to them that he has to appeal for support in his administration , and for the testimony of their approval by the re-election of either himself , or some other prominent member of the same party , whose administration would // be animated by the same leading principles . He has perpetually a very delicate and difficult part to perform . The responsibilities of his position are incalculable , and press upon himself individually , without that distribution which almost neutralizes the efficacy of responsibility in large corporate bodies . his official patroi*age is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which there cnn be no President who does not sigh for relief . Assuming every office to be filled with his partisans , ( and we do not hesitate to asscrt the fact , that upwards of one-third throughout the country are occupied by political opponents , ) yet , for every friend whose interested support is thus ohtained , he has not only to abide the embittered hostility of several disappointed applicants , but the zealous assaults of numerous expectants , of the Opposition party . Ten thousand battering engines are daily and hourly assailing the foundations of his power , with never-relaxing blows , of every degree of force , from every direction . Every administrative detail , the conduct and character of every subordinate officer , every public evil or distress from whatever cause arising , is a subject of partisan attack , and is made a means of general prejudice against his whole administration . Argument and sophistry , eloquence and declamation , truth and misrepresentation , the earnestness of mistaken enthusiasm and the ridicule of malicious wit , are forever busy , in countless modes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy that sensitive and exposed object , his popularity . It must , then , be manifest to all candid minds , that not only the power but the existence of the Executive depends upon his fidelity to those radical and eternal principles of democratic truth , which lie at the foundation of the national character of our people , as a great democracy . We hope that those great powers resident in the Executive arm , may never again be called forth into activity by similar causes . There is no reason , we think , to apprehend it . They can only be aroused by a great impulse of the popular sentiment . They are but the sinews and muscles ,  --  the latter alone is the vital energy of the will-without which the former are powerless as those of an infant . We trust that before a similar struggle can ever again arise-surprising the country in the condition in which it was found by the last , with both Legislature and Judiciary arrayed against the cause to *vhieh the Executive , supported by the democratic mass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such great public convulsions will be removed , by the disconnection of the Government from the moneyed interests of the country , and the restriction of the Federal action within narrower limits than has ever heretofore been the case . And this consummation , so devoutly to be wished , will he realized by those three great events now on the eve of accomplishment , namely , the establishment of an independent Treasury system for the administration of the public revenue-its collection and // disbursement in specie alone  --  and the final extinction of the last vestige of the American System policy . We are no friends to strong governmental action . We are no friends to powerful executive influence . We should be glad to see our Executive divested of the greater proportion of its official patronage , by an extension of the principle of popular election ; and we even hope that the day will come , when the bond of connection and sympathy between the Executive and the democracy will be drawn yet closer by the desirable reform of annual elections . But we confess that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ours , we have at least as jealous a distrust of legislative as of executive power . The former is of a far more insidious character than the latter , being both less suspected , and exercised under responsibilities rendered almost intangible by distribution , while it exerts the infinitely more important power of making laws and creating systems-witness its National Bank , its Internal Improvement system , its Protective Tariff , its power of appropriation , by which it can more than double ( as has recently been ) the expenditures required for the administration of the Government itself . The latter L at the utmost but of an executive nature , ever bound by the adamantine fetters of the Law created by the other ; and if , within those restrictions , it is endowed with energetic capabilities of action , they are but of a suspensive character , arresting partially the actio*i of the other , until a decision by the supreme tribunal , of the public opinion and will , can be had upon the issue joined between the two . It is only to arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of a deep and permanent effect , - that they can come into play , in a mode somewhat analogous to the theory of the Tribunitian power in ancient Rome . Nor is it ever to be expected that an Executive would engage in such an appeal , except in great emergencies , when supported by profound convictions of right and duty , and by a strong sympathy of the democratic mass on which his power is wholly and immediately dependent . If he fails , lie falls , and his ruin and that of his party are irretrievable . If he succeeds , the popular sanction relieves him of the responsibility of his acts ,  - -  leaving him only the glory of having greatly , wisely , and patriotically dared them . Such , then , according to our conception of it , is the leading idea of the philosophy of the history of the late Administration . It was directed by one of the most extraordinary men of the age . Devoted to democratic principles-simple and plain in every habit of lifeattached with a most ardent patriotism to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of them-with a wenderfully intuitive mind , whose natural solid strength and vigor had not been enervated by over-culture , or luxurious indulgence in the emasculate literature of the times-clear and sagacious in his // judgments-strong in his convictions , and unyielding in his resolutions , when once formed , and not less fearless in theirexecution-of kindly and benevolent affections , and an unaffected sincerity of piety in his religion , though ardent and impetuous in his emotionsa good lover and as good a hater-prone to confidence , in the guileless truth of his own nature , but immitigable in his resentment and scorn when once deceived  --  a Cincinnatus to whose simple and honest patriotism any degree of even irresponsible power might with safety have been entrusted-Andrew Jackson seems to have been selected , by that sort of prophetic instinct often apparent in the impulses of great masses , as precisely the man for the time , to stand by the helm of state during the great convulsion of the elements which was approaching , and which was necessary to relieve and purify the political atmosphere , surcharged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of his influence was vast , both from the force of his own character , and , in an infinitely higher degree , because be acted as the champion and representative of the democracy . Yet was it of a sound and healthful character ; for that species of baser influence attached to the dispensation of patronage ,  --  from the disagreeable burthen of which no President can disembarrass himself-was but an insignificant element of his power . That power was a moral one ; and it was by the legitimate means of direct intercourse with his constituency , the mass of the nation , by frequent appeals to them in state papers of remarkable force , that it was sustained . He used the great energies of his office , in accordance with the forms , and within the limits of the intention of the Constitution and the Laws , more boldly indeed , and perhaps farther than any former President had done , or had had need to do ,  --   --  but he did so on a great emergency , in a period of mighty strife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evils threatened to the liberties of the country-for the popular cause , and in the sole strength of the popular support . The occasion has now passed ,  --  the man that it required arose with it , and has passed with it , to take his place in history ; and we trust that no necessity will ever again call out all the capabilities of the Executive department . It is now rapidly subsiding back to the old moderate routine , delayed partially for a while only till the consummation of the reform already in progress shall establish a permanent security , for the future , from all danger of similar agitations . The cry of Executive usurpation , so long effectual to animate a strong party zeal against the late Administration , is fast losing its power , and Congressional orators but waste their eloquence in the vain attempt to revive its exhausted prestige.
