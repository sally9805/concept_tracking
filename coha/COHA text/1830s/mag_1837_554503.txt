txt THE history of English lexicography , it seems to us , if it should fall into the right hands , might be wrought into a very curious and amusing book ; one which would interest not only the learned philologist , but every widely read English scholar . But to this end the author would be compelled to resort to the original sources ; to go back to the dawn of Christianity , of civilization , and of learning in England , in the seventh century ; to trace , through the increasing gleams of light in the first half of the eighth century , the planting of the Saxon language , into which , in the coming age , Allied regretted that the learned men , who were spread over England , did not translate the best of the books , in several languages , with which the churches and monasteries were filled ; to mark how these fair hopes were blasted by the incursion of the Danes , who not only destroyed the monasteries , the seats of learning , with the libraries they contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new dialect ; to begin again , after more than a century of thick darkness , with Alfred the Great , whose genius for learning was inspired by a Saxon poem of beautiful penmanship and richly illuminated , - the gift of his mother ; and after his reign , glorious to him as a prince , as a learned man and as the founder and patron of learned institutions , to pause while learning languishes and expires , and barbarism is again triumphant ; and then to emerge from this long night , in the eleventh century , and , in the midst of it , to find the Saxon subject to the Norman , and submitting to the edicts and decrees of the latter , promulgated in his own language , both in the end mingling in good fellowship , though the pride and stability of the Saxon eschew , so far as may be , the novelties which have been strenuously forced upon him . With this preliminary research , he , who would give a thorough history of English lexicography , should collect all the English provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each . Some philological antiquaries , more curious than wise , have thought that they dis // covered traces of the ancient British in the English language , as it now exists , suflicient to encourage the investigations of the philologist . But this was so nearly supplanted by the Romans , Saxons , and Danes , that it may be left out of the account , and we need not wander to the Highlands of Scotland or to the mountains of Wales for the lost fugitives . Their places were supplied by the Saxon , mingled in a greater or less degree , in different districts , with the Danish , and afterwards blended with the Norman . " If , " says the author of a work entitled Anecdotes of the English Language , ' ' " you would seek for the terms and expressions of the Northern people of England , it will be in vain to ransack the British tongue , which fled with the natives into the fastnesses of Wales ; for the Northern dialect ( Scotland included ) is for the most part Saxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitless to search in the Saxon forests of the North for the language of the western counties of England , which ( except by transplantation , ) is of British growth . In Kent and Sussex , and the immediate southern counties ( coastwise at least ) , our pursuit may be directed in a great degree to Gallicisms , in point of idiom as well as words ; and , lastly , in London ( the great Babel of them all ) every language will be found incorporated ; though that of the true Cockney , is , for the most part , composed of Saxonisms . The Danes left us some traces of their language , though it is but a dialect of that extensive tongue , which , under the different names of Teutonic , Gothic , &amp;c. , was known in every region of what is called the N'orth of Europe . " As to the mixtures of more modern origin , occasioned by conquest , by political , ecclesiastical , and commercial relations , it is needless to speak particularly . But of words derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Norman , we may lay it down as a rule , almost without exception , that they were introduced not by the conquests of the Romans prior to those of the northern invaders , but by learned writers of modern times , partly through the pride of learning , and partly through the facility of multiplying words in this way , framed unconsciously upon the models of other words of similar forms that came through the Norman French . This fact might be illustrated by a multitude of examples drawn from successive periods in the history of English literature . // A work elaborated agreeably to this outline , would indeed embrace a history of the English Language ; but it would embrace also much more of illustration than any treatise with which we are acquainted , by means of constant reference to the changes in the English vocabulary . We shall here barely state a few facts , respecting the history of English lexicography , beginning with the time when authors professed to emhody our language in a full vocabulary . About the middle of the sixteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and " Little Dictionaries , " in Latin and English , particularly one compiled by J. Withals , which passed through several editions from 1559 to 1599 . In 1580 was published a dictionary entitled " An Alvearie , * or Quadruple Dictionarie , containing four sundrie Tongues namelie , English , Latine , Greeke , and Frenche . Newlie enriched with Varietie of Wordes , Phrases , Proverbs , and divers lightsome Observations of Grammar . By John Baret . " But the Lexicon said to have been the most copious and celebrated of its day , was that of Sir Thomas Elliot , " declaring Latin by English , greatly improved and enriched by Thomas Cooper in 1552 . " Rider 's Dictionary , published in 1589 , came forth with considerable pretensions . In his Preface , he says , that " no one dictionary , as yet extant , hath the English before the Latine , with a full index of all such Latine words as are in any common dictionary . " His additions to the vocabulary , he affirms , " amount to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affords . " The words are sometimes defined in English , and sometimes the meaning is to be Baret , in the preface to this work , thus explains the occasion of entitlin it *lvearie . " Having pupils at Cambridge studious of the Latine tongue , I used them often to write epistles and theames together , and dailie to translate some peece of English into Latine . Perceivin* , what great trouble it was to come running to me for everie worde they missed ( knowing then of no other dictionarie to help us , but Sir Thomas Eliot 's librarie ) , I appointed them certaine leaves of the same hooke everie daie to write the English before the Latine , and likewise to gather a number of fine phrases out of Cicero , Terence , Cnsar , Livy , &amp;c. , and to set them under severall titles , for the more readie finding tli*m again at their neede . Thus within a yeere or two , they bad gathered together a great volume , which ( for the apt similitude betweene the good scholars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hive ) I called then their . dlseerie , both for a memoriall by whom it was made , and also by this name to incourage other to the like diligence . " Hawkins , in his " Life of Johnson , " dates Baret 's Dictionary , 1572. // gathered only from the Latin . XVe have an edition before us , ( London , 1649 , ) " corrected and augmented " by Francis Jioly-Oke , from which " the barbarous words , which were many hundreds , are expunged , to the help of young Scholars , which before they used in stead of good words . " " The Nexv World of English Words : or a General Dictionary , " by Edward Phillips , was published in 1658 . Phillips was a nephew of Milton , and evidently a man of learning . He acknowledged himself indebted to Thomas Blount 's " Glossographia , " published in 1656 , for essential aid . It was the main purpose of Blount 's work to interpret " such hard words , whether Hebrew , Greek , Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined English tongue , " &amp;c . Phillips dedicated his Dictionary , primarily , " to the most illustrious and impartial sisters* the two Universities , " which he addresses as " Most equal sisters . " Hawkins , in his " Life of Johnson , " says of this dictionary , " The New World of Words , ' as it is much more copious than Blount 's Glossographia , ' and comprehends a greater quantity of matter , must be looked upon as the basis of English lexicography . " This inference is wanting alike in logical soundness and in truth . The fact is , that neither of those works can be regarded as the basis of English lexicography . Phillips 's " World of Words " is a very limited world , including little more than the technical vocabulary of the times , in which Chiromancy Divination , Astrology , Magic , Heraldry , and Hawking have a prominent place , - " hard words , " from other languages , - Proper Names , Mythology , &amp;c . In fact , as a dictionary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 be compared with Rider and some other of its predecessors . Even the work of Junius or of Skinner , in regard to the vocabulary and etymology , might be pronounced to be the *L basis of English Lexicography , " with much more truth than that of Phillips . The first English dictionary upon a plan sufficiently comprehensive to deserve that name , was Bailey 's , entitled , " An Universal Etymological English Dictionary . " He says little of his predecessors in the same vocation , except that he made diligent use of their works , rejecting xvhat was redundant , and supplying what was deficient , by adding " several thousand English words and phrases , in no English dictionary before extant . " In regard to etymology , he claimed to be // " the first who has attempted it in English , except what Blount has done in his Glossographia , ' which is hut a very small part of the words , and those of a Latin derivation chiefly , besides a small extract of Dr. Skinner 's Etymologicon . ' " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that formed the groundwork of Johnson 's Dictionary . " An interleaved copy of Bailey 's Dictionary in folio , he made the repository of the several articles , and these he collected , by incessant reading of the best authors in our language , in the practice whereof his method was to score with a black-lead pencil , the words by him selected , and give them over to his assistants to insert in their places. * ' The merits of Johnson , as a lexicographer , have sometimes been overstated , but more generally , we believe , undervalued . The conception of his Dictionary , in all its parts , as the plan is expounded in his letter to Chesterfield , and in his Preface , indicates a far-reaching and philosophical mind . That the execution of the work does not approximate nearer to the ideal excellence , of which he appeared to have a distinct view , is no matter of wonder . In regard to the vocabulary , it was no part of his ambition to swell the list of words , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he expect to embalm the language , so as to put an end to further corruption and change . He may be thought to take a narrow view of our wants , when he affirms that , " if the language of theology were extracted from Hooker and the translation of the Bible ; the terms of natural knowledge from Bacon ; the phrases of policy , war , and navigation from Raleigh ; the dialect of poetry and fiction from Spenser and Sidney ; and the diction of common life from Shakspeare , few ideas would be lost to mankind , for want of English words in which they might be expressed . " But Charles Fox , at a later period , took a still narrower view of the needed extent of a vocabulary , when he resolved , as it is related of him in reference to his intended History , that he would " admit no word into his book for which he had not the authority of Dryden . " This may be regarded , if not as an example of literary bigotry , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no danger of too great copiousness , if the writer is duly watchful of the purity of his words and idioms . Johnson did indeed , at one time , indul* , e the hope of fixing the language , and in some good // measure of rescuing it from the fluctuations of time and chance , and from the changes caused by affectation and caprice . But he soon saw how vain the expectation was . With philosophical prescience , also , he perceived that in the progress of intellectual knowledge , new ideas , ( new either in fancy or in fact , ) would be evolved , demanding a corresponding enlargement of phraseology ; and that , especially in arts and sciences , there would be a demand for new words , or new modifications of words , answering to the advancement of knowledge and to the discovery of new facts . It was the first labor of Johnson to supply the deficiencies in the English dictionaries , which he accomplished to a great extent . He also expunged from them many unauthorized and unused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were either the production of lexicographers themselves , or a component part of the scholastic jargon of preceding centuries . He might have exercised this liberty to a much greater extent than he did , a fact of which any one may satisfy himself without looking far into his Dictionary , even under the first letter of the alphabet . He faithfully preserved the language of poetry , so far back as the time of Shakspeare and Ben Jonson , accompanying the words , however , as the occasion seemed to him to require , with cautions couched in terms assumed by him as a literary censor ; such as , little used , not used , obsolete , low and vulgar , &amp;c . The poetical part of the vocabulary was greatly enlarged , as well as richly illustrated by his own reading ; and we owe him great thanks , that he did not sacrifice the more ancient , if not the more opulent stores of English phraseology , to an exclusive regard to those that were more recent , and which were looked upon , by many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many omissions , after all the diligent efforts of Johnson to complete the vocabulary , were soon perceived in his Dictionary , even of words in familiar use , and of such as he had used himself in his writings . In the year 1800 , appeared a " Supplement to Johnson 's Dictionary , " ascribed to Mason , in which the author professed to supply what was omitted in Johnson . His plan extended " not only to the words and senses of words unnoticed by Johnson , but to the exemplification of those that stand unexemplified in the principal Dictionary . " It seems to have been // an object with the author of the " Supplement " to glean what Johnson had not gathered from Spenser , though the authorities cited are various . This " Supplement " must have been serviceable to those who have since compiled English dictionaries ; but it fell far short of what was wanted . Much fault has been found with Johnson 's definitions , particularly by our countryman , Dr. Noah Webster . He has been charged not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical definitions , but , - what we should hardly expect from such a distinguished scholar and master of English , - with want of discrimination . It is not surprising , that , in so large a work as his Dictionary , men far inferior to him in learning and talents can find many definitions which may be amended . But it would be wonderful , if a man of such comprehensive learning and such strong powers of mind , as Johnson , selecting examples of the use of words from the best writers in our language , and thus continually putting in our power , and at our immediate command , the means of detection , should constantly offend , at the same time , against good usage , and common sense , and the judgment of those best skilled in our language . He experienced the difficulty which every one must , of explaining words , especially those of a moral import , by other words nearly synonymous . Such definitions it is much easier to ridicule , than to amend or to avoid . Simple words , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we acquired in childhood , through an unconscious process of induction , suffer from copious explanations and words ambiguous as to their meaning , whether their etymology is clear or doubtful , must be settled by usage rather than by their origin . Taking these things into the account , and extending a reasonable share of indulgence for oversights to the author of so great a work as that of Johnson 's Dictionary , his faults in the definitions are by no means so many or so gross , as to merit the indiscriminate censure that has sometimes been uttered . To this result we believe every one will come , who will compare his Dictionary with those which claim to be independent , not to say infinitely superior authorities . We have never placed a high value upon the etymological part of Johnson 's Dictionary . It is a part of his work on which he probably labored with much less diligence , than upon that of his illustrations . Besides his own errors and defects , he copied many of the errors of his predecessors , without // 193 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Skinner , or of Bailey , without due investigation , or adequate reasons to justify such a departure . Since his time , etymology has assumed a more imposing character in the hands of scholars , who have threatened the very existence of our present grammars and dictionaries in all languages . Home Tooke stands foremost in this new sect , whose principal ohject it seems to have been , to trace words to their true etyrnons , and thus to rescue them from the tyranny of custom , and to restore them and confine them to their primitive rights . The principle at the hottom of the theory is , that each and every word has hut one meaning , and that the multiplication of definitions and illustrations of a word in our dictionaries is all deceptive , and grows not out of the true meaning of the word itself , hut of its associates and adjuncts . That there is some truth in this , is not to he denied ; nor need it he , in order to show the necessity of explaining words in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried to its full extent , would not only destroy our present dictionaries , hut bring about a revolution in language ; such a revolution , however , as can never he effected , except by a universal language , which shall assign a real , unvarying character to every word or sign of thought . The preparation for this must begin with the human mind , with the classing of human thoughts and objects of human knowledge , and a universal , infallible logic . Such a transcendental theory will answer for the philosopher 's plaything , but will never supersede the labors of the practical lexicographer . Johnson 's illustrations of his definitions , by copious examples , have been spoken of by some in terms of disparagement which they by no means deserve ; and by many others they are not appreciated according to their merits . We are confident , that , in respect to the meaning of the great mass of words which belong legitimately and without controversy to the English language , as such , most of which we find in Johnson , nothing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboring in the dark to settle the true or customary sense of a word , or to ascertain the purity and genuineness of an idiom , may obtain from Johnson 's illustrations an illumination , for which he will have much reason to be grateful . They go far beyond the mere citing of the // names of authors who have used a word in a particular sense . We are not left merely to the decision of the lexicographer in the matter , but are enabled to examine the word with its adjuncts and associates , and find how it is affected by the company in which it is found . Many words which appear to be as well defined in dictionaries as they can be , still perplex the young writer ; and it is not till he sees them applied to their subjects and fully exemplified , that he can become thoroughly satisfied concerning their exact meaning and the propriety of their use . Johnson 's Dictionary has never been superseded . Other dictionaries have had a portion of public favor , as common manuals ; but Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedency in England , if not in this country . There are now two rival lexicographers , claiming superiority over each other , and over their great predecessor . We mean our countryman , Webster , whose great Dictionary was published in 1828 , and Richardson , whose " New Dictionary of the English Language , " the publication of which was begun in the " Encyclop*dia Metropolitana , " twenty years ago , is now far advanced toward completion , in a separate form . Dr. Webster has for a long course of years been signally mindful of his reputation as a linguist ; and " a linguist , " as Milton says , " should pride himself to have all the tongues that Babel cleft the world into . " He has ever thought very meanly of the English dictionaries in common use , and his honesty and self-love have taught him , in speaking of them , not " to mince the matter . " He has accordingly availed himself of all suitable occasions to proclaim their deficiencies , and to promise to supply them ; to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should correct them . Great curiosity therefore was felt , as well by the faithless as the believing , to see how his promises would be fulfilled in his forth-coming Dictionary . He promised not only a large accession of words , but " precise and technical definitions . " Former dictionaries , he said , were " almost exclusively translating dictionaries , in which one word is defined by another , that is synonymous , or nearly so . " Instead of this he promised , by an implication not to be misunderstood , that he should substitute " accurate , discriminating , and technical definitions " ; and should insert probably thirty thousand significations and distinct applications of words , ( many of them among the most important // words , ) which significations and applications are not to be found in other dictionaries . But the greatest of his promises related to " new etymological deductions and affinities . " We were told that " the obscurity which has hitherto rested on this subject , and which has brought it into discredit , will be , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etymology will be made erriinently subservient to the illustration , not only of words , but of history , and the affinities of many different languages . It is found that the most valuable and interesting facts and principles in the formation of languages , have escaped the observation of European philologists . In this work , the aspect of this subject is entirely changed . " In regard to the " formation of languages , " a preliminary discourse was announced , " in which the principles , on which languages have been formed , will be illustrated by facts and proofs entirely original . " In these and such-like promises Dr. Webster was doubtless sincere , and as fully persuaded that he should fulfil them all , as ever any indefatigable experimenter was convinced that he had discovered perpetual motion . His rival , - Richardson , the author of the " New Dictionary , " - fearing , as he says , that he might be charged with want of courtesy , should he pass unnoticed the " American Dictionary " of Dr. Webster , speaks somewhat uncourteously of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a display of Oriental reading in his Preliminary Essays , which , as introductory to a dictionary of the English language , seems as appropriate and useful , as a reference to the code of Gentoo laws to decide a question of English inheritance . " Dr. Webster 's ignorance of old English authors is asserted by Richardson , in terms no more respectful , than those in which he condemns the misapplied labors of that learned countryman of ours . The retort courteous has been bestowed in ample measure by Dr. Webster . He has assailed Richardson 's definitions with various weapons , and has visited his ancient English lore with provoking raillery , in return for the grave charge of ignorance bestowed upon himself . But we will not here further meddle with this warfare . Dr. Webster 's great Dictionary was published in 1828 , while Richardson 's was in progress in successive numbers of the Encyclopa*dia Metropolitana . We might suppose its vocabulary to be as complete as the efforts of one man could make it , when he tells us , that , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own contains seventy thousand . But we know a collector of words which are found in English books , and used as English words , who affirms , that , after deducting from his catalogue all that he has in common with Webster , there is still a remainder of six thousand not to he found in any English dictionary . The prodigious increase of the vocabulary , since Johnson 's work was published , is to he ascribed in great part to the more extended insertion of technical words . They were introduced sparingly by Johnson . And when we consider the advancement of arts and sciences since his time , during which period some of them have been greatly extended , and some of them almost created , or the nomenclature of them in their divisions and ramifications so essentially changed and enlarged as to form almost a new language , and find also that a more liberal introduction of such words into our dictionaries is sanctioned by the wishes of the public , the seeming mystery of this vast increase of words is in a great degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to orthography . It is a matter , concerning which he has always been striving against usage , often , we have thought , to little purpose . We were glad to find , on the appearance of his great work , that he had abandoned these skirmishes . It was his principal aim , we believe , in this work , as it should have been , to fix what was loose and uncertain , and to he consistent in the spelling of words of analogous formation , so far as may be , without doing too much violence to custom and prejudice . For all his success in this undertaking he deserves thanks . But sad is the record of the defeat , even of those , who are just throwing off the harness and priding themselves in their conquests . In a review of the orthography of this Dictionary , by Mr. Lyman Cobb , giving proofs of a more minute and thorough examination than it has ever fallen to our lot to witness on a similar subject , the author shows " between seven and eight hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Dictionary , " and affirms , that he has " noted about five hundred others . " How other English dictionaries would fare under a like scrutiny , we are not able to decide . If in any one department of lexicography , more than another , Dr. Webster has claimed superiority over his predecessors , it is in that of etymology . Indeed he seems to have plumed // himself , when on that ground , as standing not only " unrivalled , " hut " alone . " " The aspect of this subject , " in his work , " is entirely changed , " and facts and principles in the formation of languages are developed , as we were told in advance , which " have escaped the observation of European philologists . " It was well known , from what he had previously made public concerning his pursuits , that he had been long employed in the unwearied study and comparison of different languages , in order to ascertain their affinities and the derivation of words . But he must have found oftentimes lamentable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave much to uncertain conjecture , and to produce doubt concerning their identity . We readily perceive the agreement of a great portion of English words , with those of the northern European dialects , and another large portion we trace , through the Norman French , to the Latin language ; hut , when we attempt to connect them with the Oriental dialects , some links in the chain are often not to be found . The absurdity of referring the origin of English words directly to the ancient languages of the East , in consequence of a near resemblance in sound , or in letters of like power , without regard to the intermediate languages through which words have come to us , must be manifest to every scholar . We recollect being once present at an exercise in Hebrew , in the lecture-room , when the word * occurred . It was at a time when the mode of studying that language was improving , and it was becoming common to speak disparagingly of Parkhurst 's Lexicon , which had enjoyed its day of reputation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in Parkhurst would probably be found under that word , as a derivative , the English word dagger , especially as the Hebrew verb signifies to pierce , or stab . Accordingly , in consulting Parkhurst under the Hebrew word , were found , as derivatives - dagger , dirk . Dr. Webster does not indeed thus land in Britain from Asia by a single leap , but he does it sometimes with an agility very nearly resembling it . Dr. Webster has entered more deeply into etymological researches , and with greater success , than any of his predecessors in the same vocation . Much , to be sure , as it necessarily must be , he possesses in common with others . What is peculiar to himself is often curious , as well as satisfactory but from some of his decisions there may be good reasons // for dissent . On a review of his labor , he must doubtless find less effected , than be bad promised to himself , and bad led the public to expect . " The aspect of this subject " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told it would be . It is acknowledged by Dr. Webster , that the origin of many words is wholly lost , and that the origin of others is so obscure as to admit of no certainty . It is on the etymology of such words , that the imagination of philologists runs riot ; and all the learning and critical acumen of the author of the " American Dictionary , " have not , on every occasion , made him an exception from those who are subject to this infirmity . Great pains were bestowed by Dr. Webster , as we learn from himself , on the definitions of words . In this part of his work , be has supplied many defects , and corrected many faults , which had been copied from one dictionary into another . He has also given the more recent acceptations of old words , though it is to be regretted that he has often failed to cite his authorities . While much in the way of amendment has thus been done by him , he can not be acquitted of all trespasses such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in some of his definitions of theological words , the couching of a dogma of his own in the terms of the explanation . We are the more inclined to remark upon his superfluity , because this is one of the faults , which , formerly , he charged with much vehemence upon Johnson . And we are prompted by the additional fact , that he has recently brought into comparison , in one of our public journals , his own definitions with those of Johnson . He citds examples under several words , from which we select the following : From Johnson . " CAN . To he able ; to have power . 2 . It expresses the  |p6tential  mood . 3 . It is distinguished from may , as power from permission . I can do it , it is in my power ; I may do it , it is allowed me ; but in poetry they are confounded and sometimes in prose . 4 . Can is used of the person , with the verb active , where may is used of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do it , it may or can he done . " From lVebstcr 's " American Dictionary . " " CAN . To be able ; to have sufficient strength or physical power . One man can lift a weight which another can not . // 2 . To have means or instruments , which supply power or ability . A man can build a house or fit out a ship , if he has the requisite property . 3 . To be possible . Nicodemus said , How can these things be ? 4 . To have adequate moral power . A man can indulge in pleasure , or he can refrain . 5 . To have just or legal competent power ; to be free from any restraint of moral , civil , or political obligation . A man can hold an office , or he can not . The Jews could not eat certain kind of animals which were declared to be unclean . 6 . To have natural strength , or capacity ; to be susceptible of ; to be able or free to undergo any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constitution of nature , or by divine appointment . Silver can be melted , but can not be changed into gold . Can the rush grow without mire ? Can the fig-tree bear oliveberries ? Can faith save him ? 7 . To have competent strength , ability , fortitude , patience , &amp;c. , what else ? in a passive sense . He can not bear reproof . I can not endure his impertinence . This is a hard saying ; who can hear it ? 8 . To have the requisite knowledge , experience , or skill . An astronomer can calculate an eclipse , though he can not make a coat . 9 . To have strength or inclination , or motives sufficient to overcome obstacles , impediments , inconvenience , or other objection . I can not rise and give thee , ' &amp;c . Luke . 10 . To have sufficient capacity ; as a vessel can not hold or contain the whole quantity . " Let it be recollected , that Dr. Webster professed to give precise definitions . The meaning of he word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exact ; nice ; definite having determinate limitations . " And yet what can be more inexact , loose , indefinite , and unlimited , than the senses he ascribes to the little word , which he singles out for an example to prove his superiority to other lexicographers in his definitions ? Johnson defines it , with precision , in a single line , followed by a few grammatical remarks . Webster , besides ascribing to it the true meaning , as including power , ability , possibility , gives it a physical , a moral , and a legal sense ; a sense of natural strength , susceptibility , fortitude , patience , skill , knowledge , experience , inclination , motives , and capacity of measure , to say nothing of " &amp;c . " To these distinct // significations ascribed to can , he annexes distinct propositions or sentences , and seems wholly unconscious , that , instead of interpreting the little auxiliary , he is all along interpreting the propositions or sentences selected to illustrate its meaning . All this is about as appropriate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 1 . A black animal . The horse on which she rode was black . 2 . An animal with a man on his back . There came two men on horse-back. 3 . A huge beast . All wondered at the hugeness of the horse . 4 . An animal which is sometimes fed with human flesh , &amp;c . " Like to the Thracian tyrant , who , they say , Unto his horses gave his guests for meat . " If we had chanced upon the example cited from Dr. Webster , in his Dictionary , instead of finding it in a communication of his own to a magazine , we should have regarded it as an example so peculiarly unfortunate for his reputation as a critic , that it ought not to be selected as a specimen of his definitions ; but as it appears to be a favorite one with him , it seemed fit that we should expose its errors and fallacies . There are no intimations , we believe , in any of Dr. Webster 's writings , that he had seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Dictionary which had previously appeared . It is probable , however , that he had ; since successive numbers of Richardson 's work , which were printed in the Encyclopai*dia Metropolitana several years before the American Dictionary appeared , attracted much notice in Great Britain , and received great commendation in several respectable English journals . However that may be , their labors were in great part contemporaneous ; and , as they became more known to each other and to the public , they came , as we have before hinted , to stand in the relation of rivals . Each of them had been employed , independently of the other , in preparing a new dictionary ; and the two works are in many respects as dissimilar as xve can conceive two works of the same period to be , the main objects of which are alike , and some of which should seem to require little else for their execution , than a mechanical kind of literature . Richardson appears to have proceeded , in his undertaking , // more systemaiically than his rival . Nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ground ; for the questions come up , whether his system is good , and whether the plan of his work is well and faithfully executed . For one of the leading peculiarities of his plan he acknowledges himself indebted to Johnson ; to Johnson as a projector , not as an author . It was Johnson 's original design to exhibit in his explanations , first , the natural and primitive signification of words , then to give the consequential , and then the metaphorical meaning . Such was the exposition of this part of his plan in his Letter to the Earl of Chesterfield . In his Preface it degenerates into the mere shadow of his first conception . " In every word of extensive use , " he says in his Preface , " it was requisite to mark the progress of its meaning , and show by what gradations of intermediate sense it has passed from its primitive to its remote and accidental signification ; so that every foregoing explanation should tend to that which follows . " **rrhis is specious , but not always practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexity can not be disentangled , nor any reason be assigned why one should be ranged before the other . " Richardson seized upon the great idea which Johnson first conceived . He has accordingly aimed so to arrange his definitions and illustrations of words , as to give their history as nearly as possible in chronological order . In connexion with this part of the plan he assumes the dictum of Home Tooke , namely , that " a word has one meaning and one only ; and that all usages must spring , and be derived , from this simple meaning . " Hence etymology becomes infinitely important ; though in defiance of the theory it might be shown , that many words have so far departed from their primitive meaning , as to render their etymological derivation little else than a matter of curiosity . The utility of this theory of language , when reduced to practice and rigidly adhered to , sometimes becomes very questionable . There is a higher law , the norma loquendi , established usage . It affords gratification indeed to the philosophical critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etymology ; hut this use , not etymology , however demonstrably true it may be , is the test of criticism , and opposition to it is vain . If we mistake not , the unlearned reader is in danger of being misled by some of Richardson 's // definitions and illustrations , in which the etymological meaning stands so conspicuous as to draw attention from the acquired and customary meaning , and undue importance is given to the chronological succession of his authorities and exemplifications . The genius and idiom of the language as it exists , determined by those who write and speak it in the best manner , are never to he lost sight of hy the lexicographer . These it is his great husiness to ascertain and exemplify . But we must speak a little more particularly of the great work before us . In regard to Richardson 's vocabulary , we have seen it alleged that a large number of words are not to he found , which are contained in Johnson 's and Webster 's Dictionaries . This case , we should think , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied in an appendix . We add to this the opposite fault ; namely , the insertion of a multitude of obsolete words and worthless derivatives . Many of these derivatives are antiquated , and have long since given place to other forms , and some are not explained ; and therefore the introduction of them serves to confound the unlearned . Mimerous words are inserted from Chaucer , which escaped the industrious gleanings of Todd . We do not see the propriety of thus scattering through an English dictionary a glossary of authors unknown to the bulk of English readers . They are made little wiser by the words themselves , or by the citing of the passages in which they occur . Compounded words are sparingly introduced . They are not omitted by accident , as we may infer from the fact that they are frequently contained in the exemplification , when they are not found in the vocabulary . We pass now to what is peculiar to Richardson 's Dictionary ; we mean the etymological arrangement , - the grouping of derivatives under the primitive words . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so in English dictionaries , and in dictionaries of other modern languages . All the lexicons of the Hebrew and the kindred languages were formed upon this plan , till recently ; and the modes of derivation of words in those languages , by letters prefixed and changed , made the consulting of the ni very vexatious . So bigoted were the lexicographers to the theory of uniform , mechanical modes of derivation , that , when they could not discover a root from which supposed derivatives might be analogically formed , // they imagined one which they pronounced obsolete . This system of lexicography carries with it the absurdity of presupposing the very knowledge which is sought for . Though it has some advantages , it ought not to supersede the alphabetical form ; hut if adopted at all , it should be superadded . Adam , in his Latin Dictionary , published about the beginning of this century , adopted the etymological arrangement ; but , though his Dictionary is in many respects valuable , it has never , we believe , been extensively used . The inconveniences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language as in some others , particularly in the ancient Oriental languages . From the manner in which derivatives are formed in English , they may Follow each other generally without interrupting the alphabetical arrangement . But it is by no means uniformly so ; and this method does not appear to be so convenient for the definitions and exemplifications of the words . No one can consult Richardson 's Dictionary to any great extent , without perceiving the inconvenience of his arrangement in these respects . And though there is an advantage as well as pleasure in seeing the whole family together , yet it does not compensate for the want of opportunity of becoming better acquainted with each member separately . One other peculiarity of Richardson 's Dictionary , to which we have already incidentally adverted , consists in his manner of illustrating words by selections from English authors . His plan is to come down from the oldest writers in the language , to recent ones , and thus , as we have said , to present a sort of chronological history of words . Wiclif 's Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his most ancient authorities . Robert of Gloucester wrote when the language of England was in a transition state , not far from the middle of the thirteenth century , and about a century , probably , after the Saxon Chronicle was written . Whoever has the curiosity to see what sort of English he wrote , may gratify it by looking into Johnson 's Preface to his great Dictionary , in which is printed an historical poem by that author and he will be satisfied that Robert " used a kind of intermediate diction , neither Saxon or English . " Richardson has generally selected those lines , in which there are the nearest approaches to English ; but still many of his selections must be almost " all Greek " to many English readers . We have already expressed our decided approbation of the // illustration of words by examples , not so much for the sake of tracing their history ( though we do not think slightingly of this ) , as for showing their meaning in combination with other words , in the productions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has by some critics been greatly undervalued ; while the importance of etymology , in contradistinction to it , has been greatly exaggerated . Richardson 's work , in this view , is highly praiseworthy . The author 's purpose is , while exemplifying the changes in the use of words , and tracing them from remote to recent times , to keep present good usage also in view . But his zeal as an antiquary sometimes outstrips his affection for what is modern , as if it were also degenerate . Examples are cited in undue proportion from the oldest English authors , and they are often of little value . They are used in superfluous abundance under words , which have preserved an unvaried meaning from their Saxon origin to the present time , and differ in nothing but orthography . This is particularly striking and faulty in sonic of the compounds . The word kind , as an adjective , signifying the quality of tender affection or good will , is placed as a derivative under kin ; and this meaning , sought for through three columns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Chaucer , and found obscurely in one from Gower , in a sort of pun or play upon the word . But when we come to unkind and the abstract unkindness , though the meaning is uniform , as opposed to kind arid kindness , pertaining to natural affection , two examples are taken from Robert of Gloucester , one from Brunne , six from Piers Plouhman , two from Wiclif , one from Chaucer , &amp;c . We might select other instances equally remarkable , to show how the system of the author is so rigidly adhered to , as to incumber his work with much superfluous matter . In his definitions , Mr. Richardson , conformably to his theory , begins with the radical meanings of the words , however obsolete they may be . But it is impossible for him , in some cases , to bring down in regular gradation the acquired meanings , in his prescribed order , namely , the consequential and metaphorical . These varieties of meaning are sometimes mingled in his examples ; and one must he familiarly conversant with ancient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by his illustrations . Besides , it does not appear to us , that the consequential and metaphorical meanings are so // 1837 . Richardson 's English Dictionary . generally and clearly different from each other , as to make the distinction of much importance . The radical signification of long , for example , as a verb , is , according to Mr. Richardson , to lengthen , to reach or stretch out ; and the consequential meaning is , to desire eagerly , &amp;c . Is not this also a metaphorical meaning ? For a metaphor , to take Mr. Richardson 's own definition , is " a transference or translation of the application of a word from its literal meaning , denominating some sensible object , or action , or operation , to supposed similar or corresponding objects , or actions , or operations of the human mind . " This theory , therefore , of a threefold distinction in the meaning of words , is not of so much importance when reduced to practice , as it may at first sight appear ; and we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not utterly fallacious . Whatever may be the defects and superfluities of Richardson 's Dictionary , it must be regarded as a very rich addition to English philology . The same remark is applicable to Webster 's Dictionary ; and our estimate of the labors of each of those authors far transcends that which either of them has formed of the other . We can not doubt , however , that there are many scholars , - not more learned philologists in respect to the English language and its sources , for this is not to be expected , - who would use their knowledge with more judgment and art , if they should apply themselves to the same laborious undertaking . We here add what should have been said in another place , that twenty-seven of the thirty Parts in which Richardson 's Dictionary is to be comprised , have reached this country . We have had the opportunity to examine them , and have availed ourselves of it , as far as our avocations would permit . We do not despair of a great dictionary of the English language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so freely remarked ; hut we do not wish it to appear before the two living authors have reaped a generous reward for their Herculean labors . The materials for such a work are varied and copious . In regard to the vocabulary , it would he found that not a few words might well he discarded . A consistent , welldefined system should he adopted , and strictly applied in this part of the work , particularly in respect to compounded words , and technical and foreign words . The definitions already furnished , though they should be scrutinized with critical severity , // afford great opportunities for selection and choice ; and whatever modifications they might require , they are still such as to save much of the labor , that would he required to prepare them wholly from one 's own reading and recollection arid etymological learning . Much the same may he said of the rich illustrations of words by examples , in Johnson 's and Richardson 's Dictionaries . These may he greatly abridged , and probably better ones sometimes substituted ; hut similar examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has existed for centuries past , can not be spared . It is one of the most effectual means of preserving the beauty and idiomatic purity of the English tongue . Though it is not from a dictionary , as some seem to think , that we are to get a full knowledge of language , yet he must be singularly learned , who has never occasion to resort to it , in order to learn sometlung that he never knew , or to recall what he has forgotten , or to clear up that of which he is doubtful . And though we are no perfectionists , even in regard to that kind of learning whose boundaries seem to be well defined , yet we greet with the highest joy and gratitude , those who approximate most nearly to what we deem perfection in an arduous literary undertaking.
