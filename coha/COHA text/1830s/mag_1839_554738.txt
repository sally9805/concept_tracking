txt IN a late number of our Journal , while treating of the early discoveries in the West , * we had occasion to speak of the Travels of Father Henne*in . It is well known , that , from the first publication of these Travels , the author 's veracity , on certain points , has been more than doubted . In the article above alluded to , we expressed our opinion , after a pretty thorough investigation of the subject , that these doubts were well founded , and that the pretended discoveries // of Father Hennepin below the mouth of the Illinois river were unworthy of credit . His narrative of a voyage down the Mississippi , we believed , and still believe , to have been fabricated in Europe , several years after he left America . A writer in the " Democratic Review " has assumed the other side of the question , and undertaken to relieve the memory of Hennepin from the burden of these charges . He endeavours to answer some of our objections , and seems to look to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he has brought forward any facts , which had not already passed under our notice , or that he has removed any of the obstacles , which stand in the way of the credibility of Hennepin 's narrative . He has accumulated probabilities , to which due weight should be allowed , though , for reasons which we gave in treating the subject , they do not satisfy our minds . He points out no error in our statements , and neither produces new testimony , nor new materials of any kind , which , in our opinion , affect the merits of the question . He is so far from referring to any book which we had not consulted , that , for any thing that appears , he obtained most of his facts from our article . As to Ellicott and Stoddard , whom he finds fault with us for not mentioning with sufficient consideration , we did precisely that which these writers failed to do ; that is , we compared the two works of Hennepin together , and the supposed spurious one with that attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a previous occasion , we had referred to the latter , were also fully stated by us. * So far from leaving any room for doubt , whether we were acquainted with Charlevoix 's objections to it , we expressly cited and canvassed those objections . t And as to another fact , in respect to which the writer in April finds occasion for a rebuke to us , we had ourselves recorded it in January , in the paper on which he was commenting ; - we refer to Tonti 's not being known to have returned to France , after his departure from it with La Salle. * The editors of the " Democratic Review " suggest their intention of investigating the subject to a greater length and , when this task shall be executed , we shall not be reluctant to recur to it , should they succeed in collecting additional facts . The subject , being one merely of historical inquiry , should be discussed without prejudice or bias , and with no other aim than that of arriving at the truth . In this spirit we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . t Ibid. pp. 81 , 82. * . Arortli . flmericare Review , Vol . XLVIII . p . Si . * Ibid. p. 97. // In reviewing the writer 's statements , however , we can not forbear to express our surprise , that he should have so entirely overlooked the voyage of Father Marquette from the Wisconsin to the Arkansas , about which there is no question , and which was performed seven years before Hennepin saw the Mississippi . He lays much stress on Hennepin 's map , and speaks of it as follows . " Hennepin gives a map of the country , till then unknown , from Florida to the South Sea , and traces the Mississippi considerably below the point to which La Salle authorized him to go below the Illinois , and beyond which its course was so utterly unknown , that La Salle himself hoped to reach China by it . In this map , nevertheless , Hennepin continues the course of the river , by a dotted line , to the Gulf of Mexico , fully intimating his knowl-. edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired by La Salle was communicated to Europe . " Now this map was published in 168*3 , ten years after Marquette 's voyage , the particulars of which were well known in Canada , as Joliet , the companion of Marquette , remained there . Moreover , Marquette 's narrative , accompanied by a map of the Mississippi from the Wisconsin to the Gulf of Mexico , was published at Paris , in 1681 , two years before the publication of Hennepin 's map . It is likewise to be observed , that Marquette 's map is remarkable for the accuracy with which the rivers and other conspicuous objects are delineated . Where is the wonder , then , that Hennepin , with this map before him , should be able to construct another map , in which the same objects are delineated Again , the writer says ; " A singular feature in the whole matter is , the absence of authentic information respecting the discovery of the Mississippi until 1697 . No trace of any account of it occurs in any remarks that we have met , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before this date , Marquette had not only discovered the Mississippi , but had sailed down its waters from the Wisconsin to the Arkansas , a distance of more than one thousand miles ; and , stxteen years before , the account of these discoveries had been published in Paris In the same tone , the writer adds ; " Hennepin transferred to the literature and language of the old world , the Indian name of the great Mississirri , the hoary father of waters , which he first explored . " An extraordinary assertion ; as Marquette had called the river constantly by that name , and affixed the name to " the hoary father of waters in his map . The writer also speaks of " Hennepin 's name of // Illinois , " although Marquette had both mentioned this name , and explained its meaning in the Indian language . From these remarkable oversights , we should infer , that the writer had never heard of Marquette 's narrative , if he did not allude to it in a way that leads the reader to suppose he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been better for him to spare such broad assertions , till he had thoroughly possessed himself of facts , and examined all the bearings of his subject . As they now stand , they essentially wenken his argument , and create the suspicion , that , if he could fall into such grave errors in one branch of the discussion , he may not be free from them in others . If this is a specimen of the accuracy , with which the editors propose to pursue their inquiries , it is to be feared , that their results will not contribute much to increase our stock of historical knowledge . Before they proceed further , we recommend to them a careful perusal of Marquette 's narrative , and an inspection of his map , and we apprehend they will find there the substance of nearly all such particulars , contained in Hennepin 's description of the lower Mississippi , as could not be easily supplied by a fertile imagination . Nor is it the least of Hennepin 's delinquencies , that , even in his first work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had preceded him in a large part of his actual discoveries on the upper Mississippi . The writer in the " Democratic Review " desires us to give further information relative to the map of Tonti , referred to by us . We wish we had it to give . But he will see , on a more careful reading , that , so far from professing to have seen the map in question , we expressly referred to Mitchell 's preface to Joutel 's " Journal , " as authority for our description , and added , that " the only original copy of the Journal , published as by Tonti , which we have seen , ( that in Harvard College Library , ) has no map . " * On the other hand , what could this writer have had in his mind , when he suggests , that the map , thus referred to by Mitchell , must have been contained in the reprint of Tonti , given in the " Recueil de Voyages au Nord " ? Mitchell 's edition of Joutel was printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recueil " earlier than this ? Was there any till twenty years later On the latitude given by Tonti , the " 1 ) emocratic Review , * says , an important point in the controversy turns . If the controversy respecting Hennepin 's veracity be meant , we do not see how that latitude affects the question . There is // no doubt , that Hennepin 's latitude , and description , of the mouth of the Mississippi , are more correct than that of the work ascribed to Tonti ; nor is the authenticity of that work upheld by us . We referred to his supposed map , incidentally , in speaking of our reasons for rejecting Charlevoix 's general denunciation of his Journal . We do not suppose that Hennepin got his latitude from Tonti , for it agrees neither with his text nor the map mentioned by Mitchell.
