txt We notice this book with no little pleasure , as a new illustration of the great benefits to be reasonably expected from the formation of societies , having for their object the collection and preservation of the materials of history . Without doubt much has already been lost , in this country as in all others , which such associations might have rescued in due time ; but much , also , has been searched out , simplified , systematized and put on record , for the good and the gratification of other ages . It speaks well for the future , as well as the present works of the Maine Society , that its list of members comprises the names of a great number of the ablest and most distinguished citizens of the State , not a few of whom have heretofore done much for the interests of science . The history of Portland , occupying half this volume , has been drawn up by Mr. Willis of that place , with remarkable accuracy and clearness . The contributions which come from the manuscripts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of Indian literature , will be read , perhaps we should say studied , with peculiar interest . A mass of additional information , we are happy to perceive , is to be expected from the same source , upon the same subjects . The native tribes of Maine ,  --  with the exception of the far-famed Tarratines , and the Narantsouacks or Norridgewocks , while connected with Father Rall* ,  --  have as yet made little figure in history ; but we have long been satisfied , from personal investigation , as well as general and analogous reasoning , that many interesting facts respecting them may be hereafter disclosed . The movements of the Maine Society , in this department , will be observed with more than ordinary solicitude . Under the title placed at the head of this article , we have heretofore * enlarged upon the lives and characters of some of the most distinguished individuals , who have appeared among the North American natives . The present seems to us a favorable opportunity , for pursuing farther inquiries of the same nature . While the materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and quite as satisfactory , in point of quantity * See No. 73 , N. A. Review . // and quality , as they are likely to be at any future period , a stronger interest than usual is felt in every thing which relates to the Indians . And there is reason for such an interest . A great crisis has arrived in the relations existing between the tribes of that remarkable race , and the civilized and Christian population , which presses upon their borders . The passions of the public mind are excited for and against them . Avarice and ambition look with an eager eye upon the fertile territories , where their last remnants yet linger about the haunts of their childhood and the graves of their fathers . Then philanthropy interferes ; new and old plans of civilization and amalgamation are brought forward . Then pride is roused , and prejudice exasperated . But , meanwhile , the rights of the people , who occasion all this excitement , and the respect consequently due to them , must come to be discussed . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially their collective and individual competency for civilized jife , are involved ; arid here it is , that history and biography should be made to render their services , it is not speculation or theory that is needed ,  --  but facts , plain facts . It has often occurred to us , that the latter of the two departments of Indian literature just named , has been singularly overlooked . Journals , and travels , and narratives , and publications of almost every other name arid nature , have been filled , year after yea r ,  --  from the period of Father Hennepin 's first journey among the Illinois , down to the last doleful , catch-penny sketch of the last captive among the barbarous and bloody heathen , ' - with delineations of the Indian manners , customs and institutions . The ablest philologists of Europe and America have made their languages the study of years . Others have devoted themselves to investigations respecting their origin , their antiquities , their history ; and in all these departments has philosophy been amply remunerated for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biography has been forgotten ? Why have no lives been given , or attempted to be given , of the great men and the wise men of this singular race ,  --  their orators and conquerors , patriots and prophets ? Why is so little known , when so much might be known , of Pontiac and Uncas , of Piskaret , of Garangula and Logan ? Had such men lived in civilized society , their achievements and their eloquence would have occupied volumes of eulogy . Why , under circumstances which only make them more remarkable and more admirable , should their // memories be given over utterly to oblivion ? Alas ! their armor was the tomahawk , and not the lance . They wore the blanket for the toga . They painted with vermilion instead of roug*e . The name of Tecumseh* is comparatively familiar to modern readers , for the same obvious reason , that King Philip was like a household word , a century and a half ago . But his character , we conceive , has been often misunderstood and mis- represented . The means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions ; but the relations existing between the two races , and between individuals belonging to them , especially during his life-time , have had a tendency to create prepossessions , and to conceal facts . Such was the fortune of Philip himself ; and though the change which has taken place since his time in the situation of the country , made Tecumseh a much less terrible , and therefore less obnoxious enemy , than the Sachem of Pokanoket ,  --  this very circumstance , on the other hand , has probably had its effect in disparaging the reputation of the former . Philip lived at a period , and among a people , which gave him some prospect of success . But Tecumseh 's exertions were hopeless . He was feared too little to he duly appreciated , as the other was feared too much . He was contemned , comparatively , as the other was l ) ated . As Tecumseh was by birth a member of the Kisk6poke tribe of the Shawaneet nation , a brief account of this somewhat celebrated community will not be considered irrelevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shawanees personally , as well as by reputation , for many years , calls them a courageous , high-spirited , and manly people ; and more careful in providing a supply of ammunition to keep in reserve for an emergency , than any other nation be ever heard of . ' These remarks are decidedly confirmed by their history . As their * The Indian pronunciation of this word is Tecumth6 . It has been sometimes written Tecumtha , and sometimes Tecumsah ; but the orthography adopted in the text is the most common . * This ill-fated word has been subject to even more than the ordinary liberties , exercised upon Indian terms . The vernacular plural , we suppose , is Shawanock or ShawaneOk ; but almost every foreign writer has invented his own combination . Heckewelder has it Shawanos , and Sawanos ; the latter being the name generally given them by other tribes . Others use Shawanoes , Shawannoes , Shawanese ; and still more , Shawonoese . All these are derived from the Delaware word Shawaneu , meaning South , and referring to the origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they came originally from the south ; and the oldest individuals of the *Johican tribe , their elder brother , told Mr. Heckewelder , that they dwelt in the neighborhood of Savannah in Georgia , and in the Floridas . They were a restless people , ' we are further informed , delighting in wars ; ' and in these they were so constantly engaged , that their neighbors ,  - -  the Cherokees , Choctaws , Creeks , Yamassees , and other powerful tribes ,  --  finally formed a league , offensive and defensive , for the express purpose of expelling them from the country . But the Shawanees were too wise to contend with such an enemy , and they adopted the more prudent policy of asking permission to leave their territories peaceably , and migrate noi*thward . This favor being granted them , their main body settled upon the Ohio ; some of them as far up as where the French afterwards built Fort Duquesne ,  --  now Pittsburg ,  - -  others , about the forks of the Delaware , and a few even upon the site of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their belligerent disposition manifested itself among their new acquaintances . Those who remained on the Ohio becoming numerous and powerful , it was not long before they crossed the Alleghany mountains , and fell upon a settlement of the Delawares , on the Juniata ,  --  of which very people , their grandfather , * they had solicited peace and protection , through the interposition of the Mohicans , on their first arrival in the country . Murders were committed , plunder was carried off , and a war ensued . As soon as this was fairly off their hands , they engaged in the French war , which broke out in 1755 , against the English . That being terminated in 1763 , and the tribe being elated by its increased numbers , and by the strong confederacy now established between themselves and the Delawares , they commenced hostilities against the Cherokees . In the course of this war , the latter occasionally pursued the aggressors into the Delaware territories , and thus that nation was aroused again . The union of forces which ensued , added to the already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Cherokees , and in 1768 , they solicited and oh- * A title given to this ancient people , by about forty other tribes . The Mohicans were called the Elder Brother , because their separation from the parent stock was one of the most ancient , of which the tradition was distinctly preserved . Following the same principle , the Delawares themselves have uniformly given the title of Uncle to the Wyandots ; thus acknowledging their seniority over all other tribes . // tamed a peace . Owing chiefly to the influence of the Delawares , the Shawanees were now kept quiet for the unusually long term of six years , when they were involved in a war with the people of Virginia ,  --  then comprising Kentucky ,  --  occasioned by the noted murders committed upon Logan 's relations and others , hy white people . The burning of some of their villages had scarcely driven them to a sort of truce with this new enemy , when the war of the Revolution commenced , in which they allied themselves with the English , and continued openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous victory and treaty of General Wayne , in 1795 . It seems to he universally understood , that their reputation , as warriors , suffered nothing during all this long series of hostile operations . The first settlers of Kentucky were molested and harassed by them , more than hy any other tribe . Boone , who was taken captive by them , in 1778 , saw four hundred and fifty of their warriors mustered at one place ,  --  still called Chilicothe ,  --  ready for a foray among the white settlements , which soon after ensued . Marshall , in his History of Kentucky , gives the particulars of an expedition against them , the season after this , in which many of the best men in the country were privates ; ' the invaders were defeated and driven off , and nearly two hundred of them pursued , with considerable loss , by ahout thirty of the Shawanees . Of all the Indians who had been marauding in the country , ' the same writer observes elsewhere , the Shawanees had been the most mischievous , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the History of the Mission of United Brethren among the North American natives , represents the tribe in question as the most savage of the Indian nations . ' An incident , showing the disposition which they manifested , even at this period , ( 1773 ) towards their American neighbors , may throw some light upon their character , and upon subsequent events . The celebrated missionary Zeisberger visited some of their settlements , during the year last named , in the hope of establishing a mission among them . At one of their villages , he met with the head chief of the tribe . The latter gave him his hand and addressed him ; This day , ' said he , the Great Spirit has ordered that we should see and speak with each other , face to face . ' He then entered into a long detail of the practices of the white people , describing their manner of deceiving the Indians , and finally affirmed that they // were all alike ,  --  all hypocrites and knaves . The missionary made some reply to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white people , ' adds Loskiel , that brothei* Zeisberger 's exhortation seemed to have little weight with him . He at length gave the preacher permission to visit the other Shawanese towns , taking care to suggest , as a parting word of comfort , that he must rely upon having his brains 1 ) eat out very speedily . Thirty years previous to this , when Count Zinzendorff himself went among the Wyoming Shawanees to convert them , they rewarded that pious pilgrim for his labor of love , by conspiring to murder him ; but by a fortunate accident , he escaped safe from their hands . On the whole , setting aside for the present the history of this nation for the last thirty years , during which we have suffered most from them , it would seem that a more warlike or more hostile people has scarcely existed upon the continent . Where , rather than here , should we look for the birth and education of the modern Philip , and when , rather than at the stormy period of the Revolution ? Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress ( in 1780 , ) were expelling them westward from the river Scioto , and burning their villages behind them , the young hero , who afterwards kindled the flame of war upon the entire frontier of the States , by the breath of his own single spirit , was learning his first lessons of vengeance amid the ruins of his native land , and in the blood of his countrymen . His native land , we say , for it is tolerably well ascertained that he was born on the banks of the Scioto , near Chilicothe . His father , who was a noted Shawanee warrior , fell at the battle of Kenawa , while Tecumseh was yet a mere boy . His mother is said by some to have been a Shawanee , and by others a Creek ; but he is understood himself to have told a gentleman at Vincennes , in 1810 , that she was a Cherokee , who had been taken prisoner in a war between that nation and the Shawanees , and adopted , according to Indian custom , into a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lake. * This account is confirmed by the circumstance of this woman having migrated into the Cherokee territory in advanced age , and died there . The totem of her tribe is said to have been a turtle , and that of the father 's a tiger . * Note to Schoolcraft 's Travels , page 138 . Mr. S. has given some interesting information respecting Tecumseh , from authorities of which he was personally assured . // From all the information which can now be gathered respecting the early years of Tecumseh , it appears that he gave striking evidence in his boyhood of the singular spirit , which characterized him through life . He was distinguished for a steady adherence to principle , and generally to that of the best kind . He prided himself upon his temperance and his truth , maintaining an uncommon reputation for integrity , and , what is still rarer among his countryn ) en , never indulging in the excessive use of food or liquor . He would not marry until long afier the customary period ; and then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends , he seems to have connected himself with an old woman , who was perhaps not the handsomest or most agreeable lady in the world , but who nevertheless bore him one child , his only offspring . With this exception , he adopted in his matrimonial life certain practices of the sect of Shakers , whose principles , as is well known , were afterwards so strenuously promulgated by his brother , the Prophet , that a certain prime functionary in that denomination gave him the credit of being as good a disciple as himself. * Whether there was an express concert or actual co-operation between the two , at this early period , respecting this or any other project or policy in which they subsequently engaged together , does not appear to be positively ascertained . It is not to be supposed , that any remarkable achievements of the young warrior in his first battles , should be preserved on record . The Shawanees relate , that he made his debut in an engagement with the Kentucky troops , which took place on the banks of Mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ungallantly turned right-about-face , and made the best of his way from the field , with all possible diligence , and that too while one of his brothers stood his ground with the other Indians , and fought till he was wounded and carried off . It must be admitted , that this was not so creditable a proceeding as may be conceived ; but the extreme youth of the party goes some way to explain , as his subsequent conduct did to excuse it . But from this time , whatever might be his animal courage , he was never known to shrink . Indeed , previously to the treaty of Greenville , ( in 1795 ) when he was probably about twenty-five years of age , he is said to have signalized himself so much , as to have been reputed one of the boldest of the Indian warriors . No // individual was more regularly engaged in those terrible incursions , by which the first settlers of Kentucky were so much harassed ; and few could boast of having intercepted so many boats on the Ohio river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was sometimes pursued , but never overtaken . If the enemy advanced into his own country , he retreated to the banks of the Wabash , until the storm had passed by ; and then , just as they were laying aside the sword for the axe and ploughshare , swooped down upon them again in their own settlements . It goes to show the disinterested generosity always ascribed to him , that , although the booty collected in the course of these adventures must have been very considerable in quantity and value , he rarely retained any portion of it for his own use . His ruling passion was the love of glory , as that of his followers was the love of gain ; and of course a compromise could always be effected between them , to the perfect satisfaction of both parties . He was a feudal baron among boors . It remained for subsequent occasions , then little dreamed of , to show that his temperament , like his talent , was even better adapted to the management of a large engagement , than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at an epoch in his life , when it is no longer possible to give his own history to much advantage , but by connecting with it that of his celebrated brother , the prophet already mentioned . The name of this personage was Elskwhtawa. * He and Tecumseh , and still another , Kumsh&amp;ka , were the offspring of the same mother at the same birth . Probably there was an understanding between the three , at an early date , respecting the great plans which the prophet and the orator afterwards carried into execution ; but as we hear little or nothing of the subsequent co-operation of Kumshhka , it may be presumed that he did not live ,  --  employment would certainly have been found for him , if he had . It has been said , that it was about the year 1806 , when his two brothers first conceived their design of uniting all the Western Indians in a war against the Americans . But it appears to us probable , that the main project was older than this , although the minutice of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . * Meaning , says Mr. Schoolcraft , a fire that is moved from place to place . Elsewhere we find him called Olliwayshila , on good authority . A compromise may be effected , by suggesting that he assumed various names at various periods . // Whether it was Tecumseh 's alone , or the Prophet 's alone , in the first instance ,  --  or the result of the joint deliberations of the two , can not now be determined . The better opinion , perhaps , favors the first theory ; with the qualification , however , that the Prophet was for many years the only and intimate confidant , and probably on many occasions the counsellor of his brother . He contented himself , at all events , with being a subordinate actor in the play , from first to last , though he was by no means an insignificant one . It has been very generally underst6od , that either this man 's brain was affected by some accident , or that he had the good fortune to be naturally possessed of a certain species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the Indians hold in peculiar esteem . This may have been true , but we think the probabilities of the case are in favor of a different supposition ,  --  to wit ,  --  that his frenzy was feigned ; and that his brothei ' instigated and instructed him to make an important use of it , in the promotion of the grand scheme , which was secretly exercising the ingenuity and fostering the ambition of both . It goes against the former theory , that those who are best acquainted with Elskwhtawa , and especially such as knew him personally , were the least suspicious of any deficiency in his intellect . Take the evidence of General Harrison , for example , who had repeated opportunities of closely scrutinizing his conduct and conversation . The author of the Life of that gentleman , published at Cincinnati in 1828 , in speaking of a visit of a fortnight from the Prophet , in August , 1808 , observes , that the Governor discovered him to be possessed of considerable talents . ' Again , his astonishment was excited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians . ' It could by no possible means be gathered from his language , whether he was or was not under British influence . That point , indeed , never was ascertained satisfactorily by any American ; and so far was General Harrison in particular from gaining it , that his biographer frankly admits him to have been completely deceived ' by this fellow 's ' profound subtilty , notwitlistanding both the special prejudice be had previously formed against him , and the general knowledge he l ) ossessed of Indian cunning and duplicity . All this , we say , with the entire mass of evidence of the same kind , which might be produced , goes strongly against // the theory of the Prophet 's having been a man of inferior intellect . On the other hand , there are many circumstances to corroborate a different impression , one of the strongest of which is the very part which he acted as Prophet . So far as we can judge , that was precisely the course , of ' all others , calculated to advance most surely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a belligerent union of the tribes . No principle in the Indian character has been more thoroughly or more universally ascertained , than their excessive superstition . Hence the great influence , which has always and every where been exercised over them by their most talented , though sometimes unprincipled men , under the various titles of ' powahs , jugglers , sorcerers , physicians , wizards , and prophets , by every conceivable method of imposture . The American impostors are not behindhand with any , in this point ; and as by chance , ( if we will not allow the devil any share in it , ) they sometimes happen to divine or guess pretty right , they acquire by this a great reputation ; they are reckoned genii of the first order . ' Thus it was in Charlevoix 's time . Heckewelder dwells more at length upon this weakness in the American native . It sinks him down , ' is his language , this childish apprehension of an occult and unknown power , to the level of the most fearful and timid being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confession of a sorcerer to an intimate English acquaintance , respecting the secret of his management . Such was the credulity of this man 's countrymen , according to his own testimony , that if he only picked a little wool from his blanket , and rolled it between his fingers into a small round hall , that was sufficient to establish his reputation . A general apprehension was excited among his spectators ; and if at that moment , he happened to cast so much as a side-glance at any particular man , the victim was at once selected , convicted , and executed . in ninetynine cases out of one hundred , he would sooner or later perish under the terror inflicted thus by his own credulity . So much for the general feasibility of the Prophet 's plan . The mintttia ? of it furnish still better evidence of his shrewdness . It will be sufficient for our present purpose , to remark upon these so far , as to show them to have been such as were best adapted to effect the grand political objects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . He inculcated , in the first place , that a radical reform was necessary in // the manners of the red people . This was proved , by enlarging upon the evils which had ensued from the neighborhood of the whites , ... - tbe imitation of their dress and manners , the introduction of ardent spirits , diseases , contentions , and wars ; by the vast diminution of the means of subsistence , and the narrowed limits of territory to which they were now hemmed in , and by other considerations of the most irritating , as well as plausible kind , the force of which was not at all lessened by occasional comment on particular transactions , and glowing references to the long , peaceful and happy lives of their forefathers . This point being gained , and a favorable excitement produced , the next thing in order was his own commission from the Great Spirit . This was authenticated by the astonishrng miracles he was able to perform , and still more , by the great benefits he was able to confer on his followers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be no more fighting between the tribes , . - *they were brethren . They were to abandon the use of ardent spirits , and to wear skins , as their ancestors had done , instead of blankets . Steak . ing , quarrelling , and other immoral modern habits were denounced . Injunctions of minor importance seem to have been enforced , merely with a view to test the pliability of savage superstition , to embarrass the jealous scrutiny of those who opposed or doubted , and to establish a superficial uniformity , whereby the ttue believers should be readily distinguished . The policy of the more prominent tenets can not be mistaken . Just in proportion to their observance , they must inevitably promote the independence of the Indian nations , first , by dimin-. ishing their dependence upon the whites , and secondly , by increasing their intercourse and harmony with each other . In addressing himself to such subjects , with such a system , Elskw&amp;tawa could hardly fail of success . For some years , indeed , his converts were few ; for great as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises over his ignorant countrymen , when his reputation is once fairly acquired , it is by no means so easy an undertaking , to acquire it in the outset . The extent and permanence of his success , in fact , are more conclusive as to his talent , than the mere conception and adoption of the policy . This was comparatively commonplace , and a common-place personage might undertake it . Mr. Tanner , who published , a year or two since , a very interesting narrative of his residence of thirty years among the In. ' // dians , has given incidental sketches of as many as three or four pretenders . Some of them were laughed at for their pains . Others obtained a temporary credence ; but we hear nothing of them beyond a year or two . Elskwf*tawa was at this very period extending his reputation from tribe to tribe , over the whole West . Difficulties and discouragements were encountered by him ; but he nevertheless persevered and prevailed . His first establishment consisted of about one hundred warriors of his own tribe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conciliated , by preaching up the superiority of the Shawanees over every other people under Heaven . This doctrine , however , was not calculated for general use ; and the prophet had scarcely collected his partisans around him at Greenville , when his efforts to add to their number from other tribes ,  --  and upon other grounds , of course ,  --  compelled him to modify his theory so much , that about half of his own countrymen deserted him . But their place was soon supplied by stragglers , who came in from various quarters . In June , 1807 , the United States ' agent at Fort Way*ne wrote to General Harrison , then governor of Indiana Territory , that not fewer than fifteen hundred Indians had passed that station , on their way to hear the preaching of the Shawanese Prophet . In the course of this season , the effects of his exhortations became so palpable , as to excite some apprehension among the white settlements on the frontiers . Suspicious movements were visible among the Kickapoos , and among portions of the Potawatamies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Greenville to Tippecanoe , on the upper part of the Wabash , and his disciples followed in his train . During the next year , rumors of war became prevalent , and though the preacher had a little before this been nearly deserted , he was now reported to have more than one thousand individuals under his entire control . The Wyandots , and many of the Winebagoes had joined him ; and the warlike Sacs and Foxes followed soon afterwards . Meanwhile , murders and other outrages are said to have taken place in the vicinity of the Prophet 's settlement . A general alarm existed *tnong the whites , throughout Indiana and Illinois . *ikasures had already been taken , under the immediate charge of Governor Harrison , for the defence of the frontiers ; and of Vincennes in particular , where the first onset of the enemy was expected . The attention of the General Government itself was by this time so much aroused , that a proposal // from the President to make prisoners of both Tecumseh and his brother was suspended , only that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise with the disaffected tribes . Early in 1811 , the Indian force mustered at Tippecanoe was larger , than Governor Harrison himself could easily collect ; and the body-guard of Tecumseh , on the visit which he paid the former at Vincennes , in July of this season , consisted of more than three hundred men . This meeting took place ostensibly in consequence of a speech , which the Governor had sent to the brothers at their encampment on the Wabash , in June . He had taken that occasion to repeat his former comolaints of the insults and injuries he supposed to have been offered to American citizens , by Indians under their influence ; to inform them that he had heard of their recent attempts to hasten hostilities between the Union and various Indian tribes ; andy finally , to remind them in strong terms , of the consequences of persisting in this conduct . Brothers ! - was one of the expressions in this speech ,  --  ' I am , myself , of the Long-knife fire . As soon as they hear my voice , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as numerous as the mosquitoes on the shores of the Wabash . Brothers ! take care of their stings . ' Tecumseh promptly replied to this communication , by promising to visit the Governor in precisely eighteen days , for the purpose of ' washing away all these bad stories . ' Some delay occurred ; but upon Saturday , the 27th of July , he made his appearance at Vincennes , with his three hundred followers . As neither the Governor nor the inhabitants generally were desirous of prolonging his entertainment , it was proposed to commence the negotiations on Monday ; but this he declined doing , and it was late on Tuesday before he made his appearance , at the arbor prepared for the occasion . Nor did he then come , without taking the precaution to ascertain previously , whether the Governor was to be attended by armed men at the council ,  --  if so , he should adopt the same etiquette . Being left to his own option , and given to understand that his example would be imitated , he came with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bows and arrows , and others with knives , tomahawks , and war-clubs . The Governor , on the other hand , was attended by a full troop of dragoons , dismounted , and completely furnished with fire-arms ; and he had taken care , on Tecumseh 's first arrival , to secure the town , by sta // 442 April , tioning two foot companies and a detachment of cavalry in the outskirts . He placed himself in front of his dragoons ; Tecumseh siood at the head of his tawny hand , and the conference was commenced with a speech on the part of the Governor . This was briefly replied to ; but a heavy rain coming on , matters remained in statu quo , until the next day , when Tecumseh made a long and ingenious harangue , both exposing and justifying his own schemes , much more openly than he had ever done before . Respecting the demand which the Governor had made , that two Pocawatamie murderers should be given up to punishment , who were stated to be resident at Tip .. pecanoe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there ; and then went on very deliberately to show , that he could not deliver them up if they were there . It was not right , ' he said , to punish those people . They ought to be forgiven , as well as those who had recently murdered his people in the illinois . The whites should follow his own example of forgiveness ; he had forgiven the Ottawas and the Osages . Finally , he desired that matters might remain in their present situation , and especially that no settlements should be attempted upon the lands recently purchased of certain tribes , until he should return from a visit among the Southern Indians . Then , he would go to Washington , and settle all difficulties with the President ; and meanwhile , as the neighboring tribes were wholly under his direction , he would despatch messengers in every quarter to prevent further mischief . ' He concluded with offering the Governor a quantity of wampum , as a full atonement for the murders before mentioned . The latter made an indignant rejoinder ; the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few followers , soon afterwards commenced his journey down the Wabash for the southward . Such was the last appearance of Tecumseh , previously to the war . The popular excitement now became greater than ever . Meetings were held , and representations and resolutions forwarded to the Federal Executive . But before these documents could reach their destination , authority had been given to Governor Harrison , to commence offensive operations , if necessary , and forces , in addition to those under his territorial jurisdiction , were placed at his disposal . The banditti under the Prophet , ' says the secretary ,  --  Mr. Eustis ,  --  in a communication of July 20th , are to be attacked and vanquished , provided such a measure shall be rendered absolutely neces // sary . ' It is not our purpose to detail the subsequent measures of Governor Harrison , which terminated in the celebrated battle of Tippecanoe ; and much less , to agitste the question heretofore so inveterately contested , respecting the general propriety of the offensive operations he commenced , or his particular system or success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of November , 1811 ; the Governor having previously sent Indian messengers to demand of the various tribes in the Prophet 's encampment , that they should all return to their respective territories ; that the stolen horses in their and his possession , should be given up ; and that all murderers , then sheltered at Tippecanoe , should be delivered over to justice . The first messengers , about the last of September , had the effect of bringing out a friendly deputation from the Prophet , full of professions of peace . But fresh outrages were committed by his followers about the same time ; and , when sundry headmen of the Delaware tribe undertook , in October , to go upon a second mission , they are said to have been abruptly met by a counter deputation from the Prophet , requiring a categorical answer to the question , whether they would or would not join him against the United States ? ' The Delawares , nevertheless , Ivent on , and having visited the Prophet 's camp , returned to Governor Harrison , now on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insulted , and finally dismissed with contemptuous remarks upon themselves and the Governor . Twenty-four Miamies next volunteered to go upon this thankless business . They seem to have been better entertained , for the good reason , that they decided upon raising the tomahawk against their employer . At all events , these serviceable diplo. - matists spared themselves the pains of returning . The particulars of the battle are well known . The Governor having entered into the heart of the territory occupied by the Prophet ,  --  but claimed by the United States , as being purchased of those tribes who had the least disputed claim to it , he encamped on the night of the 6th , in the vicinity of the Prophet 's force ; and a suspension of hostilities was agreed upon between the two parties , until a conference could take place on the ensuing day . Whether , as the Prophet affirmed on this occasion by his messengers , he had sent a pacific proposal to the Governor , which accidentally failed to reach him ; or whether he was now actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself compelled to commence them , need not be // discussed . His forces , supposed to number from five hundred to eight hundred warriors , made a violent attack on the American army , early in the morning of the 7th ; and one of the most desperate struggles ensued , of which we have any record in the history of Indian warfare . The enemy was at length repulsed , leaving thirty-eight warriors dead on the field . The Americans lost about fifty killed , and about twice that number wounded . The Prophet 's town was rifled , and the army commenced its return to Vincennes . The sequel of the mere history of the two brothers , familiar as this portion of it is to all readers , may be soon told . Tecumseh , who was absent ,  --  at the South , as is generally believed ,  --  when the battle took place , returned soon afterwards , and without doubt was exceedingly surprised and mortified by the conduct of the Prophet . From this time , while the latter lost much of his influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether he had previously maintained a special understanding with the British , can not be positively decided ; but his subsequent course admits of little controversy . He proposed to Governor Harrison , to make the contemplated journey to Washington ; but , as the Governor expressed a determination that he should not go in the capacity which he deemed suitable to his standing , the idea was abandoned . Thenceforth , whatever his intentions had been , he determined upon the necessity of fighting ; and it naturally followed , whatever had been his disposition towards the British authorities , theirs towards him admits of no question ,  --  that he should no longer hesitate to avail himself of every fair opportunity of co-operation . In July , 1812 , Captain Wells wrote to Governor Harrison , from Fort Wayne , that Tecumseh had called there recently , on his way to Malden , to receive from the British Government twelve horse-loads of ammunition , for the use of his people at Tippecanoe . ' Immediately after this , he openly joined his new allies , became Brigadier-General Tecum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in raising and retaining the Indian forces . During the first months of the war , his whole time was devoted to recruiting . He was present , however , at the siege of Fort Meigs ; and upon the famous 5th of May , 1812 , commanded the co-operating savage force , on the south-east side of the river . At the second assault on Fort Meigs , in July , he was also present . Again , while the siege of Sandusky was going // on , we find him at the head of two thousand warriors , reconnoitring the position of General Harrison . In the decisive battle of the Moravian Towns , he commanded the right wing of the allied army , and was himself posted in the only part of it , which was engaged with the American troops . Here was his last struggle . Disdaining to fly , when all were flying around him but his own nearest followers , he himself pressed eagerly into the very heart of the contest , encouraging the savages by his voice , and plying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is said , directly upon Colonel Johnson , who was pressing forward , on the other side , at the head of his mounted infantry . Suddenly , a wavering was perceived in the Indian ranks . There was no longer a voice of command among them . Tecumseh had fallen , and his bravest and best men , still remaining , were disheartened and defeated by the same blow which prostrated him . That they did their share of fighting in this engagement fully appears from the fact , that thirty-three of them were found dead on the battle-ground ,  --  chieny near Tecumseh ,  --  and that many were slain in the pursuit , while the number of British killed was but twelve . It is much disputed , to whom belongs the honor of shooting Tecumseh ; upon which ,  --  as every body admits that he was shot ,  --  we shall spend but few words . In the language of a writer upon this question , there is a possibility , that he fell by a pistol-shot from the hand of Colonel Johnson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the Colonel was himself wounded ; ' and this is nearly all , we suppose , which can or need be said upon the subject . The British Government granted a pension to his widow and family , which probably continues to this day . The Prophet also was supplied in the same manner , from the close of the war until his death , which took place a few years since . The reputation of this man , as we have heretofore intimated of his brother , has suffered from the complete ultimate failure of his plans . It has suffered the more ,  --  particularly among his own countrymen ,  --  from the very circumstances which mark him as an extraordinary man ,  --  his career as a prophet . Tecumseh knew his own talents better , than to play a game like this : but he also knew , without doubt , that Elskw&amp;-tawa was capable of doing more for the advancement of their common object , by acting this co-ordinate or subordinate part , than by adopting the same course with himself , even had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were endowed with a complete system of qualities necessary to accomplish their design , but neither could act alone . Tecumseh was frank , warlike , persuasive in his oratory , popular in his manners , irreproachable in his habits of life . Elskw*ttawa had more cunning than courage ; and a stronger disposition to talk , than to fight , or exert himself in any other way . But he was subtle , fluent , persevering and self-possessed , and this was enough . He suddenly became an inspired man , and Tecumseh was his first convert . Possibly some others of their tribe were intrusted with the secret . They had , at all events , a great respect for these men , and being both a proud and warlike people , they received with avidity the well-contrived doctrine of their superiority over other tribes , and entered upon a course of projects , likely to produce war ,  --  rhough of war nothing might be yet seen or said ,  --  with the fury , and which we have very little doubt were generally committed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , and perhaps against his wishes . The young men , especially , who gathered about him , like the young men who brought on the war of King Philip , were wrought up till the master-spirit himself lost his control over them ; and to make the matter worse , most of them were of such a character , in the first instance , that horse-stealing and house-breaking were as easy to them as breathing . Like the refugees of Romulus , they were outcasts , vagabonds and criminals , in a gre at degree brought together by the novelty of the preacher 's reputation , by curiosity to hear his doctrines , by the fascination of extreme credulity , by restlessness , by resentment against the *vhites , and by poverty and unpopularity at home . These things should be taken into consideration , when the success of the Prophet is estimated . His ingenuity was tasked to the utmost , in getting and keeping these people together in the first place . Then it was necessary to instruct them just so far , as to put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to make them serviceable in collecting and convincing others , without committing the cause too unreservedly to noisy tongues , and to rash hands . Then , complaints were made by American authorities , and these must be pacified . Offers of assistance came in from other quarters , and // these must be kept secret . In a word , emergencies of every kind were occurring from day to day , which nothing , but the most ready invention and the shrewdest sagacity on the part of the two brothers , could have prevented from ruining the cause . As an instance in point , we may mention the circumstance that the chiefs of many Indian tribes were their strongest opponents . They were jealous or suspicious of the new pretenders , ridiculed and reproached them , and thwarted their exertions in every possible way . What was to be done with these persons ? Here was an opportunity for the peculiar genius of Elskwhtawa to exert itself , and he was not long at a loss . He availed himself of a new department of that unfailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of witchcraft was brought up . His satellites and scouts being engaged in all directions , in ascertaining who were , or were likely to be , his friends or his enemies , it was readily determined at head-quarters , who should he accused . Judge , jury and testimony were also provided with the same ease . He had already taken such means of gaining the implicit confidence of his vo*. taries , that his own suggestions were considered the best possible evidence , and the most infallible decision ; and the optics of his followers becoming every day more keen , upon his authority , there was no want of the most suitable convicts . When the excitement had grown to such a height as to ensure the success of his scheme , he went the length of declaring , that the Great Spirit had directly endowed him with the power of pointing out , not only those who were in full possession of the diabolical art , but those who were impregnated with the least tincture of the diabolical disposition ,  --  let them be old or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly satisfactory , he had only to speak the word ,  --  or , as Heckewelder expresses it , even to nod ,  --  and the pile was prepared for whomsoever he thought proper to devote . The Indians universally have an extreme horror of a wizard or a witch , which no reputation , rank , age , or services , are sufficient to counteract ; and of course , resistance or remonstrance on the part even of an accused chieftain , only went to exasperate , and to make more speedy , the sure destruction which awaited him . Among the sufferers , were a great sachem of the Delawares , and three of his staunch friends . Another eminent victim was the Wyandot chief , known by the English name of Leatherlips , // whose Indian appellation , Shateyaronrah , appears among the signatures to Wayne 's famous treaty of Greenville . He was sixty-three years of age , had sustained a most exemplary moral character , and was particularly attached to the American cause , as opposed to the English . The latter circumstance throws some light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence was ,  --  and probably the one constituted the other ,  --  orders were given to an influential chief of the same nation with the convict , in the Prophet 's service , who , with four other Indians , immediately started off in quest of him . He was found at home , and notified of the sentence which had been passed upon him . He entreated , reasoned and promised , but all in vain . The inexorable messengers of death set about digging his grave , by the side of hiswigwam . He now dressed himself with his finest war-clothes , and having refreshed himself with a hasty meal of venison , knelt down on the brink of the grave . His executioner knelt with him , and offered up a prayer to the Great Spirit in his behalf . This was the last ceremony . The Indians withdrew a few paces , and seated themselves around him on the ground . The old chief , ' says the original describer of this horrid scene , * inclined forward , resting his face upon his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the young Indians came up , and struck hint twice with the tomahawk . For some time , he lay senseless on the ground ; the only remaining evidence of life being a faint respiration . The Indians all stood around in solemn silence . Finding him to breathe longer than they expected , they called upon the whites one or two of whom were spectators , to take notice how hard he died ; pronounced him a wizard ,  --  no good ,  --  then struck him again , and terminated his existence . The office of burial was soon performed . ' We have given these particulars , disagreeable as they are , to illustrate more clearly the astonishing influence of the Prophet , as well as the means by which he obtained it . The executioners in this case were apparently sincere and conscientious men ; and one of the party was a brother of the victim . The proceeding just described , bears on the face of it such manifest marks of the Prophet 's style of doing business , as to have been attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge does no great injustice to his real character , appears // from many other well-authenticated transactions of a similar kind . Undoubtedly he was not , in all cases , without the advice of his brother ; but it appears probable , that the latter was in favor of milder measures ; and accordingly we find that , about the time when most of the Kickapoos joined the Indian Confederation , one of their leading men , a chieftain , opposed to the newfangled doctrine and policy of the brothers , was quietly disabled by being reduced to a private capacity . The same course was taken with the Winebagoes , one of the most warlike and highspirited tribes on the continent , and the most serviceable allies of the English in the late war . An Indian scout , sent to the Prophet 's encampment by an American authority in 1810 , to gain informt*tion of his designs , reported , that an old chief of that nation had told him , with tears in his eyes , ' that all the village chiefs had been divested of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warriors . This , we apprehend , may have been an amendment suggested by Tecumseh , upon an original scheme of the Prophet , of which the credit belongs wholly to himself ; and of which the authority just referred to was informed by a friendly Indian of high standing , but a month or two before this . It was a proposal to the young men of many of the tribes , to murder all their principal chiefs , at one heat . The pretext was ,  --  and it might have appeared a sufficient and righteous one in the mind of the Prophet ,  --  that these were the men , who bartered their lands away to the Americans for a song , and traitorously connived at the inroads and trespasses of the settlers . But whatever was the professed object of the plan , and whatever the real motive , both the audacity and the ingenuity which it indicates , are none the less worthy of notice . At other times , the handitti were reduced to an extreme scarcity of provisions , as might be expected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they led . At first , they were given to understand that corn and pumpkins would be raised for them supernaturally ; but the Prophet thought it might be easier to produce these essential articles by other means ; and here was another reason , for maintaining a good understanding with his American neighbors . In the spring of 1808 , such numbers of half-famished savages crowded about Fort Wayne , that it was considered necessary by the Governor , Harrison , to supply them with provisions , lest humger // might drive them to extremities ' * ..... a matter well understood by the Prophet . Soon afterwards , the latter gave out , that he proposed visiting the Governor at Vincennes , with the view of begging provisions ,  --  ' for the white people had always encour-* aged him to preach the word of God to the Indians . ' This purpose was carried into execution ; and it was upon this occasion , that the Governor was completely deceived , ' as we have seen , by the Prophet 's appearance and language . So lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wabash for the Prophet 's use , together with another quantity , intended for the Kickapoos and other Indians . He seems to have balanced some time between necessity and policy , on this occasion ; but he finally adopted the middle course of seizing upon the whole cargo , and sending a very civil apology to the Governor in payment . It might have been expected , that a man of his pretensions , with so many rivals and enemies , would be exposed to the hazard of assassination . But here again he was on his guard ; for it was always one of his strong positions , that the least violence offered to him or his followers , would be punished by the immediate interposition of the Great Spirit . The religious character , indeed , was sustained to the last . The Delaware messengers already mentioned found his forces at Tippecanoe in the highest state of excitement , owing to his magical rites , his harangues , and the war-dance which he performed with them day and night . Hence the unexampled bravery , manifested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very bayonets of our troops ; and in some instances , pressing aside the soldier 's musket , they brained him with the war-club . The Prophet , meanwhile , is said to have been comfortably seated on an adjacent eminence , singing a war-song . He had assured his followers , that the American bullets would do them no harm ; and that while they should have light , their enemies should be involved in thick darkness.t Soon after the battle commenced , he was told that the Indians were falling . Fight on ! fight on ! ' cried he , never at a loss , it will soon be as I predicted ; ' and he howled his war-song louder than ever . Undoubtedly he lost a good deal of his influence , by the event of the * Dawson 's Narrative , pp. 105-107. * He was not so much out of the way in this prediction , as in some others . McA fee observes , that the camp-fires , so long as they remained burning , were more serviceable to the Indians than our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally restored , and the misfoitune in this case was sagely attributed , by the multitude , to the important circumstance of his wife having touched some of his sacred utensils . Nothing but a series of triumphs on the part of the American forces , the death of his brother , and the loss of all his best friends of his own tribe , ( for the Kish6pokes were reduced to about twenty warriors during the war , ) finally de- ' stroyed his character as a prophet . When this was effected , it was human nature to degrade him below the level of a man . The death of his brother we have told ; and we come now to remark briefly upon a few prominent points , in the career and character of that distinguished chieftain . We have described Elskw&amp;tawa as ingenious and insinuating , with more assurance than energy , and more ambition than principle . Tecumseh , on the other hand , while he equalled the Prophet in the quickness of his faculties , far surpassed him in the intrepidity and dignity so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stable and legitimate influence . Elskw*tawa managed well the business which was given him ; but he was content to do it in secret , and glad to do it in safety ,  --  much as he overlooked from his mountain-seat the battle of Tippecanoe . Tecumseh , meanwhile , was ranging the continent from North to South , from East to West ; threatening , flattering , rousing resentment , alarming superstition , provoking curiosity ; - thus extending the limits of his grand Confederation , year by year , from tribe to tribe ; but slowly , calmly and in silence . No labor fatigued , no difficulty or disappointment disheartened , no danger alarmed , no emergency surprised him . It was by his means chiefly , that the extravagant stories of his brother 's supernatural power were propagated , so soon and so simultaneously as they were , among a hundred different tribes , sometimes by himself , and sometimes by his agents. * Hence , so early as 1807 , General * The most absurd stories were told and believed by the Indians , of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thought too great to be endured , to get a sight of him . ' - Mcslfee . This writer observes , elsewhere , that Tecumseh visited all the tribes west of the Mississippi , and on lakes Superior , Huron and Michigan , repeatedly , ' before the year 1811 . Soon after his return from the South , Tecumseh visited Fort Wayne . He still appeared haughty and obstinate in the opinions he had hitherto maintained , and even had the effrontery to demand ammunition of the commandant , which was refused him . He then said , that he would go to his British father , who would not refuse him ,  --  appeared thoughtful and sullen for a while ,  --  then turned on his // Harrison discovered , that the Shawanese tribe in particular were devoted to the British interest. ** Hence the strange movements , perceivable at the same period , among the various tribes of Indians around the lakes . They were assembling in council , day and night , and belts of wampum and pipes were sent in all directions , Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's settlement , than new forces were mustered . For four years , it has been truly said , Tecumseh was in constant motion ; to-day visible on the Wabash ; then heard of on the shores of Erie or Michigan , now among the Indians of the Mississippi . Finally , when every thing was effected in the North and West which he could effect there , he commenced a laborious and hazardous journey of months , among the remote tribes of the South . The train was laid everywhere but here ; and the subsequent trouble given by the Creeks ,  --  justly attributed to his influence ,  --  indicates sufficiently what might have been accomplished in time , had his confederates been as prudent as himself . The battle of Tippecanoe was a premature explosion , and a most unfortunate one for his interests . It intercepted the negotiations for new allies , diminished the moral power of the Prophet , and frightened and forced many , who were or would have been his adherents , into neutrality in some cases , and open hostility in others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all his solicitude and his labor was thrown into confusion , on the very brink of success . He was exasperated , humiliated , afflicted . He could have wept as Philip did , when his projects , so similar to Tecumseh 's , were thwarted in mid career by the rashness of his warriors . But here was the trial of his noblest qualities . He came forward and made every proposition , looking like compromise , which he deemed consistent with his dignity ,  --  perhaps necessary to it ,  --  hut in vain . He saw then , plainly , that the battle must be fought , and his soul grew strong . The wrongs and woes of his race , and the power and pride of the white men , passed before him . The mortification of failure and exposure on his own part , the dishonor brought upon his brother 's name , the ignominy of submission , the censure and scorn of his savage rivals , the triumph heel , raised the war-whoop , and went off. - Mc. **fee . We are obliged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident of our substantial correctness . * Dawson 's Narrative . // of his civilized enemy , all were daggers in his bosom . Then boiled within him the frenzy of despair . Then fear and hope struggled for the mastery . Pride , revenge , ambition , were roused . Let them come , then , thought he , I hear them and see them , in the South and in the East , like the summer leaves rolling and rustling in the breeze . It is well . Shall Tecumseh tremble ? Shall they say that he hated the white man , and feared him ? No ! The mountains and the plains which the Great Spirit gave , are behind and around me . I too have m*y warriors , and here ,  --  where we were born and where we will die ,  --  on the Scioto , on the Wabash , on the broad waters of the North , my voice shall he heard . Those who know any thing of the history of the last war , need not be informed , that Tecumseh was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of the Anglo-Indian Depart-. ment , and that greater forces were collected by his influence , and embodied under his command , than in any other instance from the first settlement of the country . He brought in si* hundred Wabash recruits in one body , early in 1813 . In the attack made upon Fort Stephenson , in the summer of the same year , the enemy numbered but five hundred British regulars , for eight hundred Indians , ( under Dickson ) while Tecumseh was at the same time stationed on the road to Fort Meigs with a body of two thousand more , for the purpose of cutting off the American reinforcements on that route . It should be observed , that only eighteen months before this , the disastrdus defeat of the savages atTippecanoe had restored the most profound tranquillity ' upon the whole line of the frontiers , where , previously , scarcely a fortnight passed without some depredation having been committed ; ' and that all the information received by Governor Harrison ,  --  who had better opportunities of receiving it than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prophet 's party. ** So , as lately as July , 1812 , we gather from the letter of Captain Wells to the Governor , already cited , that the Indians , who were under the British influence before that date , had all , with the exception of Teeumseh and about one hundred , abandoned their alliance , ' - owing in a considerable degree , we suppose , to the apprehensions excited by the expedition of General Hull . On the very day when this letter was written , the brother of Tecurnseh , our * Dawson 's Narrative , pp. 254 , 257 . TOL .

He will remain at his village , ' adds the writer , until he knows the intentions of the Western Indians . If they will not join him , he will then go and endeavor to save himself by pretensions of peace to the commissioners at Piqua . ' At this period , then , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or might not join the Americans , but as yet they had only abandoned the British . And yet , in a twelvemonth afterwards , Tecumseh was himself commanding a body of two thousand of them , and co-operating with eight hundred more under General Proctor ! So much for his energy and his influence . The minutia of his system of recruiting and retaining , we can not be expected to furnish . That he exerted himself personally , we have already seen : - that he plied also the industry of the Prophet , and that the latter personage was quite pliable , as well as in sane mind , appears from the following passages of the authentic and amusing communication , last referred to . On the 12th inst . July , 1812 , the Prophet arrived here , ( Fort Wayne ) with nearly one hundred Winebagoes and Kickapoos , who have ever since been amusing the Indian agent at this place with professions of friendship . It is now evident , that he has completely duped the agent , who had suffered him to take the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition , &amp;c. to support his followers , until they can receive a supply from Tecumseh . On the 19th inst. an express arrived in the Prophet 's camp , from Tecumseh . In order that it should make the better speed , the express stole a horse from some of the inhabitants of the river Raisin , and rode night and day . The horse gave out within twenty miles from this place . The express was directed by Tecumseh to tell the Prophet to unite the Indians immediately , and send their women and children towards the Mississippi , while the warriors should strike a heavy blow at the inhabitants of Vincennes ; that he , Tecumseh , if he lived , would join him in the country of the Winebagoes . The Prophet found no difficulty in keeping this information to himself and one or two of his confidential followers , and forming a story to suit the palate of the agent here ; and on the 20th inst. despatched two confidential Kickapoos to effect the objects Tecumseh had in view . In order that these two might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have gone // to the westward at the rate of one hundred miles in twenty-four hours , at least . To keep the agent blind to his movements , the Prophet went early in the morning , yesterday , and told the agent that two of his bad young men were missing , and that he feared they had stolen some horses ; the agent found no difficulty in swallowing the bait offered him , and applauded the Prophet for his honesty . To keep up appearances , the latter has this morning ( the 22d ) despatched two men on foot , as he tells the agent , to bring back my horses , &amp;c. , and that lie and his party will certainly attend the meeting of the commissioners at Piqua . This he will do , if he finds he can not raise the Western Indians . If he finds they will join him , he will strike a heavy blow , as Tecumseh calls it , against the whites in that quarter . You may rely on the correctness of this statement , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , from a quarter that can not be doubted . The conduct of the agent towards the Prophet , I have been an eye-witness to . ' It will be recollected , that Tecumseh had passed Fort Wayne about a week l ) previous to the date of this letter , on his way to MaIden . He then declared , that his object was to obtain ammunition from the British Government for the Judjails at Tippecanoe ; and it was understood accordingly , a few days afterwards , that while his brother was playing tricks upon the agent , he had openly connected himself with that Government , against the Americans . The whole transaction is character .. istic of the two individuals , who were the chief actors in it . The Prophet resorted , without hesitation , to all the wiles of Indian cunning and stratagem , for effecting his own purposes , and for thwarting those of his opponents . The course of Tecum seh was as manly and dignified , as it was prompt . It had been so , indeed , from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclose his schemes , he appears never to have taken much pains to conceal them . We know that he was subsequently suspected and accused , of having been actively engaged in inducing general hostility , as xveil as instigating par. * ticular outrages among the frontier tribes , for several years before much was actually known of him . This may have been the case , and it may not ; the evidence , so far as we have seen , amounts to nothing , and the suspicion and accusation alluded to , like the offences themselves , are very easily accounted for upon other and obvious grounds . Of course , there is no necessity of going at length into the histcry // of the Western country for the last half century , to point out the real grounds of complaint and the real provocations to hostility , which Tecumseh , or his brother , or any other Indian of information and reflection might have alleged on the part of the tribes , against the American Government or the American people . This would be justifying what we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juite enough had occurred , to lurnish plausible pretexts for all that the chieftain is known to have done or attempted to do . Governor Harrison stated in his annual message , for 1809 , to the indiana Legislature , that owing to defects in the Federal law , every person has been allowed to trade with the Indians that pleases ; whicl&amp; proves a source of numberless abuses , of mischievous effects , both to them and ourselves . ' Two years before , we find an opinion advanced by the same excellent authority on a similar occasion , that the utmost efforts to induce tl ) ern ( the Indians ) to take up arms would be unavailing , if one only , af the many persons who have committed murders on their people , could be brought to punishment . ' To illustrate the truth of this remark , we may mention the murder of a Creek Indian at Vincennes , early in 1810 , and of course subsequently to the particular transactions alluded to in the message . He was shot by a white man , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was intoxicated , had shown a disposition to do him some injury . The Governor discharged his ( luty by causing the Italian to be arrested and tried ; but , in the language of our informant , as in too many other cases , acquittal was the consequence. ** We are farther told , that about the same time , two Indians were wounded by a white man , at a few miles ' distance from Vincennes . The occurrence of circumstances of this natut e , is said to have been a source of great embarrassment and vexation to Governor Harrison ; but in this case , he could only send out-not a constable for the aggressor , for that course had been sufficiently tried ,  --  but a stirgeon for the wounded men , who both finally recovered . It can not he douhted , that the character of these proceedings was well understood , and indignantly resented by all the tribes which obtained knowledge of them ,  --  as most of them did in the course of their own experience . The house of a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sutnmer , by a mem // bet ' of the Delaware tribe , so famous for its faithful , and more than faithful adherence to the American cause . According to the stipulations of Wayne 's treaty , expressly provided for giving up criminals to the parties respectively injured ,  --  and scrupulously observed up to this date , we should add , on the part of the Indians ,  --  the robber in the present instance was demanded of the Delawares . The answer was , that the nation never would give up another man , until some of the white people were punished , who had murdered members of their tribe ; they would , however , punish him themselves . And tLey did accordingly put him to death . But all these were trifling causes of irritation , compared with those which had occurred at various periods , in the treaties and other negotiations , public and private , whereby immense quantities of territory had been obtained of the Indiaas . It is not intended to insinuate , that the Government was in fault upon any of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nat*ire , to such an extent , at such a distance , by the instrumentality of agents ,  --  as likely as any other men to be sometimes ignorant , insolent , and avaricious ,  --  offences must needs come . On the other hand , in cases wherein the Gov-. eminent was not even nominally concerned , ( whatever the understanding of the vendors might be upon that i ) oint ) the most flagitious deception had been practised . In still other instances , where the conduct of the purchasers was unobjectionablc , there were conflicting claims to territory , which one or more tribes , or portions of tribes , or perhaps individual chiefs , nevertheless undertook to convey . Owing to these and similar causes , the tribes had very generally become extremely suspicious of proposals for the purchase of land . They perceived , too , independently of any unfair dealing upon either side , that the white settlements were advancing upon them with the most formidable rapidity . Something must be done , then , in self-defence . Setting aside past impositions , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting aside all imposition , it was necessary to raise some universal and effectual barrier against inroads of any kind , upon any quarter . It is recorded , accordingly , by a historian already cited , that the agitation among the Indians at this time was accounted for by some of them , by saying , that they were endeavoring to effect what had frequently been recommended to them by the United States , viz. , a more effective and cordial union // among the various tribes . The writer considers this an attempt at deception ; ' but his facts appear , in this instance , to outweigh his opinion . War might or might not be anticipated as an ultimate resort , in offence or defence ; and British agitators ' might or might not be actually engaged , as certainly they were interested , in producing that result , and preparing the tribes for it . But it seems to us that there can be no reasonable doubt , that an effective and cordial union of the tribes , for the purposes just mentioned , was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading principle in the schemes of Tecumseh . This principle he never disavowed . He declared it in the most open manner , on every suitable occasion ; and with it the cogent reasoning , upon which in his mind it was founded . In July , 1810 , he conversed very fully upon the subject , with a person sent to his brother by the Governor of Indiana , to dissuade him from war and to gain information of his views . He said that the Great Spirit had given this great i sland ,  --  meaning the American continent ,  --  to his red children ; but the whites , who were l ) laced on the other side of the big water , not content with their share , had crossed over ,  --  seized upon the coast ,  - -  driven the Indians from the sea to the lakes ,  --  undertaken to say that this tract belongs to one tribe , this to another , and so on ,  --  when the Great Spirit had made it the common property of them all . They had retreated far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time disclaimed having intended to make war , but expressed his opinion that it would not be possible to preserve peace , unless the Indian principle of common property should be recognised , and the progress of the white settlements discontinued . He then proposed going to Vincennes , for the purpose of convincing the Governor that matters had been mis-represented to him . The visit accordingly took place in August ; and he then stated most distinctly ,  --  Mr. Dawson 's phrase is , in the broadest manner ,  --  that his policy had been to establish and extend the principle of common property as a means of necessary self-defence ; that the tribes were afraid of being l ) uSlled back into the lakes , and were therefore determined to make a stand where they now were . At the formal interview which ensued , Tecumseh , who was attended by a body of followers , manifested so much irritation , that the Governor apprehended an attack upon the spot ; the citizens were alarmed ; troops were called in ; and a scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologized for this demonstration of spirit at the next conference , and then appeared perfectly cool , he still persisted in the statements made in the outset . When asked by the Governor , whether it was his intention to prevent the surveying of a certain territory , recently purchased , he answered , ' that himself and those who were joined with him were determined , that the old boundary should continue . ' The Governor afterwards visited him at his camp , for the purpose of sounding him privately . Being asked if his intentions were really what he had openly avowed , he replied that they were . He had no complaint to make against the United States , but their purchasing the Indian land as they did ; and he should very much regret the necessity of making war for this single cause . On the contrary , he was anxious to be upon good terms with them . If the President would give up the late purchase , and agree to make no more in the same manner , he would even become their ally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these terms could not be complied with , he should be obliged to fight with the English against them . The Governor assured him that the President should be informed of his views , but also expressed his opinion , that there was no prospect of their being acceded to . Well ! ' answered the warrior , as the Great Chief is to determine the matter , I hope the Great Spirit will put sense enough in his head , to induce him to give up the land . True he is so far off , that the war will not injure him . He may sit still in his town and drink his wine , while you and I will have to fight it out . ' At the last conference , which took place previously to the battle of Tippecanoe , it is stated that his designs were more completely developed , than ever before. * And this , it should be observed , was his own voluntary and deliberate disclosure . The States had set the example , ' he said , of forming a union among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians for following it ? ' He had now succeeded in combining the Northern tribes , and he was about visiting the South , for the purpose of completing the scheme . But war , if it ensued , would be no fault of his . He hoped that the Governor would prevent settlements from being made on the new purchase , till he returned from his journey in the Spring . He would then visit the President himself at his leisure , and the matter should be settled with him . This speech has been called an // artful evasion , easily seen through . ' It appears to us , on the contrary , to be a model of manly frankness . The orator did not expressly state , indeed , that the combination alluded to anticipated the possibility or probability of war . But this was unnecessary . It was the natural inference in any reasonable mind . It had been frequently so stated and so understood . Repetition could only exasperate . On the whole , Tecumseh seems to have manifested a noble dignity in the avowal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound sagacity in which it originated , and the intelligent energy which conducted it , through every opposition and obstacle , so nearly to its completion . He might be wrong , but it is evident enough tljat he was sincere . As for British instigation , we need not suggest the distinction between a disposition upon their part , and a counter disposition upon his ; or between himself and the motley multitude of fanatical and ferocious vagabonds , who , unfortunately , formed a large part of the Prophet 's first congregation , and some of whom were as troublesome to each other and to him , as they were to the white settlers . Outrages were committed , as we have seen , on both sides , and criminals refused to be given over to justice by both ,  --  the ndians copying in this respect , the example of the American authorities . But we need not pursue this subject . The best existing evidence with regard to Tecumseh 's particular interest in it , seems to be his own , which has been given . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of the English . He told Governor Harrison , when he declared the necessity which might arise of an alliance with them , that he knew they were always urging the Indians to war for their own advantage , and not to benefit his countrymen . And here , ' we are imiformed , * he clapped his hands , and imitated a person hallooing at a dog , to set him fighting with another , thereby insinuating , that the British thus endeavored to set the Indians on the Americans . ' The truth is , he was too proud for a subordinate part . His confederates might do as they chose , but for himself , he would maintain the dignity of a free and brave man , and a warrior . He abandoned his plan of visiting the President , because he could not be received as the head of the deputation . It is said , that , in the last conference at Vincennes , he found himself , at the end of a long and animated speech , unprovided with a // seat . Observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed for him , and requested him to accept it . Your Father , ' said the interpreter , requests you to take a chair . ' My Father ! ' replIed the chief , the sun is my father , and the earth is my mother ; I will repose upon her bosom . ' And he adjusted himself on the ground in the Indian manner . A qualified remark has been made upon his courage ; but the manner in which he conducted himself during the war , is sufficient to establish this point beyond controversy . The same may be said of the fearlessness shown in his visits to Vincennes ; and especially , in his exposure of himself on that occasion , though he must have perceived that he was feared , suspected , and even guarded by large bodies of troops , drawn out for that express purpose . It is very illustrative of the apparent diversity in the character of Elskw&amp;tawa and his own in this respect , that when the Delawares sent a deputation of chiefs *o break up the Prophet 's settlement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawson expresses it , to give them an interview ; but despatched his brother to them , whose threats or persuasions were sufficient to drive back the chiefs , with strong indications of apprehension and terror . ' When General Proctor began to prepare for retreating from Maiden , Tecumseh , having learned his intention , demanded an interview , and , in the name of all the Indians , delivered an animated speech . If the spirit , which it manifests , could have had its intended effect in inducing the General to fight before he retreated , the result must at least have been more glorious , if not more favorable to his cause . Father ! ' he began , ' Listen to your children ! You have them now all before you. * The war before this , our British Father gave the hatchet to his red children , when our old chiefs were alive . They are now dead . In that war , our Father was thrown on his back by the Americans , and our Father took them by the hand without our knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Listen ! When war the last war was declared , our Father stood up and gave us the tomahawk , and told us that he was then ready to strike the Americans ,  --  that he wanted our assistance ,  - -  that he would certainly get us our land back , which the Americans had taken from us. * The phraseology generally adopted by Indian deputations , to express their representative character . vor*. xxxiv. - No. 75. 59 // Listen ! When we were last at the Rapids , it is true , we gave you little assistance . It is hard to fight people who live like ground-hogs . Alluding to the American fortifications . Father , listen ! Our fleet has gone out . We know they have fought . We have heard the great guns ; - Perry 's victory ,  --  but we know not what has become of our Father with one arm , Commodore Barclay . Our ships have gone one way , and we are astonished to see our Father tying up every thing , and preparing to run away the other , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always told us , you would never draw your foot off British ground . But now , Father , we see you are drawing back , and we are sorry to see our Father doing so without seeing the enemy . We must compare our Father 's conduct to that of a fat dog , that carries its tail upon its back ; but when frightened , drops it between its legs and runs off . Father , listen ! The Americans have not yet defeated us by land ,  --  we are not sure that they have by water ; - we wish , therefore , to remain here and fight . If they defeat us , we will then retreat with our Father . Father ! You have got the arms and ammunition , which our great Father sent for his red children . If you have an idea of going away , give them to us , and you may go and welcome for us . Our lives are in the hands of the Great Spirit ,  --  we are determined to defend our lands ,  --  and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones upon them . ' This celebrated speech is probably as good a specimen as any on record , of the eloquence of Tecumseh . It was a natural eloquence , characteristic , as all natural eloquence must be , of the qualities of the man . As Charlevoix says of the Canadian savages , it was such as the Greeks admired in the barbarians , ' - strong , stern , sententious , pointed , perfectly undisguised . It abounded with figures and with graphic touches , imprinted by a single effort of memory or imagination , hut answering all the purposes of detailed description , without its tediousness or weakness . The President was drinking his wine in his town , ' while Tecumseh and Harrison were fighting it out over the mountains . The Indians were hallooed upon the Americans , like a pack of starved hounds . The British nation was our great Father , and our great Father was laid flat on his back . So the policy of the United States , in extending their settlements , was a mighty water , and the scheme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist it. * Tecumseh // belonged to a nation , noted , as Heckewelder describes them , for much talk ; ' and he was himself never at a loss for words . He was a countryman of Logan , too , and he reasoned and felt like him . His whole time and talents were devoted to the cause of Indian independence ; and when he spoke upon this theme , as he generally did in public , his fine countenance lighted lip ; his firm and erect frame swelled with a deep emotion , which scarcely his own stern dignity could suppress ; every posture and gesture had its meaning ; and language flowed burning and swift from the passion-fountains of the soul . We have drawn the portrait of this eminent chieftain hitherto , only so far as to sketch some of those strongly marked lineaments , by which he was best known to his contemporaries , and by which he will be longest remembered . But there was something more in his character , than strong savage talent and savage feeling . Injured and irritated as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an interest in the fate of his countrymen , and by the agitation of his own schemes , there is no evidence either of coarseness in his manners , or of cruelty in his conduct . For reasons easily to be imagined , he regarded Governor Harrison with less partiality , than most other individual Americans ; and hence , the British General is said to have stipulated early in the war , that the Governor , if taken prisoner , should be his captive . But he is understood to have always treated that gentleman with such courtesy , that we apprehend , had this casus fcederis unfortunately occurred , he would have gloried only in conveying him off the battle-field in the manner of the Black Prince , and in setting before him , with the royal munificence of Massasoit , all the dry pease in his wigwam . When the Governor proposed to him , on his first visit to Vincennes in 1810 , that , in the event of a war , he would as far as possible put a stop to the cruelties which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others , no longer in a situation to resist ,  --  he readily gave his assent to the proposition , and voluntarily pledged himself to adhere to it . There is reason to believe , that he remembered this promise ; and that , amidst temptations and provocations ,  --  . and , many would be inclined to add , examples , from an authority he might have been supposed to respect ,  --  . of an extraordinary nature . In one of the sorties from Fort Meigs , a hundred or more of the American garrison were taken prisoners , aud put into Fort Miami . Here , McAfee and others relate // that the British Indians garnished the surrounding rampart , and amused themselves by loading and firing at the crowd within , or at particular individuals . This proceeding is said to have continued nearly two hours , during which time twenty of the unfortunate prisoners were massacred . The Chiefs were , at the same time , holding a council , to determine the fate of the residue . A bloodthirsty mob of cut-throat Potawatamies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot , while the Wyandots and Miamies opposed that course . The former prevailed ; and had already systematically commenced the work of destruction , when Tecumseh , descrying them from the batteries , came down among them , reprimanded the ring .. leaders for their dastardly barbarity in murdering defenceless captives in cold blood , and thus saved the lives of a considerable number . That all this was done by express permission of the English commander , and in presence of the English army , as is farther stated , it does not belong to us , in the pursuit of our present subject , either to assert or prove . If there be any truth in the charge , or in a tithe of those of the same character which have been brought against the same party , the sooner the veil of oblivion is dropped over them , the better . On the whole , the character of Tecumseh , in whatever light it may be viewed , must be regarded as remarkable in the highest degree . That he proved himself worthy of his rank as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even of his reputation as a great warrior among all the Indians of the North and West , is , indeed , a snall title to distinction . Bravery is a savage virtue ; and the Shawanees are a brave people ; too many of the American nation have ascertained this fact by experience . His oratory speaks more for his genius . It was the utterance of a great mind , roused by the strongest motives of which human nature is susceptible , and developing a power and a labor of reason , which commanded the admiration of the civilized , as justly as the confidence and pride of the savage . But other orators , too , have appeared among his countrymen , as eloquent and as eminent as Tecumseh , wherever the same moving causes and occasions could give birth and scope to the same emulous effort . And the mere oratory , in all these cases , was not so much an absolute vindication , as a naked and meagre index of the mighty intellect and the noble spirit within . HapjAly for the fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  *-such as were felt as well as heard in his own // day ,  --  such as will live on tile pages of civilized history , long after barbarous tradition has forgotten them . He will be named with Philip and Pontiac , the agitators ' of the two centuries which preceded his own . The schemes of these men were ,  --  fortunately for the interest which they lived and labored to resist ,  --  alike unsuccessful in their issue ; but none the less credit should , for that reason , be allowed to their motives or their efforts . They were still statesmen , though the communities over which their influence was exerted , were composed of red men instead of white . They were still patriots , though they fought only for wild lands and for wild liberty . Indeed , it is these very circumstances that make these very efforts ,  - -  and especially the extraordinary degree of success which attended them ,  --  the more honorable and the more signal ; while they clearly show the necessity of their ultimate failure , which existed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at once , of genius and of principle.
