Child , Lydia Maria Francis , 1802-1880 : To George Thompson . from To George Thompson ( 1836 ) I 've heard thee when thy powerful words Were like the cataract 's roar  --  Or like the ocean 's mighty waves Resounding on the shore . But even in reproof of sin , Love brooded over all  --  As the mild rainbow 's heavenly arch Rests on the waterfall . I 've heard thee in the hour of prayer , When dangers were around : Thy voice was like the royal harp , That breathed a charmed sound . The evil spirit felt its power , And howling turned away ; And some , perchance , ' who came to scoff , Remained with thee to pray . ' I 've seen thee , too , in playful mood , When words of magic spell Dropped from thy lips like fairy gems , That sparkled as they fell . Still great and good in every change ! Magnificent and mild ! As if a seraph 's godlike power Dwelt in a little child !     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
