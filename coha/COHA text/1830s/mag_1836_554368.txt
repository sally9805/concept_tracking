txt THE reprint in this country of this useful and popular work , affords us an opportunity to say something of Mr. Edgeworth , the father of the celebrated writer . This is the description by which he is generally known . This of itself is no small distinction , to have aided in forming a mind to which the world has been so much indebted ; and not only so , but to have borne a part in those efforts by which her fame is established ; for an age that ascribes to education almost unbounded power , must allow that the success of the scholar affords strong presumptive evidence in favor of the teacher and his system . If there were any doubt as to his agency in this respect , it is removed by the express testimony of his daughter , who is too sagacious to claim for him more than he could rightfully demand . She evidently considers herself under obligation to her father , not only for the formation of those intellectual habits which have led to her brilliant success , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best works . She is a good , if not impartial witness ; if there were no other proofs of his merits , this alone would to our minds be clear and convincing . But however plain it may be that a teacher has a right to be honored for the ability and success of the scholar whom it has been the business of his life to form , such honor is not apt to be given , we mean by public applause , though private gratitude be ever so warm in its acknowledgment . It is always found that an illustrious name eclipses other distinguished names beside it ; instead of shining in its brightness , they are exceedingly apt to be lost in its light . In ordinary associations there is no help for this unequal distribution of favor ; and the secondary party must bear neglect as he may ; but in a case like this before us , a father may be supposed , so far from lamenting this circumstance , to take as much pride and de // light in the reputation of his daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard it as his own . This Mr. Edgeworth appears to have done . Without any anxiety to establish his own claims , his whole ambition was to advance his daughter 's success , by lending counsel and aid to make her works as perfect as possible . Such manly and self-denying affection was honorable to his name . The result has been , that all the literary reputation l*as been carried away by the daughter , or rather given to the daughter ; for she certainly has not been ambitious to claim more than is fairly her own . Mr. Edgewortb is little known in this country as a literary man ; it is not even known that his tastes inclined decidedly in that direction ; it is commonly thought that the aid which he furnished her was of the kind , which in intellectual matters , would be called mechanical ; such for example , as supplying subjects and materials ; suggesting improvements , and occasionally throwing in some of those sagacious and practical maxims in which her writings abound . Assistance of this kind , though very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , who concern themselves with what has been accomplished , and care little how , or by whose aid it was done . So that Mr. Edgeworth , though his name has been so often associated with his daughter 's , as on the title-page of the work before us , has been little known as a literary man . He is generally considered as a man who possessed a remarkable inventive talent with which he amused his idle hours ; constructing engines of various kinds , which were better calculated to exercise his ingenuity than to increase the coinfort and convenience of life . There is of course nothing wrong in this playful employment of a mechanical 0enius , nor is this a disparaging view of an able man , living apart from society , and requiring amusement as a relief from various labors ; still it is plain , upon examining his life and writings , that amusement was not his object ; his desire was to be useful ; and to this purpose he devoted talent , time and money , for which , like too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing good . It is much to his honor that he did not , like too many who profess to make utility their object , profane and abridge the meaning of the word . One would suppose from the language of many on this subject , that man had nothing but a body to provide for ; they account nothing useful but that which tends // to increase the comfort and supply the wants of the pre3ent existence ; but to those who have hearts and souls , and who feel that the well-being of the moral and spiritual nature is a thing to be regarded , such a view of the subject and such language on the subject , seems untrue as it is unworthy . They think that there are things of the moral kind , quite as essential in domestic life as cooking-stoves ; and that railroads , convenient as they are , are not the only things that deserve the name of public improvements . Every suggestion that throws light on the subject of education , and shows us how to bring t e means and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion that tends to make men aware of their rights and responsibilities , every philosophical investigation that teaches us the mystery of our own nature , and even all those efforts of taste and imagination which raise us above the bondage of the senses , are useful in the highest acceptation of the word , and he is a stranger to himself and his duty , who does not receive the word utility with all this breadth of meaning . Mr. Edgeworth saw the subject in this light ; and after he had retired from social life , in which he bore an enviable part , to the seclusion of his own estate , he devoted much of his time , not only to what are called improvements , but to the cultivation of the minds of his children . Those of his daughter 's productions in which he took most interest , were those in which *ducation was the prominent object ; probably it was the strong direction of his mind to the subject , which turned her attention to the intellectual paths in which she has travelled with so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what good education is from his mother , whose early lessons he well remembered . She became , by some mismanagement in sickness , a cripple for life : and being suddenly thrown upon her own resources , devoted her time to the education of her children . By her calm and judicious firmness she acquired remarkable influence over them . Never following the usual course of parental discipline which varies between severity and indulgence , she took favorable moments to make impressions upon them , teaching them the necessity of putting restraints upon themselves . His temper was naturally fiery and ungovernable , but she taught him that unless his own good sense restrained it , it would be his ruin . Her suggestions and warnings were remembered ; and his daughter bears witness to the fact , that in his // later years , though he had many things to try the goodness of his disposition , he never gave way to anger or any passion , but always kept himself under firm and resolute control . She also taught him to take correct views of all subjects without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character receives its bent is shown by some examples in his own history ; particularly by the case of a young man of fortune , who married an inferior woman , and filling up his house with her relations led a life of riot and sensuality . The natural consequences of self-indulgence came , and he was confined by sickness to his own apartment . Here he was regaled by crusts of bread , which were cast away as refuse by those who were feasting at his expense below . He was so wounded by this treatment that he sunk away and died . Mr. Edgeworth , in his childhood , having this case before him , became sceptical as to the gratitude of mankind . But before he could form permanent habits of jealousy and suspicion , his mother came to his aid , and showed him the subject in its proper light . This timely aid saved him from that distrust approaching to misanthropy , by which so many are unfitted for social life and its duties . He remarks in his sketch of his own life , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjudicious conduct of benefactors , than from the Want of proper feeling in those whom they have obliged . Mr. Edgeworth was able to remember the manner in which his mind was determined to engage in those experiments and inventions in which he afterwards delighted . His mother had received some strangers with hospitality , and in return for her kindness , the gentleman whom she had laid under obligation , brought her an electrical machine , hoping that it might restore the use of her limbs . It was tried with some beneficial results ; but on one occasion , the shock was not given , and the operator was at a loss to account for it . Mr. Edgeworth , then very young , observed that the wire used as a conductor touched a hinge of the table , and asked if that might not be the reason of the failure . It was the cause , as he suspected ; and the operator was so much pleased with this instance of observation , in a child , that he paid him the utmost attention , and took pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him their uses . This encouragement confirmed his taste for mechanical constructions ; and thus by an early association he acquired his decided interest in the business of inventions . // Examples of this kind show how tastes of any kind may be formed and encouraged , and how the mind may he set at work in any pursuit , by watching , and drawing out those marks of early intelligence on which the formation of characterso much depends . His mother was particularly attentive to his moral education . We refer here not only to religious principle but to rules of action , such as the young need for the conduct of life , and which they are commonly left to learn by their own experience , which is the best way certainly , if its lessons are not too costly and do not come too late . Observing his peculiar tendencies , she took pains to show him the necessity of quick and decided action . She pointed out examples in which that easiness of temper which finds it hard to say no , leads to fatal indulgences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in others expectations that can not be answered , it brings unusual anger and reproach on those who would , if it were in their power , do favors to all mankind . Good nature too often appears in the form of a fault ; having no power to resist importunities , the easy tempered man is always at the mercy of others ; he does not gratify them by his compliances , since what he does for one he does for all meantime he feels all the misery of a dependent spirit , and goes through life like a drifting vessel entirely at the mercy of the waves and storms . Happy are they who have a parent who has judgment to discern and power to control the early elements of character , and who does not leave to accidental influences that which parental instruction is hound to do . As Mr. Edgeworth passed from childhood to that age when be became more his own master , he felt the benefit of this early instruction . When he was fourteen , being at an entertainment at Pakeuham Hall , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try his fortune ; he won with it in the course of the evening a hundred guineas . The next evening he lost it all , and his lordship offered to lend him more ; but he steadily declined and did not again sit down at the table . He was then congratulated by his mother on his self-command , which would secure him from the vice of gambling . The nobleman was rather a perilous moralist , and the experiment might in many cases have led to most injurious results ; in this instance however the effect was happy , and he never was tempted to engage in such amusements again . // He never seems to have been deficient in energetic decision . While he was at Oxford he was present in the courts when a prisoner was on trial for a felony , and observed that the foreman of the jury was completely inattentive to the testimony . While the judge was engaged , the foreman , having observed that Mr. Edgeworth was interested in the trial , asked him what verdict he ought to give . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge ordered him to sit down ; he remained standing , and was threatened by the judge , but still he persevered . He at length obtained a hearing , and stated to the court the manner in which the juror was trifling with his obligations . For this he received the thanks of the court , expressed in terms of strong approbation of the course which he bad pursued . He was still young though a married man , when he lost this parent to whom he was indebted for such judicious instructions . He describes her as a woman of fine understanding , who had read much and thought more on the subject of education , and had applied the results of her thought and study to practice , not fetterin0 herself by servile adherence to any system , but watching carefully the young minds under her control , and giv-. ing each the restraint or encouragement , the counsel and warning which it happened to need . She set to her children the example of unpretending piety , and generous benevolence ; and enforced all her lessons by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which inspires confidence even in children , though they know not why , by producing that consistency of feeling and action , which is always sure to be respected . The taste for mechanical inventions , which seems to have been natural , or , what perhaps is the same thiry , early inspired in Mr. Edgeworth , was never lost in the domestic and social cares and interests of later years . Before he had entered upon professional business , he employed himself in making under unfavorable circumstances , and with indifferent tools , a wooden orrery which required accurate calenlation and ingenious contrivance . Though no one cared for his pursuits or sympathized with his success , he kept up his interest in the employment , devoting most of his time to scientific researches . He re retted that his wife had so little regard to his favorite indulgences ; but she fortunately had domestic qualifications which were of more importance to his welfare , and by her prudence and good // management , he was able to live in this manner without a very ample income . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he became acquainted with some persons of note who are described at large in his memoirs . Among these was Sir Francis Delaval , one of those men of genius whose ability is admired perhaps more than it deserves , in consequence of the indifference with which it is regarded by its possessor . Sir Francis Delaval was a man of similar taste in some respects with Mr. Edgeworth . We do not refer to moral tastes in which the baronet was not the best example ; but he had never failing resources of invention , which were employed in various wild pranks which served to amuse an idle hour . He often aided his friends with suggestions which saved them from the consequences of foolish wagers , a kind of child 's play , which was then as now very common among those who neglected the serious business of life . Mr. Edgeworth , though he had no sympathy with these follies , was interested in Sir Francis as a man of talent , and it was this association which led to the first construction of a telegraph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be transmitted to London some hours before the intelligence could be carried by express . Mr. Edgeworth 's claim to the invention of a telegraph , which was used on this occasion , has exposed him to much abuse , which , as in many other cases , loses its power to injure by reason of the malice with which it is given . He said that he had read the work of Wilkins , and had seen in Stooke 's works some suggestion of such communication . Every one knows that such things were in use in ancient times . What he claimed was to have revived this invention ; and this claim is evidently made in reference to the French experiments which were many years subsequent to his own . Now that Mr. Edgeworth did construct and use a telegraph in 1767 , can not well he denied ; nor is there any question that the French invention was made public many years after ; and these facts , so far as we can discover , go to the full extent of his claim . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he does not even pretend it ; he expressly says that he took the suggestion from Wilkins and Stooke . It is not easy to state his claims in a more modest and inoffensive form . But a certain journal , notorious for its base and narrow prejudices , made // a venomous attack upon his veracity in reviewing his memoirs , and founded its charge upon this very invention . Mr. Perrot , Mr. Edgeworth said , was witness to his experiments , and assisted him ; and he procured Mr. Perrot 's letter , in which he testifies that he had conversations with Mr. Edgeworth on the subject , and recollected the experiments which were made . Now says this amiable journal , Mr. Edgeworth implies that Mr. Perrot gave practical assistance , and his letter proves that he did not . It is evident enough to all who can read that Mr. Edgeworth neither says nor implies any such thing . All the assistance implied is such as would he given by suggestions in conversation upon the subject in connexion with his own experiments . This same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of genius of the honor of his acknowledged inventions , since nothing is so new under the sun as never to have been suggested before . When Sir Francis Delaval was dying , he expressed to Mr. Edgeworth his hitter regret that he had wasted the resources of his inventive genius in trifles , and strongly exhorted his young friend , if he wished to escape *remorse in his closing scene , to make himself useful to mankind . Mr. Edgeworth does not seem to have needed this advice ; it was always his ambition to turn his powers to this account . Beside the many inventions by which he increased the comfort of his household , and others which seem like playful suggestions of an active and original mind , he acted the part of a good citizen , and gave his country or rather offered his country the benefit of his services , and at a critical moment attempted to revive the plan of transmitting intelligence by means of his telegraphic signals . in 1794 , the apprehension of a French invasion was general in Ireland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in constant agitation . Mr. Edgeworth asked of the government nothing more than the privilege of putting up a telegraph at his own expense , or in any way that the public authorities might approve . After establishing the practicability of his plan , he submitted a memorial to the government on the subject , which was approved and encouraged so far as to leave no doubt in his mind that his offer would be accepted , but after he had spent several hundred pounds , and given much of his time to the subject , he was informed that nothing would be done . Whether it was that the government had changed its mind , or that it never intended to engage in // the undertaking , does nofappear . He himself always ascribed it to tl ) e fetters which statesmen and leaders of parties are compelled to wear . Nlen in power are apt to be men under authority ; and while all are envying their high station of command , they are themselves compelled to submit to the dictation of some unseen masters . Shortly after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coasts . Without taking exception at his former treatment , he renewed his offers ; but they were accepted in form , and declined in reality , as before . It is much to his credit that this kind of experience never overcame his good nature , nor abated his zeal for the welfare and honor of his country . As to the extent to which the government was pledged to him , there can be no doubt that it encouraged him to go on with his experiments , and it was not till he had incurred considerable expense that he was informed that the plan would not be adopted . If it were a case between two individuals , there can be no doubt as to the obligation of the party which thus encouraged the other ; although there was no positive promise , there was an equitable claim created , which could not honorably be disregarded . IVIr . Edgeworth published a letter to the Earl of Charlemont , containing a temperate statement of all the circumstances ; the tone in which it is written is philosophical and high-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Edgeworthpub* lished a work on Roads and Wheel-carriages , describing the results of many intelligent experiments . These were of various kinds ; among other things , he pointed out the benefit of springs in carriages to the animals that draw them . It was well known , that the person conveyed was benefited by the springs of the vehicle , but it was not suspected that the horses were also laid under ohli0ations ; in fact , the contrary was taken for granted . By these and many other suggestions , of great value , but not ostentatiously proclaimed , he lent efficient aid in preparing the way for the great improvements of modern times . He even struck out the idea of a railway , , and applied it on his own estate , to the transportation of materials from one part of it to another . In reclaiming the bogs of Ireland , he proposed to employ wooden railways shod with iron ; these were supported on piles driven into the bog not permanently attached to them , but so constructed that the rail and its support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was necessary for the cars to go . After having // tested the value of this invention , hy using it to convey limestone over his farm , he undertook to apply it on a great scale to public works , and entered upon an engagement with the proprietors of extensive iron-xvorks , to carry all their materials and productions upon railways of this description . Finding however , that the company was not prosperous , he never carried the plan into effect ; but his successful experiments on his own estate , showed that the conveyance could be employed to advantage ; and as to the honor of the invention , what great public improvement was ever carried to perfection or applied to all its purposes by a single hand ? But we pass from subjects of this kind to consider what Mr. Edgeworth did in the great cause of education , which now inspires so general an interest , that we can hardly conceive how little it was regarded thirty years ago . lie always had the highest views of its importance . At some times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intellectual varieties which are found in the civilized world ; hut he appeared at last to settle down in the conviction , that while there were certain original differences in minds , by far the greatest differences are those which arise from education . Regarding the subject in this light , he felt how great was the obligation which rested on parents , on teachers , and on statesmen also , who can do more to influence the destinies of their respective nations by giving or withholding encouragement to instruction , than by any other means or measures in their power . Mr. Edgeworth undertook to educate his eldest son , according to the system of Rousseau , which was then new to the world , and from the novelty of the subject and the method of treating it , made a great impression upon enlightened minds . It was not then known that the fervent pleader of the claims of childhood on parental care , was in the habit of sending his own children to be educated in the Foundling Hospital , where he might never hear of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Day , the author of Sandford and Merton , speaks of Rousseau , as the greatest and best of men . Mr. Edgeworth was not a slave to the system , and he was soon convinced by the results of his experiment that the system was unsound . So far as physical education went , there was nothuing to desire ; the boy was active , hardy and strong ; hut the spirit of independence which had been systematically en couraged in him , outgrew all control . Having no taste for // study , and being somewhat unsettled in his disposition , he went to sea , and afterwards came to South Carolina , where he died in 1776 . It is not easy to tell how far the system or the manner of applying it produces such results . Let the course he shaped as direct as possible , there will always be sidewinds and under-currents against which no human wisdom can guard . Mr. Edgeworth was still more painfully disappointed in a daughter by his second wife . She was always an object of inspiring hope ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Upon her he tried his favorite theory , which maintained that by cultivating the habit of attention , a new direction could be given to the youthful mind . She was deliberate and exact . He wished to awaken an interest in literature , particularly such as excites the imagination . By reading to her , according to his practice in his family , passages from poems and works of fancy , and pointing out their beauties , he effected the desired change , and gave her a decided literary taste . But while she promised to reward his affectionate care , she became the victim of hereditary consumption , and died at the age of fifteen . It is quite possible to write and reason well on the subject of education without much practical ability ; neither is success in a few cases always to be regarded as a test of the merit of the system . But Mr. Edgeworth was in general , very happy in his laborious attempts to educate his children , and in one instance he has given the world ample assurance of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a union of talents which do not often exist together , of clear sagacity with brilliant invention ; the imagination was evidently the gift of nature , while the just discernment was the result of education . This was according to his theory , which maintained that the resources should be carefully drawn out by attentive care , so as to balance one against another ; to remove that which is excessive , and supply that which is wanting . So important did this process appear , that he recommended to parents to keep a private journal in which the peculiarities of the child 's character , as they manifested themselves , should be noted down . In short , his opinion was , that parents should make it a serious object to educate their childrcn , and always keep it before them , as an indispensable and sacred duty ; not leaving young minds and hearts at the mercy of chance and time ; but doing the workj which Providence assigns them when it places the children under their care . // The work which is now republished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than thirty years before the public , and many of our readers are well acquainted with it ; still we have thought the appearance of a new edition an occasion not unsuitable for giving to the author the credit which he deserves . We say the author , for , although it was published in connexion with his daughter , she describes the principles and suggestions as his , and herself as bearing a part only in the execution . The suggestions must have proceeded from one who had thought much on the subject , and corrected his theories by patient and attentive observation , it is full of illustrations , which show that no partiality for systems interfered with his penetrating discernment of truth . In fact , in the latter part of his life , he became an observer by profession , devoting much of his time to his family , and steadily following the advice given by his penitent companion , formerly alluded to , to be useful to the very last . In the works published in conjunction with his daughter , the public , knowing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than her share of credit ; but in 1808 lie published a work on Professional Education , which was entirely his own . It is not very generally known in this country ; but those who have read it , will agree in pronouncing it one of the best , as well as most interesting works upon the subject . The prevailing idea on which his system is founded , that natural differences can be greatly modified by devoting the attention for the purpose , seems to us judicious and true . But even those who care nothing for the subject , will find entertainment and instruction in the intellectual character of the work , which abounds with sagacious remark and shrewd observation , such as implies extensive knowledge of the mind and heart . We have made these few remarks upon the literary character and services of Mr. Edgewort h , because justice has not yet been done to his memory , in this country ; those who feel the warmest interest in the works and reputation of the daughter , have , unintentionally " done her sire some wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that he was an intellectual man of high order , and though in the early part of his life , he made rather a sportive use of his great mechanical genius , afterwards , in maturer years , he discharged the duties of a father , a friend , and a patriot , with such exemplary fidelity , that his greatest enemies allowed him the praise of a useful man ; which , properly // understood , is the highest praise that ambition can covet , or the world bestow . And those who read , ( as who does not ? ) the works of his daughter , will remember , that he was the diligent former of her mind , both in youth and maturity , so that we are in part indebted to him for the admirable works with which she has favored the world.
