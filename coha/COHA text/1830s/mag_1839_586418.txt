txt When the people of the United States resolved to put an en&amp; to the corporation which , rising upon the ruins of the old continental currency , amidst the wants and distresses of the revolution , early displayed its native instinctive hostility to justice , equality , and the liberties of the people ; and which , after a few years of interregnum and anarchy-while the people , bsarthened with the debts they had incurred as the price of their liberty , were torn by rival factions , and distracted by the petty jealousies of thirteen sovereign States-was ingrafted into their new government before they had learnt its strength and resources , distinctly marked its limitations , or tested its cupacity for good or evil ; and which again , after a few years ' suspension of its existence , reviving , like a phmnix , from the ashes of national calamity , clothed with renewed strength , and endowed with mightier privileges , was forced upon their necks , under the pretence of expediency and necessity , in the midst of war and na* tional calamity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in violation of the Constitution , and after long experience and repeated trials of its dangerous tendencies , it was not the mere paper charter  --  the parchment roll filed away among the records of legislation-which they wished to have annihilated ; nor was it the types and machinery by which paper is manufactured into money which were the objects of their hostility ; none of these things could call forth those deep feelings of opposition and repugnance which the people have*manifested for more than half a century , and which , growing stronger and stronger by every day 's experience , have at length become fixed in a solemn resolution to risk every consideration in the unflinching resolution to confine all money corporations to their legitimate sphere of promoting commercial utility alone.a * Minutes of the Assembly , March 21 , 1785 . Petitions from a considerable number of the inhabitants of Chester county were read , representing that the bank at Philadelphia bad fatal effects upon the community : that whilst men are enabled , by means of the bank , to receive near three times the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money at very short warning , whenever they have occasion for it , it will be impossible for the husbaadman or mechanic to borrow on the former tern*s of legal interest and distant payments of the principal ; that the best security will not enable the person to borrow ; that experience clearly demonstrates the mischievous cansequences of this institution to the fair traders that impostors have been enabled to support themselves in a fictitious credit , by means of a temporary punctuality at the bank , until they have drawn in their honest neighbors to trust them with their property , or to pledge their credit as sureties , and have been finally involved in ruin and distress ; that they have repeatedly seen the stopping of discounts at the bank operate on the trading part of the community with a degree of violence scaroely inferior to that of a stagnation of blood in the human body , hurrying the wretched merchant who bath debts to pay into the hands of griping usurers ; that the directors of the bank may give such preference in trade , by advances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality which ought to prevail in a commercial country ; *sat paper money has often proved beneficial to the State , but the bank forbids it , and the people must acquiesce ; therefore , and in order to restore public confidence and private security , they pray that a hill may be brought in and passed into a law , for repealing the law for Incorporating the bank . March 28 The report of the committee , read March 25th , on the petitions from the *o , mties of Chester and Berlee , and the city of Philadelphia and its vicinity , praying the act of the Assembly whereby the bank was established at Philadelphia may be repealed , was read the senond dine , as followa , via : // The &amp;cand War of the Revolutiirn .

That , at best , if it wale even confined to the hands of Americans , it would be totally destructive of that equality which ought to prevail in a republic . We have nothing in our free and equal Government capable of hal cing the influence which this bank must create , and we see nothing which , in the course of a few years , can prevent the directors of the bank from governing Pennsylvania . Already we have felt its influence indirectly interfering in the measures of Legislature . Already the house of Assembly , the representatives of the people , have been threatened that the credit of our paper currency will be blasted by the bank ; and if this growing evil contin , aes , we fear the time is not very distant when the bank will be able to dictate to the Legislature what laws to pass and what to forbear .

" // were embodied the tyranny , oppression , and despotism , which , growing up age after age , and piling tower upon tower , was then frowning in sad wrath from its lofty battlements , upon an enslaved , down-trodden people , and scowling defiance in their pallid , hunger-bitten faces , every hour of their toilsome and degraded existence . It was this consci*ousness , deep-stirring in their bosoms , that set the long-sleeping masses in motion , and sent them welling and billowing against that which was a more complete emblem of tyranny than the poor imbecile Louis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was not the parchment of privileges , the impenetrable walls of a marble palace , or the dM De Launay , royal superintendent , and his Swiss guards who dwelt therein , that roused the indignation of the people against our American bastile . It was a mightier cause of action  --  a secret , all-pervading , overshadowing influence , corrupting their agents and snpping their liberties ; of which sweeping , overwhelming power that institution was the sign , the symbol , the thinking-head and controlling will . The Constitution , after a perilous time of disorder and national prostration , was adopted by the people of the States for their common defence and general welfare and the Government organized under it had been in operation now some forty years , but was perverted in the beginning from its legitimate purposes . That class of men who would live by their wits on the labor of others ; who would be clothed with purple and fine linen , and fare sumptuously every day at the expense of the toil and aweat of the poor man 's brow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profusus  --  the system of Diddler in the farce , " living any way and well , at any body 's expense ; ' who hung like a dark cloud of croaking , ill-boding ravens on the Bkirts of our suffering , bleeding armies , defrauding the soldiers , succoring the enemy , and in the hour of triumph , soulless wretches as they were , crying beef ! beef ! while a patriot camp was wringing with the shouts of victory and independence ; ever clamorous for office , scrambling for the merest crumbs of patronage ; that class of men , the perennial growth of every clime and every age , seized on the Government in the beginning of its operations , and endeavored to convert it into a machine for funding , banking , and speculating , not only in the national domain , in Indian wars , treaties , annuities , and Indian lands ; but such was their cormorant appetite , that not even the claims of the poor invalid and pensioner , the claims of the toil-worn soldier , which he asked in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in defence of his country , could escape their rapacious hands . While robbin g the poor , and plundering the nation , ever fruitful in expedients , skilful in devices , growing bold with success , and audacious in impunity , they at length assumed omnipotent D powers for a government which the people had ordained for limited and specified purposes , and commenced a system of unequal and unjust taxation , beneficial to themselves , but burthensome to the people  --  a system of taxation , not for revenue , not for the legitimate wants of a Government economically administered , but avowedly for the purpose of fostering and protecting the interests of a few sections and classes of men at the expense of the entire nation . The vast funds , thus accumulated beyond the just wants of Government , were wielded as a kind of magic wand , to sway and influence the opinions of the people , corrupt their principles , change their love of liberty into a thirst for gain , and to bribe them into submission and a right loyal allegiance , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would obtain a portion of those rich spoils , the fruits of their prostitution and abandonment of principle ; but which were at length , by selfish and fraudulent combinations , expended Oil some road , or canal , or river ) or creek , or harbour , not for the common defence and general welfare , but forthe immediate and only benefit of those concerned in the speculation . This stuI ) endous system of partial legislation , of fraud and peculation , was checked by the Executive veto on the bill providing for die Mnysville road ; but it still survives , and , Proteus-like , lives in a thousand shapes , costing the nation , to this day , an animal expendifure of some ten or twelve millions . In tracing the history of our national lc , * , islation , it will be observed that the limitations of the Constitution , and the common good of the whole Union , have been rarely considered // in the adoption of any measure . And with few exceptions , the same observation is true in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back than seven years , the date of the veto on the hank bill , what has been their employment since thatperiod* Lookattheirstatutebooks ; they are crowded with enactmentstoalter* amend , enlarge , and create bank charters , banking companies , monopolies , and corporations , for every conceivable purpose within the scope of human enterprise , and even of human imagination . To foster these schemes , to furnish apabulum for these banks , canals , turnpikes , and railroads to feed upon , the credit of the States have been brought into requisition , and the people , in a new form , saddled with a national debt of more than one hundred and seventy millions . The banks , thus sustained on the credit of the people , live only by making a lottery of their fortunes , and plundering them of their property . The thousand petty vchemes of internal improvement , forced into being by a prodigal expenditure of the public resources , are , with rare exceptions , local and sectional in their character ; giving no stimulus to agriculture or enterprise ; gotten up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them altogether useless , and all put together , are not able to pay the interest on the money expended in their execution . While the Legislatures of the States have never lifted themselves up to a comprehensive view of the wants and interests of the whole ; never ventured to hazard on some noble enterprise for education and commerce , the little modicum of popularity by which they held Lheir places , ever scrambling for a distribution of the crumbs ; intriguing and mousing over their petty , selfish schemes of individual advantage ; while thus wasting the resources of the State , and poorly consulting the common weal , all power has been gradually sliding from their hands , and falling into the possession of those corporate instituZions which they , from year to year , had created , Where are our men of talents , of wealth , of experience in affairs-men of influence , ambitious of power and distinction ? Look at your railroad companies , canal companies , turnpike companies , and banking institutions ; there you will find them , presidents , cashiers , treasurers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the councils of the nation , members of Congress , of the Executive cabinet , and senators , are retiring from those exalted stations , and seeking with avidity the offices in the gift of corporate institutions . And wherefore i " Wheresoever the carcass is , there will the eagles be gathered together . ' Ambitious men seek those stations , because they well know that in them is concentrated the true , substantial power and patronage of the country ; that in them is lodged the power behind the throne , greater than the throne itself ; tl*st they are the steam engines that put all the wheels of Government in motion , and draw along after them the entire train of legislation . Nine hundred banks-the number is scarcely less-with as many thousand officers , three or four hundred thousand stockholders , near seven hundred thousand debtors , wielding a capital of four hundred millions , a discount loan of five hundred millions ; possessing the sovereign prerogative of elevating or debasing at pleasure the currency of the country ; controlling a State funded debt of one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debts of an innumerable host of joint-stock companies , which , together with the banks , constitute an organized , consolidated , well-disciplined Macedonian phalanx , thoroughly imbued with aristocratic ideas of the nobility of money and the degradation of labor ; holding that wealth is a virtue , and poverty a crime , monopolizing nll the lands , capital , trade , and commerce of the country ; marching boldly forward under the direction of influential , wealthy , talented , and ambitious men ; openly aspiring to legislative and governmental control ; crowding our national Assembly and State Legislatures with hired and unprincipled orators ; corrupting the people in their primary assemblies at the polls and the ballot-box , and recklessly pressing forward to the ultimate overthrow of equal representation , and the establishment of what they designate a mild aristocracy  --  the open and avowed enemy of Democratic principles . And well have they succeeded in the accomplishment of their purposes . The constitutional form of legislation is an idle mockery ; the people may go through the solemn ceremony of electing men to represent them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as men arrive on the theatre of action , they universally imbibe the opinions , and fall into the current of feeling most fashionable around them . They soon learn to think that the interests of the banks and of the people are the same : " touch the banks , you touch the people ; " they are not long in discovering that the directors and financiers of moneyed corporations are wiser than they are , or their constituents , and that whatever schemes they may desire or recommend must be implicitly adopted . Not to speak of the direct influence brought to bear on their hopes and fears-their expectations of some future good or evil resulting from the tre . mendous moneyed power of the banks. *their personal feelings of pride and vanity are appealed to ; and really honest , unsuspecting men , yielding to the attentions and blandishments of those who know so well how to use them , and anxiously seeking to gain the smiles and approbntion of those whom they have the weakness to sup .. pose would reflect honor on their acquaintance , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Should these appliances fail , which seldom happens , the more potent weapons of ridicule and denunciation are resorted to ; the keen sarcasm , and cutting wit of the pensioned orators , and hireling presses , seldom fail to drive all but the stern uncompromising friends of liberty into silence or neu* trality ; so that when any question of vital importance comes up , in which the interests of associated wealth and the interests of the people are at issue , the latter have never failed to be found in a hopeless minority . Events had been steadily and surely advancing to this crisis for more than forty years . Forgetting that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty ; imagining that their forefathers had accomplished every thing in ordaining a Constitution of specified powers , and vainly dreaming that all power was vested in themselves ; the people at length woke up to a sense of their true condition , and found that their creatures had become omnipotent-that the reins of government had glided from their own hands , and fallen into the possession of an exclusive privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution , or a pretence to the common defence and general welfare , were creating monopolies , immunities and privileges for themselves , engines of oppression , burthensome taxes , , and enormous national debts for the people .

When the decree went forth , pronounced by the Hero of the Iron Nerve , that the Bank of the United States , after the expiration of its present charter , should not be renewed ; when that decree was sanctioned and sustained by a virtuous and patriotic people , resolved to restore their wounded and down-trodden Constitution , then commenced the Second War of tke Rev .. l*4io*i&amp; .

Seven long years have we been involved in this war of revolution , and have not yet approached the beginning of the end . Seven years have nearly elapsed ; during that long period many have fallen in the conflict-many passed from the scene of action ; many leaders and whole masses of men have changed their position , altered their relations to each other  --  the old landmarks have been obliterated-darknes* has come over the path of the people-the dear objects of their pursuit seem to he eluded them at every step , and they are , apparently , no nearer their attainment than when they first began .

Few , however , at that time seemed to comprehend the true question before the country . Many honest , sincere friends of the people , circumscribed in their vision , really imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States ; and that when the overthrow of that institution was accomplished , the controversy would be at an end , rtot dreaming it was a death struggle for power and supremacy , an effort on the part of the people to regain their lost independence , to restore to its natural and constitutional owners that power which an unjust , partial , and unwise legislation had thrown into the hands of corporations , monopolies and speculators , into the hands of a monied aristocracy , a republican oligarchy to which the Bank of the United States was the nucleus of attraction , the thinking-head and controlling will . The true friends of reform , while ignorant of the character and extent of the evil to be remedied , were laboring under a fatal delusion which prevented them from adopting those wise measures demanded by the crisii of the times . Taught only in the school of bank financiers , they were led to believe that the interests of commerce and trade would be greatly promoted by permitting the public revenue to be used by banks , as a fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were their own capital . Such had been the practice of the United States Bank , and all the local banks , and such were the doctrines so zealously inculcated by their friends , that use and custom , and the uncontradicted dogmas of bank emissaries , had at length impressed the minds of honest men with the idea , that there was a sort of propriety , if not nocessity , // in a connection of Bank and State in some form-not knowing that credit , which they were so anxious to promote and protect , when based on sound capital aud the actual products of the country , possesses an elnaticity and expansibility capable of meeting any increased operations of business , and adequate to every sudden emergency in commercial vicissitudes , they yielded to the clamor of bank friends , and thereby sacri*ced the only measure of reform by which the people were to be benefitted . The local banks , on the other hand , au* their numerous friends , never co-operated in the destruction of the United States lThnk , with an honest intention of promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They looked only to the political ndvanta* , es necruing to themselves , nad to the spoils of victory . They had been restricted in thoir operations , checked and thwarted in all their plans , and kept in a state of vassalage by the overshadowing influence of that national institution . They clearly foresaw that if the Bank of the United States were once removed. , they would . by an easy and natural combination , control the entire legislation of the country ; and realise vast sums of money by an unlimited trade on the commerce , public lands , and credit of the Union . Possessing all power in their respective States , they could not brook opposition , and easily grasped at the proffered means of casting off restraint , and expanding their own fortunes . Hence their hostility and zealous co*operation against the Bank of the United States . Their motives can not be mistaken . Never intending to surrender any of their dominion and power over the fortunes and liberties of the people , they only desired to clip the aspiring wing of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Runnymede agreement among the rag barons , that no one of the fraternity should be monarch over the others-n quarrel of the robbers against their brigand chief for assuming more authority than is justly due to him  --  a quarrel which would soon be healed when the hand itself is endangered , or new spoils are to be obtained .. When therefore we consider the friends of the United States Bank , who well nigh constituted a majority of the whole Congress , the friends of the State banks who entered into the crusade merely for their own privnte gains , and the friends of reform who were laboring under a delusion , it will not be surprising that so few comprehended thetrue crisis of affairs ; and that no sound measures were proposed or adopted . What more could be expected of a body composed of such materials , than panic speeches , agitation , and a vile scramble among the rival interests for  --  a portion of the spoils . The wise plan of ultimately producing the reformation desired by the people-of *1nally separating the Government from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reduce their circulation , and fill up the channels of trade with gold and silver , so that the divorce might take place without any injury to themselves , or any shock to the business of the country , was talked of , highlypraised , held up to public view as the most salutm-y and important reform ever proposed , but it was never digested into any definite form , or introduced for legislation . It was promised by a distinguished senator from Virginia ; he pledged himself to its performance , and the hopes of the country for a time hung on his movements . But he never redeemed his promise . And whether be was deterred by a modest diffidence of his own powers , or a dread of the overwhelming majority then arrayed against him , or whether he himself was drawn in , and engulphed by the mighty maelstrom of bank induence which swept every thing along in its dashing and whirling eddies , is no longer a doubtful question . For two years and a half nothing was done . From December 1833 , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever , and were left to run wild in their excesses . That portion of the monied oligarchy , who for their own purpose desited. an overthrow of the United States Bank , having gained their end , went to work in their respective States to multiply their local institutions , and increase their facilities for stockjobbing , borrowing , speculating in petty schemes of internal improvement , and plundering the people .

G a // tution , and feeling a comm&amp;n interest in preserving all power in the hands of the oligarchy , naturaliy co-operated with them in all their schemes , and gave them a decided majority in almost every le , , islature in the Union . By their joint operation the number of banks was more than doubled in the space of time we are now speaking of ; and nearly nine hundred manufactories of paper money were set in motion , , pouring forth their rags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beg0ars in the street but endowed with the magic name of money , they came forth " thick as autumnal leaves in Valombrosa , " a perfect shower , not genial like the vernal rains , but blasting and ruinous , potent only f* evil . It was impossible to have employed profitably in the legitimate business orth e country , real gold and silver , equal in nominal value to those spurious issues of paper money . Trade and commerce are regulated by uniform and invariable laws . They require a circulating medium bearing only a small ratio to the actual productions of the country ; and if ; by any unforeseen cause , those productions should increase beyond the currency necessary to exchange them , they would furnish a basis whereon to rear a credit sufficient to meet the increased demand for money . A sound and healthy action of domestic trade , and a wise increase of foreign commerce , had no part in producing that flood . of paper issues by which the land was deluged . The monied oligarchy would not have been laboring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent solid good of all the people in the measures they adopted . Their object was to get the public lands in exchange for their paper  --  to stimulate speculation-drive commerce beyond its wants and its means  --  to intoxicate the people with the idea of boundless prosperity  --  to make them reckless and extrava , , ant , so that their property , in the end , their improvements , and their liberties , also , miaht fail a prey into the hands of those who had wickedly drawn them into the snare . Almost the entire public domain , amounting to townships , dukedoms , and principalities , fell into their hands-forcian trade was involved in a debt of thirty mdli s beyond its resources , and as a legitimate consequence , an enormous surplus revenue was accumulated far beyond the most extravagant demands of Government . Hence there arose another difficulty . Wlsat shall be done with the surplus i We have not only to regulate by law the connection between Bank and State , but we have to dispose of the overflowing revenues naturally resultin* from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfaction of the monied oligarchy , by the act of the 23rd June , 1836 . That law was the work of their own hands , and . devised for their own benefit . By it , a perpetual union of Bank and State was solemnized ; an indiscriminate reception of their paper issues was authorized a more equal distribution of the benefits arisin , , fiom the use of the public funds was made among the entire fraternity of paper coiners ; and a precedent was established by which the annual surplus should be distributed anion , the States , there to be used . a second time for their benefit . No schemes could , apparently , be more happily 4evised to promote the ends of the monied oligarchy  --  the embezzlement of the fortunes and the subversion of the liberties of the people . But , by a kind Providence , who has ever watched over the destinies of our Republic , their clsosen instrument was made the means of producin , their own overthrow-of catching them in their own snare-entrappin* them in their own craftiness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the banks , was the chief cause of the disasters which subsequently befel them . But before we proceed to a consideration of that branch of the subject , let us dwell for a moment on the extraordinary precedent of distributing the surplus revenue among the States , under pretence of a deposite for safe keeping . That measure , more than any thing else , displays the true character and design of those who , from the beginning , have controlled the op'rations of our Government . A proposition for distributing the proceeds of the public lands , and also the surplus revenue among the States , had repeatedly failed . Few were prepared openly to avow a principle , whose tendency was to destroy the independence of the States bind them as pensioned provinces to a central government of unlimited // powers , and to blot out every feature of popular supremacy traced in the Constitution . But when the same principle was introduced in a covert and insidious way , it was immediately adopted by an overwhelming majority ; and that which men would not directly attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can not be safe , when , by indirect legislation  --  a distinctly recognized violation of the Constitution  --  a precedent is established of such evil omen . The dangerous consequences of that measure are yet to be seen ; they are to burst forth in full vigor at some future day . Be it remembered that the States , under the guidance of the ruonied oligarchy , are plunged into the wildest schemes of internal improvement . Jealous of each other 's prosperity , rivair*ig one another in efforts to draw the trade and commerce of the country through their own channels , they have undertaken gigantic enterprises , and pledged the credit of the people for sums of money which would have startled the Congress of the whole Union a few years since . States , whose revenues are barely sufficient to carry on the operations of an economical government , are borrowing enormous sums , to be expended by speculators and improvement mongers , on thriftless schemes which can never be of any advantage to the people . Already have eighteen , out of six-and-twenty , involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions . That debt is annually and rapidly increasing ; and all the works put together , on which the money has been expnnded have not , and never will have , a revenue sufficient to pay the accruing interest . The tnonied oligarchy , who have involved the country in these embarrassments , and placed themselves in a delicate position before the public , have but two alternatives whereby to extricate the community , and save themselves from the denunciations of the people . The one is , a resort to direct taxation ; the other , to the surplus revenues of the United States . The first alternative they will never adopt , so long as it can possibly be avoided . They know very well that while they do not resort directly to the pockets of the people , they can cheat them , delude them , or oppress them , to their heart 's content , and they will never detect the cause . But an open demand upon the purse-strings , an actual withdrawal of the taxes from the hands of the people , awakens their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . They will want to know for what purposes their money is abstracted from them . Such an inquisitive disposition would not at all suit the taste of the monied oligarchy , who know they could not give a just account of their stewardship . Direct taxation , therefore , is not to be thought of ; the other alternative is the only one left , and , happily for all the schemes of the oligarchy , the very best that could be devised . A large surplus revenue , arising from the snles of public lands and the duties out foreign importations , can only be obtained by a connection of the Government with the banks , and an indiscriminate reception of their paper issues in payment of the public dues . Then , besides the entire force of the oligarchy , wielding all the monied resources of the country , as we have shown , and pressing the necessity of this Union , if we consider for a moment the tremendous auxiliary forces they have in those who are interested in the thousand petty schemes of internal improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-meaning man , from some remote section , sitting in the Legislature of his State . Catching the mania for improvement , he has a little scheme of his own , by which he hopes to benefit his constituents , increase his own popularity , and retain his seat in the public councils . His mind is wholly intent upon that ; he thinks of nothing else ; and is willing to resort to any honorable means to gain friends and votes for his favorite enterprise . But he is told that the resources and the credit of the State have been exhausted ; that a resort to direct taxation would blow up their schemes and themselves at once ; and that the only hope of success is to obtain a surplus revenue from the Federal Government . As the precedent of distribution has already been set , we have nothing to do but obtain the surplus , which might readily be had , could those radicals be once put down , and the Government permitted to go on in its usual course . Could the public dues be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again deposited in the banks , to be loaned out to speculators in public lands , and dealers in foreign // commerce , we would soon have a revenue for distribution , sufficient to accomplish all our purposes ; to pay the State debt , which has become a serious matter* and to complete all our schemes of improvement . Yielding to the plausibility of an argument which solves so many perplexing difficulties , and only suggests that things be permitted to go on in their usual course , a really honest man , and through him his constituents who would not directly do any thing to jeopard the institutions of their country , are made indirectly to favor schemes whose inevitable results must be to bring down the States in vassalage to a central power , and finally to subvert the liberties of the people . This conflict , th*fore , between the people and their rulersthe monied oligarchy  --  the revolution , so far from being at an end , so far from being accomplished , has only begun . We are now enjoying a short armistice-living ii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rally and the onset is again heard , we shall find a host of auxiliaries , we little dreamed of , arrayed against the people . Many from among themselves , whose feelings and principles are the same with their own , led astray by the petty interests of the moment , and duped by the plausible insinuations of the oligarchy , will , in the next contest , be found arrayed against them . With earnestness , therefore , and sincerity , we warn the people , and tell them not to be deceived . The final conflict has yet to come ; the shock of the allied forces has still to be met ; the Waterloo field has yet to be fought . It was only deferred by the catastrophe which has recently befallen the banks-a catastrophe brought on them by their own friends ; but ordained and overruled by kind Providence , as the means of opening the eyes of the people , alarming them at their perilous condition , and preparing them with more earnestness and resolution to enter into the coming battle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overflowing with the ideal wealth poured into their laps by the credit and resources of the Government , became more avaricious than ever ; and , in endeavonring to divide more equally among themselves the spoils of victory , overacted their parts ; brought a great calamity upon the country ; exposed the unsoundness of their doctrines , and the hollowness of that imaginary prosperity with which they had cheated and deluded the people . No proposition in political economy can be clearer than this : that the act of June , 1836 , was the immediate and prime cause of the calamities which subsequently befel the banks in 1837 . A few plain principles in connection with the history of these transactions will place the proposition beyond controversy . Currency , like water , is always seeking its level-tending perpetually to a common centre . As the little rivulets that bubble up among the hills flow into each other , increasing and expanding as they go onward , until they pour their tributary streams into the great ocean of waters , so does currency in like manner , originating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , flow onward , increasing as it advances , until it finally falls into the great currents which are perpetually revolving around the emporiums of trade and commerce . Where all the agricultural productions of the country are accumulated , or their values exchanged for the manufactured articles and imported goods that may be consumed , there the greatest quantity of currency is needed , not only as a standard of value , but as the means of regulating the exchanges , and of liquidating the numerous balances which daily occur in every transaction . Hence a circulating medium is required in very small proportions in the interior of the country . It is always tending towards the great mart of trade ; and any attempt to disturb this uniform course would be as destructive in its consequences as a violation committed on the laws of physical nature . An attempt to force water up stream would not be more disastrous than a similar attempt to force the currency backward in its channels . The soundest circulating medium and credit , based on the actual capital and productions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and disturbed in their accustomed revolutions through the emporiums of trade , would , from the very laws that govern them , fall into irregularities and embarrassment . How much more necessarily must those // 509 consequences have followed the actual condition of those two main springs of national prosperity at the time of the act now under consideration ? In June , 1836 , some twenty-five or thirty banks had in their possession , on deposite , more than thirtijthree millions of public funds . This money , and private deposits , and their own capital , together with their credit , so far as it could be extended , were all loaned out to individuals and companies engaged in speculations in public lands , private lands , lots , improvements , stocks-on enterpris* doubtful in their character , and depending on remote contingencies for a profitabl&amp;*eturn of the investment ; so that the banks , in case of an emergency , contrary to the laws of sound banking , could scarcely command a dollar of their resources . All the other banks in the Union followed their example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession , or employed them in their own private speculations . They could not perceive why that privilege should be allowed the banks and not to themselves . The only expectation the banks had of finaUy returning the public funds was founded on a fortunate result of the speculations in which their debtors were engaged , and on their own nominal and spurious capital . The public officers had their own private fortunes , the fortunes oCtheir securities , and in like manner the fortunate results of the s p eculations in which they or their borrowers had engaged . And if the same rigid exactions were made of the one as of the other , the chances are in favor of the public officer , that he would pay a larger per cent . than the banks , on the public funds in their possession . At any rate , it is very natural that he should think so . And as there was no rule of justice by which the bank monopolist should enjoy such advantages over the individual ; and as there was no law prohibiting him from using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been set him ; and , along with all the rest of the world , plunged into every kind of speculation . A universal system of credit , from the reckless man of enterprise down to the day laborer , was created on the facilities furnished by the banks . And they thought themselves enabled to do so , in consequence of their connection with the Government , and their possession of the national resources . Every body was dealing on the credit of the banks , and the banks on the credit of the Government . It is obvious , therefore , that the very existence of this gossamer work depended on an undisturbed continuance of the existing relations between the partiea . But many of the Banking interest were not contented with the existing state of things . A few only of the fraternity enjoyed a monopoly that was designed for the whole . We should never have joined , ' said they , in a crusade against the Bank of the United States , could we have anticipated such results . We can not be satisfied with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' An equal distribution was therefore , agreed upon . An act was passed , requiring " that at least one ( deposite bank ) shall be selected in each State and Territory ; and that the Secretary of the Treasury shall not suffer to remain in any deposite bank an amount of public mc ys more than equal to threefourths of the amount of its capital stock actually paid in ; the Secretary was also required to see that the banks kept in their vaults such an amount of specie as shall be , in his opinion , necessary to render the said banks safe depositories of the public moneys . The operation of such provisions , which were intended , in the language of the act , " for purposes of equalization , " must be obvious to the commonest observer . To take the funds out of the natural channels of trade , where they had been accumulated , and distribute them among eight-and-twenty States and Territories ; to compel the banks to divide some forty millions of money among three-times the number of depositories ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of specie that might be considered safe by the Secretary of the Treasury , were operations of such severity as to test the strength of the soundest institutions , and to derange the best condition of the currency . If the mere transf&amp; of three or four millions , from the Bank of the United States to other depositories on the opposite side of the street , was sufficient to produce the panic , the distress , and the disasters of 1834 , how much more ruinous must have been the consequences of the law now // under consideration ? Out of their own mouths , therefore , we condemn them . Bu* this was not all . The banks had to go through the ordeal , above described , from June to January , 1837 . After that period they were required , within the space of nine months , to distribute thirty-seven millions of dollars among nil the States of the Union ; and , within two-thirds of that time , they actually distributed twenty-eight millions . This vast sum , which had been loaned to individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rnnsiftcativns of trade , was now suddenly to be *vithdrawn end scattered to the four winds . *This fund , so far as it might be used as a means of adjusting the delicate relations between the banks and their numerous debtors , which it had been mainly used in creating , was to be totally annihilated . Indeed , annihilation , a bonfire of the paper , or a sinking of them inthe ocean , would have been much better for the banks than the operation actually required . Boston , for example , was made to throw back into Maine , New Hampshire , and other places that trade with her , those funds which had accumulated there in the usual course of trade ; she was required to create a d*ebt against herself and subject herself to drafts , and that for specie too , from regions which , in the natural course of business , ought to be indebted to her . In this way , contrary to every known law of currency , New York city alone was required to *atte'r thirteen millions* or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , and Tennessee . But , notwithstanding that ruin was the inevitable consequence of so radical and disorganizing a law ; and though the banks were forewarned to prepare for its operations , yet , taken as a whole , they never made any preparations , took no precautions whatsoever to arrest the evils or to blunt the force of the shock that was coming upon them . In ead of reducing their business , as prudence , honesty , and a just regard to the welfare of the country would have suggested , their line of discounts , and their issues , were actually greater in the spring of 1837 , just before the suspension , than they were in the autumn preceding . While the laws of currency were totally deranged , and all the channels of business were billowing up from their deep foundations , the banks crowded all canvass , and madly pressed forward as thosab they were sailing on the bosom of a summer 's sea , fanned by the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed such a law , in the first instancefor they were alone concerned in it , with the exception of a few deluded friends of the people , who had been deceived by their doctrines-has always been a matter of astonishment to us . We never could account for them but on one principle , that so/tom God designs to destroy , he first makes mad-quesse Dens vult perdere , prius dement at . Believing that he had designed to save our Republic , as an example and a guide to the world , we fondly trusted that he was about to adopt their own chosen means as the instrument to crush the enemy which h d been cherished in its bosom , and to frighten away the vultures that had been feeding on its vitals . We had no commiseration , therefore , for the monied oligarchy , when , in 1837 , they brou0ht on themselves a train of calamities . And yet , indeed , they needed no commiseration . They had entire control over the legislation of the country , and knew very well how to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own folly and madness on the shoulders of the people . Had they not been conscious of their power , they never would have exercised , as they did , the high prerogatives of sovereignty* Some eight or nine hundred banks , having in their possession the currency of the country , resolved , by the common impulse and sympathy of interest , , and with a simultaneous movement , to depreciate that currency  --  to debase it , in some instances , ten , some twenty , and some thirty per cent . below the constitutional standard of value . This high-handed act of usurpation and tyranny was no sooner committed than the State Legislatures were assembled to sanction and justify it . If penalties and forfeitures were to be incurred for this outrage on the rights of the people , or if any restrictions had been imposed on the operations of the banks in any of the States , those were the places in which the Le islatures met to suspend the penalties and forfeitures , remove the restrictions , make depreciuted irredeemable bank papet // legaltender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by adopting it in the sninutest fractions of currency ; to magnify the necessities which were beyond the control of the banks , and had forced them into their present position ; and to praise their magnanimity and forbearance in shaving , and not crushing , the people . Good citizens of the United States , pause here for one moment , and reflect on the brief history of one year , extending from June , 1836 , to June , 1837 . Consider the dangerous and fatal precedent of distributing the surplus revenues among the States , as a means of corruption , a basis for incref. *ing banking , and a rich boon to be scrambled after by the wild schemes of ' internal improvemenL Consider how the public funds were scattered among the States and Territories , not with a regard to their safe-keeping and disbursement , but solely with regard to the avaricious demand of the banks . Consider the bold and reckless career of those institutions in the midst of known and acknowledged dangers . Consider , when those dangers could no longer be avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws and penalties , violate their faith and obligations to the country , and rely on their own omnipotence for protection and justification . And consider , above all , the unanimous voice with which your representatives resolved to accept the proffered bribe ; and with what alacrity they came together to praise , justify , and sustain all the subsequent acts of bank usurpation . Can any man reflect seriously on these things and be not satisfied that all power has departed from the people . and is lodged in the hands of a inonied oligarchy i Then would be not be convinced , though one rose from the dead . But the chronicle of their deeds is not yet complete . After debasing the currency , violating every legal or moral obligation binding upon them ; and while calling together their liege subjects and willing friends to register such edicts as they might prescribe in the premises , they had the audacity to demand that the Federal Government also should continue to receive their depreciated paper , and retain the banks as the agents to collect , transfer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , finally , threats of violence mid revolution , were resorted to as means of intimidating the Executive , and forcing them to accept the immoral , fraudulent , and debasing terms of the oligarchy . The President pointed them to the Constitution , which recognised nothing but gold and silver as a legal tender ; and to the laws , which would receive nothing but gold and silver , or their equivalesst. ii* payment of the public dues . But it was all in vain . Men who regarded such obligations as mere cob-webs , to be brushed aside whenever they stood in the way of their interest or their advaneement , could not conceive how others were so scrupulous in their observanee . Their clamor and denunciation grew louder and louder . They even had the cunning and the adroitness to cast en the Executive the odium of their own acts . Having debased their paper below the constitutional standard , they thereby created two currencies  --  the better for the Government , and the baser for the people  --  and made the salaries of Government Gificers ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominal amount received by the people . This odious distinction was charged on the President ; he was charged with the design of ruining the people , and of fattening an army of officeholders on their misfortunes . Happily for the country , however , the President was possessed of a wisdom and a firmness which eminently fitted him for the crisis of the times . His duty was plain before him , and he steadily pursued it . He directed circulars to be sent to all the collectors , receivers , and disbursing officers , commanding that nothing but gold and silver , or its equivalent , shall be received in payment of public dues , or disbursed in payment of public creditors ; and when Congress assembled in September , 1837 , he recommended a total separation of bank and Statea complete divorce of Government from the embraces of the whole banking system . This measure constitutes the second *rand epoch in the History ef the Revolution through which we are now passing . The high tower of the oligarchy , their bastile of strength , had been hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken from them ; but xvth the insUn*t of self-p reservation they rallied // on the thousand other corporations prepared to their hand , seized the reins of Government , and were well nigh overturning the institutions , and crushing the liberties of the people , when by one false move they stumbled and fell . At that critical juncture , at that providential period , the President of the United States , truly representing the fi*elings and the interests of the people , lifted up the constitutional standard7 and called on all who loved their country to come to the rescue , and save it from destruction . Until this crisis in their affairs , the oligarchy had always been divided in their councils , and estran ed from eac*a other in their t*elings . Those who had sustained the Bank of the United States*ere angry with that portion of the fraternity who joined in putting it down , in order to build up their own petty institutions , and to usurp that authority which properly belongs to a National Institution . The minor interests on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should again wrest from them tthe power they felt themselves happy in having obtained ; but the whole craft was now endangered Recent events had opened the eyes of the people , and they showed a determination to bring back that power which , by the laws of nature , and by their own Constitution , was vested in them ; but which , for nearly fifty years , had been lodged in the hands of associated wealth . In this state of things the oligarchy were not long in coming to their conclusions . They might quarrel with each other over the spoils in the hour of triumph and security , but a common danger from without would soon bring them together for mutual defence . Differing in no principle whatever , and slightly only in the detail of their measures , the one advocating a United States Bank , the other a United States Banking System , the two wings of this great interest were resolved that their little rivalries for power and for interest should not be an obstacle in the way of a union against the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a total divorce , all petty fends were buried . Pilate and Herod made friends-entered into a close union-formed an alliance offensive and defensive , and have been ever since zealously cooperating to effect the same object  --  a re-union of the Government with the banking interest . Notwithstanding the total failure of all their schemes ; notwithstanding it was obvious as day that the operations of their own hand had brought the calamities upon them , yet the Conservative wing of the oligarchy insisted that the specie circular had done all the mischief ; patched up another scheme of five and twenty banks , without doubt , embracing the old United States Bank , and urged that upon Congress for their adoption . They insisted that Government should take it in their embraces-place their confidence in it , and thereby restore confidence in the people . If the Government refused to do this , they declared it would shake the credit of the banks , and of bank paper ; paralyze their ability to assist the energies of the people in recovering from the recent shock , and postpone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oligarchy , wl*o in former years , when this scheme was opposed to their own , condemned and ridiculed it , were now loud in its praises , and recommended it as a panacea to heal the maladies of the country . The Representatives of the people , however , awoke from the lethargy of long years , refused to adopt any such system . Yet none of the predicted evils have come to pass . Many of the banks finding that the Executive resolutely persisted in adhering to the constitution and the laws , and steadily refused having any dealings with them or their debased currency ; finding that their friends in Congress were not strong enough to force him from that position ; and perceiving that public sentiment was rising against them , resolved immediately to fail back into their usual channels of business , and commence the curtailment and redemption of their paper issues . Mr. Biddle , however , entrenched himself behind his cotton bags , and declared that he would not resume until the Government abandoned its position . All the banks South and West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to follow his example . But he , at length yielding to the considerations of interest , resumed specie payments // that he might consummate a favorable contract with the Oovernment , which they refused to complete until his notes were made equivalent to specie , and his vaults a legal depository , by a resumption of specie payment . Again following his example , all the banks South and West attempted to resume . Now we call on the people to bear in mind the history of this transaction  --  to treasure it up as a precious truth to be of infinite service hereafter . That by a steady adherence to the constitutional standard on the part of the Government , the banks have been compelled to come up to that standard . Their obvious d*ign was to force the Government down to their level ; to constrain them , as they had done the States , to legalize bank paper , and to receive and pay it out to public creditors . Let us suppose , for a moment , they had succeeded in the accomplishment of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the Atlantic States bank paper was depreciated about ten per cent . In the South and West it was depreciated , in many instances , five-and-twenty per cent . If the Government then had consented to receive hank paper , a nominal payment of one hundred dollars in the Atlantic States would have amounted to ni ty dollars when valued by the constitutional standard a similar payment in the South and West , estimated in the same way , would have amounted to seventy-five dollars  --  a loss in the one case of a tenth , and in the other , ofa fourth of the entire revenue . Public creditors would have been paid in the same unequal proportions . Not to speak of the unconstitutionality and injustice of such a course , what effect would it have had on the morals and temper of the people i Every one would strive to make the best of such a state of things , and to derive from it all the advantages he could . There would be the strongest inducement to all the States to depreciate their currency as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same level by the Government . The constitutional standard being lost sight of ; and the banks no longer required to keep their issues within a certain ratio to the precious metals on hand , would pour forth their paper rags without stint , until one dollar in silver would be worth a hundred , then two hundred , then four , then five hundred , constantly sinking until finally the whole would come down a dead mass , and involve the honest farmers and laborers in utter ruin . Such were the consequences of excessive issues of continental money during the Revolution ; and of assignats in France ; and such would have been the consequences of the measures proposed and urged by the banks and their friends at the time of the suspension . And to such a condition are they resolved at last to bring us . At no period of pecuniary derangement and disaster , was the disproportion between bank issues and the specie for its redemption greater than at the present moment . The banks are immersed in a debt of more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment 's notice may drain the country of all its specie on a demand of foreign capitalists . From a tabular statement of the returns of the local banks throughout the United States , received at the Treasury Department , for the period nearest January , 1839 , it appears that the loans , discounts , and circulation of the banks there enumerated , exceeded the total amount of redemption specie by four hundred and seventy millions of dollars . The necessary results are beginning to appear , banks are suspending and blowing up in every section of the Union . A sky-rocket at regular intervals is shot into the heavens as a signal of distress . Alarmed agitation pervades the whole fraternity , and at no distant period we may look for another panic and general prostration . But notwithstanding these threatening signs of the times , the bank mania is evidently on the increase . We daily hear from the State Legislatures , of new creations of banks , and enlargement of the capital of old ones , and the incorporation of internal improvement companies with banking privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has recently been given by the introduction of what is called the freebanking system . Be it known that we are friendly to a free banking system based on specie and real capital , and confined strictly to trading and commercial purposes . But the free banking system now in fashion is the monst rune horrendum of this present Revolution , and is destined to play more havoc with the // morals , fortunes , and liberties of the people , than the famed guillotine with the heads of men . Judging of its spirit and final development from what has already been done , we may fairly infer that issues of this new invention will in a short time equal in nominal value the entire property , both personal and real , of the whole Union . Mortgages on real estate , negroes , and stocks , thereby embracing every kind of property , will be made the basis of banking operatipus ; and every one fearing that his neighbor may derive more advantages from iNhan himself , will eagerly pledge his fortune , and press into the scheme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entangled with each other in paper credits in some form or other , to the entire amount of property in the country . Now , when we consider that a circulating medium sufficient for all business purposes is only required to bear a certain ratio1 one-fifth or one-twentieth , as some make it , to the annual productions  --  a currency such as ours is destined to be ,  --  equaling in nominal value-not only the annual productions , but the entire property of the community , both personal and real , must sink down of its own weight ; its enormous over proportions must crumble it in , and crush it into a mass of ruins . The whole circulation must become spurious and worthlessa world of promises without the intention or capacity of fulfilment  --  a bottomless gulf of falsehoods , in which all things , public and private , are doomed to sink and disappear . But do the original inventors of the falsehood , the cunning forger of the lies , suffer the smart of their detection and protest ? Oh , no ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the result . Lies , and the burthen of evil , they bring are passed on , shifted from back to back , and from rank to rank  --  and so land ultimately on the hard labourinb mass who with spade and mattock , with sore heart and empty wallet , daily come in contact with reality  --  and cesn pass the cheat no furl her . Then will the tyrant come , and , like another Neptune , will ride over the troubled billows , wave his omnipotent trident , bid the waters cease their commotions , roll back into the caves , and be hushed , and forever after will reign in undisputed sway with a rod of iron . Such will be the end of the Revolution , dimly shadowed forth because the reality has yet to come . But if the events do not fulfil our words , then say we are false prophets , and have not rightly warned the people ; yet we are deepl*r impressed with a consciousness that the truth only has been delineated , and unless the people take heed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will not heed our voice of *varning , we pray them to learn wisdom from their own experience . Look hack on the history of the oligarchy for the last fifty years , such as we have portrayed , it and such as we know it to have been , and what do we find ? Repeated acts of violence on the constitution ; a continued prostitution of the laws for selfish and fraudulent purposes  --  and a total perversion of Government to the oppression and ruin of the people , and the aggrandisement of themselves . Our fathers declared , even before the constitution was formed , that the principles and the favorite measures of the oligarchy " were incompatible with the public safety , totally destructive of that equality which ought to prevail in a republic . ' The bitter experience of half a century has impressed upon us the truth of their anticipations , yet we linger ! still hesitate to go forward and meet the lowering front of the enemy . Are you prepared then , sons of America ! tamely to yield up the hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your fathers , won by their blood and treasure . Are you prepared as degenerate sons to receive the chains which are fording for you ? To bow in willing submission to the yoke inimical interests are about to bind upon your necks . If your hearts have not been tamed by long years of usurpation , and your spirits enervated by the degeneracy of the times ; if you still love liberty , and the blessings of independence , and are willing to lift a hand in their defence , then come and rally around the standard of the Constitution . That has been planted on a rock-eternal as the rock of aes-truth , justice , and the ri , hts of man-principles understood , felt , and praetised by your fathers , and bequeathed to you as the greatest blessings that could be conferred by a race of patriots , heroes , and statesmell. // Amidst the difficulties that beset us , and in view of the dangers that threaten , in those eternal principles alone can we find safety ; on them alone we may repose with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have but little understood them , never practised them . From the foundation of the Government , you have been in the hands of an oligarchy , lead , duped , deceived by them .

What are the doctrines of the Constitution on that great question now before youwhich for forty years has been the source of endless perplexities , and has at length come up for decision-which peculiarly constitutes the crisis of the times , and on which the great battle for independence and dominion has to be fought ? As truth always is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require that legislation shall not be perverted from the common defence and general welfare , to promote the interests of a few sections , classes , or individuals ; that no more revenues shall be collected than are necessary for the economical administration of a Government limited to a few general and specified objects ; that they shall be collected in actual values , gold and silver , and not in spurious promises ; shall be safely kept by sworn and chosen officers of the Government , under high penalties for the faithful discharge of their duties ; shall not be long retained or accumulated , so as to be a temptation to the officer to use , and to the representative to misapply them ; but promptly employed for the purposes they were collected , and thence returned into the ordinary channels of trade . These are the principles of the Constitution , which must bring home conviction to every mind ; these are the doctrines the present Administration have embraced as their own , on which they have staked their salvation , and now call upon the people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuredly will they come . Can any one hesitate I Is there one so besotted by the delusions of party , so entangled in its meshes , that he is afraid to venture on these simple truths ? Then let him go ; he is unworthy the name of a freeman . Afraid to trust the principles of the Constitution ! As well might the Christian be afraid of his Bible . When the spirit of reformation comes upon the church , after long years of corruption and heresy , where does she look for guides to lead her through the mazes of a tangled labyrinth  --  to the practices and homilies of fallible , designing men , or to the oracles of inspiration ? And in this day of political corruption and heresy , the spirit of reformation has seized on the people , and to the oracles of the Constitution must they look for their guides .

Shall this , the only spot on earth where man enjoys the high behests of Heaven , and marches onward to fulfil the laws of his creation , cease to glory in its privileges ; the star of hope to all aati*s be blotted from the firmament ; and the peace and good will on earth ordained , of God , be put far back unto generations yet unborn ? These are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewels cast on the uncertain tide of this revolution . Conscious of the awful wagers staked upon the issue , the arch-enemy of truth and human kind , the grand hierareb of apostacy , plies every enginery that malice or the dread of falling fortunes can invent , to dupe and draw into his train states and principalities , and men of every grade , regardless of the means , as is his wont , so that the end maybe obtained . Amid the many thousands who have fallen a prey to his seductive arts , and the shrewd appliances of private ends and selfish interests , there is one at least who proves a faithful Abdiel . Among the faithless , faithful only he ; Among the innumerable , false , unmoved , Unshaken , unseduced , unterrified ! Nor number , nor example with him wrought To swerve from troth , or change his constant mind , Though single . From amidst them forth he passed , And with retorted scorn his back he turned On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed ! And who is this faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorning to hold allegiance with apostacy ; foremost in the rank he moves , bearing aloft a fit emblem of the State he is proud to serve ; a goddess erect and calm , though treading chains and tyranny beneath her feet ; a banner , which never waved o er craven hearts or faltering lines ; a surer harbinger of victory than the Prior 's sacred relique , on uplifted spear , in Flodden field . Renowned old commonwealth ! Ancientest , purest , noblest , of the train of vestal sisters , who feed the flame on freedom 's altar ! When first the tyrant came , with holy zeal , she fought against him , and flung upon the breeze her thrilling war-cry , Give sue liberty or give me death ! which now is echoed bae.k with cheerful voice by herthousand sons . First , to read aright the charter of human liberties , and pluck it from the grasp of ruthless enemies ; again , she comas to save it from pervertion and the taint of treacherous friends . Ever prodigal of her wealth and ofher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deeds and sacrifice ; and yet , above them all , she values most , virtue , honor , and the sacred cause of truth . Scorning selfishness and low ambition , one end alone she seeks-tIme common good . Who fails to study that , although her son , she will repudiate . Even now a lesson she is teaching , fraught with more of good to human kind than all the lessons of the schools  --  a lesson which the world must learn are Government cnn rest on sure and just foundations-that law and troth , and principle alone , not feeble man , must be a nation 's guide ; that no distinction , eminence or service , can compensate the loss of those great truths of which she is alike the guardian and the foster mother.
