INTRODUCTORY REMARKS , BY THE PUBLISHER . Among the evils which a vitiated appetite has fastened upon mankind , those that arise from the use of Tobacco hold a prominent place , and call loudly for reform . We pity the poor Chinese , who stupifies body and mind with opium , and the wretched Hindoo , who is under a similar slavery to his favorite plant , the Betel ; but we present the humiliating spectacle of an enlightened and christian nation , wasting annually more than twenty-five millions of dollars , and destroying the health and the lives of thousands , by a practice not at all less degrading than that of the Chinese or Hindoo . Whether , then , we consider the folly and indecency of the habit , or the waste of property , health and life which it occasions , it is time for the Patriot , the Philanthropist and the Christian , to put forth united , vigorous and systematic efforts to banish this injurious and disgusting habit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform not only prepares the way for another , but often so depends upon it , that the complete triumph of the one can not be effected without that of the other . Such appears to be the relationship existing between the use of intoxicating drinks and that of the stimulating narcotic , tobacco . The use of tobacco almost always accompanies the use of alcoholic drinks , and it may be feared that total abstinence from the latter will not be permanent , unless there is also a total abstinence from the former . Our temperance brethren , particularly our worthy Washingtonians , will do well to bear this in mind . The tobacco reform , being similar to that of temperance , must be brought about by similar means . Information must be diffused , the evils of the practice exposed , and the attention of the public aroused to the subject . To aid in this , is the object of the following pamphlet , two editions of which have already been put in circulation , and it is said to have been re-published in England . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repeated editorial remarks , and the numerous letters of thanks addressed to the author , affords much encouragement for a vigorous prosecution of the enterprise . Three members of the church of which the author is pastor , placed at his disposal a sum sufficient to supply , gratuitously , each of the 1000 Beneficiaries of the American Education Society , with a copy of the essay . Orders were furnished for bundles for distribution . An individual in Maine ordered 500 copies , and 1000 were ordered by E. C. Delevan , of New York , the distinguished advocate of Temperance . Let the friends of true reform remember the early days of the temperance cause , and take courage . All interested should exert themselves . Clergymen can do much by lecturing and other means . Churches should form Anti-Tobacco Societies , circulate information and induce as many as possible to take a stand against the evil , by enrolling their names on a Pledge . Teachers should speak on the subject , and endeavor to prevent the formation of so vile and tyranical a habit , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lads in many of our public schools try to hasten their claims to manliness , by learning to chew , smoke or snuff . This being the case , we may expect , of course , to find these practices prevalent in our academies and colleges , our medical and our law schools and theological seminaries . In the early records of Harvard University , says Dr. Mussey , is a regulation ordering that " no scholar shall take tobacco unless permitted by the President , with the consent of his parents , on good reason first given by a physician , and then only in a sober and private manner . " How different now ! Probably one half , at least , of the students of our colleges are , not in a " sober and private manner , " but publicly addicted to this slovenly and disgusting practice . As the use of tobacco is injurious to health , it is the duty of physicians to exert their influence against it . Their authority upon such subjects is generally respected , and is therefore very important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a word , in order to secure their aid in a reform that so intimately concerns themselves . In this matter , as in the vice of intemperance , woman , though comparatively innocent , is by far the greatest sufferer . With what a melancholy prospect does a young lady marry a man who uses the filthy plant in any form . He may at first do it in a neat , or even a genteel manner , and neutralize the sickening odor by the most grateful perfumes ; but this trouble will soon be dispensed with , and in all probability he will , at no distant day , become a sloven , with his garments saturated with smoke , and himself steeped in tobacco juice . Alas , to think of being annoyed a life-time by the nauseous odor of the vile tobacco worm , and of wasting patience and strength in vain endeavors to preserve neatness in his slimy trail ! Little can be accomplished in this , or any other reform , without the aid of females . Let them take hold of the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon be corrected ; young men and old too , will soon learn that by no rule in the code of politeness and good breeding , can the use of tobacco be tolerated . A word to dealers . How can a man who regards the morals , the happiness and the prosperity of his neighborhood and his country , deal out so useless , so filthy , and so injurious an article as tobacco ? Many will of course , excuse themselves by saying as the rum-sellers once did , " If I do n't sell it , others will , " This plea did not justify the rum-seller , neither will it , the dealer in tobacco . Others will say , " I must sell it , or I shall offend my patrons and lose their custom . " But this is not valid even as a selfish argument . A large and increasing portion of the community would be glad to patronize traders who sell only the useful and necessary articles of life . Let respectable traders cease to sell the article , and respectable customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the practice of using tobacco , is a sufficient argument to induce all decent people to wage war against it . Stage coaches , rail cars , steamboats , public houses , courts of justice , halls of legislation , and the temples of God , are all defiled by the loathsome consumers of this dirty , Indian herb . For the sake of decency , for the honor of humanity , let the land be purified from this worse than beastly pollution ! Let none be discouraged from engaging in this reform , because it relates to a wide-spread and fashionable vice . With a moderate degree of effort in each town and village , hundreds of thousands might in one year 's time , be induced to pledge themselves against all use of tobacco . During the last winter I drew up the following pledge , and obtained many signatures here and in other parts of the state . ANTI-TOBACCO PLEDGE . We , the subscribers , believing that the use of TOBACCO , in all its forms , is injurious to health , and knowing it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do pledge ourselves that we will not SMOKE it , CHEW it , nor SNUFF it ; and that we will use efforts to persuade those addicted to the practice , to discontinue its use ; and above all , that we will not traffic in it , nor countenance those who do ; and that we will use our influence to banish the " vile stuff " from New England , our country , and the world . A gentleman in North Bridgewater , to whom I lent a pamphlet on this subject , said he had not read it half through , before he emptied his pockets of tobacco , and resolved to use no more . He also took a pledge to circulate among his neighbors . Another man who had chewed tobacco thirty-three years , abandoned the habit and remarked that he would not return to it for fifty dollars . Two benevolent individuals , in Providence , had two or three hundred copies of the above pledge printed to circulate in the State of Rhode Island . One of the principal clergymen in P. said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that the money paid for tobacco in the city was sufficient to support the public preaching . A gentleman there , who has recently given up tobacco , said he would not go back to its use for a thousand dollars , although it cost him a great effort to refrain from it . A young man , after receiving a private lecture from an anti-tobacco friend , committed to the flames half a dozen cigars he had by him , and signed the pledge . I have conversed with very many addicted to the use of tobacco , and nearly all express regret at having formed the habit . A few days since in a town not far from Providence , as I was sitting in the stage about starting for the city , up came a reverend gentleman , a very fine man by the way , with a big cigar about half burned . He had too much good breeding to get into the stage with it , and to all appearance , disliked to part with so good a friend ; he accordingly stood outside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping an eye on the driver ; when all was ready , he scrambled in , and we drove off . What an example , for a clergyman to stand in a public street and puff a cigar like a loafer or a blackguard ! Rev. Mr. C. , in a village adjoining Providence relates , that a brother clergyman called to preach for him . He was in the habit of chewing tobacco , and Mr. C. took the opportunity to speak to him on the subject . At first the brother remarked that there was nothing wrong or injurious in it ; but on Mr. C 's pressing the matter and asking how he could preach " righteousness , temperance " and good habits in all things , when he was himself addicted to such a practice , the brother frankly acknowledged that he knew he was setting a bad example , and that tobacco was poisonous , injurious to health and shortened life , but he excused himself by saying he could not give it up , for he found it impossible to write a sermon or preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preaching inspired by tobacco ! What better is this , than the inspiration of brandy ? Rev. Mr.  --   --  , now of Boston , formerly of a neighboring city , is a most excessive smoker and chewer , so much so that it was a matter of notoriety and remark among his congregation and acquaintances of his former residence . He was a very agreeable man in other respects , but his study , his library , and every thing about him were so completely saturated with tobacco smoke , that the ladies of his church rarely made him a call , and more rarely borrowed a book from his extensive and excellent library .  --  Is it not time for clergymen to reform themselves in this particular , and then consistently to set about reforming others . I have recently learned that many ladies are in the habit of chewing snuff ! Some of them become so addicted to it as to use enormous quantities in this way . " One of these snuff eaters , " I was told , " was accustomed to take herself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb and four fingers of the other to fill in an embankment between her lips and teeth . " Shocking ! Yet , what young lady who carries a concealed snuff-box , can be sure of not coming to this ? I saw a woman who commenced with chewing snuff , and is now a regular tobacco chewer . She said however , that she intended to give up the habit and refrain from tobacco in all its forms . Unless something is done to check the evil , who can say that we shall not become as bad as the inhabitants of Cuba , where , according to Rev. Mr. Ingersoll , " not only men , but women and children smoke , and some at a large expense . " And according to Rev. Dr. Abbot , " it was the common estimate that in Havana , there was an average consumption of ten thousand dollars worth of cigars in a day . " BOSTON , July , 1842 . RECOMMENDATIONS .

This is a very valuable and instructive discourse . We have for two years or more been fully convinced that the use of tobacco , in its three common forms , ought immediately to be abandoned ; but never were we so fully sensible of the alarming extent and tremendous ravages of this evil , as when we had read this production . We think no christian , who is willing to know and do his duty , can read this pamphlet , without saying on the spot , if he uses tobacco , ( except it be judiciously prescribed by a physician. ) the use of this poisonous , deleterious weed is a grievous sin , and I will abandon it immediately and forever .

From our own observation , limited as it has been , we are persuaded that the victims of intemperance in the use of this poisonous weed are by no means inconsiderable in number . Probably Mr. Fowler is correct when he estimates the mortality occasioned by the use of tobacco in its various forms , at five thousand annually . For ourself we are convinced that the suppression of intemperance in spirituous liquors will never be effected while the agents and advocates of our Temperance Societies , lecture with a pinch of snuff in their fingers and a huge tobacco quid in their mouths .

" DISQUISITION . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being done to drive away the darkness and delusions of many generations , and to diffuse light and truth through the earth ; it excites the liveliest joy in every philanthropic bosom to witness the triumphant results already achieved . Recent efforts to banish the use of intoxicating drinks , have brought well nigh half the civilized world to a solemn pause : and the work of reformation in this matter of spirit-drinking has gone so far , and is yet making such sure progress , that many are rejoicing in the lively hope that the day is nigh , even at the doors , when drunkenness , with her burning legion of evils , will cease from the earth ; and the gospel of the grace of God will have free course and be glorified , and the whole family of man become temperate , holy and happy . The God of our salvation hasten that day apace ; that our eyes may see it , and rejoice and be glad in it , before we go to the grave . But ere that day shall fully come , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must yet be fought ,  --  many a victory must yet be won . Much light must yet be poured forth ,  --  much darkness must yet be driven away . The world is not yet half reformed . The majority in the best portions of the earth  --  in this country even  --  are on the side of free indulgence in every thing that pleases the appetite . Intemperance in the use of intoxicating drinks ,  --  and intemperance in the use of tobacco , in the several forms of smoking , snuffing and chewing ; together with several other evils , which I need not here specify , are even now predominant . By intemperance in the use of tobacco , I mean all use of this drug except that which is under the direction of enlightened , judicious medical advice . With this exception , entire abstinence from this narcotic substance constitutes the only safe and genuine temperance .  --  This principle has been adopted extensively , in its application to intoxicating drinks ; but before it shall be universally adopted in that application , it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pipe , and the snuff-box . Rum-drinking will not cease , till tobacco-chewing , and tobacco-smoking , and snuff-taking , shall cease . Though all who are attached to the quid , the pipe , or the snuff-box , are not attached to the bottle ; yet a vast multitude become attached to the bottle , and this attachment is continued and increased , through the poisonous , bewitching , and debasing influence of tobacco . Moreover , the use of tobacco involves a train of evils , superadded to its influence in perpetuating drunkenness , which cries aloud for immediate and universal reformation . It is my present purpose to consider these evils . And I wish to premise that , in this consideration , I shall urge ; that it is the duty of every friend of humanity  --  of every lover of his country  --  of every Christian  --  and of every minister of Christ , to abstain , himself , immediately , and forever , from all use of tobacco , whether by chewing , smoking , or snuffing , except it be medicinally ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example to persuade others  --  and especially the young men and maidens of this nation  --  to practice entire abstinence . I am fully aware that the topic which I have selected , the position which I lay down , and the purpose at which I aim , are not popular . But what then ? Did Clarkson and Wilberforce abandon the cause of the enslaved African , when they found that abolition was unpopular in the British Senate ? Did Columbus abandon his purpose of attempting to discover a new world , when he perceived that the noble project of his noble soul was unpopular , with princes and people , learned and ignorant ? Did Jesus Christ abandon his purpose to redeem a world lying in wickedness , when it became manifest that his doctrines , and the pure benevolence of his holy soul , were unpopular . And has it ever been seemly for one of his true and faithful disciples to abandon the cause of human happiness , and the soul 's everlasting salvation , because the work of saving mercy is unpopular ? The theme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should not , we will not , therefore abandon the purpose of exposing the evils of smoking , and chewing , and snuffing , that dirty weed , which is so hostile to animal life , and so offensive to every creature on earth , that no living being but man  --  and a loathsome worm , called the tobacco-worm  --  will taste , or touch , or handle it . A A It has recently been affirmed that there is a dirty goat in South America which will eat this dirty plant . Though it be unpopular to expose the evils of using tobacco ; these evils are so appalling , it will not do to slumber over them longer .  --  We must look at them ; we must lay them open  --  we must raise our voice against them ; ( we would gladly raise it so high that it should reach every family in the nation . ) Yes , we must cry aloud and spare not ; or give up our claim to patriotism , and benevolence . In approaching this subject , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old habits . Dr. Rush speaks of a venerable clergyman who closed a long sermon , in which he had controverted what he supposed an heretical opinion , with these words : " I tell you  --  I tell you , my brethren , I tell you again , that an old error is better than a new truth . " There are few who will assent to this proposition in plain terms ; but there are thousands upon thousands , who act up to the very letter of it , constantly .  --  The history of man is extensively a history of folly , delusion , and sin . No error has been so absurd as not to find advocates  --  no habit has been so foolish , or so deadly , as not to find martyrs . But of all the delusions , which have prevailed among civilized men , there have been few  --  perhaps none , but that of intoxication  --  so disgusting , so inexcusable , so destructive to health , and wealth , and life , as the habit which we now ask you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position is this ; it is the bounden duty of every man and every woman to abstain , immediately , and forever , from all use of tobacco , whether by chewing , smoking , or snuffing except it be as a medicine . This position I maintain , I. From a consideration of the history of this loathsome weed .  --  The tobacco plant is a native of America . It was unknown in Europe until some time after the discovery of America , by Columbus . It was first carried to Europe by Sir Francis Drake , about the year 1560 , less than three hundred years ago . The natives of this continent called it petun ; the natives of the islands called it yoli . The Spaniards gave it the name of tobacco , from Tobaco , a province of Yucatan in Mexico , where they first found it , and first learned its use . Its botanic name is Nicotiana , which it received from John Nicot , then Ambassador from Francis II . to Portugal , who brought it from Lisbon , and presented some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Grand Prior of the house of Lorraine ; whence it was sometimes called the Queen 's herb , and the Grand Prior 's herb . The practice of smoking it in England , was introduced by Sir Walter Raleigh , about the year 1584 . The cultivation of it is not uncommon in various parts of the globe ; but the seat of its most extensive culture is Virginia and Maryland , in this country . In England its cultivation was forbidden  --  and we believe is still forbidden  --  on penalty of forfeiting forty shillings for every rod of ground planted with it . James I. wrote a treatise against the use of it , which he called his " Counterblast to Tobacco . " Pope Urban VIII . issued a Bull , to excommunicate all who used tobacco in the churches . The civil power in Russia , Turkey , and Persia , was early arrayed against it . The King of Denmark , who wrote a treatise against tobacco , observes that " merchants often lay it in bog-houses , that , becoming impregnated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisker , stronger , and more foetid . " It is said to be a fact , that in manufacturing tobacco , it is frequently sprinkled with stale urine . The use of tobacco never was general in Europe ; and within the last fifty or one hundred years , it has been banished from all the polite circles of that part of the world . John Adams , the former President of the United States , speaking of his own use of tobacco , and referring to his residence in Europe , says : " Twice I gave up the use of it ; once when Minister at the Court of Hague ; and afterwards when Minister at the Court of London ; for no such offensive practice is seen there . " But although the cultivation of tobacco has been forbidden in many countries of Europe ; and though the manufacture of it is frequently attended with circumstances so disgusting and offensive , that the modesty of this paper will not permit me to detail them ,  --  and though the use of it is abandoned by all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , and among the lower orders abroad , tobacco has triumphed : and the only hope of expelling it from our land , lies in enlisting against it the power of enlightened public opinion  --  a mightier power than any eastern despot wields . Now from this brief sketch of the history of tobacco , it appears that it was unknown to all the civilized world , till within three hundred years ; and that even now , all the polished and enlightened portion of community abroad  --  and we add , a very respectable portion at home  --  have no fellowship with the filthy weed . And can any man justify himself in the daily use of a disgusting plant , against the practice , opinion , and remonstrances of so large a portion of the civilized world ? Can he be discharging the obligations of his duty , and enjoying the full amount of his privilege , while he suffers himself to be a bond-slave to his quid , his pipe , or his snuff-box ? Either an important article of the vegetable kingdom , lay hid from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its discovery , the lovers of tobacco have formed an entirely erroneous opinion of its properties . In the sequel , I trust it will appear , that so far from possessing valuable properties , it is one of the most noxious weeds that grows ; that , as an article of medicine , it possesses scarcely a redeeming quality ; and that , though it was not made in vain , if the world had remained ignorant of it six thousand years longer , no cause of regret would have been occasioned . I maintain the position I have laid down , II . From a consideration of the ruinous effects of tobacco upon the health and constitution of men . In considering this point , let us examine the properties of this weed ,  --  the prominent diseases which the use of it induces ,  --  and the experiences of unprejudiced observers . The properties of tobacco are decidedly poisonous . In proof of this assertion , I appeal to ample and unquestionable authority . Professor Hitchcock says , " I group alcohol , opium and tobacco together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being poisonous in their natures . " " In popular language , " says he , " alcohol is classed among the stimulants , and opium and tobacco among the narcotics , whose ultimate effect upon the animal system is to produce stupor and insensibility . " He says , " Most of the powerful vegetable poisons , such as hen-bane , hemlock , thorn-apple , prussic acid , deadly night-shade , fox-glove and poison sumach , have an effect on the animal system scarcely to be distinguished from that of opium and tobacco . They impair the organs of digestion , and may bring on fatuity , palsy , delirium , or apoplexy , " He says , " In those not accustomed to it , tobacco excites nausea , vomiting , dizziness , indigestion , mental dejection , and in short , the whole train of nervous complaints . " Dr. Rees , in his Cyclopedia , says ; " A drop or two of the chemical oil of tobacco , being put upon the tongue of a cat , produces violent convulsions , and death itself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with opium , ether , mercury , and other articles of the materia medica . He calls tobacco a " fashionable poison , " in the various forms in which that narcotic is employed .  --  He says , " The great increase of dyspepsia ; the late alarming frequency of apoplexy , palsy , epilepsy , and other diseases of the nervous system ; is attributable , in part , to the use of tobacco . " Dr. Waterhouse says that Linnaeus , in his natural arrangement , has placed tobacco in the class Luridae  --  which signifies , pale , ghastly , livid , dismal and fatal . " To the same ominous class , " he adds , " belong fox-glove , hen-bane , deadly night-shade , lobelia , and another poisonous plant , bearing the tremendous name Atropa , one of the furies . " He says , " When tobacco is taken into the stomach for the first time , it creates nausea and extreme disgust . If swallowed , it excites violent convulsions of the stomach and of the bowels to eject the poison either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entirety ejected , it produces great anxiety , vertigo , faintness , and prostration of all the senses ; and , in some instances , death has followed . " The oil of this plant , he adds , is one of the strongest vegetable poisons , insomuch that we know of no animal that can resist its mortal effects . Moreover , says Dr. Waterhouse , after a long and honorable course of practice , " I never observed so many pallid faces , and so many marks of declining health ; nor ever knew so many hectical habits , and consumptive affections , as of late years ; and I trace this alarming inroad on young constitutions , principally to the pernicious custom of smoking cigars . " Professor Graham says " Tobacco is one of the most powerful and deadly poisons in the vegetable kingdom . " " Its effects on the living tissues of the animal system , " he adds , " are always to destroy life ; as the experiments made on pigeons , cats , and other animals abundantly prove . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in fact an absolute poison . A very moderate quantity introduced into the system , even applying the moistened leaves to the stomach , has been known very suddenly to extinguish life . In whatever form it may be employed , a portion of the active principles of tobacco , mixed with the saliva , invariably finds its way to the stomach , and disturbs or impairs the functions of that organ . Hence most , if not all , who are accustomed to the use of tobacco , labor under dyspeptic symptoms . Our advice is to desist immediately and entirely from the use of tobacco in every form , and in any quantity , however small . A reform , to be efficacious , must be entire and complete . " Dr. Warren says , " The common belief that tobacco is beneficial to the teeth , is entirely erroneous ; on the contrary , by its poisonous and relaxing qualities , it is positively injurious . " Says another physician , " Though snuff has been prescribed for the head-ache , catarrh , and some species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cases where its use is continued , it not only fails of its medical effect , but commits great ravages on the whole nervous system , superinducing hypochondria , tremors , a thickening of the voice , and premature decay of all the intellectual powers . " As a diuretic , Dr. Fowler , and others , have found it in some cases to be valuable . Its narcotic properties have sometimes assuaged the tooth-ache ; but it always hastens the destruction of the teeth . But of all substances in pharmacy , there seems to be a general agreement among medical writers , that tobacco , though occasionally beneficial , is the most unmanageable , and used with the least confidence . A multitude of cases , confirming these views , have actually occurred ; two or three of which I will cite . A clergyman , who commenced the use of tobacco in youth , says , " that no very injurious consequences were experienced till he entered the ministry , when his system began to feel its dreadful effects . His voice , his appetite , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickness at the stomach , indigestion , emaciation , melancholy , and a prostration of the whole nervous system . All this , " says he , " I attribute to the pernicious habit of smoking and chewing tobacco . " At length he abandoned the quid and the pipe . His voice , appetite , and strength were soon restored ; all aches subsided , and in a little time general health was enjoyed . Another clergyman writes , " I thank God , and I thank you , for your advice to abandon smoking ; my strength has doubled since I relinquished this abominable practice . " A respectable gentleman in middle life , who commenced chewing tobacco at the age of eighteen , was long afflicted with depression of spirits , great emaciation , and the usual dyspeptic symptoms .  --  All attempts to relieve him were fruitless , till he was persuaded to dispense with his quid . Immediately his spirits revived , and he soon regained his health . A A Extracts in point might here be given from numerous letters received by the Author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unnecessary . Cases of reform and cure are occurring by thousands , every year , all over the land . Let every lover of tobacco , who is afflicted with dyspepsia , and nervous maladies , reform , immediately and entirely ; and let him adopt a simple and rational system of diet , regimen , and employment ; and in nine cases out of ten , he may hope to enjoy good health , and live long to bless the world . The conclusion from all this evidence is established , that tobacco is an active poison ; that its constant use induces the most distressing and fatal diseases ; and that , as a medicine , it is rarely needful , and never used , even medicinally , with entire confidence . This loathsome weed , then , should not be used , even medicinally , except in extreme cases , and then in the hands of a skillful physician . For every man  --  and especially for every boy , who has hardly entered his teens  --  to take this poison into his own hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as preposterous , as if he were to take upon himself to deal out arsenic , corrosive sublimate , or calomel . No man can devote himself to the pipe , the quid , or the snuff-box , without certain injury to his health and constitution . He may not perceive the injury at once , on account of immediate exhilaration ; but complicated chronic complaints will creep upon him apace , making life a burden , and issuing in premature dissolution . And just so certain as it is our duty to do no murder ,  --  to use all lawful means to preserve our lives , and the lives of others ; as certain is it our duty and our privilege to practice entire abstinence from the use of tobacco . I maintain the position I have laid down , III . From the consideration of the ruinous effects of tobacco upon the intellect . Here , again , let Professor Hitchcock speak . Says he , " Intoxicating drinks , opium and tobacco , exert a pernicious influence upon the intellect . They tend directly to debilitate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course to cloud the understanding , weaken the memory , unfix the attention , and confuse all the mental operations , than by thus entailing upon ourselves the whole hateful train of nervous maladies . These can bow down to the earth an intellect of giant strength , and make it grind in bondage , like Sampson shorn of his locks and deprived of his vision . The use of tobacco may seem to soothe the feelings , and quicken the operations of the mind ; but to what purpose is it that the machine is furiously running and buzzing after the balance wheel is taken off ? " The late Gov . Sullivan , speaking of the use of tobacco , says , " It has never failed to render me dull and heavy , to interrupt my usual alertness of thought , and to weaken the powers of my mind in analyzing subjects and defining ideas . " The actual loss of intellectual power , which tobacco has hitherto occasioned , and is still causing , in this Christian nation , is immense . How immense , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a giant , has not risen above mediocrity ; and many a man who might have been respectable and useful , has sunk into obscurity , and buried his talents in the earth . This is a consideration of deepest interest to every philanthropist , patriot , and Christian in the land , and especially to all our youth . We live at a time , and under circumstances , which call for the exertion of all our intellectual strength , cultivated , improved and sanctified , to the highest measure of possibility . Error , ignorance , and sin , must be met and vanquished ; they must be met and vanquished by light and love . The eye of angels is upon us ,  --  the eye of God is upon us ,  --  and shall we fetter , and palsy , and ruin our intellectual capabilities , for the paltry pleasure of using one of the most poisonous , loathsome , and destructive weeds found in the whole vegetable kingdom ? Let us rather shake off this abominable practice , and rise , as individuals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and let us go forth from day to day , to the noble purposes of our destiny , untrammelled by the quid , or the pipe , or the snuff-box ; and before another generation shall lie down in the grave , our efforts and our example may cause the light of human science , and the light of civil and religious liberty , and the light of Bible truth , to blaze through all our valleys , and over all our hills , from Greenland to Cape Horn ,  --  and with a lustre that shall illumine the world . I maintain my position , IV . From a consideration of the ruinous effects of tobacco upon public and private morals . The ruinous effects of tobacco upon public and private morals , are seen in the idle , sauntering habits , which the use of it engenders ,  --  in the benumbing , grovelling , stupid sensations which it induces ,  --  but especially in perpetuating and extending the practice of using intoxicating drinks . Governor Sullivan has truly said , " that the tobacco pipe excites a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste of glandular secretion , in proportion to the expense of saliva ; and ardent spirits are the common substitutes ; and the smoker is often reduced to a state of dram drinking , and finishes his life as a sot . " Dr. Agnew has truly said , that " the use of the pipe leads to the immoderate use of ardent spirits . " Dr. Rush has truly said , " that smoking and chewing tobacco , by rendering water and other simple liquors insipid to the taste , dispose very much to the stronger stimulus of ardent spirits ; hence says he the practice of smoking cigars , has been followed by the use of brandy and water as common drink . " A writer in the Genius of Temperance , says that his practice of smoking and chewing the filthy weed , " produced a continual thirst for stimulating drinks ; and this tormenting thirst says he led me into the habit of drinking ale , porter , brandy , and other kinds of spirit , even to the extent , at times , of partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after I had subdued this appetite for tobacco , I lost all desire for stimulating drinks . " Now the fact that some chew , and smoke , and snuff without becoming sots , proves nothing against the general principle , that it is the natural tendency of using tobacco to promote intoxication . Probably one tenth , at least , of all the drunkards annually made in the nation , and throughout the world , are made drunkards through the use of tobacco . If thirty thousand drunkards are made annually in the United States , three thousand must be charged to the use of tobacco . If thirty thousand drunkards die annually , in the United States , three thousand of these deaths must be charged to the use of tobacco . If twenty thousand criminals are sentenced to our penitentiaries in twenty years , through the influence of strong drink , two thousand must be charged to the use of tobacco . If fifty-six millions of gallons of ardent spirits have been annually consumed in this country , five and a half millions must be charged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , profanity , quarrelling , and crime of every description , caused by the use of intoxicating drink ; a tithe must be charged to the use of tobacco . And what friend of good morals ,  --  what friend of man ,  --  what friend of his country ,  --  what friend of Christ and true religion ,  --  and especially , what friend of the temperance cause ,  --  can look at these results with the eye of candor and compassion for his fellow-men , and then not deliberately resolve that he will never chew another quid , nor smoke another whiff , nor snuff another pinch of the dirty weed ? I maintain my position , V. From a consideration of the amazing waste of property , which the use of tobacco involves . On this point I have been unable to obtain the means for making out a perfectly accurate statistical result . I can only approximate a definite calculation . This approximation , however , will serve all the purposes of this argument . We will examine three items : the cost of the article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the pauperism it occasions . From a statement lately furnished me from the Treasury department of our National Government , exhibiting the quantity and value of cigars and snuff , exported from and imported into the United States , annually , from 1st October , 1820 to 30th September , 1832 , it appears that the value of cigars imported into the United States in 1821 , was $113,601 . In 1827 it was $174,931 . In 1832 it was $473,134 ; while from the same document it appears that the value of cigars exported , in each of those years , was about one quarter the value of imports . Hence it appears that , in 1832 , about half a million of dollars were paid for imported cigars ; while in 1821 , only $113,601 were paid ; being more than a four-fold increase in eleven years . Whether there has been a corresponding increase in the value of domestic cigars consumed , I have no means of determining . From the fact of so prodigious an increase of imported cigars , I am led to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country within ten years , far more rapidly than the increase of population . From this treasury document , it appears also , that in 1824 , the value of unmanufactured tobacco exported from the United States , was $4,855,566 Of manufactured tobacco , the value was 2,477,990 Of snuff , 203,789  --   --   --   --   --  Making a total of $7,537,345 In 1832 , the value of unmanufactured tobacco exported , was $5,999,769 Of manufactured tobacco , 3,456,071 Of snuff , 295,771  --   --   --   --   --  Making a total of $9,751,611 for 1832 , and an increase from the year 1824 , of $2,214,266 Whether the quantity consumed in this country equals the quantity exported , or exceeds that quantity , I have no data enabling me to give a definite answer . But from the fact that large quantities of tobacco are raised in various other parts of the world , for foreign consumption ; and from the fact that the people of this country are , above all other people under the sun , a chewing , smoking , snuffing people ; I have very little doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exported . If so , the sum total paid annually , for this vile weed , in this christian country , is $19,503,222 . But as I wish in this examination , to put the estimate below rather than above the truth , I will set down the value of tobacco , cigars , and snuff , consumed annually in this nation , as equal to the amount exported ; that is , in round numbers , $10,000,000 . That this is a very low estimate , will appear by another conclusive calculation . According to the census of 1830 , the population of the U. States , over twenty years of age , is about six millions . Suppose one in four of our adult population , use tobacco in some form ; ( and this is a very moderate supposition , ) it gives one million , five hundred thousand : and suppose one in twelve of those who have not reached the age of twenty , use it ; it gives five hundred thousand more : making a total of two millions  --  or one sixth of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose the expense to the consumers of this noxious drug , varies according to the quantity , and mode of using it . The expense to some is two dollars a year , to some it is five , and to others ten , twenty , and even fifty dollars a year . A laboring man , of my acquaintance , who did not use tobacco extravagantly , and only by chewing , told me that it cost him five dollars a year . A young lady of my acquaintance , says her snuff costs eight dollars a year . If a man pay three cents a day for cigars , it amounts to ten dollars , ninety-five cents a year . If he pay six cents , it amounts to twenty-one dollars , ninety cents a year . If he pay twelve and a half cents , it amounts to forty-four dollars , sixty-two cents a year . It is the opinion of good judges , that very many , who smoke freely and use Spanish cigars , pay more than fifty dollars a year for this foolish gratification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Some of the gentry of this land , bestow three , some four hundred pounds a year , upon this precious stink . " It will certainly be a moderate calculation to put down one quarter of the consumers at two dollars a year ,  --  one quarter at five ,  --  one quarter at eight ,  --  and one quarter at ten dollars a year . Then the several items will stand thus :  --  Half a million at two dollars , is $1,000,000 Half a million at five dollars , is 2,500,000 Half a million at eight dollars , is 4,000,000 Half a million at ten dollars , is 5,000,000 Total , $12,500,000 . Again : the amount of tobacco annually consumed in France , as appears from authentic documents , is about seven millions of pounds ; which is about one pound to every four persons . The amount annually consumed in England , as appears from authentic documents , is about seventeen millions ; which is about one pound to every man , woman and child , in that nation . A In the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in France , and three times as much as in England , in proportion to our population . If so , the quantity used in this country can not fall short of thirty-five millions of pounds ; B which , at thirty cents a pound , amounts to ten and a half millions of dollars ; not including cigars and snuff , which cost half as much more ; making the total sum fifteen and three fourths millions of dollars . And this enormous sum is doubtless below what the article actually cost the consumers . A The tobacco imported and used for home consumption in Great Britain and Ireland in 1832 , amounted to 20,313,651 pounds  --  the duty on which was 15,300,000 dollars . B 1,765,000 pounds of tobacco passed up the Erie Canal in seven and a half months in 1834 . From these three results , we believe there can not be a doubt that the actual expense of tobacco , in its various forms , to the consumers in this country , may safely be set down at ten millions of dollars a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is another item of no inconsiderable moment . Some spend two , three , and four hours a day in this vile indulgence . To all who use the article , in any way , it occasions the loss of more or less time . If we put down the average amount at half an hour a day ; and reckon the time thus lost at four cents an hour , it will amount  --  not reckoning Sabbaths  --  to six dollars , twenty-six cents a year , for each individual ; which , for the whole company of consumers , is an amount of $12,520,000 . The pauperism which tobacco occasions , is another fearful item . Multitudes who are scarcely able to procure the necessaries of life , will shift , by sacrificing health and comfort , to procure the daily quantum sufficit of tobacco . Many very poor families use tobacco , in all ways . Now suppose a poor family use twenty-five cents ' worth of tobacco a week ; it will amount to twelve dollars fifty cents a year ,  --  and in fifty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three thousand five hundred and fifty-two dollars . Just look at this tax for snuff and tobacco , in a single aspect more . Many think it will make no man the poorer , to pay six cents a day for this indulgence . It will make every man the poorer . Let any young mechanic , or farmer , or merchant , consume six and a quarter cents ' worth of this drug a day  --  beginning at twenty years of age , and continuing until he is sixty years old  --  and the sum total , reckoning principal and interest , will amount , in these forty years , to three thousand five hundred and twenty-nine dollars , thirty-six cents . If the cost of tobacco ,  --  the neglect of business which it occasions ,  --  the expense of the pipes and the boxes , and the various apparatus which the use of it involves ,  --  and the intoxication to which it leads ,  --  all be reckoned up , the amount of pauperism which this weed brings upon the nation , can not be less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the sum total of the pauperism in this nation , has been shown , again and again , to be not less than twelve millions of dollars , annually . Hence the pauper tax , occasioned by the use of tobacco , may be set down at three millions of dollars , annually . Here we have , then , the expense of tobacco , $10,000,000 The time lost by the use of it , $12,520,000 The pauper tax which it occasions , $3,000,000 Total , $25,520,000 To this sum should be added one-tenth of the waste of property , which strong drink occasions ; inasmuch as one-tenth of the rum-drinking must be charged to tobacco . Now , it has been estimated that the whole cost of strong drink used annually , in this country , amounts to one hundred and twenty-five millions of dollars ; a tenth of which is twelve and a half millions of dollars . If this tithe be added to the above estimate , it will make the sum total thirty-eight and a half millions . But as I intend my estimates shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property which tobacco occasions in connection with strong drink . I will put down the sum total as above twenty-five millions of dollars . Twenty-five millions of dollars , consumed by the use of tobacco , in this Christian nation , annually ; and not a little of it by professors of religion , and ministers of the gospel , who are required by their Lord and Master to deny themselves ,  --  to take up their cross ,  --  to let their light shine before men , that they may see their good works , and glorify our Father in heaven . Nearly the whole of this twenty-five millions of dollars is a dead loss to the nation ; yes , it is infinitely worse than a dead loss ; it not only does no good , but it actually goes to make fools and beggars , idlers and sots ,  --  to purchase dyspepsia , early graves and everlasting shame . And what would this vast amount of property accomplish , if saved and devoted to useful purposes . Twenty-five millions of dollars annually , if applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the advancement of the arts , sciences , and true religion , would accomplish everything for this nation , that the enlightened patriot and true Christian can ask for . Twenty-five millions of dollars , annually , would soon furnish canals , and rail-roads , and all other desirable facilities for intercommunication throughout the nation . Twenty-five millions of dollars , annually , would sustain all our colleges , academies and other schools , and all the religious and benevolent institutions of this whole country . It would rear seminaries of learning in every State where they are needed ; and it would plant a Sabbath school , with a sufficient library in every school district . Twenty-five millions of dollars , annually , if applied in all feasible and suitable ways , would give freedom , with all the blessings of Christianity to the colored race in our own country , and throughout the continent of Africa in a very few years : and would terminate slavery and the slave-trade in every part of the world . Twenty-five millions of dollars annually , would send forth to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and five millions of tracts , every year , provided the men could be found . Twenty-five millions of dollars , annually , would , in five years , furnish all the money necessary to carry into complete execution , that noble purpose of the American Bible Society , of giving a copy of the Bible , within a specified time , to every accessible family on the earth . And what friend of man is there among us ,  --  what patriot is there ,  --  what Christian is there ,  --  who can look at these truths , and not make up his mind to abandon all use of tobacco , forever ; and to exert the whole weight of his influence and example to persuade others to do the same ? I am aware , indeed , that it may be said , if the whole company of tobacco-chewers , smokers , and snuffers , should at once abandon all use of this weed , and thus withdraw their whole patronage , this twenty-five millions of dollars , which now gives wealth to many a man engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be so much capital unemployed ; and the means of living would be cut off from many a family ,  --  and bankruptcy , and wretchedness would be the consequent portion of many an individual . This may be true . And it may be true , too , that the like consequences would follow the universal abandonment of intoxicating liquors . But what then ? Shall one sixth part of the nation continue to use this poison , because , forsooth , the producers and venders of it will lose their profits if it be abandoned ? Shall the intellect , and health , and comfort , and wealth , and lives of hundreds and thousands of our fellow citizens , be sacrificed yearly ; and widows and orphans be multiplied by scores and fifties , in every section of this wide-spreading country ; and one of the prominent auxiliaries of intemperance ,  --  and consequently of crime , and insanity , and eternal woe  --  be cherished ; and twenty-five millions of dollars be wasted , and worse than wasted ; and all this , that the producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This objection lies equally against the temperance reform and every other reform , where cupidity and avarice are involved . As to the producers , it is affirmed on good authority , that hemp and corn , and other useful articles may be substituted without loss , and even with advantage . As to the venders , their capital may all be profitably employed upon valuable merchandise , without damage . But if it were not so ; where health , life , and happiness are involved , no good man can hesitate . The path of duty is plain . We are bound to walk in it , even though it run counter to the gains of those engaged in unlawful commerce . I maintain my position , VI . From a consideration of the mortality which tobacco occasions . Some of my readers may be startled at this consideration . They may not have dreamed , even , that tobacco kills any body . So insidious are the effects of this poison , and so insensible have the community been to its abominations , that very few have regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills of mortality . But though appalling , it is nevertheless true , that tobacco carries vast multitudes to the grave , all over our country , every year . Says Dr. Salmon , " I am confident more people have died of apoplexies , since the use of snuff in one year , than have died of that disease in an hundred years before ; and most , if not all , whom I have observed to die , of late of that disease , were extreme and constant snuff-takers . " The late Rev. Dr. Samuel Cooper , of Boston , by constant use of snuff , brought on a disorder of the head , which was thought to have ended his days . A very large quantity of hardened Scotch snuff was found , by a post mortem examination , between the external nose and the brain . The late Gov . Sullivan , speaking of Gov . Hancock , the early President of Congress , says , " Gov . Hancock was an immoderate chewer of tobacco ; but being a well-bred man , and a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrained from spitting in company , or in well-dressed rooms . This produced the habit of swallowing the juice of the tobacco , the consequence of which was , his stomach became inactive , and a natural appetite seldom returned ; the agreeable sensations of hunger could not be experienced but by the use of stimulants , to satisfy which he swallowed more food than his digestive powers could dispose of . This derangement in chylification increased his gout , his stomach became paralytic , and he died at the age of fifty-eight . " Again , says Governor Sullivan , " My own brother , the active General Sullivan , began early in life to take snuff . It injured essentially a fine voice which he possessed as a public speaker . When he was an officer in the American army , he carried his snuff loose in his pocket . He said he did this because the opening of a snuff-box in the field of review , or on the field of battle , was inconvenient . At times he had violent pains in the head ; the intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when his sufferings ended in a stroke of palsy , which rendered him insensible to pain , made him helpless and miserable , and lodged him in the grave before he was fifty years of age ; and I have no doubt says the Governor , but all this sprung from the use of snuff . " He adds , " I have known some persons live to old age , in the extravagant use of tobacco ; but they bear a small proportion to those who , by the habit of using tobacco , have been swept into the grave in early or middle life . " Professor Silliman mentions two affecting cases of young men , in the Institution with which he is connected , who were carried to an early grave by tobacco . One of them , he says , entered college with an athletic frame ; but he acquired the habit of using tobacco , and would sit and smoke by the hour together . His friends tried to persuade him to quit the practice ; but he loved his lust , and would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went down to the grave , a suicide . One of the German periodicals says , the chief German physiologists compute , that of twenty deaths of men between eighteen and twenty-five , ten , that is , one half , originate in the waste of the constitution by smoking . They declare , also , with much truth , that tobacco burns out the blood , the teeth , the eyes , and the brain . To this unequivocal testimony , which is confirmed by the observation of every intelligent person who has turned his attention to this matter , much more might be added ; but it is unnecessary . How large a proportion of the twenty thousand deaths  --  reckoning one death to a hundred souls  --  which occur annually , among the two millions of tobacco consumers in this country , are to be charged to the use of this deadly narcotic , I am unable definitely to determine . If we suppose one quarter of these deaths to be caused by tobacco , it will give us the number of five thousand . Five thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of tobacco ! and this is doubtless far below the actual number . Five thousand valuable lives sacrificed in this enlightened land , annually , in the use of a dirty plant , that no living creature , except man and the tobacco worm , will touch , or taste , or handle . Five thousand men and women carried to the grave , yearly , by a poisonous weed , which does no good , and which , for filthiness and disgust , scarcely has its parallel in the whole vegetable kingdom . Is there a Christian ,  --  is there a patriot ,  --  is there a friend of humanity ,  --  is there an individual , that values his own probationary existence ,  --  who can look at the sweeping mortality which tobacco brings upon the nation , and longer indulge his attachment to his quid , his pipe or his snuff-box ? Is there one who will pause and look at this matter , and not resolve that he will , forthwith , entirely , and forever , abandon a practice which does so much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  From a consideration of the apologies of the lovers of tobacco . I call them apologies . They can not be considered reasons . Almost every lover of the dirty weed , feels that he needs an apology . One will tell us he has a cold , watery stomach , and he thinks that tobacco , by promoting expectoration , relieves the difficulty . Another will tell us he is very much troubled with indigestion , and he thinks tobacco relieves the difficulty ; though , in truth , tobacco is the very worst drug he could use to relieve that disease , and is among the primordial causes of inducing it . Another will tell us that he is afflicted with the rising of his food after eating , and he thinks tobacco gives immediate relief ; not suspecting , perhaps , that this rising of the food is occasioned by over eating . Another will tell us he has a distressing difficulty in the head , and brain , and he thinks a little good Scotch snuff affords relief ; as though the filling the pores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain , with this dirty stuff , would remove a disease which in most cases it originates . Others use tobacco to preserve the teeth ; and this , though it is a solemn truth , that many a one loses his teeth by smoking and chewing the poisonous plant . Others , again , use tobacco to excite the mind to more vigorous intellectual effort . But when and where do we find great lovers of tobacco great students , and intellectual giants ? Dr. Rush says , " I suspect tobacco is oftener used for the want of ideas , than to excite them . " There are some whose apology for using tobacco is , that it guards them against the power of contagious diseases . But Dr. Rees affirms that tobacco does not contain an antidote against contagion , and that , in general , it has no antiseptic power ; and is therefore of no special use . There is another class still , who use tobacco because it soothes the irksomeness of life . They fear solitude ; and to prevent self-examination , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipe , quid , and snuff-box ; and soon , by an easy transition , to the wine-glass and brandy-bottle . These are the usual apologies of the devotees to tobacco . And what do they amount to ? In truth , the common opinion that tobacco is good for the head-ache ,  --  weak eyes ,  --  cold and watery stomachs ,  --  the preservation of the teeth ,  --  and the like , is sheer delusion . Let every man and woman , who would live long , and usefully , and happily , awake from this delusion ; and let no one , as he values health , life , and salvation , taste , touch , or handle , the filthy poison . I maintain my position , VIII , AND LASTLY .  --  From a consideration of the eternal ruin which tobacco occasions . On this point , a word or two only , will suffice . That tobacco carries many a soul down to the pit of eternal woe , is manifest from its connection with drunkenness , and from its inducing disease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man who , knowingly and recklessly , brings upon himself disease and death through the influence of tobacco , is a suicide . And drunkards and suicides can not inherit the kingdom of God . How many will at last , ascribe their eternal ruin to alcohol and tobacco , can not now be told . That it will be a great multitude , ( perhaps a great multitude which no man can number , ) we have no reason to doubt . What then , I ask , ought to be done ? What can be done ? What must be done ? If this poisonous narcotic be of recent origin ; if it be ruinous to the health and constitution , and intellect , and public and private morals ; if it occasions an amazing waste of property ,  --  and a multitude of deaths ,  --  and eternal ruin to many precious souls ; and if it do no good ,  --  and there be no apology for using it , which will bear examination ; then something ought to be done , and it ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . And that can be done , and it ought to be done . It is this :  --  tobacco can be abandoned . And if moral influence enough can be enlisted , it will be abandoned . TOTAL ABSTINENCE is the only sure remedy . TOTAL ABSTINENCE will deliver us from all the evils which this weed has brought down upon individuals and families , and the nation .  --  Nothing else will do it . And total abstinence can be adopted and practiced . True ; in some cases , it may cost an effort ; but , in every instance , three weeks ' perseverance will overcome the habit . Three weeks ' total abstinence , will disenthrall every victim , and give him the prospect of freedom , plenty , health , and happiness . And shall this effort be made ? A mighty effort it must be , to liberate and save this whole nation  --  and especially our young men and maidens  --  from the curses of the quid , the pipe , and the snuff-box . I appeal to my fellow citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . Shall the effort be made ? I appeal to patriots . Patriotism forbids the man who loves his country , to shrink from any personal sacrifice , if he can thereby arrest some great national evil . That the use of tobacco is a great national evil , appears from the considerations which have been laid before you . It has been shown that tobacco is weakening the physical and mental energies of this nation ,  --  that it is depraving our morals , and destroying the public conscience ,  --  and that it is causing an amazing waste of property , and health and life . I ask every patriot to look at this portentous evil . Every true patriot , who will examine the length , breadth , and depth of this evil , can not but feel that it claims his attention . And he will enquire what efforts , what sacrifices , can deliver us from the curses of this narcotic ? The answer to this inquiry is an easy answer ,  --  the effort is an easy effort ,  --  the sacrifice is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstain from the poison , immediately , entirely , and forever ; and let him use the whole weight of his influence and example to persuade others  --  and especially the young men and maidens of this republic  --  to practice entire abstinence ; and the work will soon be done . We put the question to every true patriot : will you do it ? I appeal to Christians . Your religion requires you to abstain from the very appearance of evil . It requires you to deny yourselves , to take up your cross , and to follow Christ through evil , as well as through good report . Is there no appearance of evil , in the use of tobacco ? Can the Christian deny himself and follow Christ , with the quid , or pipe in his mouth , or the contents of the snuff-box in his nose ? If Christ himself , were here on earth , in this age of action , when six hundred millions of men , for whom he died , are perishing for lack of vision  --  think you he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of time , or a single ounce of health and mental energy , in the habitual use of this narcotic ? Would he handle , touch , or taste , the poison ? And will you , whose names are written in his book ,  --  you , who have been bought with his blood , and sanctified through his grace , and made heirs of all the riches of his kingdom ,  --  you , whom he requires to be examples in all things ,  --  will you handle , or touch or taste it ? Let every Christian in our country , abstain from this poison , immediately , entirely , and forever ; and let him use the whole weight of his influence and example , to persuade others to practice entire abstinence ; and this work of reform will soon be done . We put the question to every true Christian : will you do it ? I appeal to the youth of both sexes . You are the flower and the hope not only of this nation , but of all nations struggling for freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under God , in your hands ; and inasmuch as all the friends of freedom , everywhere , are looking up to our institutions for light and aid , the destinies of the world will rest with a mightier weight of responsibility upon your shoulders , than upon any other generation that has come forth upon the stage of action , for twenty centuries . The importance of sound and enlightened principles  --  of pure and elevated examples , and independent and decided action in you , is above all estimation . You are placed in the moral Thermopylae of the world . The evils arising from alcohol and tobacco , which you have it in your power to avert from your country , are more dreadful than the invasion of Xerxes with his millions . The cause of moral reform , in the use of the latter of these articles , which we urge upon you with deepest and sincerest solicitude , is far more urgent than that in which the Bruti and the Gracchi offered up their lives . Some of you have not yet handled or tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and never yield to the power of custom , temptation and lust . Some of you , on the other hand , have permitted yourselves to become the victims of this drug . Let all such be urged by the voice of patriotism , religion , self-respect , reason , conscience , and duty , to abstain from this poison , immediately , entirely , and forever . And then every young man , and every young woman , in the republic , shall be free from all the calamities attending the use of this narcotic ; and love , and peace , and joy , will run through the land , and flow over the world . We put the question to every youth : will you do it ? I appeal to the friends of temperance . You have enlisted your energies to expel intoxicating drinks from common use throughout the world . Go on , and prosper . But , as you go , remember , that complete success will not crown your exertions unless you are consistent ,  --  unless you abandon all use of tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go forth to the noble work you have undertaken , you will be met at every corner , with the declaration of A. B. and C. , I am ready to abstain from alcohol when you do from tobacco ; and how effectually will this declaration shut your mouth , and destroy your influence . Be consistent . Carry your principles into all your evil habits , and a moral potency will be diffused through what you say and do , that nothing can resist . We put the question to every friend of temperance : will you do it ? I appeal to American females . As mothers , wives and daughters , you have it in your power ( without turning aside from your appropriate duties ) to put an end to the use of this disgusting weed . The children and youth of this nation , to say nothing of the young men and fathers , are almost exclusively under your control ; and may be moulded at your pleasure . You know how filthy , disgusting , ruinous , is the practice against which we ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and urge this practice upon all within your reach ; and in less than twenty years , this reformation will be completed . We put the question to every mother , wife , daughter : will you do it ? I appeal to the medical profession . You are the guardians of the health of the republic . You are acquainted with the deadly properties of the drug in question . You can understand the necessity , and appreciate the importance of reform . You know that entire abstinence is urged by paramount considerations . In the work of reform from spirit-drinking , you have acted in a manner that reflects honor upon your profession . In the work of reform now urged upon your notice , we calculate upon your active , hearty co-operation . If you put your hand to this work , by precept , and by example ; if you abstain entirely , and forever , from all use of this plant , and inculcate entire abstinence , as you have opportunity ; the work which now bespeaks your attention will soon be done . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ? Finally  --  I appeal to ministers of the Gospel . You are stationed on the watch-towers of Zion , as guardians of the public morals . Against every abomination your great Master requires you to cry aloud and spare not ; to lift up your voice like a trumpet ; to show the people their transgressions , and the house of Jacob their sins . He requires you to be examples to the flock , in all things , that , while " You allure to brighter worlds , " you " may lead the way . " I ask you to look at the influence of tobacco upon the health , wealth , morals , and lives of this republic ; and then to decide , as in the fear of God , whether the blood of souls may not be found on your garments , if you do not abstain yourselves from all common use of this drug , and warn every man around you to do likewise . A Suffer us to point you to Him who went about doing good , and pleased not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything ; and also to that early servant of his , who would abstain from things good and lawful , rather than prejudice the interests of Zion . What reception would the Apostles have met , when they went about to enlighten and reform the world , if they had carried with them their snuff-boxes , pipes , cigars , and pig-tail tobacco ? But a word to the wise is sufficient . Let all who minister in holy things , abstain from this poison , immediately , entirely , and forever ; and let them use the whole weight of their influence , and example , to persuade others  --  and especially our youth  --  to practice entire abstinence ; and this good work will soon be done . We put the question to every minister of Christ : will you do it ? A Says a distinguished correspondent  --  the most efficient officer of one of our benevolent institutions , " Not long since a clergyman called on me as agent for one of the most popular Societies for spreading the knowledge of Christ crucified throughout the world : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a current from each corner of his mouth downward . I need not describe to you my feelings at this exhibition . " JUST PUBLISHED . " Facts and Important Information from distinguished Physicians and other sources . " Fourth Edition .

Andover , Aug. 16 , 1841 . Andover , 29th , July , 1841 . I have read a pamphlet entitled " FACTS , etc. , from DISTINGUISHED PHYSICIANS AND OTHER SOURCES , " respecting a vice which is undermining the health and happiness of many , and degrading them , in some respects , below the brute creation . I think there is nothing in the manner of this pamphlet which can be matter of just offence to any considerate mind . I am persuaded , that , delicate as the task may be , the time has come when benevolence demands that some effort should be made to enlighten the public mind on the subject of which this pamphlet treats ; and both the remarks of the pamphlet , and the facts stated in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most heartily do I wish success to that benevolence which is willing to undertake a task so delicate and so difficult as this . It is time for those who love the purity , the well-being and the most interesting relations of human society , to speak out upon a vice which is dangerous in proportion to the secrecy and silence in which it has been involved . We fully concur in the above . M. STUART . L. WOODS . R. EMERSON . Recommended by the Boston Recorder , Zion 's Herald , and many other papers ; also by numerous clergymen , teachers , physicians , &c.; Dr. Woodward , of the Worcester Hospital , has done much to expose this solitary vice . He says no cause is more influential in producing insanity . According to the Report of the Institution , for 1838 , out of 199 patients , 42 are considered victims of masturbation . RECOMMENDATIONS . From President Humphrey , of Amherst College . AMHERST COLLEGE , April 17 , 1842 . REV . ORIN FOWLER :  --  Rev. and Dear Sir  --  I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that vile narcotic , tobacco . It ought to be the abhorring of all mankind , as it is of all other flesh ; and the extensive circulation of your timely and powerful antidote , can not fail of doing great good . The public in general have no idea of the enormous expense of smoking and chewing in this country ; much less of the waste of health and life occasioned by it . I rejoice that your essay begins to be loudly called for , and wish that as many copies might be circulated as there are miserable slaves to the habit , which , next to alcoholic drinking , is stupefying more brains , and probably shortening more lives than any other . Very sincerely and affectionately yours , H. HUMPHREY . From Rev. M. Tucker , D. D. PROVIDENCE , April 30 , 1842 . I have read with interest the Rev. Orin Fowler 's Essay on the evils of the use of Tobacco . A perusal can not fail to convince every candid mind . The use of tobacco in most cases is an evil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments are sound , the facts abundant , and the conclusions fair and forcible . They who can resist such appeals must be slaves indeed . I shall rejoice in its wide circulation . M. TUCKER . From Edward C. Delevan . E. C. Delevan , former Secretary of the New York State Temperance Society , says , in a letter to the author  --  " The subject of your Essay is one of immense importance to the world and to the temperance cause . The use of this vile weed has been the medium of forming the appetite for strong drink , and ultimately destroying thousands of the most promising youth of our country . You will hardly ever meet with an intemperate person without finding him addicted to the use of tobacco . The public only want light on this important subject , to act . Your able and convincing Disquisition will be the means of doing much good . I hope funds will be provided to furnish a copy to each clergyman in the United States .
