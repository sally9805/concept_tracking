txt Events occur , from time to time , which , by a common consent , serve to divide and distinguish the history of the world into moral and political eras . The Mahometan dates from the flight of his Prophet ; the Shaker makes up his era from the time of Mother Ann Lee ; and deeds , love-letters and notes of hand will , doubtless , hear date from the wonderful discovery of the Book of Mormon , so soon as all the world shall be sufficiently enlighted to believe in Mormonism . There is , indeed , an unwillingness and reluctance in mankind , to change even the epoch from which they date their business transactions . Old notions and long-cherished habits stick to one , long after he has forgotten the oriein or reason of them ; Christians , for this , or some other cause , have never adopted the " Ileirira " instead of their " . /hsno Domissi ; " and we have no doubt , if it had not been for the perversity of Antimasonry , the Craft , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to issue their decretals and diplomas , " *qnno Lucis , " until every thing like masonic light had been extinguished . Whether the publishing of the work , whose title we have placed at the head of this article is to become one of those epochs , from which a new era is to bear date , can , probably , be better determined hereafter than now . Though , if the institution of the Christian religion was of sufficient importance to be considered the commencement of the Christian era , we do not see why the annihilation of it , which this book seems designed to effect , should not be an epoch of equal magnitude . If , therefore , the author is not mistaken in his calculations , we may consider the nineteenth century as the last of that reign of error and delusion ; and the year 1834 as the first of a new era of Deistical Immortality , and of the life and opinions of Lysander Spooner . The work of prostrating the Christian religion , in which so many men have , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostate down to Fanny Wright , may be considered as accomplished by this new apostle of Deism . He has prored that there is neither sense nor reason in the delusion of that simple and unenlightened class of men , who are weak enough to believe in Christianity , and , with a single blow , has overthrown their whole system of faith and morals . At first , we confess , we had some misgivings in seeing the faith of our fathers so rudely and unmercifully attacked , and for a moment were almost angry at this author for exposing ' it ; because no man is willing to be told that he is a fool , though he may be rationally convinced , on the whole , that he is one . But the reasoning of this work is so original and conclusive , its style is so fascinatingly beautiful , its premises and conclusions are so exactly alike , that we had not read it half through , small as it is , before we began to wonder that so many had been fools so long ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the nineteenth century , for the first time , to outstrip error , which had been in advance of it for eighteen hundred years ! It is , therefore , with mingled pain and delight , that we have seen this ray of intellectual light bursting upon a dark and ignorant world ,  --  delight , that nobody can be ignorant hereafter ,  --  and pain , that so much money has been spent for nothing . We could not help thinking how much had been paid , even within a dozen years , for meeting-houses , ministers salaries , ordination dinners , tracts , and missionaries , and how much time had actually been lost in Sundays , Thanksgivings , and Fasts , which ought to have brought , upon an average , fifty cents a day , in making shoes , spinning cotton , or hoing corn . And when we thought how all this might have been saved , if Mr. Spooner had only been born , in the place of Gibbon , or Hume , or Voltaire , or Tom Paine , or almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried so hard and so unsuccessfully , to enlighten the world , and who were weak enough , themselves , at last , to yield to the terrors of the very superstition which they had been so long combating , we could not but lament that his pamphlet had not been ushered into being some centuries ago . It is true , almost every age of the Christian era has been presented with all the arguments that are to be found in this remarkable production , and these have been repeated in all the various forms , in which depraved ingenuity or abused talent could shape them . But our author , having perceived that these assaults fell harmless upon the system , against which they were aimed , doubtless measured with unerring accuracy , the calibre and reach of his artillery , when he directed his tremendous battery against the very citadel of Claristianity. // 329 Whether it was fair or manly for any one , so conscious of his own powers , to batter down , at once , a system which has gallantly withstood its enemies for eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most say , we were sorry to see it , becaose it looked like a giant striking down a dwarf ,  --  it was doing violence to that role of warfare which we learned in our boyish scvffles , of " taking one of your size ' for an antagonist . I3ut the triumph has been so complete that we are willing to forget how it was achieved . We fear that we owe onr readers an apology for having kept them so long from the contents of this precious production . We have given its title at the head of this article , and its divisions correspond to the subject mentioned in the title pag. in the first division , we h ye the reasons why a Deist believes in the immortality of the soul , which would be perfectly conclusive in our own minds , if the basis of this belief was not deduced almost entirely from the Bible itself . " Deists are led to believe in a future state of existence , by the consideration that without it our present one would seem to be without aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would appear contemptible . Whereas by supposing a future life we can imagine in our creation a desit*n worthy of Deity , viz. to make us , finally , elevated , intellectual , and moral beings . " This is the first paragraph in the book , and rriay , as we suppose , be taken to be a condensed view of the author 's creed ) and the p**mises with which he starts . We should like the doctrine mightily if we could only guess how the notion of a future state , or of a Deity , such as he supposes , first originated , if we keep out of sight that fable  --  the Christian 's Bible . It is the misfortune of those of us , who believe with this author , that we have no very authentic accounts of any such system of belief ; as Deists hold to now , having been adopted before the introduction of Christianity . The Jews , and those with whom they held intercourse , had , indeed , sorriewbat rational views upon this subject . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets , unfortunately , partook so much of the character of the preaching of the Author of Christianity , that those *ho have not properly understood the matter have been ready to assimilate these writings and opinions with revelation . We are , therefore , bound , in candor , to confess that our notions , as Deists , do not derive any great strength from the opinions of the Jews . Being somexVhat of a novice in this doctrine of our author , we have looked , elsewhere , for the origin of the belief in a Deity , who is " to make us finally elevated , intellectual , and moral beings , ' and , of course , have gone to those nations who had the " theology of reason " in greater perfection than the credulous Jews . But we must confess , sub rosa , that we have no where been able to find any such Deity believed in as our author assumes to be the Deity of Deists . We looked at the popular theology of Greece and Rome , but we found a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should call them  --  to do thin , *s which , now-a-days , are considered of not quite so elevated , intellectual , or moral tendency , as were some of the precepts of the Gospel . The family quarrelsofFathierJoae and his spouse Juno , and the peccadilloes of Mercury and Vulcan a beautiful wife , were thought a little too bad , even by the better sort of the Greeks and Romans . Plato arid Socrates , too , were , doubtless , pretty learned men in their day ; but we frankly believe that a common laborer , at this day , who reads the Bible , knows more about the immortality of the soul , than twenty just such philosophers as they were , with all their learning . We are not certain that we strengthen our position in favor of a Deity of such pure and elevated , intellectual and moral taste , as our author supposes , if we look to barbarous nations , either ancient or modern . We shrewdly suspect it would have been necessary to have had a Temperance Society formed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality of his paradise , could have been elevated into " intellectual or moral hem *s . " Which , of the all Deities which the theologians of nature and reason worshiped before the introduction of what is called Revelation , our author assumes as the Deity of whom our creation is so worthy a design. , we do not pretend to guess , and , therefore , take it as he leaves it-upon his own assertion . We lay aside all such cavils and trifling objections as we have alluded to , and although , speaking merely historically , it is true that the Gospel " brought life and immortarity to light , " if we can only come to the conclusion of this author , that the Bible , in his words , is " a detestable falsehood , " we shall certainly feel at liberty to discard all historical evidence whatever , in the case . // From the premises above quoted , the author draws the conclusion that the soul is immortal , and that his evidence of this " does not , like that on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is doubtful . " if the reader is equally well satisfied upon this point , he is ready to follow the author in his comparison between the heaven of the Deist and that of the Christian . As there can he , of course , no such thing as revelation in the case , the heaven of the former must necessarily be altogether imaginary . Yet , compared with these ( the author 's ) views and prospects , how puerile is the heaven of Christians . " " Many of them do , indeed , believe in the eternal progress of the soul ; but they obtain not this belief from the Bible . it was the much scoffed at theology of reason and nature that taught them this doctrine . " How forcibly we were impressed , in reading this , with the liability one is under to err about what seems very plain . Until we learned the contrary from Mr. Spooner , we had thought the Bible indicated something like an eternal progress of the soul in a future state ; but we now find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught this . We would give almost any thing to know when this system of theology took its rise , and who were some of its earliest doctors who taught this doctrine which Christians have stolen from them , and worked it into their own creed . But our author does not throw much light upon this part of his subject . rhere are a great many things , nevertheless , in the Bible , which , if this work did not assure us to the.contrary , we should be half inclined to believe indicated a future improvement and advancement of the soul . Our ministers have certainly told us so in their sermons ; but as they are paid for preaching , we can not regard their opinions in the matter . We had supposed there was implied in the very idea of soul , powers and capacities of acquiring and retaining knowledge as well as the existence of passions and affections , which might be considered as among the elements of what we distinguish as soul . We do not furthermore , find any authority Ibr believing that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the soul loses a part of its elements while it retains the rest . We read in the Bible of knowing and being known hereafter ; of love and adoration to be exercised towards a being perfect in his nature . he Christians God is described as possessing every thing which it is desirable to know or worthy of being loved-as the fountain of knowledge and light  --  and we can not exactly see why , under such influences and in such society , when freed from the weakness and embarrassments of human nature , a soul can not and will not as certainly make an onward progress in the future state , as it does in its present feeble , beclouded , half animate existence . Probably , however , these opinions which we once entertained , were adopted like those of the rest of Christendom  --  to use the chaste and beautiful language of our author ,  --  " simply because it has been dingiug in our ears fiom our childhood , " and should , therefore , fade away before the new light which " the march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should be glad to spread before our readers , if we had room , the evidence by which this author , who rejects all revelation as to a single state of future existence , arrives at the conclusion that there are to be a series of successive existences hereafter . We quote his conclusion . The Theory of successive existences is rendered probable by the obvious necessity of having our situations and the objects of investigation and reflection , by whiuh we are surrounded , correspond to the state of our capacities . " We can not , we confess , entirely fathom the author 's meaning here . The Bible has left the precise character of the future state in mystery , and we can only learn from it , that " eye bath not seen , nor ear heard , nor bath it entered into the heart of man to conceive , the things which God has prepared for those who love him . " Our author , while he rejects this Bible , because believing it is , in his words , " an humiliation calculated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of virtuous principles , " does not seem to venture so far into the future , even as revelation has gone . We regret this beyond measure , because we are very curious to know " the situmtions and objects of investigation , " which are to be found in these successive existences . If he knew , he ought to have told us ; and if he did not know , we think he ought not to have said any thing about it . We are sorry to find fault // 331 with a favorite author , but we must be just to his faults as well as his perfections . For the benefit of our readers , we are obliged to substitute our own " imoajuenus for those of our author , to supply this defect ; and , following the clue he has given us , we al ) prehend we can guess pretty nearly right . In the first place , there will be , of course , no such employment hereafter , as the Bible speaks of , and we may , therefore , suppose our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in this life , and only improved in quality and enlarged in dimensions , while the " objects of investigation " will increase in proportion . This little globe will , probably , grow to a universe . A man that can now lift a hundred weight , will then be able to shoulder the Alps and carry them around in a show-box . Mr. Benton , for instance , who now talks four days upon almost nothing , will then be able to make a speech of some two or three years duration , upon quite nothing at all . There will be mountains , and rivers , and suns , and stars , scattered around us , such as no geographer , but he who shall have gone through a sufficient number of these existences , could comprehend or describe . That we may make no mistake on this point , we quote the following : " Was ever a thought more full of sublimity ?  --  a thought , representing Deity in the far future as presiding over , not merely en unirerse of motter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this world , but as ruling over , occupying the thoughts and inspiring the homage of a universe of intelligences , intellectually and morally exalted and constantly being exalted towards a state high and perfect beyond our present powers of conception . " But we hasten to the second part of Mr. Spooner 's book- " An Essay on Man 's accountability for his belief . " In this he undertakes to show how incredible is the story of our Savior 's life , and how blameless and innocent every man must be who sees fit to disbelieve and ridicule it . We shall not attempt to follow his statements or his arguments upon this subject . Unfortunately we can find nothing new in his reasoning ; and as the same has been so often urged before , and reasonable men still believe , we are very apprehensive he must lose his labor . But so it is , and always has been ; and it is an old saying-not borrowed from the Bible , and therefore to be credited-that " error will run half over the world while truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we fear that , in spite of our author 's book , there will still be men credulous enough to believe and regard the Christian revelation . But we forbear to trifle any longer upon a subject as important as that religion , which is the anchor of the Christian 's hope . Nor should we have noticed this impotent and harmless , attack upon it , if it had not been one of the many publications which the press is sending forth , from time to time , to poison and corrupt the minds of the unreflecting or unwary . We fear no ill consequences from publications like these , upon minds which are disciplined by reflection , or accustomed to weigh and examine propositions that are presented to them . But there are many honest minds which may be disturbed by a plausible presentation of specious arguments , though baseless , in fact , as the " theories " of modern infidelity . There are mysteries in Christian revelation , which the human mind can not comprehend . But there are mysteries alike unfathomable in every object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these before he rejects the mysteries of the incomprehensible wisdom of the Christian 's God , as either idle or absurd . There is a zeal  --  and fanaticism-manifested by infidels , which is quite as unaccountable as any of the doctrines which they affect to disbelieve . Admitting every thing that a Deist believes , to be true , that revelation is an idle tale , and that those who believe it are weak and deluded ,  --  why should the Deist be so anxious to undeceive them ? The delusion , at the worst , is a harmless one , and its tendency is innocent and moral . And if the soul is , indeed , immortal , and if , according to the Deist 's belief it is sure of making an upward progress towards perfection hereafter , be its character what it may in this world ,  --  what possible harm can it do for a man to indulge in a delusion as innocent and consoling as the Christian 's hope and the Christian 's faith ? There are , in the pamphlet now under consideration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian religion , which would ill become even a well-bred Turk , and with which wo will not stain this page . They result from the same spirit of fanaticism which a Voltaire and a Paine manifested in their day , but which ever has been , and ever will be , fo nd as harmless as the // Literary Notices . envenomed tooth of the viper in the fable , when biting at the file he would devour , while it shall be directed against Christianity . We understand the author of this pamphlet is a student at law , of some cleverness of parts ; and , if it is so , we regret , on his account , that he should have wasted the hours it must have cost him , in an idle attempt to check the progress of a religion , the very existence of which , hostile as it is to so many of the natural propensities of man , is a greater miracle than many of those which he professes to deride . We can understand , and do respect , the doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reconcile one 's honest doubts is a far different thing from dealing out stale abuse , and hackneyed and long-since refuted arguments , or contemptihle quibbles , to cre* te doubts where none exist , or to unsettle opininns whose very importance makes the mind that entertains them timidly sensitive . The attempt , at best , is cowardly , cruel , and base , and deserves the scorn and pity of every honest mind . We have neither space nor inclination to attempt to confute the doctrines or " theories " of modern infidels , if men will not he convinced , there is no use of reasoning with them . If they will not believe facts , there is no use in producing proofs before them ; and ig as is generally the case , men adopt these opinions , to show , what they think , an independence of mind , they ought not to he reasoned with . Opposition is precisely what gives them their temporary consequence ; and if left to their own sober thoughts , in most cases , they would shrink with horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being thought singular may have driven them . If this author is , indeed , in the pursuit of the profession , which has been ennobled and distinguished hy such men as Judge Blackstone and Sir Matthew Hale , let him study the opinions of such men upon the vei'y subject upon which he undertakes to sit in judgement , and learn something like humility , when raising his farthing rush-light to entinguish the illumination which such men have shed upon the Christian religion . We have treated this book with irony , because we thought it deserved nothing better . But when we consider the efforts now making , in every form , to spread infidel sentiments throu h the country , the happiness of too many immortal beings is involved , to justify our trifline with the subject . We would give our author one word of parting advice . Let him never exercise the right which he has secured , exclusively to himself , by the forms of law , of publishing another edition of his work . lie has an honorable profession open before him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often require some other sanction than the morality of Deisin , to protect and bind together society . He will need no higher triumph to satisfy a reasonable mind , than success in the profession he has chosen . He is out of his place , when warring with the Christian religion , and will only be kindling , within his own breast , a fire , which will born long after his ill-advised pamphlet shall be remembered , only in that dread chronicle of events , which is one day to be unfolded before the assembled universe.
