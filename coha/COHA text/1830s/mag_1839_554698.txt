txt THIS volume , as appears from its title , is very miscellaneous ; yet the most prominent part of it is a collection of the early laws , some real and some fictitious , of the English colonies in America . The laws here brought together are denominated " blue " ; but no satisfactory reason is given for this general appellation . The compiler seems to have been aware , that some explanation of the title of his book would be expected by his readers ; and , accordingly , he has stated in his preface , that " it has been generally supposed , that the laws enacted by the New Haven colony previous to the code by Governor Eaton , in 1655 , formed the code of Blue Laws , so highly celebrated in this country . " Of the truth , however , of this supposition he has produced no evidence ; except that Peters is referred to , as saying , respecting this same colony , " that many of what have been termed Blue Laws ' were not suffered to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , that recording them would be unnecessary ; until the laws of that colony were systematized by Governor Eaton , and printed in 1656 , at which time many of the laws previous to 1656 were expunged . " Where Peters says all this , we are not told . This writer , indeed , asserts , in his " History of Connecticut , " that the blue laws of New Haven " were never suffered to be printed , " but he nowhere , in that work , denies that they were all recorded ; nor does he say , that these laws were to be made " familiar with the people " ; language which , we fully believe , Dr. Peters never employed . And as to the " expunging " of laws , which were never " recorded , " though we think very unfavorably of Dr. Peters in many respects , we shall consider this absurdity as unjustly charged upon him , till the passage of his History , which contains it , is produced . Governor // April , Eaton 's code is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian appear to have known , that such a collection of laws ever existed . We can not but express here some surprise , that a professed " antiquarian " should have investigated this subject so imperfectly . If it was worth his while to say any thing about the early laws of New Haven , it was certainly incumbent on him to exhibit the facts of the case . We are assured , on what we consider good authority , that the records of that colony are full and entire ; and that there is no reason to believe , that any thing important , either legislative or judicial , to the time of Governor Eaton 's code , was transacted there , which was not distinctly recorded , and which is not now open to the inspection of any one , who wishes to ascertain what was really done in that jurisdiction . An investigator of antiquities , if his object was the truth , should have gone to the highest source of evidence , rather than have published a story so incredible on the face of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were never put on record , referring it to an author notoriously of no credit , and who in fact has said no such thing as is here ascribed to him . On the same page , we find another story of a similar character . This " antiquarian " here affirms , that the term " blue , " as applied to the New Haven code , is said to have originated from the fact , that the first printed laws in the New Haven colony were enveloped in blue-colored paper . But in this case , as in the former , we in vain look for even the semblance of proof , that what " is said " has any foundation in truth . If there is , in fact , such a tradition , and it deserves notice , why are we not told where it exists , and what is its character , that all may judge of its claims to be considered authentic ? Within a few sentences of the passage just quoted , we find it asserted of Governor Eaton 's code , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes of the five hundred printed in 1636 , are to be found in this country . " We are not disposed to interpret this language too strictly . If all the unrecorded laws , which this " antiquarian " supposes Governor Eaton to have " expunged , " had been in fact printed , no one would ever dream of their being so voluminous as is here represented . What is meant undoubtedly is , that , of the original edition of five hundred copies of the New Haven code , but two are known to the writer to exist in this country . Taking this then to be matter of fact , that two // copies remain , why are we not informed whether these are still in " blue covers , " or whether any thing in their appearance indicates , that they were ever arrayed in such a dress ? If we supposed it of the least importance , we could report a tradition , entitled to some credit , that one copy at least of these laws was formerly so " enveloped . " But admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or what " is said , " rests on a proper foundation , what reason hence arises for applying the epithet " blue " to the laws of New York , of Virginia , and of the other colonies mentioned in the title of this volume ? Is it to he understood , that these laws were likewise unrecorded ? or , if recorded and printed , were they also bound in " blue-colored paper " ? If this " antiquarian " has made any discoveries here , he should have announced them . As the case stands , he has wholly failed to explain the principle , on which his collection has been made . But we see no mystery in this matter . The epithet " blue " was , certainly , used in England after the Restoration , as a term of ridicule and reproach . It is so used in Butler 's " Hudibras . " " Can fetch in parties ( as , in war , All others heads of cattle are ) From th ' enemy of all religions , As well as high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribands , down To all blue aprons in the town . - Part III . Canto if . 1 . 870 . In Grey 's edition of this poem , the words " blue aprons " are explained , as alluding to the preachers in blue aprons , in those times ; persons being then admitted to preach , who wore blue aprons in their trades . Grey refers to a passage from the . Miercurius Rusticus , which speaks of a " blue apron committee " at Reading . This was a committee acting under the Parliament ; from which it would appear , that " blue apron " was a term of reproach applied to the Parliamentary party , as consisting of men in humble situations of life . In support of his illustration of the phrase , the commentator , among other quotations , has the following ; " And first , to tell you must not be forgot How I did trot , // With a great zealot to a lecture , Where I a tub did view Hung with an apron blue , T was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too Was of no better hue , Though he spake in a tone most mickle . " Loyal Songs . This species of ridicule was of course introduced into New England by those who wished to bring the institutions of the early Puritan colonists into disrepute and contempt . The epithet " blue " probably was applied here more extensively than in the parent country ; and was employed particularly to characterize the laws as over-strict , and withal somewhat whimsical . This is the sense , in which our " antiquarian " uses the word ; though he seems not to have been aware of the import of his own language , or , at least , has neglected to explain it . In applying the word " blue " to laws beyond the limits of New England , the author might plead analogy in justification . The execution of the editorial part of this volume is most deplorable . Mistakes and blunders meet the reader at every turn .. We will notice two as specimens . The first of them occurs where the " antiquarian " is treating of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be , if anywhere , well informed . He gives , page 119 , " an extract from a Journal of a Dutch traveller up the Connecticut River , in 1638 , to Hartford ; " the Dutchman , however , seems , from the Journal itself , to have been in Hartford , in 1640 . On his way , he arrived " on at Rhodabergh , a fine haven , and found that the English were building a fine town , having already erected upwards of 300 houses , and a fine church . " This Rhodabergh could have been no other than New Haven . Three hundred houses would allow it at least two , for every man , woman , and child , at that time , in the colony . There could not have been half this number of houses in New Haven , a century after this Dutchman 's visit . This extract must have suffered greatly in the hands of the editor . The other passage is on page 64 , in the account of the charges against Roger Williams at Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , " that the magistrate ought not to punish the breach of the first table , otherwise than in such case as // did disturb the civil peace . " To aid his readers in understanding what is meant by the first table , the editor has subjoined a note , " First commandment , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart . " Things must have got to a strange pass in Connecticut . This " antiquarian " ought immediately to take some lessons in the New England Primer . It would be easy to show , that a large portion of this volume is prepared in such a manner , as to make a very incorrect impression on the minds of those , who are not well informed in the history of the country . Some of the colonial laws , as well as the proceedings under them , were without doubt highly objectionable . Others , compared with our present standard of judging , are of a questionable character ; but were , in truth , a great improvement in the legislation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these laws might be shown to be highly creditable to the early colonists . But we do not suppose , that the public generally need , at present , any discussion of this subject . The great object of the compiler was , obviously , to make a book which would sell among a class of readers , with whom matter of fact is of secondary importance.
