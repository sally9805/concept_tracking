txt THE remarks in this and two succeeding essays were suggested on reading a pamphlet , entitled " Reports on the Course of Instruction in Yale College , by a Committee of the Corporation and the Academical Faculty . " It is a pamphlet , calculated , for sundry reasons , to make no common imptession , wherever it is read . It is from the pen of scholars , is written with ability , and , from havin* , been long engaged in the business of " Instruction , " most of those concerned in the authorship of it have a fair claim to be deemed qualified judges of the subject of which it treats . Hence , on most points embraced in their " Reports , " we consider the sentiments of the Committee correct , their illustrations satisfactory , and their reasonings conclusive . And such we presume is the general opinion . On one point , however , we are not satisfied ; and it is that on*which the Committee appear to have bestowed most attention , and ror the decision of which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most solicitous . We allude to the necessity of a knowledge of Greek and Latin , as an element of a libcral education* Is it true , that that element is indispensable ; and that no form or degree of education is liberal without it ? May not an individual , without being versed in the dead languages , be so educated , as to be competent to the highest and most perfect achievements in science , literature , and *iie arts , as well as in professional life ? These are questions of deep concern to the intetests of society , education being the only means of fully developing the human faculties , and conferring on man the entire perfection , of which he is suscep* tible . The Committee have answered the first of them qjjlrmatively , and the last , of course , in the negative . They have pronounced an acquaintance with Greek and Roman literature essential in the constitution of a liberal education . Before offering any strictures on this decision , we shall simply remark , that we are friendly to the cultivation of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sympathy with that class of innovators , that would " drive the ploughshare of destruction " through all our academies and colleges , and uproot in them every remnant of the learned languages . Though advocates of a temperate and judicious reform on this subject , we deprecate revolution . Indeed , such are the evils inseparable from revolution , during its progress , that it should never be attempted in any thing of moment , except as the result of necessity , or under a prospect deemed infallible of great improvement . We shall only add , that we have never witnessed what we considered an unbiassed discussion of the topic before us . Notwithstanding our belief , that the learned Committee , whose " Reports " we are about to examine , endeavored to divest themselves of prepossession and prejudice , and to discover and communicate truth , on the subject of their deliberation , we are compelled to question their ability to do so . In saying this , we intend neither an impeachment of their integrity , nor a disparagement of their understanding . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already acknowledged the latter to be of a respectable order . We simply mean , that men educated , employed , and habituated from their youth , to think , as they have been , must have had , from the well-known laws of the human mind , a bias and friendliness of feeling , apart from their judgement , in favor of the study of Greek and Latin . To have felt otherwise-we mean , to have felt impartially , would have been unnatural , and , perhaps we might add , unamiable  --  a susceptibility of attachment to familiar objects and customary pursuits , being one of the attractive features of the human character . Besides ; not to have decided as they did , would have been a censure on themselves and their profession ; some of them , we believe , being concerned in teaching the classics , and all of them sanctioning that course of instruction . And self-condemnation , always an unwelcome task , is much increased in its difficulty and repulsiveness , by having to grapple with pride of opinion , personal interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall commence our discussion . What are we to understand by a liberal education ? Unless this question be previously solved , reasoning on the subject can be of no avail . It is fortunate , therefore , that the committee have given their solution of it in the following sentence " By a liberal education , it is believed , has been generally understood , such a course of discipline in the arts and sciences , as is best calculated , at the same time , both to strengthen and enlarge the faculties of the mind , and to familiarize it with the leading principles of the great objects of human investigation and knowledge . " To this solution we offer no other objection , than that it is not sufficiently full . The word all should have been inserted before " faculties . " A liberal education , then , we would define , that course of instruction , which is best calculated to prepare the mind , by expanding and invigorating all its faculties , for the highest achievements , of which it is capable , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions and the arts . For , although it is true , as the committee allege , that a liberal is distinct from a professional education , it is equally so , that the latter should always include the former , and is defective without it . It being conceded , then , that a liberal education consists in a competent cultivation of all the facullies of the mind , it must be also conceded , that whatever form of education thus cultivates them is liberal . The question may therefore be put , and the committee have an interest in answering it , What faculty , or what number of faculties are disciplined and strengthened by the study of Greek and Latin , which can not be as highly disciplined and strengthened without it ? Greek and Latin are but languages . The study of them alone , therefore , is far from invigorating every faculty of the mind . When pursued as it usually is , it invigorates only the faculty of language . It in no degree strengthens , or in any way improves either the reflecting faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It adds nothing to the capacity of the mind to form ideas of number , quantity , weight , figure , size , duration , color , place , tune , or beauty . Nor has it any bearing on comparison , reasoning , wit , or imitation . Yet these are all ideas and operations , conceived and performed by distinct primitive // faculties , which education is intended to train and strengthen . We repeat , that the study of language , cultivates alone the faculty of language ; and that can be cultivated as certainly , and we believe as well , by the study ,  --  we mean the thorough study ,  --  of modern as of ancient languages . This will be made to appear more fully hereafter . But we are running ahead of our inquiry ; we are advancing some of our own views , before examining those contained in the pamphlet . The Committee have assigned their reasons for deciding , that the study of the ancient classics is an indispensable constituent of a liberal education . If those reasons are conclusive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it would be worse than nugatory ; it would be a waste of time . If , on the contrary , the reasons are invalid , the question is still open , and invites to a stricter examination of the subject of it . Nor ought the invitation to be declined , relating , as it does , to matters of deep and general concern . Our first business , therefore , is to endeavor to test the soundness and sufficiency of some of the positions , which the " Reports " maintain . The Committee first attempt to draw a parallel between the objections made by some persons to the study of mathematics , and those made to the study of Greek and Latin ; and , having shown satisfactorily the invalidity of the former objections , they content themselves with the inference that the latter are equally invalid . In this effort , however , to maintain themselves , they have failed . Arguments founded on analogy should be advanced with caution . They are not philosophical . To illustrate is all they can do . Proof is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more harm than good , unless they are sustained by something solid , and direct to the point . In the present case , moreover , we deem the analogy defective . The attempt to show that there is an equal necessity for studying the ancient classics and mathematics , we consider a failure . A knowledge of mathematics , if not essential , is highly useful , in almost every department of life. * The power of man is greatly augmented by it , and his general efficiency in the same degree improved . It is an important element of practical science , and is not only indispensable in public and weighty projects , but facilitates and renders more complete the transaction of many private and domestic affairs . Its influence , like that of the sun and the atmosphere , is felt every where , without being always referred to its proper source . Were it necessary to illustrate or prove this , facts suited to either purpose could be collected abundantly from every quarter . Indeed , an extinction of the knowledge of mathematics , would not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements already made ; it would reduce society to an infantile condition . Every man actively engaged in agriculture , commerce , or the arts , does many things on mathematical principles , whether he be educated in the science or not . Several other sciences , * We do not mean to contend that every candidato for a liberal education ought to compelled to study mathematics , to any great extent . Some knowledge of the principles of the science , and their application , he ought to acquire ; and to this attainment every one is competent . But those alone who have the faculty of Number in sufficient strength , can attain a thorough knowledge of mathematics . Nor should the attainment be exacted of any others . A practice the contr ry of this is unjustifiable , because it loads to an unprofitable consumption of time . Of every other study , the same is true . No one should be constrained to pursue it , unless he possesses afaeulty for it . A strict observance of this rule would be an important improvement in the education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arts , are dependent on mathematics , if not for their existence , at least for the degrees of perfection they have attained . As respects a knowledge of Greek and Latin , the case is different . To say the least , its usefulness in the common affairs of life , whether public or private , on a large scale or a small one , is very limited . Were we to deny it altogether , it is doubtful whether we could be convicted of error . Classical knowledge belongs to literature , and appears to us to have no necessary connexion with practical science . As a mere attainment in language , it deals in words and names , not in substantial ideas and things . True , it facilitates the making of addi tions , when required , to scientific nomenclature . Such additions , however , might be made without it , though not , perhaps , so conveniently-certainly not so learnedly . But no one will contend , that it contributes , in the slightest degree , to widen the boundaries of si*ience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature or to new and useful applications of those already made . Some of the most distinguished discoverers , invent.e rs , and improvers , the world has produced , have been strangers to Grecian and Roman literature . In proof of this , many well-known names might be cited . Of a knowledge of mathematics , it need scarcely be said , that the reverse of this is true . Science and the arts , we repeat , are immeasurably indebted to it , on the score of both discovery and improvement . We reiterate , therefore , our inability to perceive any analogy , at all available in the present case , between the necessity of it , and a knowledge of the ancient classics , constituting an element of a liberal education . Every enlightened people is , and always has been , indebted to mathematics for many of their means of prosperity and power . But nations and empires have been prosperous and powerful , without any aid from Greek o* Latin . From reasoning by analogy , the Committee proceed to another ground of argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the British islands , ( say they ) in France , Germany , Italy , and , indeed , in every country of Europe in which literature has acquired distinction and importance , the Greek and Roman classics constitute an essential part of a liberal education . " This is begging the question ; or rather , assuming positively the right to decide it , by the weight of opinion . The allegation made is true , only by construction-true , on the ground of human authority , but not , therefore , necessarily so , under the sanction of reason . In the countries mentioned in the extract , custom of long standing has established the belief , that " the Greek and Roman classics constitute an essential * It would not , we believe , he difficult to show , that of the most illustrious dr , roverers , inventcrc , and improvers in science and the arts , a large majority have been ignorant of Greek and L stin . For this , there seems to be a good reason Self-taught men are untrammeled tiny authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide ; whereas , the educated , hem macli under the influence of what they have learned in colleges , and other seals of learning , thoik as t/ny /ucre bees taeght , and are guided by example . Under these circumstances , the former can cc crely f-mu to take a lead , in the work of general innovation and improvement . The remedy foi this evil in our colleges and universities is obvious and easy . Young men should be instructetl rcassuueb/y , not dseosaticatly , or aut/zeritaticetuj . They should be taught independence of mind , to study nanare as well as books , and , on every subject , to examine strictly , believe cautiously , and think for themselves . The following re a few , out of many that might tue named , of eminent discoverers , inventers , and improvers , who had no knowledge of Greek or Latin Franklin , ititlenhouse , Watt , Arkwright , hutton , Itubbart , itriudley , Bramnah , Leslie , Stevenson , Perkins , and Fuhon . To these , dozens of others might he added-among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liberal education . " This belieg however , does not form a fact . No mere belief does so . If it did , fact and absurdity would be often identical . That at the time of the Revival of Letters , and for centuries afterwards , an acqt.raintance with the " Greek and Roman classics constituted an essential part of a liberal education , " is not denied . The reason is obvious . At that period , those works were , in Europe and most parts of Asia , the depositories of almost all recorded knowledge . But they are not so now . The amount of knowledge , which they lock up , at present , from the mere reader of modern* languages , is extremely small ; and , we may safely add , of little use . All the important information they contain , has been , long since , translated into other tongues . Hence they are no longer consulted as oracles of science . Had the Committee , therefore , pronounced a knowledge of them a fashionable or conventional , instead of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term would have been more appropriate . If mere authority be waved , the propriety of the epithet , in the present condition of the world , is more than doubtful . Rut that authority is , in many cases , not only a fallacious , but a dangerous , basis of education , may be easily shown . Has not a belief in the infallibility of the Pope , in the performance of miracles by the relics of saints , and in the divine right of kings to trample on their subjects , been inculcated by authority , as an element of education ? And , in some parts of Europe , is it not so inculcated still ? Has there not been a period , when , had teachers refused to implant these notions in the minds of their pupils , they would have been deemed heretical , and deprived of their offices , if not of their lives ? The reply to these questions must be affirmative . Were we inclined to press this matter further , we might add , that the time was , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy to be at the head of a college or a university , because no other could procure for it the favor of Heaven ; and the time also was , when no young man 's education was esteemed liberal and complete , though he might be intended for holy orders , unless it included the art of defence . In fact , there is scarcely an error ' or an absurdity in discipline , so gross and striking , as not to have found its advocacy in the same source . It is not perceived , then , in what way the Committee have strengthened their cause , by a reference to fashion , or human authority . We shall appeal , hereafter , to a higher tribunal , that of Nature . The Committee employ another argument , the soundness of which we think equally doubtfuL We shall give it in their own words " The literature of every country of Europe is founded , more or less , on classical literature , and receivesfrom this source its most important illustrations . " Admitting this to be true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portugal , and also of modern Greece as far as she has a literature , 15 it so of that of any other European country ? Is it true of GreatBritain , Holland , Germany , Prussia , Russia , or any other northern nation ? or , is it true of the United States ? Is the literature of these latter countries founded on that of ancient Greece , or Rome ? and is it dependent on " that source for its most important illustrations ? " The Committee would hazard much , in replying affirmatively to this ques* // tion . In plain terms , if we comprehend their meaning in the paragraph quoted , the reply could not be sustained . The constitution of the English language , and every thing fundamental that belongs to it , rest much more on the Saxon , than on either the Greek or Latin , or on both united . And the Russian , and the German in all its dialects , are original tongues ; no more dependent on Greek or Latin , than the latter are on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after those of the writers of Greece arid Rome , is true . But , that the most pure and classical writers of the English language have done so , is not true . English literature has a character of its own , very distinct from that of either Greek or Roman literature . It can not conform to both of them , they being widely different from each other . The truth is , that , when pure , it conforms to neither . This is proved by the prose works of Dryden , Bolingbroke , Swift , Addison , Taylor , Goldsmith , Scott , and other great masters of English style . Those compositions , and many others that might be referred to , derive nothing in manner or illustration from ancient literature , and but littlo in words . Ihey are written chiefly in Saxon-English . We allude especially to the structure and spirit of the composition . Some of the most tasteless works in our language are modeled alter the ancients . How can it be otherwise ? An effort is made in them to assimilate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferiority , and contribute to perpetuate it . On that ground , ancient authors have injured many modern ones . No writer will ever be great , unless he aspire to originality , both in manner and matter . He must act according to the constitution of his own mind , not in imitation of the mind of another ; for his intellectual stores , he must draw on nature ; and , to acquire mental vigor and dexterity , he must exercise rQgularly , and on suitable subjects , the powers he possesses . But the adorers of the ancients will be the last to do this . Like the adherents to royalty , they will continue to recognize , in the Greeks and Romans , a divine right to instruct the moderns . English literature will never attain the perfection of which it is susceptible , until it shall be cultivated , more than it ever has been , on the ground of the true constitution of the English tongue . Never until then will it be free from trammels ; and freedom is essential to perfection in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to prevail ; and that it has so begun , can not be doubted . En .. glish and American writers , generally , are less servile copyists of the ancients , than they were fifty years ago . And , as nations , ' their writings have improved . Both in Great-Britain and the United States , more especially in the latter , there are twenty good writers now , where there was one , at the commencement of our revolutionary war . Yet , in neither country has the devotion to the ancient classics increasedin the same ratio . It would be difficult to prove , that , in proportion to numbers , it has increased at all . Nor shall we ever have a truly classical literature of our own , until it shall have been formed out of our own materials , and on the constitution and construction of our own tongue . We might safely add , that when one writer copies or imitates the style and manner of another , he is apt to imitate his sentiments and mode of thinking , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such a degree of dependence operates as a blight on // the human faculties . That it may be able to act with its entire force , and achieve every thing , of which it is capable , the mind must be free , and must , therefore , do homage to nothing that is human . Aristotle and Plato among the ancients , and Newton and Locke among the moderns , checked originality of thought , and thus did mischief , through the excessive deference paid to them , by their contemporaries and those of after ages . Imitation and the restraint of authority chill the fires and deaden the elasticity of genius , and are fatal to all that is great or new . We do not hesitate to say , then , that , instead of being benefited by the homage once paid by them to ancient compositions , modern writers have improved , both in matter and style , almost in proportion as that homage has abated . As far as our acquaintance with German literature fits us to judge of it , we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , " than the English . It appears to us to be very independent , and to have a distinct constitution and character of its own . To crowd a composition with what are called classical illustrations and allusions is now deemed a mark of pedantry , rather than of good taste ; to which might be added , that it is also a mark of a barren mind . The rich are not compelled to borrow ; nor is the scholar , who is sufficiently versed in the book of nature , obliged to rely for his illustrations on the literature of the ancients . The Committee make a further effort to establish , by analogy , the high claim of an acquaintance with Greek and Latin to enter as an element into a liberal education . The subjects of their analogy are architecture and sculpture . Thosearts are stated to have been carried to such perfection in Greece , that their products are still unrivaled , and constitute the best models for modern imitation . True ; as relates to sculpture , the Committee disclaim being advocates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclaim it only in u'ords , while in principle they recommend it . When a modern statuary places an ancient bust or statue before him , and works by it or after it , to improve himself as an artist , we know of no other name , which suits him so well , as that of imitator . His object is not to avoid faults in the statue ; because he always selects the most perfect specimen . If , then , he does not intend to imitate  --  to assimilate his work in some way to the model in his presence , why does he look on it as an exemplar ? Why does he not copy directly from nature , the true inspirer of genius , and the finished pattern of all elegance and all excellence ? By doing so , and depending alone on her , in conforming to her works , he would take the rank of an original . But as long as he relies for his improvement on human productions , he is a copyist . Every great artist has a beau ideal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all the elements of it are derived from nature . He only unites and fashions them to his taste ; and , in his attempts to attain perfection , he works after the image he has thus created . His effort is to equal that , not to equal or surpass a pattern set by any other artist , either ancient or modern . After whose models did Phidias or Praxiteles work ; or by what artist 's productions did they improve themselves ? The answer is plain . They worked after no models but those of nature , and deigned to imitate no productions but hers  --  and hence their works bestowed immortality on them . It is believed that the ancient artists , // painters , as well as sculptors , owed their excellence chiefly to their being originals . Nor could they be otherwise ; because they bad no highly finished works of preceding artists to imitate . Were the moderns to follow their examples of originality , instead of copying their works , they might equal them in the perfection of the art ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to us , that the chief , if not the only advantage , which the works of ancient artists can bestow on modern ones , is on the ground of competition and rivalry . They may excite in them a higher ambition to excel , than they would otherwise feel ; and there , we apprehend , the true benefit ends Our allusion is to artists of a high order . That inferior ones may improve their humble performances by imitation , is not denied . They are intended and fit only to follow in the wake of superior men . They are not1 therefore , embraced in the present discussion . We are treating of artists qualified to be originals ; and they are necessarily injured by imitation . Be these things , however , as they may , we say of this analogy , as we did of the last , that it proves nothing , because it is an analogyand not , we think , a very close one . In the reasoning founded on it by the Committee , the premises and the conclusion do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same syllogism . Modern architecture , say the Committee , has been improved by ancient architecture , and modern sculpture by ancient sculpture . But the Greeks and Romans were the great masters in these arts . Therefore , modern literature is improved by ancient literature in which the same people were also masters . We confess our inability to perceive either the force or fairness of the inference . There is yet another ground , on which the analogy of the Committee appears to us to have failed . Sculpture is a direct imitation of something in nature . The product , therefore , of the ancient and of the modern sculptor , when imitating the same object ,  --  say , * the human figure , - must be so much alike , that the latter , when possessed of but moderate abilities , may , perhaps , improve his style , by working after the model left by the former . He is still indirectly imitating nature , when he is imitating a well-executed image of her . But language , though founded in nature , resembles ' none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial ; and , as products of art , the English , Latin , and Greek languages are , in their present condition , so dissimilar to each other , that it is difficult to conceive , how the former can be , in any way , improved , by an attempt to model it after either of the latter . That it must be injured by it , seems , on principle , the more probable result ; and experience , we think , sustains the opinion . " But , ( say the Committee ) the study of the classics is useful , not only as it lays the foundation of a correct taste , and furnishes the student with those elementary ideas , which are found in the literattire of modern times , and which he no where so well acquires as in their original sources  --  but Jso as the study itself forms the r ost effectual discipline of the mental faculties . " * * * * " Every faculty of the mind is employed ; not only the memory , judgement , and reasoning powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The matter of this extract brings us into a more serious conflict with the Committee , than that of either of the preceding ones . We // are compelled to call in question the soundness of the whole of it . We can not admit that " the study of the classics lays the foundation of a correct taste . " Wherever that " foundation " exists , it is not the creation of any course of discipline . It is the gift of nature ' - * - -  laid in the original constitution of the mind . Education improves it , but does not and can not produce it . There are many minds , some of whose powers are active and vigorous , in which no system of training can form a correct taste . Whatever they do is disjointed and out of shape . Yet they may be thoroughly imbued with Greek and Latin . Instances in proof of this are so numerous , that they must be familiar to every accurate observer . rrhe elements of correct taste are as literally bestowed by nature , as the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They consist in that form of mind , where all the faculties are active , and well-balanced , none of them preponderating much in strength over the others . Where these elements are wanting , no course of discipline can impart them . Nor are we convinced , that&gt; when possessed , they may not be as well cultivated , without Greek and Latin , as with them . Females excel in all sorts of taste , without any knowledge of ancient literature . This point will be more fully considered hereafter . Notwithstanding an attentive examination of the subject , we find it difficult to discover what the Committee mean by " those elementary ideas , which are found in the literature of modern times , and which the student no xvhe*re so well acquires , as in their original sources . " Nature , * not classical literature , we regard as the " original source " of all ideas , whether elementary , or of any other kind . We believe , moreover , that all mental philosophers concur with us in opinion . Other sources are but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conformity to the original source . But nature is as acces ' sible to the iftoderns , as she was to the ancients . Had we said that she is much more so , the position could be maintained . Fo* each well-informed student of nature possessed by Greece and Rome , modern nations furnish hundreds , in the same amount of population . Wherefore , then , must the latter depend on the former for " element* ary ideas , " or any ideas at all , to enrich their literature ? Why can they not draw them from the same fountain , which is so much more liberally opened to the modern than it was to the ancient world ? We ought rather to ask , Do they not thus draw them ? Are not modern productions generally much richer in the truths of nature , and freer from fiction , than most ancient ones ? This question must be answered affirmatively ; else all the discoverers arid philosophers , who have flourished and written since the Revival of Letters , have lived in vain . We feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specify those " elementary ideas , " and show them to be of any value , which writers of the present day most readily derive from Greek and Latin . Nor will they find it an easy task to comply with the summons . But we have not yet done with the extracted paragraph . Having , however , already filled up our allotted space in the Magazine , we must defer what we have further to say , until the next number . * We mean that impressions made , directly or indirectly , by the works of nature , on the human mind , produce in it all the ideas it possesses . To the production of these impressions , the learned languages contribute but littie@@183068473.txt WE are no friends to these Fairs ; from the first moment we heard them proposed , we had our doubts , and these doubts , in the progress of observation , in studying carefully the effects and grounds of the establishment of the Fairs , vanished , one by one , till we settled down in a firm conviction of their impropriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we intend to eulogize them ; and , on the other hand , we beg not to be apprehended as a determined enemy , who may have no hearing because suspected of prejudice ; for it is worth while , when we enter upon any project , especially when it is different from our usual course , to inquire what are the principles involved , what are the immediate effects , and what may be the retnote consequences of the act . By this view , let not only all our common actions , but also these Fairs , be tried ; and if they stand not the test , if they rest on grounds , on which nothing else may stand , and which , in the abstract , militate with our consciences , we should be very careful how we enter upon them , lest we sanction principles , which derive all their credit from this particular connexion , and which we might not wish to have generally adopted . We are aware , that we shall be considered as treading on holy ground , and trampling down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give health and vigor . We know there is a holiness of purpose enlisted in these Fairs . We are not dead to the objects of the ladies , so actively and charitably engaged to carry , by these means , relief to the poor , knowledge to the ignorant , speech to the dumb* and sight to the blind ; nor can we impeach their motives ,  --  for we have too many of our best-loved friends , who follow the general fashion , to suspect , for a moment , that they could in this , or any other work , knowingly , act on principles which are false , or dange*us when applied to any other purpose . But we will be more specific , and come at once to the material and the manner of the Fair . What are the articles offei ed for sale ? Are they generally such as have any positive value ? We will not say , that all , or even any considerable portion of them , are entirely worthless ; but that many are mere gewgaws , trifles , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have employed the delicate hands a few hours , and may tickle the fancy of the purchaser a few days . Most of these are ornamental articles ; and we are glad to see it , considering that they are principally prepared by those who are cultivated and at leisure , by whose tastes we would cheerfully govern our own , and whose influence would tend very much to refine and improve the condition of society . But we doubt , sincerely , whether they best advance even this object ; for many of the articles are of such singular design and fashion , that they would hardly gain admission to our notice , much less a permanent station in our parlors , except that they are offered and sold at the Fairs . We have every product of the earth and of art , manufactured into all sorts of fantastic oddities ; we have fortune-tellers and fate-ladies ; things new and strange , the likeness of which is not in the heavens above , nor in the earth beneath , nor in the waters under the earth ; things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and draw the money of the spectators , but // which , when carried home , serve no other purpose , than to show how curious was the invention that designed them , and when the Fair is forgotten , they will be laid aside among the things neglected . But our objections to the kind and uselessness of the materials of the Fair , is light , compared with the graver one  --  to the price . If these articles should be sold at their actual value ; if their makers stood in equal competition with the milliners and the shops , and asked no more than the real worth for their merchandize , we truly believe the Fair would never have been gotten up . But these sisters of charity have no idea of such competition . Value , worth , usefulness , cost , and state of the market ,  --  these are terms and considerations entirely foreign to their purpose . Price , with them , has no such parentage ; it owes allegiance to no principle , but that which gets as much as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercantile wisdom , in these votaries of charity , to offer such articles , confessedly not of general use , nor of permanent ornament , for sale at prices out of all proportion to their cost and worth , unless they had some enginery , by which they could induce their buyers to comply with their terms ; and , true enough , , their very success proves , that they have not reckoned without their host , but have weighed well their means , before they put their hands to the work . In ordinary affairs , men have an eye to the " quid pro quo , " and the scale of equivalents is studied with an assiduous care in almost every actiomi , and especially in all their conduct relative to each other . Almost the whole of our lives is resolvable into bargain and sale ; and for whatever we do , we look for a corresponding return . T is very true , money is not always , nor in any large part of our actions , concerned ; for as this is a mere representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have the value itself ; nevertheless , when we can not match our values , or when only one of the parties has it for exchange , we then call in the aid of money , which will purchase not only material substance , but also comfort and enjoyment , and indeed almost any thing which we may desire , whether tangible or intangible . The successful result of these Fairs is the strongest proof of this theory of the commercial nature of our lives . Now what is that , which the patronesses of the Fairs offer for the money , that they receive , if not the actual value of the article ? The answer is easy , as will be shown , *popular favor . So strong is the influence of the benevolent sisterhood , so powerful their control of general opinion , that they wield it at their pleasure , and sell it out to whomsoever will come to their bazaar , and give them a bauble , as a certificate of their acceptance . Primarily , every man stands on his own ground , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenor of his life and the correctness of his principles . But this new combination in society has a different gauge , and metes out its approbation in the ratio of generosity exhibited in their peculiar way ; and he , who previously had discharged all his duties , and mentoriously enjoyed all the privileges of companionship , and cordiality , and esteem , now suddenly finds a new condition affixed to this enjoyment , with which he must comply , in order to escape importunity , the coolness of his friends , and evem the imputation of meaniiess . It is worth while to observe the machinery put in requisition to pro .. duce the desired effect . No exertions are spared , no measures untried . // Religion and charity , wit and fashion , combine together , and labor in the field . We are advertised of the countless varieties to be exhibited , of all sorts and of all values , to suit every taste , from the staidest utilitarian to the lightest trifler . It is heralded forth , that every body is going , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we must buy this or that , at all events buy largely , to help on the sale , and induce others to follow our example . Such is the bustle and extent of preparation , such is the disciplined concert of all about us , that , when the day arrives , all are ready to strike , and , with one simub taneous effort , to carry their point ; and wo be unto him , who doubts the expediency of the measure-for he that doubteth is condemned already-wo be to him that lags behind , or hesitates to pay the admission fee , and purchase articles at the extravagant prices ; and few indeed are they , who do not submit ; for the contumacious must be pointed at for their singularity , and be punished with at least a temporary ban of society . What wonder , then , that they succeed ? We may be considered over-nice in our morality , but we question very much the right of any individuals or society to demand our money on these terms . When a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease , and our purse , we may indeed give up the latter , in order to save the other ; another of equal power over us , yet of more gentle demeanor , threatens to deprive us of our good name , unless we give to him our money ; others , still more refined , ask our contributions , or that we give up the blandishments of society . All succeed alike , because we care less for the money . Now , there is no fundamental distinction between him , who demands our money or our physical comfort , and him , who gives us the alternative of our money or our social comfort : one is as much our- natural right as the other , and whoever threatens to deprive us of either , or to mulct us in a certain sum of money , in both cases equally attempts to take . from us that , which is unquestionably ours , without offering any equivalent . Let us not be told that people go cheerfully and willingly to the Fairs , there to contribute their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husy enlistment of every motive ? Why this concert , ramifying co-extensively with society ? - Why this intervention of the Faix* with all its exciting parade between men 's purses and the benevolent object ? Why is not this presented in its naked wants ? Why are not our individual charities appealed to , and our contributiQus di rectly asked ? Are not people as willing to give for the support of an infant-school , the blind , or for a-ny other charitable purpose , that , which , it is said , they gladly and voluntarily give at the- Fair ? Is it not rather that these votaries of goodness , through a mistaken zeal , doubt their success , if they use direct means , and hence they resort to this system , so that , by a general combination , and united effort , they may produce an unnatural excitement , and compel the gift of what our free and reasonable charities would never have yielded ? It is natural for man , when he has for once left his usual track , to wander further than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having admitted one principle , which is not adopted in ordinary life , the door is opened for others , that , on more common occasions , would find no encouragement in our hearts . Hence we have not only compulsory // purchases at exorbitant prices , but wheels of fortune , lotteries , and fortune-tellers . Sometimes an article is put up in a lottery , and the discrepance between the cost of the ticket and the value of the prize is offered as one inducement , and the excellence of the object , to which the ticket-money is to be appropriated , as another reason for the purchase of the chances . Sometimes a gold ring is put into a large cake , which , being cut into slices , is sold piece-meal at a large price , which the buyers are willing to give , each in the hope that he may be so fortunate as to obtain the slice containing the ring . Public opinion has already thrown lotteries into the hands of the desperate , the wicked , and the ignorant , and our government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this uneven chance of fortune ; and if the unfortunate be tempted , by this means , to escape a prison , or the poor to save his family from distress , should venture to purchase a ticket at the lottery-office , lie becomes thereby a criminal , and so far loses his rank in , and the confidence of ; society . But here , under the sanction of all that is lovely , virtuous , and charitable , in the advancement of that very religion , which proscribes the lotteries as gambling in the other case , we are urged to buy the chances of greater gain , and are virtually told , that this will be our best way of securing that favor and blessing of society , which a purchase of a like species of merchandize in another place would deprive us of . The poor man wants bread , the desperate speculator wants money , the rich want other gratifications , and the fashionable want any thing , to which the whim of the gay company may give a temporary value ; and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , purchase a chance of obtaining that , which is to him of much more worth , and for the certainty of which he would give a very much larger sum at the fair-why may not the other , in the same way , seek the gratification of his desires , though of a graver nature , and at a place less approved of fashion and virtue ? The principle is the same in both . And whatever principle is shown to be wrong , in the abstract , certainly no application , to however pure purpose , or in however virtuous hands , can justify its operation . These m* nagers of the Fairs would be shocked if we were to propose to them to open lotteries for their private benefit ; and yet , if their moral sense would reject this means of profit in their own behalf ; how does it become so changed , that it will admit it in behalf of any public institution ? What would be said , if one should set up a wheel of fortune , at his own house or office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have the whole police in motion to stop it . Suppose that this adventurer should offer to give half or the whole of the profits to some church or infant-school , even to the blind , would they not reject it in disgust , and spurn the insult , of an attempt to bribe them , to countenance a gambling speculation , by an offer of its profits ? Suppose a gipsey to set up fortune-telling ; our little children would perhaps beg of us a few cents , so that they might buy an insight into futurity ; very probably we should not grant their request , but we should be much more likely to take up the impostor as a vagrant , and send her to the work.house , because , forsooth , she is wheedling the ignorant and the inexperienced to part with their money , without any adequate recompense . But if the poor gipsey is forbiddert voi* , v. 8 // to tell fortunes for her own support , how is it , that the same species of knowledge is to be sold for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ignorant are not allowed to learn coming events of the stroller , what shall be said to them , when , as an argument for our consent to their wishes , they quote the example of the intelligent and the gifted , the clergy , the lawgivers , and those that govern the moralities of the people-many of whom bought an insight into their future fortunes at the Fair ? They can not see the difference between their forbidden gambling at the lottery-offices in the by-places , and that public and allowed hazard in the midst of the assembled fashion and intelligence at the Fair . Nor is the distinction plain to them between the fortune-telling of the miserable old crone in our kitchens , and that of the fate-lady most tastefully arrayed and supported by all those , who commonly discountenance every vice . There is , indeed , a distinction in degree , but not in kind . We may perhaps feel secure that we shall never abuse our degree and proceed to the grosser extent of gambling , and so , too , those , who indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with self-complacency , thinking they will never so squander their time and their money ; for it was said , by a good observer , that one is always offended with that species of sin , which is not agreeable to his own taste . When we have indulged in a violation of principle according to our taste , others , who look up to us as the patterns of life , may indulge in the same violation according to their peculiar taste . Our blessed Savior , although he spared not the great sinners , yet was much more severe in his denunciation of those , who , from fashion or ostentation , broke the other points of the law : " Whosoever shall break one of the least of these commandments , and teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven . " The rich , the virtuous , and the gifted , live not for themselves alone . They are responsible not only for themselves , but for the influence of their character , their actions , an ( l their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these , as the guides for their own opinions and conduct , and adopt their principles , and imitate their example , so far as they can understand and apply them to their own condition . Those , who enjoy the superior advantages of education and influence , should avoid even the appearance of evil ; their principles and practice should be so unequivocally correct , that no lack of knowledge may misinterpret the one , and by no change of circumstances may the other be misapplied . We are aware , that we shall be met with accounts of the great success , that has already attended these Fairs , and of the thousands of dollars , which have thereby been raised for the relief of human misery . We grant these positions ; but to them we offer one demurrer : " The end justifies not the means , " however much the contrary may have availed in ages of ignorance and error ; this reasoning has long been dead , and we are sorry to see it revived again , and we are confident , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sear the public conscience , and make men openly adopt it , as formerly . Ihider the influence of the strong excitement attending these Fairs , when one all-absorbing anxiety engrosses every thought , and every word , look , and action point to the grand purpose , it is not strange , that no time is left to weigh the subsidiary means , or to observe those // niceties of moral distinctions , which temper men 's conduct in other matters . There is such an undue preponderance given to the favorite project , such a requisition put upon the time of those , who prepare the articles , and upon the money of those , that buy them , that many of the domestic and social duties must necessarily be neglected , and many of the common , every-day charities must be forgotten ; the heart is cold to the wonted objects of its benevolence , for it has exhausted its heat upon a single and public altar ; the hand is poor , for it has emptied itself : , and it can give no more relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , that they have thus given time and money , which no private suffering and want , known to them alone ,  --  no other form of charity ,  --  nothing but the universal and imperious fashion could have drawn from them . Without doubt , every friend of the Fairs would wish to carry them on by the most unimpeachable means ; but when they find these to be inadequate to their purpose , they must have recourse to others ; for money must be poured , through this channel , into the lap of ignorance and want . It is enough for them that the end is holy ; the rectitude of the steps , by which it is attained , is of comparatively small consequence . Let it not be supposed , that we have no friendship for all these excellent objects , which these sisters of charity have undertaken to patronize . We love the blind ; our hearts are warm with affection for the sick ; we would do all in our power to relieve the poor  --  to lessen human distress  --  to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these , take any step , which would , on common occasions , be repug* nant to our moral principles . We have no fears , that Ladies ' Fairs , as they are now conducted , will be permanent . We confidently believe , that , ere long , they will have gone out of fashion , and other means of popular excitement will have taken their place ; then will those , who are now their supporters , look back on them with a calm and liberal spirit , see clearly their whole nature , and , considering them as among the chimeras of the past age , wonder that they were ever engaged in them . J.@@183068475.txt THE melancholy tidings reached us , about a fortnight since , of the shocking death of Mr. Senator Johnston , of Louisiana . The circum " stances of this most distressing event , as related in the newspapers , are substantially as follows : - The steam-boat Lioness , on her way from Alexandria , on the Red river , to Natchitoches , blew up , on the morning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat was passing the Rigolet Bon Dien . Three successive explosions , following each other with great rapidity , were heard at a considerable distance . The fore-cabin , the deck above the boiler , ( which in the western steam-boats is l ) laced on the main-deck forward , toward the bow of the vessel , ) and the hold under the boiler were scattered in fragments over the water . Many of the passengers , who were thrown from the boat , saved themselves , by laying hold of these fragment In about two minutes after the explosion , the hull of the boat sunk , leaving a portion of the ladies ' cabin floating on the surface . Several gentlemen and all the ladies , who were passengers in the boat , were saved in this part of the wreck . The disaster is said to have been occasioned by a quantity of gunpowder , which had been shipped in the boat , and which was ignited by a candle taken into the hold , by two of the crew . Among the passengers severely wounded or bruised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-Orleans district in Congress . Of those who perished , was Mr. Josiah S. Johnston , oneof the Senators of the United states from Louisiana . The lo* of this gentleman is justly to be accounted a public calamity . lIe sustained , in the Conbress of the United States , areputation for intelligence , candor , and probity , not surptissed by that of any other member . His death , in the prime of life , and at the meridian of his usefulness , by a most distressing casualty , and at a distance from his family , make it an occurrence , which can not but strike the public mind , and must be regarded by his numerous friends , in every part of the Union , with the most painful emotion . The following brief outline of his active and useful career. , will apprize those , who were unacquainted with him , of the extent of the loss , which the public has suffered from this most unexpected and distressing event . Mr. JOSIAH STODDARD JOIIN5T*N was a native of Connecticut . At the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the late Dr. Johnston of that state , to the neighborhood of Maysville , where his father continued to reside , till his decease , the last year . Mr. Johnston 's professional education was received in Kentucky ; but , after a short time passed there , he resolved to enter on the wide field of liberal adventure , which was opening in the south-western part of the Union . After a short time spent at Natchez , he determined to repair to the Red river country , where he established himself at Alexandria , in the parish of Rapides , in the profession of the law . Nothing could seem more uninviting than the. *tate of society , which then existed in this part of the country . The population consisted of a remnant of Spanish colonists , and of adventurers from the United States : - the neighborhood of the Spanish frontier , rendered it a stopping place for many persons , whose relations to society , in the old states , were such , // as to make it very convenient for them to be able , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new government was , as yet , scarcely organized ; and , in a population of this description , could derive no strength from that public opinion , which is the best support of all government . Something very near a state of nature accordingly prevailed , with very little borrowed from civilization but its vices . Fatal quarrels were continually happening . The neighborhood was distracted by feuds of the most embittered character . Aifrays in the streets were of constant occurrence , and duels not less so . Every body went armed ; and life was too easily taken to be of high account . Where life is so little regarded , manners of course are wild and reckless . Such was the population , in which Mr. Johnston , a young NewEnglander , established himself at the age of two or three and twenty , *n the practice of the law , and with immediate and entire success . His native frankness of character made him the favorite of all classes ; and his extraordinary discretion kept him from being entangled in their controversies . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was so difficult to avoid it ; but , on very many occasions , he had the good fortune , by his prudent umpirage between those who were at issue , to prevent a resort to the field . In a very short period , he was advanced to the bench , where he was equally successful , in maintaining the dignity and authority of the magistracy . He was soon elected as a member of the House of Assembly in the new state of Louisiana . When New-Orleans was threatened by the British troops , at the close of the war , a regiment was raised in Rapides , under Mr. Johnston 's command as Colonel . He hastened to the capital , but did not arrive , till after the overthrow of the enemy . On his return to Alexandria , he resumed his judicial functions , daily growing in the re . ' spectful regards of his fellow-citizens . In 1521 he took his seat in the House of Representatives , as a member of the seventeenth Con* gress ; and , on the appointment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wards , as minister of the United States at Paris , Mr. Johnston was elected to fill his place , and has been twice re-elected , to the Senate of the United States . As a member of Congress , Mr. Johnston enjoyed a reputation of the most enviable character . Mr. Johnston 's style of debate was business ' like and conversational . He rarely rose except to speak briefly and closely to the matter in hand . He did not aim at oratorical display , but sought , by a pertinent statement of facts , and a common-sense logic , to satisfy and convince his audience . He rar ly addressed the Senate , in what is called a set speech ; hut his speech on Foote 's resolutions was one of the soundest , most elaborate , and most instructive , which was made in that debate . During Mr. Adams 's administration , he filled with great ability the place of Chairman of the Committee on Cornmerce , in which capacity he made a very instructive report on the British colonial trade question , which he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senate 's Committee of Finance . He had paid particular attention to the great question of the bank of the United States , and understood the subject thoroughly . He occasion . ' ally spoke in the incidental debates , which continually occurred in the Senate on that subject , and never without imparting valuable informa. ' // tion . He was understood to be the author of a pamphlet called the " Review of the Bank Veto , " which was one of the very ablest , that have appeared , during the present political controversies . The subject of the tariff engaged much of his attention , not merely as a question vitally important to Louisiana , but as closely interwoven with the general weal . He wrote one or two very able pamphlets , one of which was published with his name , on the effect of the repeal of the duty on Sugar ; and pointed out , with singular felicity , the extent to which the prosperity of almost every other great interest in the country was connected with the culture of this important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his state and to the Union . He was himself ; as a planter , exclusively engaged in the culture of Cotton . This circumstance caused him to feel the unsoundness of the statements of the nullifiers , as to the effect of the tariff on the price of cotton . His personal observation enabled him to trace the languishing state of that culture in South-Carolina , to its true cause ,  --  a cause so notorious and powerful in its operation , as to make it wonderful that any other should be thought of ,  --  the competition of the inferior and exhausted soils of South-Carolina , with the newer and richer soils of the South-west . As a cotton-planter , Mr. Johnston bore the clearest testimony to the beneficial effects of the establishment of American manufactures upon the prosperity of that branch of industry . Convinced , from his own observation and experience , that the coml ) laints of the South against the tariff were without foundation in fact , Mr. Johnston of course looked upon the strange heresy of nullification , with peculiar disapprobation . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and all his influence was thrown into the scale of the Constitution . *Such , however , was the mildness of his manner , such the kindness of his disposition , such his candor , such his known personal disinterestedness , that , perhaps , there was not a member of Congress , who possessed , to an equal extent , the personal respect of those , who differed from him on this great and exciting question . He was unremitted in his devotion to the duties of his station . To his constituents he was faithful , in a degree not easily surpassed . Their interests were ever uppermost in his mind ; and every act of legislation , which concerned them , received his unwearied attention , from its inception to its close . He made their affairs , public or private , which were committed to him , his own , till he had done all in his power , to accomplish what was desired . No labor was too great in committee , on the floor , or in private conference with other members , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his care . Few persons had pursued the political career with more flattering success ; but this success left Mr. Johnston perfectly unambitious . His total freedom from selfish aims was one great cause of his influence and popularity . No one ever suspected , that he had a private end in view , in any thing which he either did or forbore to do . During the administration of Mr. Adams , he ranked among the most prominent of the political friends of the President ; and was known to be on the most intimate footing of confidence with the Secretary of State . His character , talents , and merits , would have well warranted the Executive , in gratifying any wish which could have been entertained for his higher advancement , by his warmest friends . But nothing , // most certainly , would have pained him more , than to have had it thought , that he would permit interest to be made on his behalf for any office in the gift of the administration . It was the wish of his friends , two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Louisiana ; but , highly as he respected the state of his adoption , he found no temptation in the honors of her chief magistracy . He had a passion for active efficient usefulness , and the honor and *clat of station were the part of it , which was not only not attractive , but peculiarly burdensome to him . Mr. Johnston 's disposition was eminently social . The Kentucky cordiality of manner had in him been engrafted on the New-England discretion . He selected his intimate associates with care ; but no one possessed , in a higher degree , the happy art of keeping up an agreeable and friendly intercourse , with a large number of persons , of various tempers and tastes . He adapted himself to every kind of society , with peculiar ease , and his company was equally welcome in all the circles of the metropolis ,  --  political , fashionable , and domestic . No man ever understood more thoroughly , or practised more faithfully , the sacred duty of friendship . His time , his advice , his purse , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could sacrifice his convenience and interest with as much alacrity , in the service of a friend , as most men manifest in the pursuit of their own ends . His personal intercourse was characterized by great gentleness and suavity of manner . The rights and feelings of the absent were always safe in his keeping ; and he probably had passed through life , the object of as little personal enmity , as any public man in the country . Even party malignity , which spares no one , left him unassailed . Mr. Johnston had a strong taste for books . Though his active habits of life had led him away from the pursuit of mere scholarship , he was well acquainted with the standard literature of our language . His principal reading , however , was in the constitutional and political history of our own country . Few persons were as well versed in this subject . His library contained a more than usually ample collection of works on this topic ; and it was the favorite occupation of his leisure hours to make himself acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech on Foote 's resolution affords the amplest proof . No man was more perfectly free from affectation and pretence . Honesty , cordiality , and singleness of purpose , were striking qualities of his character . He never made an effort to give himself consequence ,  --  never attuned his voice to his own praise ; and wore the multiplied honors , which had been bestowed upon him , with the unconscious ease of true merit . Nor was he less exempt from intrigue . Although the greater part of his life had been passed as a public man , in which capacity he had filled a succession of stations , most of them depending on popular favor , he knew the arts of the demagogue only as he saw them daily practised by others . He knew no path to public favor , but public usefulness . Content to serve the people , he never courted nor flattered them ; and , residing in the part of the country , where the personal interference of candidates in the elections is not discountenanced by public sentiment , probably no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in p*.mbIic life , had left his advancement more entirely to the care of others . // Mr. Johnston was eminently happy in his domestic relations . He discharged all the duties of a son , a brother , a husband , and a father , with unsurpassed fidelity and tenderness . About the close of the war , he married the highly accomplished and amiable daughter of Dr. John Sibley , of Massachusetts , a gentleman then established and still residing in Louisiana . This lady , the ornament and pride of every circle in which she moves , survives to deplore the irreparable loss , which she has been called to suffer . Their only child , a young man of eighteen years of age , accompanying his father on a visit to his estate , was with him in the steam-boat at the time of the explosion , and escaped , almost by miracle , with trifling injury . The shocking casualty , which has cost his friends and the public a life so dear and valuable , can not but awaken the most painful emotions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the full activity of his mind , in perfect health , in the enjoyment of reputation , public favor , and domestic happiness , such as fall to the lot of few men , without a moment 's warning , by a cruel accident , the result , it would seem , of the most unpardonable indiscretion . No event of the kind could have produced a more wide-spread and unaffected regret . None could teach more forcibly the vanity of human life , or make us feel more deeply " what shadows we are , and what shadows we pursue . " To the truth of every word in this imperfect sketch ,  --  the feeble tribute of a friendship tried by the intercourse of years , on every variety of occasion , in public and in private , in sickness and in health ,  --  there are hundreds who will bear a mournful but hearty testimony ; hundreds who will say , as they hear of his death , that he has not left a more useful or a better man behind him.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
