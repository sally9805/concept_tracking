txt Since the Article on this subject in our August number was written , events have occurred which have caused a general revulsion of public opinion with regard to the benefits , ns well ns the stability , of Philadelphia Banking . The great catastrophe which had several times threatened to involve the interests of the community in universal confusion , and had , on one occasion , abo**t thirty months since , brought embarrassment and distress upon all , has at last arrived in sober earnest . Deferred by enormous sacrifices , in order that the measures ingeniously devised by its managers for the simultaneous overthrow of nil the sound banks of th' Union might fully exert their intended effect , and that the Pennsylvania elections might take place before this astounding shock should be given to the political influence of the Bank of the United States  --  the great crisis of its fate could not , it seems , be postponed beyond the very day subsequent to the election of a new State Legislature . No panic existed , nothing like a run upon the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank of the United States had so greatly thickened , and this great corporation was so destitute of means for meeting them , after it had been for months ahsorbin* the floating funds of the other cities by selling its post notes , payable at future periods , in the market , at rates which afforded from eighteen to twenty-four per cent . interest a year to the buyers , that it was even found impossible to wait the arrival of the steam packet Liverpool , which was hourly expected , and could not fail to bring intelligence of deep importance to the merchants and bankers of this country . On the day the election took place , orders were transmitted to the agency of the Bank at New York , to dishonor a large amount of its post notes // falling due on the next day in the latter city . On the same evening a meeting of the officers of the banks of the city of Philadelphia took place , on the subject of continuing specie payments . Though the Bank of the United States had previously determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented at this meeting , and its officers urged the suspeiision of all the other banks . A large majority of these banks , however voted in favor of upholding their credit by maintaining the redemption of their paper in lawful currency . The events of the next morning soon satisfied the officers of these banks of the futility of their attempt to perform their honest intentions against the determination of the Great Regulator to exert its whole power to involve the banks throughout the Union in its downfall . During the night after the day of suspension the Liverpool arrived at New York , bringing information that the house of Hottinguer and Co. of Paris , which had been the agent of the Bank of the United States on the continent of Europe from the period of Mr. John Sergeant 's famous mission , pursuant to the resolution of the Board of Directors of November seventh , 1816 , referred to in our August number , had dishonored the bills of the Bank , drawn , not merely in the absence of means to meet them , but , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice that further drafts would be refused acceptance . The annals of commerce can not furnish another instance where any party , having the slightest pretensions to character , has undertaken to sell bills of exchange in the market , with full information beforehand that they would be dishonored . Individuals have been punished for obtaining money by false pretences , upon transactions precisely similar . It was a most flagitious attack upon real commercial confidence , and has produced a sensation throughout the continent of Europe , which we fear will be long remembered to the prejudice of such of our fellow-citizens as may have occasion to raise funds abroad . That wonderful delusion , which , during so long a period , had blinded many worthy arid intelligent individuals as to the policy and management of Philadelphia Banking , and its ultimate effect upon the credit of our country at home and abroad , was at once dispelled . No longer could political prepossessions serve the Bank of the United States instead of substantial capital . Even the most invcterate party prejudice gave way under its experiments upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or travelling abroad . False glosses and extenuations have been promulgated by newspapers owned and controlled by the Bank . But the source of these apologies is now too obvious to deceive any , however willing to be misled . Unfortunately for the character of the newspaper press of our country , when the Bank undertook to carry into operation , upon a scale rivalled only by John Law , his great principle that confidence is the sole measure of value , as the means of its manufacture , it made large investmnts in leading newspaper establishments of some of our principal cities . These newspapers were // employed to vindicate its proceedings , and support , in the face of the community , its meditated schemes of plunder . The evidence of its great outlay for these profligate purposes is not derived , like most of its secret operations which have exercised such destructive influence upon public morality , merely from inference . The precise amount expended in political corruption is indeed unknown to all but the principal officers of the Bank-absolute power over all funds in its custody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president by express vote of the corporation , to be applied at his discretion without voucher or explanation . But the fact of such expenditures , and their ostensible object , is officially avowed in the carefully elaborated paper which was adopted by the unanimous vote of the directors of the Bank-excepting the three np* pointed on the part of the public  --  and thus made the solemn act of the corporation on the first of December , 1833 . This extraordinary document , to which we shall have occasion to refer hereafter , in endeavouring to defend the Bank from the charge of having secretly applied the funds entrusted to its custody to the support of partizan presses , and to subsidize party writers , employs the following language : " The Bank of the United States , like every other bank , derives much of its advanta , , es flora its credit and its general reputation for solvency ; and the directors are therefore bound , by official , as well as personal considerations , to remove unfounded prejudices and repel injurious calumnies on the institution intrusted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear right to defenti itself equally against those who circulate false statements and those who circulate false notes . It can not suffer itself to be calumniated down , and the interests confided to its care sacrificed by felsehoods . A war of unexampled violence has been waged against the bank . The institution defends itself . Its assailants are what are called politicians , and when statements which they can not answer are presented to the country they reproach the Bank with interfering with politics . As these assaults , too , are made at the periods of public elections , the answer of the hank must of course follow at the same time ; an ( l thus , because these politicians assail the Banlt on the eve of elections , unless the institution stands mute , it is charged with interfering in politics and influencing elections . ' The country has seen the mercenary band employed under these pretexts , constantly vindicating and lauding all its experiments upon our commercial interests-its contractions and expansions , by which thousands have been ruined-its cotton speculations , which have disordered our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks conducted on mercantile principles have been suddenly sti*ipped of the means of extending their accustomed facilities to commerce by the *vithdrawal of their deposits , from the unprecedented temptations offered to the cupidity of capitalists . At this time the apprehension of losing this great patron exercises an influence apparently as powerful as tire bribery of the original investments . We find them carrying on the fiercest indirect hostility against the banks which have not suspended , in consequence of their exertions to uphold the standard of value . But since the present failure of the Bank of the United States the whole matter has become too transparent to allow the artifices which had so often proved // sufficient on former occasions for misleading the mercantile and producing classes , to exert any very important influence . When most of the banks in 1837 simultanebusly dishonored their obligations throughout the country , a shout of anticipated victory was every where raised by the supporters of Philadelphia Banking . They confidently believed that this general movement , which had been skilfully concerted for the purpose of throwing the odium of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect their rights , would result in the unconditional surrender of the industry and politics of the country to thi&amp;system . Superficial declaimers , both in and out of Congress , boldly charged the Executive Government with bringing universal distress upon the country . It will doubtless be borne in mind , by those who have taken the trouble to examine our two former Articles on this topic , that our facts and deductions went to show , if indeed they did not demonstrate to all unprejudiced minds , that the result of the forty years domination exercised by this system over all the productive and comn*ercial interests of the several States of the Union , enforced and aggravated by its centrol over the collection and disbursement of the public revenue , had placed the whole country in a condition of dependence upon its princ.ipal focus of operation . The independence of the States had become practically destroyed by the nrbitrary*power there exercised over an artificial medium , which had , by imperceptible degrees , been permitted to become our general measure of value . While confidence in this general medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for its redemption in money , the banks in every section had invariably been induced to expand their circulation and increase their accommodations with the avidity which large profits never fail to produce . All kinds of speculalative undertakings were periodically encouraged , at the caprice of those who managed the focus of the system . But whenever their interests or their apprehensions have induced the demand of balances in lawful currency , none of the other banks have ever been able to sustain themselves but by sudden and violent contractions , producing distrust , distress and general embarrassment . By repeated alternations of these stimulating and depleting processes , the industry and enterprise of the whole country bave been continually kept in a condition of servile bondage to a few irresponsible individuals . Under the operation of this artificial system , sudden transiti6ns from fallacious prosperity to actual suffering have always been found unavoidable . The radical difficulty is that paper is not money , and no human power can transmute it into money . When issued by banks as a substitute for money , it enables them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever their interest makes the distinction expedient , they find no difficulty in convincing the credulous holders of their notes that they are not money , but merely rags . Paper may be rceived by consent as the representative of farms , factories , or money . Paper currency is only credit circulated among the people by confidence . // Co sting nothing , or next to nothing , and being exchangeable for money which is intrinsically valuable throughout the world , whenever confidence is general an irresistible temptation is held out to manufacture and circulate this credit beyond the legitimate demands of commerce . Those who are able , by the aid of charters , to inspire this general confidence , enjoy the prerogative of making nothing represent objects of the highest intrinsic worth . This nothing is profusely substituted for money in common use , and as no one will habitually employ a valuable article where one of no cost will answer the same purposes , paper currency necessarily expels specie from circulation , and causes its exportation to those countries where it is held in higher esteem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole airy fabric is destroyed by a breath , and its victims stand agape at the trick of legerdemain by which they have been cheated , with as much apparent surprise as though it had not been repeated time and again . The experience of the people of this country for forty years has established , beyond question , that it is not in the power of man to establish a paper-issuing authority which will regulate with steadiness and wisdom the paper issues of other institutions . XVere our own experience inadequate to establish this axiom , it has been amply proved by the history of the paper currency of England , which , under the regulation of the Bank of England , aided by all the authority of that powerful Government , has produced only a continual succession of ruinous revulsions from the days of Sir Robert Walpole to the present hour . The reason is obvious . Impunity in the excessive use of confidence for individual profit can not fail to lead to its abuse . Whether paper is issued by a single bank or by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much of this fictitious currency into all the veins and arteries of circulation whenever confidence is strong , as to excite the commercial and productive interests to the verge of insanity . Reaction inevitably follows , when a panic supervenes , and a sudden curtailment overthrows at once all calculations based upon such a visionary foundation . In a country where all politicM power is , by the form of government , derived immediately from the people themselves , immense influence can not fail to be exercised by those individuals who are actively engaged in pursuits the success of which depend upon the fluctuations of this system of currency , after it has superseded the employment of money for the purposes of commercial interchange . Among us these pursuits are held in higher esteem than in any other country . This influence has accordingly been found , at various periods of our history , to wield predominant power . Intelligent men appear to have occasionally surrendered their judgment to the implicit guidance of irresponsible persons , whose object evidently has been to realize large pecuniary gains , without regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution of their schemes of personal aggrandizement . The events of the last few weeks have rendered it but too evident that // every individual who either possesses or hopes to possess property must arouse himself from apathy , and bestow his attention upon the subject of public currency , if he expects to enjoy his possessions by any other tenure than the caprice of the manufacturers of paper money . Nor is the security of property alone hazarded by the control which these selfelected rulers exercise over the community . They have been enabled to monopolize vast amounts of property , and to direct the commerce of the country into such channels as will best promote their short-sighted views , by their arbitrary power over the practical measure of value . The state of dependence into which thousands are thus brought inevitably leads to political subservience . Whoever is able to withhold from any indivi - dual the necessaries of life , or the means by which those gratifications are obtained which the force of custom has elevated into the rank of necessaries , can exercise undisputed control over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave , though by courtesy anti custom he may be called a freeman . The aggregation of property in vast masses , under the control of a single person , inevitably lends to subjugation . A practical instance of this kind was lately made the subject of complacent boasting in several of the newspapers opposed to the Administration . It was seriotisly alleged , no doubt for the purpose of inducing others to imitate the example , that the recent election of Members of Congress in Rhode Island was solely carried in favor of the Opposition candidates by the power exercised by two extensive manufacturers - in that State over the numerous voters who were dependent upon them for employment and livelihood . The regulation of the enterprise , industry and subsistence of the great mass of the people , from one central point , by the movement of artificial currency , enables its managers there to exercise almost unbounded power , though neither responsible to the laws of any State , excepting that in which this central point is located , nor amenable to the jurisdiction of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has involved the monetary transactions of the citizens of every State in the Union in difficulties . In many-indeed in most-of the States , it has at once expelled money from circulation as currency , and made it an article of merchandise . rrhe long ascendancy of the Bank of the United States over all the commercial interests of the country has enabled it to inflict the greatest calamities upon every part of the country where other banks have been established , without the slightest power on the part of the State Governments of preventing these evils . Not only are citizens deprived of the means of meeting their pecuniary engagements , but the States themselves can neither collect their revenues nor pay their debts in lawful money . In short , this bank has been permitted to exercise the highest functions of political power throughout the Union . The original projectors of Philadelphia Banking undoubtedly regarded this practical result of its operation  --  the creating an arbitrary // 375 and irresponsible control over the people of the United States-as its main object . Their design was to establish a strong government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people . It xviii be seen , by reference to the Report of Hamilton in fttvor of a national bank , that its specious language , when translated into the vernacular tongue , clearly imports that the Executive power was to be increased by the control intended to be exercised through a great papermanufacturing machine over all the interests and pursuits of the people . As soon as it was established , he accordingly made it the focus of all public transactions , which necessarily involved those of the most influential classes of the cornmunit* . The present advocates of a national bank , emboldened by the great authority of Philadelphia Banking over all our productive and commercial interests , have flung aside all those disguises and subterfuges which l ) ave been suggested by their predecessors in justification of the violation of the Constitution which such an act of legislation by Congress involves . Instead of urging the necessity of creating an irresponsible corporation to assist the Executive in the management of the public finances , as was done by Hamilton , we have seen a distinguished candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peregrination through several of the middle States , earnestly point out the advantages of surrendering the control of the public resources to an association of private individuals , to be employed for their own profit , for the avowed purpose of lessening the Constitutional power of that branch of the Government . Abotit the same period , a gentlcman , * understood by all who are familiar with the politics of the day to be high in the confidence of the principal leaders of the party opposed to the existing Administration-if indeed , he does not regard himself to be one of the leaders of that party-promulgated from Saratoga Springs , at that time the general head-quarters of the party , an elaborately written epistle upon the currency , of which the sum and substance may be understood from a single sentence , which is expressed in these terms : The fhct is , a national bank is the sun of our political system and without it we shall have the darkness and confusion which the planetary system would exhibit without . the great regulator of the universe . " Views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of Mississippi by a late distinguished member of the House of Repr*sentatives , in offering himself as a candidate for the Senate of the United States , which has been republished , with strong marks of approbation , by the leading Opposition newspapers throughout the country . The question respecting the Bank of the United States may , therefore , be fairly regarded as the main point in issue between the two gre t political parties of the country , as distinctly as it was at the commencement of the operation of our present form of government . *Mr . Joseph M. White , originally of Kentucky , and lately delegate to Congress from the Territory of Florida . The letter referred to in the text was published in the National Intelhigencer of the 16th Au*ust last . // It may be worth our while , under these circumstances to consider whether the sagacious founders of our General Government , in framing its fundamental laws , were favored by that marvellous light which the " sun of our political system " has so benignantly shed upon modern politicians . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been granted by the Constitution . But for the authority given by this instrument , any three hundred individuals , assembled in any part of the country , with or without the form of election , may assume the powers exercised by Congress . If , therefore , the Constitution has not invested that body with the power to create a bank of the United States , it may be chartered to as good a purpose by the Whig convention which is to assemble next month at Harrisburg , as by Congress . Now , nothing is more certain than that the Convention which framed the Constitution of the United States expressly refused to include among the powers granted to Congress , the authority to create any corporation whatever with privileges extending beyond the limits of the ten miles square , within which the right of exclusive legislation was restricted . Before that period , the blessings inseparable from the employment of paper currency as a substitute for money had been enjoyed to satiety . In fact , no other single cause had operated so powerfully in producing the evils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security of private property , and the preservation of the political rights of the people at large . The conflicting and profligate lenislation of the several States* on the subject of currency had nearly destroyed all commercial intercourse between the several sections of the Unioa , bad embarrassed foreign intercourse with a variety of unequal and preposterous restrictions , and had reduced society almost to its original elements . In establishing the General Government with ample power to remedy the evils created by a narrow spirit of rivalship among the State Governments , the majority of the Convention disclaimed all desire or intention of empowering Congress to concentrate a general control over the people and property of the several States . This was no doubt among the reasons which led to the denial of power to create a bank-though the prominent ground shown by the debates appears to have been an absolute abhorrence of all paper currency in every shape and form . It is very certain that the upright and clear-sighted sages who took a leading part in those memorable discussions were deeply impressed with the cardinal principle upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the ancient Germanic polity of local selfgovernment derived from our Anglo-Saxon ancestors . Long since eradicated , by the influence of fraud and force , from the old world , its principal vestige , even in England , whence it was originally brought to this country , is the trial by jury , of which the original features have been so materially invaded , at different periods of English history , for the pur // pose of promoting the convenience of the prerogative . No argument operates with so much power upon superficial minds  --  and none is so often urged in favor of the general use of paper currency in all the transactions of social life-as that of convenience . It is regarded as sufficient to justify the overthrow of the most sacred sanctions . Impartial justice , the security of property , and the permanent comfort of the community , are all to be disregarded for the exclusive convenience of those who are enabled , by the employment , in all public and private transactions , of this factitious medium , to exercise irresponsible power . No government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the zenith of his imperial sway . Nothing , on the part of his subjects , was suffered to interfere with his views of what he was pleased to regard as their interests . He always professed a devotion to liberty quite as zealously , arid with more apparent sincerity , than is contained in the fervid declamations constantly promulgated in support of the management of Philadelphia Banking , as a counterpoise to the tyranny of our Constitutional Government . His secret orders were sufficient laws for his dependents . Those upon whom they operated became acquainted with their purport and object when they were put in execution . No directions were ever more implicitly obeyed  --  and none could be more highly esteemed by his followers-than those which empowered them to riot in the plunder of subjugated Europe . The overthrow of established dynasties by military force , in order to relieve their subjects fiom oppression , may be cornpared with the convulsions which have so long agitated the commerce and property of this country , by the galvanic action of the Bank of the United States , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Executive upon the Constitution and the Laws . The unlimited control over the hopes of vast numbers of adulators and dependents which both Napoleon and the Bank were able to exercise for periods of nearly twenty years , at once sank under the reverses inseparable from the preposterous enterprises into which they were equally seduced by the convenience of arbitrary power over whole States and nations . The principle of local self-government has at last found an abiding place on this side of the Atlantic . By the modern improvement of representation , its efficiency and extent of practical application have been incalculably increased . Populous communities are now enabled to participate in its manifold advantages , without being involved in those scenes of disorder which led , in ancient times , so often to anarchy . But this power of extension exposes its principal source of weaknesssecret influence operating upon the selfish&gt; motives of an unworthy Representative , and causing him to pursue a course contrary to the true interests of his constituents . In England , this insidious corruption has effected such enormous sacrifices of the welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few individuals , as to seriously threaten the overthrow of the existing order of thin*s. in this country , the same // cause produced the charter of the first Bank of the United States , as was explained in the Article in our July number . The vast fortunes realized in Philadelphia out of the distresses of those who sustained the actual burden of the war of the Revolution , and who had been cornyelled by necessity to part with their public securities to speculators at two-and-sixpence in the pound , which were funded by Hamilton at their nominal value , in despite of the earnest opposition of Madison to this profligate arrangement , furnished ample inducements for soothing the original opposition of several members of Cone , ress to the National Bank . Experience has invariably shown that , the more distant the Representative is removed from the knowledge and supervision of his constituents in the performance of his delegated trust , the more accessible he becomes to such abuses . The strongest bulwark against therri is , accordingly , to be found in the practical sovereignty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Congress , of the oppressive example of England , in subjecting the people of this country to a paper oligarchy , could never have been brought about , but for the ambitious schemes of the moneyed interest to impose indirect burdens on the whole people of the Union , by means of the General Government . Undoubtedly , the State Governments will be managed by men of like passions with others . The permanent interests of their citizens may be involved by improvident debts , created by the intrigues of speculators . These may be sustained by oppressive monopolies , intr9duced under ingenious pretexts of public advantage . Productive industry may be shackled by laws calculated to make the rich richer and the poor poorer . But , so long as these evils are local , they admit of remedies more immediate and effIcient than when they are simultaneously spread over the Union . Where the whole body is diseased , cure becomes immeasurably more difficult and doubtful than when only a separate limb or organ is out of order . If the people of any State are willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm in another State , the perfect independence of each will promote the ultimate advantage of both . Discovery of any mistaken course will be made the more readily , and proper measures for retrieving the general interests of the citizens at large may be adopted and carried into effect with greater efficiency , under the immediate influence of those whose property and pursuits are exposed to injury , than would be prncticable by the General Government . Every measure , therefore , which tends to invade the sovereignty of the States , or to render them dependent upon , or tributary to , any branch of the General Govern*nent , in matters of internal policy , must impair the safety of the whole people . While the States shall steadfastly uphold their right to govern their citizens within the sphere of their respective jurisdictions , and firmly exercise all the attributes of sovereignty , excepting such as have been granted to the General Government by the Constitution , the public liberty must remain in an impregnable position . No individual State , however temporarily // 379 misguided , can produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall maintain its rights over its own citizens . But , whenever , the political power of the country shall become concentrated , by the subversion of the practical sovereignty of the States , the stability of the General Government will receive a fatal blow . The records of the human race do not furnish an instance of a revolution which does not illustrate the dangers inseparable from the concentration of political power . The oldest form of government in the world , equally with the most recent , only serves to evince the wisdom and fbresight of the great framers of our Constitution , in their jealous anxkty to preserve , with all their original force , the rights of the States over every subject belonging to their internal government . As the course pursued by the Celestial Empire , in prohibiting the smuggling of opium into ber dominions , has been seriously stated to be the real cause of the late failure of the Bank of the United States , the example of that most ancient of all governments can not be regarded as far-fetched , since the disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic in a single night , converted " the best curreney in the world " into a disgusting mass of depreciated shin-plasters . China had realized all the blessings which inevitably flow from a paper currency many centuries before an individual of the present reigning family had passed the great wall . The Emperor , now in possession of the throne , inherits it from the leader of a horde of nomadic rrartars who succeeded in seizing upon the seat of central power in one of his predatory incursions . As every section of that extensive and vastly ppulous nation is entirely dependent for all the details of internal administration upon the central power at Pekin . the usurper and his descendants found little difficulty in establishing and maintaining themselves at the head of the Empire . in spite of the repugnance of nearly the whole people to this forcible change of dynasty . Dut to come more immediately to our own times , the nation which has most recently and most frequently changed its frame of government is France . Within the last half century it furnishes an interesting series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time but not the least applicable to our present purpose , is the original revolution in 1789 . This was brought about by the results of the famous SYSTEM of John Law upon all public and private credit . A clear and satisfactory explanation of this system . may be found in our number of March last , translated from the writing of the celebrated Storch . It will be perceived that Philadelphia Bankin is merely a servile imitation of Law 's schemeeven to the details of commercial speculation , and the exportation of specie to foreign countries . After the desolation which overspread France in consequence of the currency issued by the Royal Bank , the extreme distress of the people induced the national assembly to sanction the repetition of paper currency  --  the convenience of which has always been so seductive to short-sighted politicians , and the security of which was // so unquestionable , when made receivable , as this paper was , in payment for the national domain of France , estimated at an immense value . The issue of assi gnats was strongly resisted-particularly by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-meaning Neckar . But all objections were answered by Mirabenu , in a single sentence , which shows both his talent and his profligacy . " Partout oii se trouvera un porteur d'assignats , vous conterez un d6fenseur n*cessaire de vos mesuresun cr*ancier int6ress6 * vos succ*s . " Can any intelligent man doubt but a similar motive has often dictated the course of Philadelphia Banking-especially in its recent enormous issues of post-notes at such appaling sacrifices ? The same argument led the authors of the funding system and the Bank of the United States to declare a national debt to be *i national blessing . On similar principles it has been lately proposed to issue a vast sum in Treasury notes for the relief of the improvident spcculations into which the banks , and some of the States under their influence have been plunged . Neither the revolution of 1789 , nor the changes of government which afterwards so rapidly followed each other , could have been effected , had not all the political power of France been concentrated at Paris . The most striking and important of all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seizure of power by Bonaparte-would undoubtedly have failed but for the universal disorder and demoralization produced by the paper currency defended by Mirabeau , on the ground that it must ensure the overthro*v of the royal government . The bulk of the French people , groaning under the evils inflicted on them by a false and fluctuating measure of value , were led to believe that the most arbitrary and tyrannical of all possible forms of government , which could protect their property from the plunder to which this flagitious system continually exposed them , was greatly preferable to such a state of insecurity . A faint idea may be formed of the general desperation which at that time pervaded France , and enabled that adventurer to ascend the most powerful and magnificent throne that has ever dazzled the eyes of Europe , if we will call to recollection the state of public feeling in this country , excited by the general suspension of the banks in 1837 . Under the incitement of favors from the banks , individuals complimented as the peculiar Defenders of the Constitution and the Laxvs* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the execution of long established solemn enactments . The control over the livelihood of large portions of the community at that time , as at the present , enabled the manufacturers pf paper currency to plunge them at once into the deepest suffering . But for the forbearance and discernment of the laboring classes , which furmsh the most conclusive proof of the real elevation of their character above that of many who have taunted them for their unfitness to exercise political rights , the whole length and breadth of the land must have been involved in scenes of disorder similar to those brought upon France by that restlessness // of temper , and that avidity for all kinds of excesses , which the paper system always creates among its disciples . A comparative view of the Revolution of England , in 1688 , with that of our own country in the followin' , century , will afford us useful instruction on the subject of concentrating political power . In the mother country a foreigner in a few weeks , by the aid of a body of imported mercenaries not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne and change the fundamental laws regulating the future succession of the Crown , hy simply seizing upon the seat of government , and thus obtaining the control of the whole machinery of political power . But during our Revolution the power of Government was not centralized . Congress could exercise no control over the property or pursuits of the people , excepting such as was indispensable to the managemcnt of the war , and the regulation of political intercourse with foreign nations . Every other power of government belonged to , and was exercised by , the several States . The capture of the city where Congress held its sessions created no disturhance in their functions . Neither the disaffection nor subjugation of particular States by the enemy , prevented the other State Governments from discharging their duties , both towards their own citizens and the common cause of freedom . The great armies maintained by England at vari6us points within the Union for seven years , though sufficiently powerful to overrun several entire States , and to hold some of them as conquests for years together , were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . they were never able to organize a new political system , because the simultaneous control over every State was essential to accomplish that great object . This the whole energies of the British Empire could never effecteven with the assistance of the intrigues , the treachery and the cupidity of many influential individuals among ourselves . Unless every State could be vanquished , and the governments of the whole held under suhjection at the same moment , the means of organized resistance were always at hand . This is the great secret of our strength as a nation . While this peculiar feature of our complex system shall be preserved in its original efficiency by the careful preservation of the rights of the States , no revolution can overthiow our Government , whether attempted by foreign or domestic enemies . On the other hand , the various projects for consolidating and concentrating the political power of the Union , which have from time to time been entertained by the partizans of a strong and all-pervading National Government , would by their success , inevitably expose our republican institutions to destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history have been effected . The stron est guarantee against the possibility of a sudden movement , by which only our system could be in danger of overthrow , is afforded hy the diversity of habits , interests , and pursuits , which prevail among the people organized in // separate and distinct political sovereignties . The practical influence of the several States in the exercise of their rights is therefore the palladium of our liberties . No one can examine the Constitution of the United States without conviction that it was not intended to impair any of these essential rights . The States were expressly secured in the full enjoyment of political power over their own citizens within their respective jurisdictions . The sages , whose counsels and courage guided the American people through their momentous struggle with the most wealthy and powerful nation on earth with triumph , were deeply impressed with the importance of guarding the rights of the States with patriotic jealousy . This is amply shown by the debates , as well in the General Convention where the Constitution was drawn up and proposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption inveshd this instrument with its sole authority as a frame of Government . A mere assembly of ambassadors , with no authority to raise revenue for the most pressing exigencies of the public service , as was the Congress of the Confederation , were continually involved in difficulty in endeavouring to carry on the common cause . The movements of such an unwieldy machine were exceedingly tedious and inefficient even under the propelling enthusiasm excited by a civil war-in peace it was found to be almost wholly unmanageable . Two of the smaller States of the Confederation , Nexv Jersey and Rhode Island , were able to set Congress at defiance . It finally became a matter of necessity to clothe the General Government with further powers to avOi ( l the total disintegration of the system .

Its leading idea is to invest the General Government with plenary authority over the intercourse between foreigners and our own citizens . Its primary office is the control of all relations between the United States and other nations , whether of peace or war . The other powers granted to the General Government are intended to be subordinate and ancillary to this paramount duty .

All powers not indispensable to carry into effect these general principles remain in the States as fully as before the adoption of the Constitution by them . As the General Government was created by the Constitution , it can obviously possess no powers beyond those contained in the instrument which called it into being . Whatever doubts might exist as to implied powers , they are conclusively settled by the tenth amendment , which was made contemporaneously with its existence as a frame of government . We have already referred to the debates with which th' framing and subsequent adoption of the Constitution by the States were accompanied . They are worthy of the careful study of every American citizen who desires to understand and perform his duty to himself , his fellow-men , and to posterity . The zealous and plausible attempt which was made to prevail on the General Convntion to propose to the States a strong Governznent , as the design for concentratin the efficient political power of the Union in a Chief Magistrate and Senate for life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative body , was complacently styled by its advocates , will be fully comprehended after such an examination . This plan was merely a servile imitation of the English system of government . It was proposed by Hamilton , who professed to regard the English as the best of all possible governments . He was imbued with an invincible , though no doubt honest , distrust of the people , who he supposed could be successfully governed only by force or corruption . Practically educated in the camp , his views of mankind were so grovelling that he appears to have sincerely believed that so long as the higher and better informed class of society could be secured in the enjoyment of the labors of the rest of the community , and the industrious classes kept in subjection by military force , good government would he maintained , and no longer . After advocating his favorite plan with all the force of his great abilities , Hamilton found it so coldly received by a great majority of the Convention , that he left the body in disgust , and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lie then appeared to have changed his vi*ws , and with great apparent zeal supported the draft which was finally laid before the several States , and adopted with amendments . This sudden change in the course of the leader and master spirit aurong those who advocatod the establishment of arbitrary power over the whole people , enables us to unde stand what might otherwise puzzle us at the present day  --  the extreme misgivings and almost moi bid apprehensions expressed by many of the ablost and purest patriots of that era , respecting the hostile influence of some of the provisions of the Constitution upon the liberties of the people . VOL . VI . NO. xxIu. - Nov. 1839 . Z // These misgivings and apprehensions among those who regarded the preservation of the integrity and sovereignty of the States as the most efficient security against the inroads of arbitrary power , not only explains the opposition which the Constitution encountered in most of the State Con*ventions , but indicate the original grounds of difference betwecn the two great political parties which have divided the people from that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opponents of the Constitution were adverse to its provisions , could they be satisfied that those who might he elected to carry them into execution would not endeavour by implication and indirection to evade their spirit . It was evidently by those who had witnessed the *viles and intrigues of the enemies of popular rights , as is shown by the general tenor of the debates and essays to which the quesion of adoption gave rise , that the administration of the General Government might fall into the hands of unscrupulous individuals who would endeavour , from ambitious vie**s , to ext end its powers beyond the prescribed limits , by plausible glosses and liberal construction , to the ultimate subversion of that precious inheritance in the purchase of which they had so freely lavished their property and their blood . As the only effectual mode of avoiding anarchy , the approach of which was daily aggravated by the overthrow of public and private confidence from the depreciation of paper currency , the States adopted the Constitution . It thus became the organic fundamental law of the Union . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was placed at the head of the public finances . It soon became apparent that ample grounds existed for the fears expressed ; that the powers of the General Government would be employed to undermine the independence of the State Governments . They were first bribed into the support of a profligate and corrupt scheme for creating immense fortunes for those who had preyed upon the necessities of the brave defenders of the country , by the unjust mode adopted for assuming the State debts , incurred during the Revolutionary war , and thus swelling the mass of that national debt which was proclaimed to be a national blessing . Inclined as mankind are to relieve themselves from present embarrassments , at the hazard of future ruin , those members of Congress who acted under the influence of the temptations held out to them by the speculators , were praised and complimented to an extent unequalled even by the fulsome adulation bestowed in our own times upon individuals who appear to have exchanged the approbation of their own consciences for newspaper puffery , and to he better satisfied with the flattery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posterity . The immense*burden imposed upon the people of the Union , by the adoption of these schemes , for transfer ring the fruits of industry to those who had acquired their claims in the first instance , by swindling the brave supporters of the country out of their bard earnings , and had then been enabled to realize their speculations by operating upon the cupidity of several individuals who had been entrusted by the people with the // 385 protection of their interests-made further steps necessary to carry out the design of enriching the few at the expense of the many . At the cornmencernent of the next session after Hamilton had carried the funding system , he made - two reports on the subject of " establishing public credit . " They are both dated December 13th , 1790 , and are worthy of examination on the part of all who desire to trace public abuses to their origin . In one of them the taxation necess *ry to be imposed on the peopie to defray the charges of these vast debts , as well as to support the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his specious argument in favor of a national bank , which has never been equalled in point of talent by any who since that time have espoused that side of this great question . He urges the establishment of a bank , not as a means of furnishing currency , for he contends with subtle deference to the universal prepossessions of the time , that a well constituted bank would favor the increase of metallic circulation . In short , he brought forward every principle , whether true or false , which might recommend this important subsidiary to his other schemes , to public approbation ; expressly setting forth , however , in a leading and emphatic sentence of this Report , that " it is to be considered that such a bank is not a mere matter of private property , but a political machine of the greatest importance to the state . " Such a political machine was not only no part of the Government recognized by the Constitution , but was , as we have seen , expressly repudiated by the Convention . It was accordingly opposed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular rights , it was admitted that it might be convenient ; but that it was necessary and proper to carry on the Government . at a time when the channels of circulation were exclusively supplied with metallic currency , will hardly be pretended at the present day , by the most earnest advocate of implied powers . This powerful institution was created wholly for the purpose of increasing the power of the Executive branch of the Government , by investing the head of the Treasury , through his influence upon the irresponsible managers of the Bank , with absolute power over the mercantile and speculating classes of society . Among the consequences of this measure clearly foreseen by its projector , but little attended to since that period in the discussions which have arisen upon this topic , was its effect in increasing the expenses of domestic production . We explained , in our first Article on this subject , the effect of an increase of currency upon the manufactures of any country . The creation of the Bank rendered the assumption of another power not granted by the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuits and employmen s of the citizens , by taxing the consumers of particular articles exclusively for the benefit of the manufacturers . Where the consumers and producers live in different States , as must of course be frequently the case , this is a direct perversion of the express terms of the Constitution , and a high-handed invasion of the rights of the States on whom such taxes are imposed . This is not the ultimate // scope of the evils inflicted on the country by making currency more plentiful than would be possible under the laws of trade alone . When taxation is imposed upon the citizens at large for the advantage of particular classes or employments in the community , another power soon becomes necessary and proper-that of determining the objects upon which the surplus revenue , not required for the legitimate functions of the Government , may be squandered in order to afford the greatest advantage to  |p0-litical  speculators . This particular exercise of power in derogation of thc rights of the States , is , however , only required when the duties sinposed by a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the enormous temptation it affords to smuggling , paying a large premium upon the demoralization of the trader and the destruction of commercial integrity . In short , when it is once admitted that it is necessary and proper for Congress to place the whole productive energies of the country under the arbitrary control of private speculators , to be excited or depressed as may best subserve their pecuniary interests or political schemes , or both combined , there is no foreseeing the consequences . By circulating a redundancy of paper currency , they push up and sustain prices at rates which flood our country with foreign productions . To pay for them it becomes necessary to drain the country of its lawful currency . When this is done , to require debts to be paid in specie under the sanction of the Constitution must break down the magnificent fortunes of many schemers which have been created by the paper system . How can we expect , under such a course , to escape the present condition of En*land ? By a paper currency the burden of all obligations was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established es only means of preventing a general overturn of property . This nostrum for the security of property has vastly increased the cost of subsistence , and has created so much popular discontent in every part of the kingdom as to threaten the most alarming consequences . Besides , the charter of the Bank of the United States by Congress was a gross infraction of the rights of the States . In view of the general calamities and wide-spread injustice previously inflicted upon the people by a discordant currency which had subverted confidence and destroyed the commerce of the country , the tenth section of the first article of the Constitution expressly prohibited any State from coining money , issuing bills of credit , making any thing but gold and silver a teeder in payTnent of debts , or passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts . By creating a corporation of private individuals , and investing this corporation with unlimited authority to manufacture paper currency , received in all payments on public account , and , of necessity , used to discharge all claims of public creditors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium of payment was , in a great measure , expelled from general circulation . By the operation of the universal laws of trade , the peier currency of the Bank compelled the exportation of the only currency which the States could authorize to be used in discharge of the contracts // of their citizens with one another , brought before their tribunals to be enforced . This scarcity soon led the States on their part to charter banks with similar privile*es , in order to relieve their citizens from almost exclusive recourse to barter as the mode of commercial interchange . Lawful currency entirely ceased to be employed as the practical measure of value by its expulsion from all ordinary channels , under the sanction of the General Government , instead of the rigid enforcement , by that Government , of the sole measure of value contemplated by the Consth tution . In the natural progress of abuses , this policy , from the conjoint action of the States and the General Government , gradually degraded both . The control of the industry and commerce of the whole country having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were empowered to trample upon the laws whenever their profits or their influence might be enhanced . The legislation of several States was not only shaped so as to shield them from these infractions , but Congress was compelled , at an eventful period , to charter a second National Bank for reasons given at large in our two former Articles on this subject . Madison , who had distinguished himself beyond all others for the ability with which he exposed the violation of the Constitution involved in the charter of the first bank , and the perspicacity and force with which he depicted the train of evils which would grow out of this assumption of power by Congress , was compelled either to sanction this charter or to see the operations of the General Government , of which he was then the head , totally stopped for want of available revenue . Several of the State Governments , under the seductive influence of this great example , have recurred to expedients deeply mortifying to the patriotic feelings of such of their citizens as reflect upon the course and consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at pleasure by fictitious currency , under hollow pretexts of public advantage , were bargained and sold to individuals . In other instances the States themselves have become partners in private corporations , and participated in the black mail levied upon the necessities and the credulity of their citizens . By these means not only has a redundancy of currency which can not be employed for the lawful payment of debts been encouraged by these States , but they have been involved in deep *mbarrassments by the profligacy to which such a redundancy always leads . The losses and inconveniences under which innocent individuals are now laboring from these causes are enormous , while the prospective sacrifices which will probably be inflicted both upon States and individuals are incalculable , unless a wiser policy shall be hereafter adopted and strictly pursued . Such are the results of the adoption by the General Governmeat of a currency repudiated by the Constitution . They have become oppressive in the highest degree . Courts of justice are compelled to enforce the payment , in gold and silver , of contracts entered into solely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the States or the General Government to alleviate the burden growing out of the discrepancy of their actual value , which continually occurs from the avidity of the maaagers of the banks to increase their profits by profuse issues , and the consequent decline in the real value of their paper . The nominal dollar , in view of which mercantile contracts are made in every section of the country , may fall in the market to the value of half or two-thirds of a dollar , in lawful currency . Creditors may require payment to be performed in the latter medium from all debtors excepting banks . No expedient has yet been discovered sufficiently potent to compel them to pay their obligations in gold and silver . Rigid provisions have been enacted in some of the States for that purpose , but it has heretofore been found impossible to enforce them . Any serious attempt to carry such laws into execution has generally led to their immediate repeal , as was the case in Massachusetts in 1837-8 . Several of the States about the same time removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the same object of increasing their power over the community . So great has been the ascendancy of these corporations over individuals delegated by the people to protect their rights , that the agents of these irresponsible bodies have generally succeeded , under plausible pretexts of public advantage , in carrying any measure through the forms of law which might serve to increase and secure their profits . The operation of these chartered monopolies which have been such peculiar favorites of legislatures , has accelerated the unequal distribution of property among individuals in many of our communities to such a degree , as to render the many absolutely subservient to the few who control them . This enables these favorites of the law , by the skilful application of a portion of their superfluity , to exercise an influence which has often proved destructive to the rights and security of the community at large . Some of the leading measures of the late and present administrations of the General Government have been directed to the relief of the people of the Union from these evils , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy in originating them . To use the language of Mr. Jefferson , a strenuous endeavour has been made " to put the Government on its Republican tack , " by the introduction and maintenance of the lawful standard of value . Without proposing the slightest interference with the constitutional functions of the States , Preskknt Van Buren , at the special session of Congress of 1837 , recommended that the fiscal arrangements of the United States be conducted agreeably to the Constitution by responsible officers , instead of being surrendered to the control of private corporations . This proposition was assailed with a degree of vituperation wholly unprecedented even in the annals of political discussion in this country . It was denounced as hostile to the banks , and threatening their total extermination . Nothing can be more unjust than such a charge . If adopted // and carried into execution , this measure can not fail to restrain and regulate those banks conducted as commercial principles , in a manner highly advantageous to their security arid usefulness . Excess of confidence at periods when no practical demand for lawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly been wrecked . The sound and unsound banks , during such periods , which have sometimes lasted for years together , go on crowding all sail in creating a redundancy of paper currency until prices are greatly elevated , and vast importations of foreign commodities produced , when specie is at once required for exportation to pay the balances due foreign creditors . They are then taken suddenly aback , and can only preserve their credit , in such emergencies , by ruining the merchants . The whole country is at once thrown into intense distress from the curtailments of the banks . Now , a constant and moderate demand for lawful currency would effectually prevent these destructive fluctuations . By requiring all paymeats into the Treasury of the United States to be made in specie , the temptation to these improvident expansions , in times of confidence , which lead to so much suffering , would be avoided .. The duty of redeeming their currency would be constantly kept in view of the banks throughout the country . The amount of lawful currency required to carry on the transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under just and economical appropriations by Congress , between five and ten millions of dollars would be amply sufficient . Generally , the public money would be required for disbursement , and be distributed among the community nearly as fast as it could be collected . There can be no question but the direct burden of this system upon the public would be much greater than the bank deposite system . But the indirect tax upon the resources of the people growing out of the invariable management of the banks must be incalculably greater than the expense of conducting an independent treasury , were it treble the estimated cost  --  to say nothing of the losses arising from profligate speculations by public officers which the bank deposite system has always encouraged and screened from detection . But , if cheapness be the main aspect in which this subject is regarded , why not extend the same view to the other branches of the public service ? Our army and navy occasion a great portion of the public expenditure . Why not save the whole amount ? Associations of individuals might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay , the duties performed by both army and navy , if authority only be granted them to plunder friends and foes at their pleasure , and immense fortunes might be realized by the bargain : besides , the fashionable declamations against placing the sword and purse in the power of the Executive would be at once ended . But public establishments are , or ought to be , maintained upon other grounds than affording private individuals an opportunity of deriving // qwq gate of minds . 7 , In the city , too , men live more for artificial , deceptive " appearances - for a petty pride of silly fashion-for a mean ostentation of wealth and luxury , in all its relative degrees-in a constant state of jealous sensitiveness to their position in those classifications which naturally arise out af the dense , heterogeneous mass of men that compose the population of a city-in a perpetual , even though unconscious , habit of self-comparison , of an upward looking envy , and a downward looking contempt . And how injurious must be the influence of the all-pervading social atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character  --  to all mental freedom and fearlessness  --  to that proud democratic dignity of manhood , to that noble love and respect for the equal human nature and human rights of the humblest of our fellow men , alone worthy of the American Citizen-it can not be necessary for us to expatiate upon . Well , indeed , notwithstanding their unquestionable industrial utility , as vast labor-saving machines , did Jefferson term all great cities , in view of their deleterious moral character and influence , " festering sores on the surface of the body politic . " In the country , on the other hand , man enjoys an existence of a healthier and truer happiness , a nobler mental freedom , a higher native dignity-for which a poor equivalent is found in that superficial polish produced by the incessant mutual attrition , and that more intense life , if we may so speak , excited by the perpetual surrounding stimulus that belong to cities . He is thrown more on himself . Most of his labors are comparatively solitary , and of such kind as to leave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is large , open , free , unartificial , and his mind insensibly , to a greater or less extent , takes a corresponding tone from the general character of the objects and associations in the midst of which he lives and moves and has his being . He is less dependant on the hourly aid of others , in the regular routine of his life as likewise on their opinions , their example , their influence . The inequalities of social distinctions , the operation of which is attended with equal moral injury to the higher and the lower , afli*ct less his more simple and independent course of life . He is forced more constantly to think and act for himself , with reference to those broa&amp; principles of nlmtural right , of which all men alike , when unperverted by artificial circumstances , carry with them a common general understanding . And to live he must labor-all the various modes by which , in great congregations of men , certain classes are ingeniously able to appropriate to themselves the fruits of the general toil of the rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he better appreciate the true worth and dignity of labor , and knows how to respect , with a more manly and christian sympathy of universal brotherhood , those oppresssed masses of the laboring poor , whose vast bulk constitutes the basis on which alone rests the // proud apex of the social pyramid . In a word , he is a more natural , a more healthy , a more independent , a more genuine man ,  --  and hence , as we have said above , the farmer is naturally a democrat ; the citizen may be so , but it is in spite of many obstacles . We have here briefly , in passing , alluded to the reasons for our preference of the political support of the country over that of the city ; and to the causes of the fact that , as a general rule , the former has always been found to be the true borne of American democracy ; while in the latter , and in their circumradiated influence , has usually been found the main strength of that party by which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the democratic principle has , from the outset , been so bitterly and unremittingly opposed . And hence the frequent saying of General Jackson , that in the cities and towns his opponents were all powerful , but that at the first country cross-road , there his land began . How generally true this is still at the present day , our readers do not need to be here told . Throughout all the late contest between our two parties , commencing with that of General Jackson 's first election , this natural bias of the cities and towns against the Democratic party  --  the general truth of which is not invalidated by particular exceptions-was promoted by the fact that it was the Paper-Money Credit System which constituted the chief force in the field against it . This fact necessarily involved in the struggle the whole commercial system of the country which was almost wholly administered and controlled through the former . In the cities this being the paramount influence , and comprising not the mercantile community alone , but extensive other classes , professional and laboring , more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large proportion of those classes whose natural instincts and sympathies , as well as their substantial interests , ought more properly to have attached them to the Democratic party , and would have done so , but for this peculiar conjunction of causes , and the overpowering pressure of influence upon them from above , by the great mercantile community , on whose patronage depended their daily bread . A consideration of the general ideas and facts here referred to makes the more remarkable the contrast between the results of the late New York election in the city and in the country . How happens it , that while in every other ipiarter of the Union we see the manifesflitions of a popular movement so powerful and so grand , in favor of the policy of the Democratic party , yet in the Country of Mr. Van Buren 's native State , where a few years ago our party was so overwhelmingly in the ascendant , the progress of that movement is found to be , though sensible , yet comparatively so feeble and slow ,  --  while , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home and stronghold of the antagonist principle to that movement , it has been seen to sweep on to so decisive and satis* factory a victory ? Whence this unnatural contrast ? Had the converse of the *ct been the case , its explanation might have seemed obvious // enough , as we observe it in the two sister cities of the great commercial emporium of which we are speaking , Philadelphia and Boston . Had both city and country gone against the Administration , by however small a majority , the contrast of the exception it would have presented to the general course of public opinion throughout the rest of the Union , would still have been less remarkable than their present attitude of opposition to each other ,  --  the city strongly , purely , and zealously democratic , and the country arrayed on the side of a system of opinions , of which the farmers ought certainly to be the very last amongst whom we should look for the peculiar supporters and pastisans . It is of this anomaly that we desire to render an account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than for the benefit of that portion of our friends in the State of New York itself ; to whom the lesson afforded by their late election particularly addresses itself . We can not , with any degree of consistency , allow it to pass unexplained , little agreeable as it may be to repeat some necessary truths , which , however wholesome , may not probably be very acceptable to many both personal and political friends . May it not be possible that the city election was unfavorably influenced against the Whigs by fraud , their opponents having entire possession of its municipal organization , through the Mayor and Councils , with a majority of the inspectors of election in every ward ? Or may not a considerable portion of the probable Whig votes have been kept from the polls by violence and tumult by reason of that deep feeling , on the part of the rude " lower classes of society , " which has evidently been excited with a peculiarly strong democratic enthusiasm on the present occasion ? Unfortunately for both these pleas of extenuation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whig press itself of the city was compelled to bear a most unusual testimony to the perfect fairness and order of the election , under the administration of the Democratic public authorities , and to its completeness as a satisfactory test of the genuine public opinion of the community . And this is in fact the first election within our remembrance at which the defeated party has been forced , not only to admit this fact , but even to volunteer its admission . The truth is simply , as has been already strongly stated by the Democratic press of the city , that the victory in the one has been due to the frankness and freedom with which the broad deiiocratic princip*les involved in the general policy of the Administration were put forward before the people ; and the defeat in the other mainly to the different course that was pursued by the great body of the party press and party leaders , namely , that of compromise , non-committalism , reserve , " moderation " - the effect of which was , so far to blend together the shades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two parties , as to make it not easy for the common sense of common people to distinguish them apart . Hence the " confused state of the public mini " to which we ascribed in advance the probable loss of the // December , election in the State . Hence the absence of that deep popular enthusiasrn , in behalf of strong principles broadly defined and strongly brought out in bright relief ; to which our general course of Democratic victories of the present year is to be solely ascribed . A portion of the Democratic press and politicians of the State have retorted upon the city , that it was to the needlessly strong and " ultra " promulgation of principles , on the part of the latter , that the defeat in the former was attributable . And to a certain extent the remark may not be entirely incorrect . The leading issues on which the election was contested in the city were comprised in the famous " pledges " required by Tammany Hall from the Democratic candidates for the Legislature . These were-the Independent Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; uncompromising opposition to the bestowal of any more bank charters , or to the renewal of any old ones ; the prompt suppression of small bills under the denomination of five dollars ; and opposition to the incurring of debt by the State for the construction of works of internal improvement . Here were broad and strong propositions , all of a soundly democratic character , all in harmony with the genera principles involved in most of the leading measures that have formed the topics of political discussion during the past several years . They naturally seized powerfully hold of the public mind in the city . They worthily roused its attention , its enthusiasm . Here was no wavering , no double-dealing , no party management . All was open , bold , and genuinely , radically democratic . The effect is before the world . It should be borne in mind that the public mind in the city had been gradually prepared , by a long process of deep agitation on fundamental principles during four or five years past , for the reception of this strong regimen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced the movement which has now swept over the whole land , north , east , south and west . It was there that first appeared the incipient fermentation of that purifying leaven of " Locofocoism " which is now fast leavening the whole lump . In New York city the trammels of the old , and sadly abused , system of party management and party " usages , " had been to a great extent cast *W and the limbs of its now free Democracy , formerly so hampered and cramped as to have become almost paralyzed by the long process , had begun to *ecover their healthy native vigor . ' In the country , unfortunately , to too great an extent , this was not the case . There is no other possible means by which a majority thus demoralized by a long system of party mis-management , can recover its pristine energies , and with them re-establish the crumbled fabric of its ascendency , than by going for a few years into minority , there to undergo , at the same time the process of just punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . If that majority has been but a false professing democracy , sustained by corrupt means , and by the in ere discipline of party organization , then this process of decline by its c wn // internal decay must be fatal . The disease is in that case a mortal one , and no human skill or power can arrest the progress of cancerous mortification , or avert its certain result of dissolution . But if on the other hand , it was indeed , as it professed itself , a true democracy , however perverted and cramped in the freedom of external developemetit , and however overspread by superficial disease , yet full of all the healthy and self-purifying vigor of the democratic principle at its heart , then is its malady , violent and convulsive as it may seem , but a transient and trifling one . The necessary course of its progress must be precisely what we have seen in the city of New York-first , a secession of a small fraction of the large majority , led , possibly , by a single bold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that small fraction by the leaders of the dominant majority , for the hateful radicalism of their new-fangled " destructive , " " jacobinical , " " agrarian , " " insane , " " Robespierrean , " principles , accompanied with a consequent general social panic of abhorrence of the said principles and their partisans ; thirdly , the gradual progress of the opinions of the new party , stimulated by persecution , until they have made such encroachment upon the former numerical majority as to throw the power into the hands of the common enemy , who has meanwhile been standing coolly by , fanning the flame of discord , and exulting in the arrival of the moment to profit by it ; fonrthly , the complete ascendency of the latter for a time , while a vehement internal struggle is still in progress between the old and the new school , between which the democratic party is now distracted ; fifthly , the consummation of this latter process of fermentation , the complete ascendency of the new school , accompanied by the acquisition of many honest converts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a considerable defecation of its own old unwholesome particles , which are soon seen to collect as a distinct scum upon the surface , and to pass off , under the name of " Conservatives , ** or any other they may choose to adopt ; and finally , the complete , decisive , and glorious reinstatement of the democratic majority in power , purified , reinvigorated , renewed , and , let us hope , penitent from the punishment it has so well deserved and so severely suffered , and wise with the experience which has been the precious jewel in the head of its adversity . In this mere general statement of the natural steps of this necessary periodical process , our readers will of course readiry recognize th&amp;actual facts of the history of the Democratic party in the City of New York through the past five years . In the State at large , the development of the process has not quite kept pace with its rapidity in the former . The majority was retained in the State , the compactness and order of the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city was plunged into the midst of all its confusion . The natural consequence is that the process has also reached its necessary consummation sooner in the one than in the other . In this idea is contained the full explanation of the late election . // December , The party leaders and the party press , in the State at large , have never yet come boldly forth with the same free and strong avowals of pure democratic principles , that have already , for some time , been familiar to the public mind of the city . They have still clung too fondly to the flesh-pots of Egypt . They have not yet overcome their ancient timid reverence for their banks , and their credit system , and their paper money . There has been too much of compromise and concession of principle in their efforts to compose their party divisions ; too much postponement of agitation of topics of dissension , which must come sooner or later . There has been too much of stifling of opinion under the uniform discipline of party management ; too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nothing but the truth , ' to petty motives of seeming expediency ; too much trimming of sails to shifting breezes of temporary popularity ; too little confidence in their own principles , and in the eventual rectitude of the popular judgment . Witness , for example , the disgraceful spectacle presented at the last session of the Legislature , of the politicians of both parties vieing with each other in restoring to the banks of the State the privilege of issuing small bills ! - retracing one of the most important steps in the progress of sound doctrine in relation to the currency , achieved by the long labors of past years-taking back the whole justly odious system of paper currency to the arms of the so-called Democratic party- repenting , recanting , repudiating , one of the most important doctrines of the party to which they still professed undiminished attachment . Such an act was suicidal . It was performed in the Legislature with all the indecent haste of a weak timidity , to cast off the burden of an apparent temporary unpopularity , which was said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the farmers found them to be replaced with floods of the small trash issued by the banks of other States . But that was not the true remedy for the evil . On the passage of that act we foresaw a severe and inevitable retribution ; and the confused state of the public mind , the distrust of the professed democracy of the party which could be so inconsistent with itself ; with the consequent loss of the recent election in the State , are but the natural consummation of that well merited retribution . In this point of view , then , we assent to the assertion of not a few of our friends in the country , that it was to the strong and " ultra " principles set forth by the more radkal democracy of the city , that the loss of the State is to be ascribed . It was so-not because those principles were not all perfectly sound and just-not because they were not calculated to call forth the strongest assent of the popular judgment , and the warmest fervor of popular enthusiasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but because the Country , through the fault of its too timid politicians and presses , was not prepared for them. * Its long dis * In fact , even with reference to the Independent Treasury , it was not till within a few weeks before the election that the Democratic press of the country began // ordered digestion was not equal to the strong and manly food which alone would suffice to satisfy the healthier constitution of the City Democracy . Yet it is no subject for regret to have lost an election thus Better far a present defeat encountered for the truth 's sake , than a hollow and insecure victory at the expense of the compromise of our convictions , at the sacrifice of a part of the truth , and of all our fearless candor in its conscientious avowal . It is true the New York pledges were and are a part of the general creed of the Democratic party ; and when the country Democratic papers abstained from publishing , them , an deven repudiated a part of them as the extravagant ultraisms of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Whig papers paraded them in their columns , as arguments against their opponents , who shrank from their honest acknowledgnsentthe latter were right in their accusation , the former were wrong in their feeble and timid denial  --  a course which was directly calculated to make them produce the worst effects on the public mind that the Whigs could desire . The better course would have been to follow the fine example of the democracy of the city  --  to be foremost in the avowal , and earnest in the discussion of them ; fearless in their conviction of the soundness of their own principles , and in their confidence in the ultimate approval of them by the sober second-thought of the people . They may depend upon it that they would then have produced the same effects in the country which they , and they alone , have produced in the city . Our readers will therefore be at no loss now to understand , and believe in the sincerity of the remark , that we look upon the results of the late election in the State of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawbacks of comparatively trifling reasons , chiefly of a personal nature , which could have made a different result somewhat more agreeable . The very defeat in the State has served to hring out , in stronger relief ; the true moral value of the victory in the city ; and by pointing so unequivocally to the opposite respective causes of the one and of the other , to afford a lesson to ourselves in the true philosophy of democratic party-politics , of far higher and more permanent usefulness than could have attached to the most overwhelming triumph , obtained at the cost of the compromise of a principle , or of an equivocating timidity in its avowal . Collaterally with the main cause of this result in the State , as ? tated above , and directly connected with it , is another to which we can not avoid an allusion . We refer to that decay , which had undeniably taken place , of the popular confidence in that general system of party administration , well organized and centralized , through which a number of the old leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ti**c firly to discuss it , in the true spirit and essence of its policy . And we have been assured by authority entitled to the greatest reliance , that had but a couple of months lon*er been allowed for its discussion , a result no less decisive might confidently have been anticipated from it , than has been witnessed in Indiana , Tennessee , and the rest of the Union . // immemorial , conducted its government . That system was old and exhausted . To say this is to say nothing more than that it was no exception to the universal law of all human things and human institutions . Lt is impossible to restore the vigor of young health to a worn-out constitution ; especially when to the natural influence of time may have been added that more rapid and fatal retributive decay consequent on the too high living to which the very seeming excess of robust health is too often apt to tempt men . The abominable system of legislation , which so long prevailed in that State , in the distribution of special privilege of monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , could not result otherwise than in the complete ruin and downfall of the party practising it . The purest party conceivable could not but have become corrupted and demoralized by it . It could not but generate likewise a thousand ndmini*trative abuses ; and connecting itself directly , in intimate and pervading alliance , with the general party organization through which the whole political action of the State was made to work , it could but result in the effect above adverted to , of ultimately destroying the popular attachment to that system of centralized organization , and to the individuals by whom it had been directed and managed . The people were tired of it , and wanted a change . Life offices , especially of pecuniary emolument , are hostile to the genius of our institutions , and naturally and justly odious to all the feelings , and habits of thinking , of our people . And this general remark is not less true of schools and classes of men , reproducing always the same thing under a slightly varied form , than of individuals . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general catastrophe and crash of this huge fabric-this vast arch which spanned the State , and of which the key-stone was at the capital  --  and great was the fall thereof  --  a fall long before confidently predicted and foreseen by some of the first men of the State , and of the party itself Now , there was then but one way in which a party so situated could have retrieved itself It was by breaking up the whole into its original elements , and beginning anew from the foundation , to reconstruct on the deeply and broadly laid basis of a strong , pure , and bold democracy . To attempt to raise again the old fabric now prostrate , to mend and modify , for the purpose of giving it a partial adaptation to the progress of the times , was a worse than idle task . Have the leaders of the party in the State pursued , since 1837 , the course here indicated as the only safe and wise one ? Few will venture to answer the question in the affirmative . At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold stand in favor of the independence of the Treasury , and of the currency of the Constitution , which has now so triumphantly rallied its then broken and disorganized party , few will venture to say that it received a cordial sympathy and support from the great body of the old political leaders of that party in the State of New York . Many individual exceptions might be cited to // this , as to the former remark  --  and there is no question that the mass of the " rank and file " of the party welcomed , with an enthusiasm long unknown , the Message of the Extra Session ; but the general remark , though we make it not without some personal regrets , remains unaffected by these exceFtions , and undeniably true . Nor could the pernicious influence of this course , which was at first pursued , be at all remedied by any subsequent changes of opinion and language , the true democratic sincerity of which must , of necessity , always remain subject to a certain degree of popular distrust , fatal to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those who had once thus forfeited it , and neglected , irrecoverably , the only opportunity of retrieval that has presented itself . We pass by one or two other minor causes which were not without their influence in coi*iperating to produce the general result , to bestow a brief allusion upon one , from which we anticipated the worst effrct at the time of its occurrence . We refer to the course pursued by the leaders of the party at the last session of the Legislature , in using the party majority which they had been able to retain in the Senate of the State-the least democratic branch of its government , from its four years tenure of office  --  to thwart the pleasure of the present majority of the people , represented by the new Whig administration , and attested by the large popular majorities of the two preceding annual elections , in a matter the least worthy of an application of constitutional power of so very equivocal a character  --  the dispensation of office . The terms of a large number of the offices held under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent of the Senate , expired at about that period . Now even though the Senate might consider itself justified in refusing to allow the Whig Governor to remove from office any of their own friends whose terms had not yet expired , yet such offices as fell in , in the course of time expiring by their own limitation , it was certainly but fair to allow the Whig administration to fill quietly with its own friends , according to its pleasure . The State could receive no detriment from the occupation of these subordinate offices by a few Whigs , and such a course would at least have been generous and manly , even if not absolutely required by justice , and a true regard to the democratic genius of our institutions . How long would have been the expressions of righteous indignation which would have rebounded from the Democratic papers of the State , had the case been reversed-had it been " my ox gored by you*i bull . " But the Senate adopted the rule of refusing its arsent to all such nominations , availing itself of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rei , held over in the possession of their offices till the entrance of a successor . There can be but little doubt that if such an applicatien of this law , and of the constitutional participation of the Senate in the appointing power , had been foreseen by the people who framed the one and conferred the other , its possibility would never have been permitted . There are few political abuses for which we are disposed to have less indulgence than that of the dexterous use of legal forms to oppose or // parry that which , after all , should be regarded as the one great governing power in the State , to which all should yield an honest and bonafide assent , the will of the majority . Especially is it unworthy of a party , on which are incumbent all the high moral responsibilities incident to the name of Democratic , ever to have recourse to such petty expedients for such petty ends . It is inconsistent , and , as far as its influence extends , suicidal . In the present case , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of an indecent appetite for the " spoils of victory , " and could not but appear to the people a very unsatisfactory foretaste of the spirit which was to animate the reconstruction of that old system of party administration , of which two pretty decisive elections had proved that it had had quite enough . In fact , what need would there seem to be of going any farther in quest of an explanation of the late defeat of the Democratic party of the State of New York , than a glance at this simple spectacle  --  a Whig Governor and Assembly , elected by large majorities ( temporarily misled , it is true , yet still positive in the constitutional expression of their present opinion and will ) - these bodies sustained by the moral force of two suc* cessive annual elections  --  a " Democratic " Senate holding over in office by virtue of the very anti-democratic constitution of that body  --  and that Senate now emulating the eagerness of the Assembly to repeal the law restricting the issue of small bills by the banks of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other body to repeal a law by which , in the old paimy days of party pride of place , a lucrative office , in most other States annual , was bestowed upon an individual by an indefinite tenure , and to substitute a term of three years ; * now straining the forms of its official power certainly as far beyond the intended spirit of law or constitution as it was at variance with the fundamental principle of its own avowed political creed , for the miserable object of keeping a few individuals in office ! We know full well that there were a great many soundly and strongly democratic members in that body , who participated in the course here condemned . We think , however , that they made a fatal mistake equally of duty and of policy ; sacrificing too much to the excited feelings of party opposition , to a natural and worthy desire to stand faithfully by their friends , and to the object of conciliating , and retaining in the party ranks , a few individuals of their number , who were certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas * The office here referred to is of course the State Printer-held by the present incumbenfby virtue of a law , the repeal of which required the concurrence of all the three depahments of the Legislature . It is personally due , however , to that gentleman to state , that this was merely an application of the same principle already adopted by the Senate of refusin5 to the Whia party , in possession of the two other branches , the privilege of substituting their friends in the places of the actual incumbents of the State offices ; and that it was generally understood that on the recovery of the control of the Legislature by the Democratic party , that gentleman intended voluntarily to resign the office , so as to remove all obstacle to any alteration of the law that might be deemed proper , or to the appointment of any one who might be selected by the Legislature to 1111 it . // 511 here stated may probably be condemned by many to whose views on such subjects we cheerfully concede a much higher weight of authority and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as our candid opinions , no reasons of this nature shall interfere with the free and frank expression of them . We confess , indeed , notwithstanding a few personal considerations , that we can not regret that the political retribution , so naturally provoked by such a spectacle as we have here drawn in feeble lines , has so promptly succeeded the act . There is now a decided Whig majority in the Senatea majority which they will doubtless retain for several years , notwithstanding that we are sure of completing next year the recovery of the more popular branch of the Legislature , nearly accomplished , in spite of all these disadvantages , at the late election . That body will doubtless immediately make a very clean sweep of all the offices within their reach , and will be prepared next year , on the re-entrance of a Democratic State administration into power , to play the same game of party mano*uvre , in which its natural aptitude to learn has had the benefit of so excellent an example for its instruction . Those who were led , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform , and approve , this very impolitic piece of party policy , will do well , in our opinion , to ponder now its retributive consequences . *f he Whigs have retained the State by a small majority . Let them reflect , not only on the moral influence of such a course upon the disinterested mass of the people , but on the exasperation it was calculated to produce among a large part of their oppon*nts  --  the advantage , to an Opposition , of the prospective dispensation of patronage  --  the zeal in political exertion to which it is wont to stimulate a great number of aspirants for each individual official favor  --  the benefit they conferred on the Whig administration , by relieving it in advance from all the odium of its probable bad appointments , and from all the discontents of applicants disappointed by the disposal of those favors which unfortunately can be enjoyed by but one at a time-let them , we say , reflect calmly upon the influence which these considerations must have produced upon the late election , and we doubt not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sufficient explanation of the small majority by which the Whigs have succeeded in retaining possession of the State . The statistical result of the late election , comparatively with those of former years , may be thus exhibited , the figures denoting the respective majorities : VOL . Vi . NO. xxIv. - nEc. 1839. // For the years 1837 and 1839 , we have taken the vote on the State Senatorial tickets ; for 1838 that on the Congressional ticket , on which the aggregate majority was somewhat larger than on the Senatorial ticket . The successive decrease of the Whig majority in the House of As* sembly is about in the same ratio with the popular vote . The aggregate vote of the present year we have not , at the present date , seen stated . If we suppose it to have been somewhat less than that of last year , which was about 375,000 , it will be seen that the Whig majority in the State at the late election but little if at all exceeds onc* per cent . of the whole number of votes cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease of this majority within two years , exhibited by the above figures  --  a steady progress of which the next similar step must secure a considerable Democratic majority at the Presidential election of next November  --  the point to which we would direct the reader 's attention is the much greater rapidity of this process of reaction apparent in the City than in the Country . In the Country the Whigs have succeeded in maintaining their ascendency , though at the cost of a large reduction . In the City , on the other hand , the Whig majority of nearly three thousand in 1837 has been converted into a decisive Democratic majority of nearly two thousand , of the soundness arid permanency of which not a doubt can be entertained . In the observation of this contrast between the two , viewed in connection with the causes which it is easy to assign f&amp;r it , is to be found a lesson in the philosophy and the morals of party politics , which we trust will not be lost either upon the rest of the Union , or upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should yet be able to command so large a popular vote , must certainly appear to the Democracy of the rest of the Union a very extraordinary phenomenon ; of which the explanation is only to be found in a state of things which it is not perhaps very easy for us to make fully intelligible to readers unfamiliar with the late history of parties in that State-though from our central position of observation we have felt it incumbent on us to attempt it . We feel not the slightest doubt of recovering the State next year , by a decisive majority , in nIl its branches except the Senate ; and we trust that the new Democratic administration which will then come into power , will return from its present temporary purgatory , thoroughly purifi*ed by the process-renewed in strength like Ant*us from his ' contact with his mother earth  --  and wise with all the precious lessons in the morals of party politics with which their late experiences have been so richly replete . rrhe course to be pursued to effect this consummation , is sufficiently indicated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our opinion , will avail ; and certainly the idea is not to be tolerated , that while almost all the other States of the Union are crowding , with an enthusiasm unprecedented in our political history , around the Democratic banner so nobly upheld by the administration which is directed by one on whom // of old she bestow* the title of her " favorite son , " the great Empire State alone should prove false to herseig to the true cause of American liberty , and to her ancient almost proverbial political faith . We can not , in general terms , more clearly and strongly express our views of the present duty of the Democracy of the State , than we find them stated in the following remarks of the Albany Argus , taking their terms in the full and broad sense in which they will be received by all who have imbibed the spirit of their political creed , at the pure source of the actual writings of the great Apostle of American Democracy : " Let it not be forgotten , that the PRiNcIPLES OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departed from without danger-as also the great issues before the people-for the separation of the Government from the Money Power , and against a National Bank and an oppressive State Debt-are founded on Truth Cod Justice , and will assuredly prevail in this State , as they have done and will continoc to do in other States . Let , then , the Democracy of the State be true to themselves , and to their cause ; and let them bear Continually in mind , that ( in the language of Jefferson ) these priticiples form the bright constellation which has gone before us , and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation . The wisdoi of our saves and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment : they should be the creed of our political faith. , the letter of civic instruction , the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust ; and should we wander from them in moments of terror or alarm , let us hasten to retrace our steps , and to reaain the road which alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Two elections that have succeeded that of Ne*v York afford a striking confirmation of the general views above stated-those of Michigan and Massachusetts . In the former , the unfavorable result has long been anticipated  --  and not only anticipated , but regarded as necessary for the purification of the Democratic party itself , which had yielded to the demoralizing influence of the possession of power . We are assured , by the best information from the former State that the just unpopularity which has there been visited upon the local dominant Democratic party , by reason of their miserable maladministration of the government , in incurring an enormous foreign debt , and undertakin an extravagant system of internal improvement , is quite independent of that true attachment of the people to Democratic principles which will be manifested next year at the Presidential election , as it would be at this moment , were the occasion presented . There is probably no State in the Union which has been more completely overrun with speculators*tban Michigan ; and there certainly is no other in which so fatal a proposition would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that which last winter but narrowly escaped becoming a law in this State namely , to make real estate a legal tender in the payment of debts , and a*t a valmaiiom to be appraised by the owners of neighboring property ! In Massachusetts , on the other hand , the Democratic party has , for years past , waged its unremittin* , struggle with the old Federalism which has so long maintained an overwhelming supremacy in the State , in a manner and spirit nobly worthy of its cause . It has appealed directly to the popular heart by strong assertions of pure and uncompromising // democratic principles . It has by this means steadily made its way , gaining yearly fresh accessions from the ranks of its opponents , and winning a large proportion of the ingenuous and nnsophisticated rising generation , who have come upon the stage comparatively free from the ancient prejudices and habits which have so long produced the strange effect of alienating a people essentially democratic-at least in its agricultural population-from the kindred Democracy of the rest of the Union . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced upon them by the astounding result of the late gubernatorial election in the old Bay State , by ascribing it mainly to the obnoxious " Fifteen Gallon " law . It is remarkable , however , that the Massachusetts papers themselves made scarcely an allusion to that explanation of their defeat , until the lesson was taught them by the Whig press of New York ; ascribing it to various causes , among which was most prominent the superior zeal and activity of the Democratic party . Some of them have even repudiated the idea that the election was materially influenced in favor of the latter by that law . We might also refer to the fact , that in the two districts in which congressional elections were simultaneously held , no less remarkable a diminution of the former Whig majorities is observable , than in the vote for Governor-elections manifestly entirely free from the influence of a local law of that nature . In the city of Boston , for example , which last year gave a Whig majority of about twentyseven hundred , a candidate so respectable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present election , a majority much higher than twelve hundred . And the important fact should be borne in mind that the aggregate Whig vote of this year falls very little short of that of the last-not more than about a single thousand , in a total vote exceeding a hundred thousand : Judge Morton 's popular majority being due to the immense increase of the positive Democratic vote ; and thus disproving entirely the assertion that it was to the apathy of the Whig party , or to any cause seriously weakening the integrity of its former numerical strength , that the result is to be ascribed . But one more remark upon the fine Democratic victory in the city of New York , and we will close this already too protracted article . This expression of the public opinion of the great commercial Metropolis of the Union can not but carry with it a peculiar weight , at the present period , and in connection with the topics of party division upon which the election has turned . There is no question raised of the fairness and purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is obvious on a comparison of the votes of the several wards with those of previous years , that art extensive change of opinion among the mercantile class itself has largely co-operated with other causes , to produce the result . A still greater falling off in the Whig vote would doubtless have been apparent , had it not been for the influence of the appeals which the party press of the city was still able to address to their old conservative timidity , on the texts of the strong radical pledges of Tammany Hall . But // for these it is extremely probable , as is stated by some of our friends , that the Democratic majority would have exceeded four thousand , instead of ; as now , falling a little short of half that number . Still , however , a smaller present majority on those pledges  --  or even a defeat-is better than a larger one without them . Now when it is remembered that all the questions at issue were mainly of a commercial nature-of the public revenue , of currency , of banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit system " of which the merchants have so long been the devoted partisans , was directly involved in the contest-  --  and that it was the Administration which has so long been overwhelmed with denunciation for an alleged hostility to commerce and to credit , that was on the one side a party to it , against those who have always professed to be the peculiar champions of both  --  the full moral value of such a victory at such a period will be apparent . We have always repelled , and a thousand times refuted the charge of hostility to commerce , or to a healthy , natural and legitimate credit . We have always maintained that our false " Credit System " was the car of Juggernaut to the true commercial interest , and that the merchants who adored it were the very first to be crushed beneath the periodical revolutions of its wheels . We have always insisted that the Democratic policy of re-establishing a sound and stable currency  --  the only sound and stable currency possible -- addressed itself directly to the promotion of the real permanent interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive at the recognition of this truth by the very force of their sufferings , which they were most falsely persuaded to attribute to the reforming efforts of that policy . Now , it is manifest that precisely this result is in process of consummation in the city of New York . The fallacies of the abused " Credit System " are rapidly losing their charm for the ears of the New York merchants . It has been a frequent admission with them of late , that " the Locofocos have not been far from right in their theories , after all . " The late developments of experience have shed a stream of new light upon the questions about which they have been so furiously and foolishly contending for so many years-light new to them , though familiar of old to the tyros in the democratic school of political economy ; and which they might have found shining from every page of a luminous work which has long served as a text-book to the latter , though the prejudices and passions of the former sealed their eyes in obstinate blindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never answered " Short History of Paper Money and Banking in the United States . " Nor can we doubt that the example and testimony of New York will be productive of a powerful effect abroad . rI*he commercial Metropolis does unquestionably exert a very important influence of a certain kind upon the rest of the country -- not upon the proper Democracy of the Union , which consists mainly of its agricultural population-  --  but upon the cities and towns , in which the mercantile is in general the dominant interest . The same convictions will work their way , spreading more // and more widely , whose effect is now beginning to make itself so apparent at the commercial centre and heart . And as we now hear the testimony from many of the West India islands , in which the late experiments of emancipation has worked so safely and successfully-  --  the testimony of the planters and white population of the islands themselves -- that no considerations would induce them to return to that state which formerly they were so blindly zealous in defending against every attack of adverse opinion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant , when the mercantile class generally throughout the country -- in common with all others , excepting the remnants of the present tribes of money-brokers and currency speculators-will look back with astonishment at the infatuation which has of late years possessed them in behalf of a system of banking and currency , in truth the most fatal to their own true prosperity and happiness that the most ingenious hostility of the worst enemy could have devised . On the subject of small bills , having beard the general consistency of our system of opinions in relation to it called in question , we feel constrained here to add a brief explanation of them , although to the attentive observer of the views heretofore expressed in the pages of the Democratic Review it may not perhaps be necessary . In the present state of the facts upon which we have to judge and act* we are uncompromisingly hostile to " small bills , " and in fact to all paper money for the daily common currency of society-except when it may bona fide represent specie , dollar for dollar . We hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to the larger transadions of commerce ; though we have no desire to bring this about by any process , direct or indirect , of compulsion-believing that when left to itself , without any of the artificial influences of legislation , the vigilant intelligence of society will ultimately arrive at this result , on deliberate conviction of its practical superiority in every point of view over our present , or any possible , paper-money " currency . " It may appear to some a departure from our cardinal principle of Liberty , as opposed to the opposite principle of the artificial regulation of Law , to advocate the compulsory prohibition of small bills . And we are by no means surprised at the confusion existing in the , minds of a large portion of the Democracy of the State of New York on this subject ; who , having suffered a great deal of annoyance from the floods of small bills of the adjoining States , with which they were deluged while their own banks were prohibited from issuing them , have conceived , it must be confessed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of feeling is rather partially in harmony , than at variance , with the spirit of Democracy , the natural instinct of which is the abhorrence of partial and unequal restrictions . Were the whole business of banking-involving the emission of paper promises to pay , to circulate as " money " among the communityentirely open , as it ought to be , and free from all legal interference , // excepting the necessary penal legislation against fraud , then indeed should we be prepared to withdraw all opposition to small or large bills . Individuals or associations might be at perfect liberty to draw , and offer to whosoever might be willing to take them , as many promissory notes , from a mill to a million , as might seem good to them-provided only that the latter is allowed an equal liberty of option to accept or refuse them ; and that no factitious character of a quasi-legality , no apparent stamp or endorsement of State sanction , be given to them , whether by a special charter , or by any other contrivance of similar effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are now most determined in their hostility to small bills will be the last to oppose its application to that , or to any other feature of the paper-money system . If the friends of paper money are right in their assertions of its great convenience and advantage , tho sag*ncious instinct of a commercial society , and a population eminently predisposed to every form of enterprise and credit , will soon decide the question in their favor ; and the two mutually acting forces of competition and combination will soon so regulate the system as to yield its maximum of advantage at the cost of its minimum of evil . The friends of a sound currency-that life-blood of the social system-ask nothing better than such an experiment , fairly tested-confident that it would soon lead , by the shortest , safest , simplest route , to the result of an universal v*lmztary specie currency , for at least all the ordinary , hand-tohand transactions of the community . But so long as the present pernicious system is artificially sustained , and governed in its movements , by Law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a totally different point of view . So long as paper-money is made , by a system of legislation which has all the effect of compulsion , the actual practical cztrrency , the virtual legal tender , of the community  --  and so long as the demoralization and infatuation on the subject in the public mind , engendered by the system itself ; continue to make the commfinity , as a whole , deaf to the daily practical as well as theoretic demonstrations of its fatal influence-so long must the friends of a sound currency labor to mitigate the existing evil , even through the uncongenial means of legal restriction . Created and sustained by Law , it is only by Law that its powers of mischief can be reached and regulated . It will go very far to break the shocl* of its periodical convulsions , and to protect the mass of the people least able to protect themselves in this matter , if we can supersede with specie all the smaller denominations of paper which now form the bulk of the actual " currency " in circulation among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end zealously and untiringly , undiscouraged by accidental difficulties by popular prejudices , or party majorities ; though always freely holding out to our opponents the offer of this compromise , namely , to allow them the full benefit in this particular of the invaluable principle of perfect liberty , if they will only consent to extend the same principle to the whole general subject of which " small bills " constitute but an incidental part.
