txt Such attraction has the spectacle of extraordinary talents joined with virtue , on which the seal of an early death has been set , that it has alone been sufficient to give popularity to works , which did not possess any high de6ree of positive merit . The mind , in its estimate of what they are , takes into the account the promise they gave of better things , and the feelings of wonder and sympathy with which they are regarded , give them an interest beyond their intrinsic value . Few works of the present century have been such general favorites with the public , as the Remains of Henry Kirke White , ' with the biographical memoir prefixed by Southey . With a great deal of truth in the fragments , shreds of poetry of no value , and whole poems of inconsiderable power , they yet display so much of elevated and steady purpose , mingled with so much genius , that the world has taken them to its affections . They are read by thousands , to whom the story and works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profligate as he was marvellous , are unknown . The writings of Kirke White have become a kind of classic ; the general scholar places him in his collection of English poets ; the plain devout reader puts him on the same shelf with his Young and his Cowper , and one of the greatest poets of the age , himself no stern moralist , has written his eulogy . Yet we do not think that there prevails in his Remains ' a healthy tone of mind . The delicacy of his constitution , the seeds of disease lurking in his frame , seem to have communicated something like a morbid state of feeling to his mind , and to have generated a disposition to despondency and a delight in complaint . The author of the volumes before us had no such tendencies . He seems never to have thought of criticising the conditions of his existence ; his only aim was to seek its noblest purposes , and to set himself with steady diligence to compass them . He appears never to have *vavered for a moment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any sickly doubts of the worthiness of the objects he was pursuing . His views of life , and the part he was to take in it , were cheerful and rational , and his mind was filled with a perpetual sunshine .

His grandfather , on the mother 's side , was Colonel Zebulon Butler , a soldier of the old French war , a distinguished officer of the Revolution , and who , as the patriarch of the village , might have sat for the original of the venerable Albert in Campbell 's poem . At the age of two years , the parents of Edmund removed to New York , hut on account of some appearances of delicacy of constitution , he was educated until his twelfth year at different schools in the country . In these , he gave evidence of early and uncommon talent , and rose to a superiority in scholarship over his companions , which he afterwards uniformly maintained throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of the year at a distance from home , his domestic affections were strong and constant , and on one occasion , when about to return to the country at the close of a vacation , he pleaded so pathetically with his father that he might be permitted to remain and pursue his studies in the city , that his kind parent could not find it in his heart to deny him . The pledge of dutiful conduct and diligence which he then gave , as the condition of not being removed from the home he loved , was amply redeemed* . He was placed at the school of Mr. David Graham , who undertook with discrimination and success the task of cultivating his faculties ; and his biographer mentions nine little volumes of essays , written at that period , still extant in his school-boy hand , all endorsed by his teacher with testimonials of approbation , and indicating powers of uncommon promise , and a mhid pervaded by a deep sense of moral and religious obligation . Several short passages are extracted by // the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives which animated his exertions , and that the ambition of excellence with him seemed to spring less from a love of superiority than from a certain honorable pride of feeling , as if indolence were a degradation of his nature . ' In his thirteenth year , young Griffin was permitted , as the reward of his diligence , to visit the place of his birth . He found not at Wyoming the flamingo , Disporting like a meteor on the lakes ' - Nor the everlasting aloe , ' throwing high its arms ; ' he saw no hillock by the palm-tree half o'ergrown , ' - Nor any other of the accessories of tropical scenery , which Campbell , with a singular forgetfulness of latitude and climate , has introduced into his description of this secluded valley . But he beheld a region of surpassing loveliness , fairer and wilder than even the poet had conceived ; and he recorded his transports in a journal , full of that unaffected enthusiasm for natural beauty , which had been nourished by his early residence in the country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here he visited the grave of his grandfather , the patriarch of Wyoming , who commanded in the fatal engagement of July 3d , 1778 , which ended in the devastation of the valley by the British troops and their savage allies . He found engraved on the monument the uncouth rhymes of some rustic poet of the wilderness . ' Distinguished by his usefulness , At home and when abroad ; In court , in camp , and in recess , Protected still by God . ' Of this Colonel Butler , Marshall , in his Life of Washington , says , that he was the cousin of John Butler , who headed the Indian auxiliaries . He also implies a doubt of the courage of Colonel Butler in that bloody action , in which perished the manhood of Wyoming . In a passage extracted from the journal of his visit to the valley , his youthful descendant indignantly vindicates the honor of his grandfather , disclaiming his relationship to such a traitor as John Butler , ' and givin gthe following account of this memorable combat . Marshall says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wyoming , and a flag of truce being displayed by them , // Colonel Zebulon Butler , commander of the forces in Wyoming , was by this pretence decoyed into an ambuscade , accompanied by a small detachment of soldiers , and that they were put to rout by a soldier , who called out that the Colonel had ordered a retreat , when he had done no such thing . But this is the truth - The Indians were about to destroy Wyoming ; the male inhabitants were determined to protect their wives , their children , and their property , and were anxious to go out and meet the enemy at the very time they heard of their coming . Col. Butler endeavored to restrain them but for a single day , in which he might find out the number of the enemy and their local advantages , but in vain . Although he saw that they were bent upon their own destruction , his honor would not suffer him to desert them . He accordingly went with them , led them against the enemy , was surprised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were about to be routed , rode among the ranks , exposed himself to the whole fire of the enemy in order to set them a good example ,  --  but all would not do . A sort of freezing horror had seized upon the men , on seeing the savage with his uplifted tomahawk break forth from the bushes , when they heard his horrid war-whoop , and beheld their friends falling fast around them from the fire of a concealed foe . Dreadful was the rout ,  --  yet more dreadful was the carnage . Out of about three hundred men but four escaped , and one of these four was Col. Butler , who exposed himself to so many dangers , and who , nevertheless , had not even been wounded . ' The matter is of sufficient importance in an historical point of view , to be set right . Colonel Butler , it seems , was distinguished both before and after this event , by marks of confidence from Washington himself . Tbe venerable historian has been made aware of the error he has committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley , ' says Professor MeVicar , has promised , that in a future edition justice shall be done to the memory of one , whom they all loved as their friend , and respected as their brave , though unfortunate defender . ' When young Griffin was fourteen years old , Mr. Graham 's school was discontinued . This gentleman has borne witness to the rapid progress of his favorite pupil in a brief panegyric , in which he describes him as one in whom the love of learning admitted of no relaxation , whose ambition embraced the whole course of study , and in every thing urged him to excel , and who , better than any one he ever knew , answered the fastidious // description of the Roman critic ; Puer mihi ille detur , quern laus excitat , quem gloria juvat , qui victus fleat . ' He was next placed at a school , which had just begun to rise into reputation , kept by Mr. Nelson , the famous blind teacher , in the city of New York , afterwards Classical Professor in Rutgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Professor NlcViear gives the following interesting account . The mention of this name recalls to the writer , who was his college class-mate , the merits of a singular man ; and as death has now turned his misfortune into an instructive lesson , it may be permitted to dwell for a moment upon his eventful story . The life of Mr. Nelson was a striking exemplification of that resolution which conquers fortune . Total blindness , after a long , gradual advance , came upon him about his twentieth year , when terminating his college course . It found him poor , and left him to all appearance both penniless and wretched , with two sisters to maintain , without money , without friends , without a profession , and without sight . Under such an accumulation of griefs , most minds would have sunk , but with him it was otherwise . At all times proud and resolute , his spirit rose at once into what might well be termed a fierceness of independence . He resolved within himself to be indebted for support to no hand but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feeble vision , had been necessarily imperfect , he now determined to complete , and immediately entered upon the apparently hopeless task , with a view to fit himself as a teacher of youth . He instructed his sisters in the pronunciation of Greek and Latin , and employed one or other constantly in the task of reading aloud to him the classics usually taught in the schools . A naturally faithful memory , spurred on by such strong excitement , performed its oft-repeated miracles ; and in a space of time incredibly short , he became master of their contents , even to the minutest points of critical reading . In illustration of this , the author remembers on one occasion , that a dispute having arisen between Mr. N. and the Classical Professor of the College , as to the construction of a passage in Virgil , from which his students were reciting , the Professor appealed to the circumstance of a comma in the sentence , as conclusive of the question . " True , " said Mr. N. coloring with strong emotion ; " but permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye-balls towards the book he held in his hand , " that in my Heyne edition it is a colon , and not a comma . " At this period , a gentleman , who incidentally became acquainted with his history , in a feeling somewhere between pity // and confidence , placed his two sons under his charge , with a view to enable him to try the experiment . A few months ' trial was sufficient ; he then fearlessly appeared before the public , and at once challenged a comparison with the best established classical schools of the city . The novelty and boldness of the attempt attracted general attention ; the lofty confidence he displayed in himself excited respect ; and soon his untiring assiduity , his real knowledge , and a burning zeal , which , knowing no bounds in his own devotion to his scholars , awakened somewhat of a corresponding spirit in their minds , completed the conquest . His reputation spread daily , scholars flocked to him in crowds , competition sank before him , and in the course of * very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income superior to that of any college patronage in the United States ,  --  with to him the infinitely higher gratification of having risen above the pity of the world , and fought his own blind way to honorable independence . Nor was this all ; he had succeeded in placing classical education on higher ground than any of his predecessors or contemporaries had done ; and he felt proud to think that he was in some measure a benefactor to that college , which , a few years before , he had entered in poverty and quitted in blindness . ' It was while at this school , that Mr. Griffin first became known to his biographer . He found him modest , sensitive , ardent , loved and honored by all , taking an unenvied precedence of his school-felloxvs ; a youth , of whom no teacher remembers a fault committed , no instructer an exercise neglected , no companion an unkind act , an angry sentiment , or an immodest word . ' At the public examinations of the school in which he was a pupil , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which he wore them . On one occasion , when he carried away the prize from all his competitors for an English version of the passage in Ovid 's Metamorphoses , describing the war of the gods , the graceful diffidence of the young poet , the feeling with which he recited his verses , and the talent shown in the verses themselves , seem to have taken his auditors by surprise . Dr. Bard , a venerated name , then President of the Medical College of New York , warmly congratulated the delighted father on the happiness of possessing such a son , and the late amiable and learned Dr. Harris , President of Columbia College , in his address to the victor , broke out with the exclamation , Macte virtute , puer ! ' Never was that classic sentence more fortunately applied . // In the autumn of the year 1819 , Mr. Griffin , then just fifteen years of age , applied for admission into Columbia College . After one of those long and rigid examinations practised at that time in the institution , which continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names of the several candidates for admission in the order of merit , his own was announced to be first on the list ; a rank which he ever steadily maintained during the whole of his connexion with the college . While the examination lasted , he was constantly attended by his blind instructer , who evinced the most intense interest in the decision . In a subsequent letter to a friend , he described his anxiety and apprehensions during this severe trial of his strength and faculties , and declared that he was most Linfeignedly astonished to find himself at the head of the list . Professor lVlcVicar relates the following anecdote of this examination . The justice of the decision was unquestioned , though the chagrin of one of the rival candidates vented itself , at the moment , in a manner more creditable to his scholarship than his philosophy . He wrote with his pencil the following distich , and passed it along to the victor : " Vicisti , Griffin ; parva at tua gloria , nam quod .11mm quinque tibi , menses mihi quinque dederunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual courtesy of Latin disputants ; " A*mule ! cur senior , fallaces ad fugis artes ? Menses tu simulas , annos tamen insere victus . " The boast was not , however , altogether false ; the author of the lines was a highly talented Italian youth , of riper age than Edmund , and who , by the aid of a learned father , had prepared himself for the examination in an incredibly short period of time . He was the son of Lorenzo Da Ponte , at present Professor of Italian in Columbia College , and partook strongly of that poetic fervor , which even now gives youth to the father in his eighLythird year , and which half a century ago , recommended him to the Austrian monarch as a fit successor to the laurel of Metastasio. * What success might have attended the future efforts of this formidable rival , when months of diligence had been changed to * Lorenzo IDa Ponte , then in his twenty-third year , was made " Poeta Cesareo " by Joseph II . in the year 1780 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , it is impossible to say . Death withdrew him from the course , before the race was well begun . Two other high-minded competitors , after a two years ' struggle , voluntarily withdrew their pretensions ; and through the remainder of his college life , Edmund 's claims to general pre-eminence remained undisputed . ' The habits of life which young Griffin had at this time formed , were such as to combine the greatest attention to health , with the most diligent and regular application to study . We quote the passage in which they are described , together with the judicious remarks they have drawn from his biographer , in the hope that it will meet the eye of some who , in the pursuit of learning , have adopted an injudicious and harmful system , and that it will teach them , by so pregnant an example , how easily the care of the constitution may be reconciled with the greatest attainments , even if it be not , as is doubtless the fact , an aid in acquiring them . Edmund 's habits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the student , on the score both of health and industry . They were early formed , and partly from love of order , still more from a sense of duty , were perseveringly maintained through the whole course of his education . His practice was to rise so early as to study between two and three hours before breakfast , which meal was at eight o'clock in winter , and seven in summer . His morning studies were , therefore , during one half of the year , commenced by candle-light . From breakfast until three r ' . M. the hour of dinner , he was employed at his books ; either at home , school , or college . After dinner , he gave up to exercise and recreation until twilight ; when he resumed his studies , and continued them until bed-time . While a school-boy , this was at the primitive hour of nine o'clock ; and not later than ten , while a collegian : thus securing for sleep some of those early hours , which , in the opinion of physicians , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invigoration of both body and mind . After quitting college , the demands of social intercourse broke in upon this regularity , and led him to trespass in his studies far upon the night ; it was a change , however , which he both lamented and condemned* and had his life been spared would no doubt have returned to those fresh morning hours , which he always spoke of with delight , and which are so essential to the health of the student . 1-lappy they who can receive this doctrine ! With the young it is in their power , and let them choose wisely and in time ; lest haply when old , they pay the penalty of having divorced a life of study from one of healthy // enjoyment . With Edmund , these regular habits strengthened a constitution naturally delicate , and enabled him to bear without injury a more than ordinary degree of mental exertion , and to execute an amount of intellectual labor almost incredible at his early years ; having left behind him manuscripts to the amount of at least six octavo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , and regular systematic exercise ; and his example in this particular is the more valuable , because in our country it is more needed . In Europe , the sedentary habits of the student are attended with comparatively little danger , to what awaits them in our warmer climate , where they are found so often to render valueless all the advantages of education , and to present the painful picture of a young man unfitted for usefulness in his profession , by the very zeal with which he has pursued it . The peculiar character of young Griffin contributed still further to this end ; he enjoyed the health which flows from equanimity . His mind was singularly well balanced ; in that happy even poise which ever preserved its serenity ; hence , though earnest , he was not enthusiastic ; though diligent , he never overstrained his powers ; but preserved on all occasions , even of the highest excitement , a tranquil self-possession , and an even sweetness of temper , which to a stranger savored of coldness ; but to those who knew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abilities . This felicity of nature was early remarked of him by his teachers . " He did every thing , " says Mr. G. , " apparently without effort ; " and so far at least as it was called forth in academic competition , the author speaks from long personal observation , having often regarded with wonder his calm benevolent repose of features in the midst of the highest exertion ; which he remembers on one occasion to have drawn forth from one of his examiners , the warm-hearted exclamation , " He has the face of an angel . " ' While a student in Columbia College , some of his Latin and English poems were thought to be of such merit , that they were printed and circulated at the request of the president and at the expense of the institution . At the age of nineteen , in the year 1823 , he took the usual degree of A. B. , and closed a course of studies , in which he had borne away the palm from every competitor , with the highest honors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed in the choice of a profession . He took , says his biographer , that stcp from which he thought he could most easily recede ; he entered his name as a student at law in his father 's office , and for two months // diligently read the sages of jurisprudence . Early religious impressions , however , and a fondness for speculations of theology , as connected with human action , at length inclined his choice to the ministry . At the opening of ' the New York Theological Seminary , he became a student , with a view of taking orders in the Protestant Episcopal Church , to which , at that time , none of his family belonged . His reasons for joining himself to a denomination in whose faith he was not educated , are given at some length by his biographer ; and when we consider the pain it must have given a mind of which filial affection was so striking a characteristic , to differ on so important a subject with those whom he most loved and reverenced , it will be admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are sorry , however , that the writer of a memoir , with which we are otherwise so well pleased , and which is intended for the eyes of the admirers of ' genius and goodness every where and by whatever name they may be called , should have thought it necessary to take this occasion to enforce the peculiar opinions of his own denomination . Mr. Griffin was admitted to Deacon 's orders in 1826 , and for nearly two years , officiated as an associate minister in two churches in the city of New York . His fine person , and the excellent manner in which he pronounced his animated discourses , soon made him a popular preacher , and the vestry of Christ 's Church offered him a settlement for life , which by the advice of his father he declined . In October , 1828 , he set out on his travels for Europe . He made the tour of France , Italy , Switzerland , England , and Scotland , during which his faculties seem to have been kept in as constant and vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No person , perhaps , ever travelled with a more fixed determination to travel for improvement , if the word determination can be applied to what seemed the natural and unavoidable bias of his mind . Whatever these countries presented of venerable in historical associations , of admirable in the arts , of majestic ot ' beautiful in the features of nature , of illustrious in learning and goodness , was observed by him intently , and meditated upon profoundly ; and at the end of a year and a half , he returned , with a mind enriched and ripened by observation , and accomplished for a sure and early eminence . At the time of his arrival in this country , Professor McVicar was obliged by ill health to suspend for a while his college duties , and Mr. Griffin // was solicited to undertake a part of them . His consent to this arrangement imposed on him the task of completing a course of academic lectures , on the history of ancient and modern literature . This he undertook and accomplished in an incredibly short space of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which speaks of the duty undertaken by Mr. Griffin , both for the views it gives of his qualifications , and its account of the circumstances under which the lectures were composed . It was a duty 1 ) 0th urgent and laborious ; involving , in addition to the general charge of history and composition , the immediate preparation and delivery of a course of lectures , for which he had made no definite preparation , and in which the short and imperfect notes of the professor could have afforded him , had they been in his hands , but little aid . These lectures continued through the months of May and June , being prepared , written out , and delivered , almost , it may be said , at the same moment . They extend to more than three hundred pages octavo ; a degree of manual as well as intellectual labor not often paralleled ; and , *vben coupled with the recollection of it being a voluntary , Unbought service , taken up without premeditation , in the very moment of return , carried on without aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident to such a period of congratulation ; it may be said without exaggeration , that they remain a noble monument of promptitude , diligence , and knowledge , and afford a rich sample of what might have been effected by him , had life been spared . Of these lectures , some portion , it is understood , will be included in the following collection . In justice to their author , the reader must not forget the circumstances of haste under which they were written . For the task itself , Mr. Griffin was well fitted both by nature and education ; since , to great natural delicacy of taste , was added a familiar acquaintance with the best models of both ancient and modern times . His classical education had been thorough , so far as that term may be applied to ArAerican scholarship . He was also intimately acquainted with the languages and literature of Italy and France , and deeply read in that of his own tongue . His recent tour had not only extended his knowledge , and still further cultivated his taste , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a science . The Italian language had been one of his early acquisitions ; he was engaged in its study with his lamented sister , when death made him a solitary student . His instructer ( Professor Da Ponte ) speaks of him as having evinced a singular aptitude in its acquisition , and great diligence and judgment in the perusal of its authors . With the French he // was equally familiar ; according to the statement of one of the most accomplished of our French scholars , ( the Rev. A. Verren , ) he spoke the language upon his return from Europe with such purity , that Mr. V. looked forward with confidence to his occasional aid in the supply of his pulpit in that tongue . His course embraced Roman and Italian literature , together with that of England down to the writers of the reign of Charles II . A few weeks after the completion of this undertaking , he was seized with the disorder , which closed a life marked throughout by the most spotless virtue , the strongest filial and fraternal affection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1st of September , 1830 , after three days ' illness . The memoir closes with a brief and affecting account of the last moments of his life , drawn tip by the parent , whose gentle and judicious management contributed to draw forth the excellent qualities of his mind and character . The Remains ' consist of a few pages of poetry , a journal of the author 's tour through Italy and Switzerland , extracts from the journal of his travels in France , England , and Scotland , portions of the lectures on ancient and modern literature , and two or three theological dissertations , written while preparing for the ministry . These , as we are informed by the author 's brother , in a modest preface , were compiled from a mass of manuscript writings , suflicient , if printed , to fill six octavo volumes , not one page of which , with the exception of a single juvenile English poem and two or three Latin ones , was ever intended for the press . Of course they should not be subjected to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their merits , rather than their defects . We may claim that they should bear marks of talent , and that they should possess qualities to make them intrinsically valuable or interesting ; but we expect and can overlook omissions which the author would have supplied , inaccuracies which he would have amended , and redundancies which he would have pruned away , had he written with the fear of the public before his eyes . It seems that he had been from his childhood in the habit of committing his thoughts to paper , as an intellectual discipline . Such a habit may give facility and fluency in composition , but it does not secure him who writes only for his own re-perusal or for the eye of partial friends , from writing sometimes with looseness and negligence . Traits of an exuberance of style , like that of an extempore speaker , may occasionally be found // in the works before us ; but on the other hand , they possess this recommendation , that they are written with a natural feeling , from the fulness of the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no artificial dressing up of ideas , nor ostentatious patchwork of knowledge . His good taste and manly sense also preserve him from any thing affected , fantastic or mawkish . The poems are first in order . Such of these as are in Latin are all that is expected from verses in Latin composed by a student ; they do credit to his scholarship , and his command over the numbers and idiom of a language , the graceful employment of which is one of the most difficult attainments of human skill . Those in English are not the work of a professed writer of poetry , nor a youth preparing himself with a determined purpose of eminence in that art ; but we think we have seen juvenile poems of less merit written by persons who afterwards became celebrated as poets . They are the occasional effusions of an ingenuous spirit of warm feeling , contemplative , and delighting in poetic imagery and poetic rhythm . The following lines are apparently an imitation of the earlier English poets . If they had been found in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a song of the sixteenth century , from the compactness of the expression and a dash of quaintness in the ideas . Like target for the arrows s aim , Like snow beneath the sunny heats , Like wax before the glowing flame , Like cloud before the wind that fleets , I am ,  --  ' t is love has made me so , And , lady , still thou say'st me no . The wound 's inflicted by thine eyes , The mortal wound to hope and me , Which naught , alas , can cicatrize , Nor time , nor absence , far from thee . Thou art the sun , the fire , the wind , That makes me such ; ah then be kind ! My thoughts are darts , my soul to smite ; Thy charms the sun , to blind my sense , My wishes ,  --  ne'er did passion light A flame more pure or more intense . Love all these arms at once employs , And wounds and dazzles and destroys . ' // The lines On leaving Italy , ' are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concluding stanzas . Oh , Italy ! my country , fare thee well ! For art thou not my country , at whose breast Were nurtured those whose thoughts within me dwell , The fathers of my mind ? whose fame imprest , E'en on my infant fancy , bade it rest With patriot fondness on thy hills and streams , E'er yet thou didst receive me as a guest , Lovelier than I had seen thee in my dreams ? Then fare thee well , my country , loved and lost : Too early lost , alas ! when once so dear ; I turn in sorrow from thy glorious coast , And urge the feet forbid to linger here . But must I rove by Arno 's current clear , And hear the rush of Tiber 's yellow flood , And wander on the mount , now waste and drear , Where Ca*sar 's palace in its glory stood . And see again Parthenope 's loved bay , And Paestum 's shrines , and Baiae 's classic shore , And mount the bark , and listen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ? Far off I seem to hear the Atlantic roar ,  - -  It washes not thy feet , that envious sea , But waits , with outstretched arms , to waft me o'er To other lands , far , far , alas , from thee . Fare , fare thee well once more . I love thee not As other things inanimate . Thou art The cherished mistress of my youth ; forgot Thou never caust be while I have a heart . Launched on those waters , wild with storm and wind , I know not , ask not , what may be my lot ; For , torn from thee , no fear can touch my mind , Brooding in gloom on that one bitter thought . ' The most attractive , as well as the larger part of these volumes , consists of the journal of the author 's travels in Europe . The tour through Italy and Switzerland , which is given entire in a series of letters , is undoubtedly a less perfect work than it would have been , had it been revised and prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that it is less interesting . It is written with great freedom and animation of // manner , and is pervaded throughout by a deeply felt enthusiasm for the wonders of nature and prodigies of art , presented to one fresh from a world of different aspect , and wearing on its bosom no traces of past generations . It is impossible not to enter into the feelings of the youthful and accomplished traveller , as he visits places hallowed by the glorious recollections of antiquity , or gazes on venerable ruins , on antique statues of etherial mould , and on the sublime creations of the Italian architects , sculptors , and painters . Fitted by his natural sensibilities for receiving strong impressions from such objects , his journal shows him deepening those impressions , and rendering them distinct and indelible , by intense contemplation , and then recording them in the glowing language inspired by the feeling of the moment . This has led to what some may perImps think a fault in the work ,  --  we mean the multitude of its descriptions of paintings and statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism , it would yet be difficult to point out a work of travels , conveying so perfect an idea of the treasures of art which Italy holds in her bosom . Take , for example , the description of the Vatican ,  --  its army of statues ,  --  its multitude of sculptures in relief-its innumerable pictures ,  --  all the miracles of genius glowing on the walls of its aisles and chapels , looking down from its lofticst vaults or dimly seen in its farthest recesses ,  --  the vast collection of the choicest antiques and most admirable productions of modern artists , enshrined in its galleries , its halls , and its museums . If the description be long , it is because the subject is inexhaustible ; but the untravelled reader will admit , that it gives him a better and higher idea of the magnificence of that mighty repository of the wonders of art , and the travelled reader will not be displeased with the means it furnishes of reviving his faded recollections . It is one recommendation of these travels , that nothing in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author actually observed ; there is no compilation , no filling up of the plan of the work from the labors of others . The learning by which they are illustrated , was in the author 's mind before he wrote . Travellers in Italy have copied from each other with little scruple . Old Lalande 's work on that country has been a store-house of materials for subsequent tourists , a curious instance of which occurs to us . The author of Rome in the nineteenth century , ' a very good book in the // main , calls Lalande the most tedious of writers , yet steals almost the only pleasant story in his book . In illustration of the indolent character of the Roinans , she relates , that she one day &amp;ntered a shop , the master of which was sitting comfortably in his chair , and inquired for a certain description of goods . He answered , that it was not in the shop , upon which she pointed to a parcel of the kind she desired , lying on a shelf ; Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - Lalande tells the story in nearly the same words . As a specimen of Mr. Griffin 's style of description in this part of the work , we quote the account of a scene , which on Easter Sunday follows the ceremony of the papal benediction bestowed in solemn silence on kneeling multitudes . Then begins a scene of confusion , such as would astonish an American crowd . In Europe it seems to be a universal law , that those who ride may trample without scruple upon those that walk . Lines indeed are formed , but are continually deviated from . The cries , the execrations , the waving to and fro of the pierced and endangered , yet still unresisting crowd , can not be easily imagined . It was curious to observe the great variety of costume which distinguished the day . Here came the peasant girl , exulting in her blue spencer with red sleeves , her white gown , striped with red and bordered with yellow , her delicate pink shoes , and head-dress formed of a muslin handkerchief , folded in an oblong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , By her side strutted her sturdy sweetheart , in his sky-blue velvet jacket , his light brown small-clothes , and his crimson sash . By and by came the pilgrim , with his oil-cloth cape , and long ironshod staff ; priests with their black coats , flowing mantles , and three-cornered hats ; and friars , with their habits white , brown , and black , were scattered around in every direction . Soldiers and Swiss guards , furnished with pole-axes , helmets , back and breast plates , with clothes slashed and parti-colored in the exact fashion of the middle ages , stood at every portal and every corner of the passages . Here rolled the English equipage , light , tasteful , and complete ; there the gorgeous carriage of the cardinal , with its noble black horses , its red and gilded body , its trappings of silk and gold , its three suspended footmen , and its attendant coaches , two and sometimes three in number , following in the rear . Being very much fatigued by the ceremonies of the morning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , I had almost determined not to visit the illumination in the evening ; but remembering that St. Peter 's was the building to be // illuminated , tl*t restless curiosity which haunts one abroad like a disease , at length overcame my reluctance . For this time I was rejoiced that I had indulged it . Arrived at the bridge of St. Angelo , the dome of St. Peter 's burst upon my view in a new and splendid aspect . From its inferior border , even to the summit of its cross , it was adorned , with lamps arranged in perpendicular lines upon its ribs and in the intervals between , somewhat in the form of Jleurs de us , glittering like so many jewels , with a tremulous though brilliant lustre . As we approached , the smaller domes began to raise their heads , shining like satellites , though not with reflected splendor . Farther on , and the cornice of the facade , marked by a double border , became visible in part . Arrived on the piazza , we beheld the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the capitals of its pillars delicately wreathed with lights . Lines of light also traversed the whole extent of the arcades , and surrounded the whole circumference of the circular piazza. here we sat admi*ng this tasteful and splendid scene , and awaiting the change in the illumination . It took place about eight o'clock , and was performed within the space of three strokes of the bell . No less than five hundred men are employed for the purpose . rrhe effect was magical . Suddenly as thought can act , the whole building blazed with what seemed a conflagration . The cross appeared a flame , and the dome to be on fire . *h architecture of the front was perfectly exhibited . Strong lights shone in the arcades , and between the intervals of the colonnade , opening to discovery their l ) eculiar beauties . Pausing upon this gorgeous display , we traced with new admiration the graceful and noble forms , and the stupendous magnitude of the building , which rose before us . Appealing less to the judgment , but more forcibly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelled mitre , in sign of its pre-eminence above all the edifices in the world . Having traversed the piazza in various directions , in order to catch from every point of view , the varied and beautiful effect of the lighted colonnade , we drove rapidly to the Pincian Mount , on the other side of the city , iii order to view from thence this magnificent phenomenon . Arrived at its summit , iii the neighborhood of the church Trinitk del Monte , we looked in the direction of St. Peter 's . Like the Sultan in the Arabian tale , we could scarce believe our eyes , so changed appeared the scene of yesterday . A fairy fabric , built by no mortal hands , seemed to arise before us . The domes , the greater part of the facade , and one wing of the colonnade , were distinctly visible . They lay floating in the distance beyond the intervening gulf of darkness , waving as if with the sun 's beams reflected froni burnished gold VOL . XXXiV. - No. 74. iS // and transparent topaz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The exhibition closed with a tremendous display of fireworks from the castle of St. Angelo , on Monday evening . Having obtained a chair early on the very brink of the river opposite , 1 was entertained , while I awaited the commencement of the show , by the picturesque effect of a multitude of torches borne in boats , which were plying up and down the river . The red light shed on the stream beneath , or on the dark countenances and rude forms of those who bore them , the music which floated from time to time across the waters , the merriment of a number of young men upon the opposite bank , who now fenced with blazing torches , and now waltzed with them in their hands , and again ran to and fro as if in the madness of a bacchanalian revel , the gaiety of costume , and cheerfulness of countenance and festivity of tone and action which pervaded the multitude around , at length released from the rigors of Lent , constituted a scene of animated and pleasing interest . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberated along the channel of the river from the distant city , announced the commencement of the fireworks . They began with a burst of rockets , which lighted up with a fierce glare the houses of the city , the varied dresses and faces of the multitude , the river with its boats , the beautiful arched bridge in the vicinity , and the rolling canopy of smoke caused by the inflammation of their contents . When the smoke had cleared away , we found the whole vast exterior surface of the castle covered with letters and festoons of delicate white light . It is not possible , nor would it be worth while , to describe the various acts of the exhibition , the wheels of fire , the cascades of flame , the darting of myriads of blazing serpents into the obscure of night , the bursting of stars from out the black cloud of smoke , and their fall to earth shattered into a thousand fragments , the roll of musketry , the roar of cannon , the conflagration which sometimes embraced the whole castle , clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grand eruption of the volcano was reserved until the last . After a few moments of profound obscurity , amidst the thunder of cannon and the incessant rattling of minor reports , whose close succession served to show how infinitely divisible is time , thousands of rockets burst from every quarter of the castle with a rush that seemed as if it must bear along with it the solid fabric ; a blaze , that , piercing through its dense envelopement of smoke , shed a glare as if from Panda*nionium , on all around ; and an irregular but tremendous explosion in the air , which appeared about to pour on our devoted heads the inevitable fate of the buried neighbors of Vesuvius . The fondness of the Romans for public spectacles seems to // be their ruling passion . On the present occasion , I really believe that Rome was more than " half unpeopled . " The crowd , the rush , the intermixture of horses and carriages with men , women , and children in the narrow streets , were really frightful , and in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docility and quietness of the noble Roman horse on such occasions , is truly astonishing . The civility of the people , too , is admirable . There is no elbowing ; no striving to get before you . rhe pressure seems owing to a general impulse , and not to any individual effort . Although there was a fine moon on both the evenings above described , yet so bright were the illumination and the blaze of fireworks , that their effect seemed scarcely to be diminished . On the following night , I went to observe the effect of moonlight on the piazza of St. Peter 's . How calm and beautiful was the contrast ! Here was the restoration of nature and of truth , after those fairy visions ,  --  of nature and of truth under their most enchanting aspect . The colonnade , with its rich intervals of brightness and deep shade , the fountains discharging shoots of liquid silver breaking into silver spray , the lofty steps , the broad fapade resting in obscurity , but surmounted by the white lustre of the aspiring dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothed and pleased imagination rested with perpetual enjoyment . ' The portions given from the journal of the author 's travels in France and Great Britain , possess another kind of interest . They contain various sketches of the philosophers , authors , statesmen , divines , and other eminent personages of the two countries . We quote a lively account of a symposium , at which Mr. Griffin found himself in company with some of the brightest wits of the United Kingdom . It is entitled , in the volumes before us , A Literary Party . ' I dined yesterday , with a very distinguished party , at Mr. M***** 's , consisting of Moore , Lockhart , Washington Irving , Smith , one of the authors of the Rejected Addresses , and other beaux esprits ; Mitchell , the translator of Aristophanes ; and some others , of less name and fame . The first is , certainly , a most unpoetical figure . Nor is his countenance , at first sight , more promising than his person . When you study it , however ; when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the receding pyramidal forehead ; the marked , yet expanded and graceful lines of the mouth ; above all , when you catch the bright smile and the brilliant eye-beam , which accompany the flashes of his wit and the sallies of his fancy ; you forget , and are ready to disavow your former impressions . To Moore , Lockhart offers a // strong and singular contrast . Tall , and slightly , but elegantly formed , his head possesses the noble contour , the precision and harmony of outline , which distinguish classic sculpture . It possesses , too , a striking effect of color , in a complexion pale , yet pure , and hair black as the raven 's wing . Though his countenance is youthful , ( he seems scarce more than thirty ) yet I should designate reflection as the prominent , combined expression of that broad , white forehead ; those arched and pencilled brows ; those retired , yet full , dark eyes ; the accurately chiseled nose ; and compressed , though curved lips . His face is too thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its intellectual character . Our distinguished countryman is of about the ordinary height , and rather stout in person . his hair is black , and his complexion " sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought . " His eyes are of a pale color ; his profile approaches the Grecian , and is remarkably benevolent and contemplative . Mr. Smith carries a handsome , good-natured countenance ; and Mr. Mitchell 's physiognomy , though not handsome , is , at least , amiable . The conversation at dinner consisted chiefly in the relation of anecdotes . To my great disappointment , no discussion of any length or interest took place . It must be admitted that the anecdotes were select , and told with infinite wit and spirit . Many of them , I doubt not , were the inventions of the narrators . Such seemed to be peculiarly the case with those of Mr. Moore and Mr. Smith ; who , though seated at different ends of the table , frequently engaged each other from time to time , in a sort of contest for superiority . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way . Both tried only which could relate the most pungent witticism , or tell the most amusing story . The subjects of the anecdotes in general were extremely interesting . Lord Byron , and other eminent men , with whom the speakers had been or were familiar , were frequently brought upon the stage . Mr. Lockhart , meantime , though he seemed to enjoy the pleasantries of others , contributed none of his own . Whatever he did say , was in a Scottish accent , and exhibited strong sense and extensive reading . Mr. Irving seems to be one of those men , who , like Addison , have plenty of gold in their pockets , but are almost destitute of ready change . His reserve , however , is of a strikingly different character from that of the editor of the Quarterly . The one appears the reserve of sensibility ; the other that of thought . The taste of the one leads him apparently to examine the suggestions of his own mind with such an over scrupulosity , that he seldom gives them utterance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments expressed , and separating the false from the true . Mr. Irving is mild and bland , even anxious to please . Mr. Lockhart is abstracted and cold , almost indifferent . // On returning to the drawing-room , the scene was changed , though the great actors remained in part at least the same . Music was substituted for conversation . Mr. Smith gave an original song , full of humor and variety . Mr. Moore was induced to seat himself at the piano , and indulged his friends with two or three of his own Irish melodies . I can not describe to you his singing ; it is perfectly unique . The combination of music , and of poetic sentiment , emanating from one mind , and glowing in the very countenance , and speaking in the very voice which that same mind illuminates and directs , produces an effect upon the eye , the ear , the taste , the feeling , the whole man , in short , such as no mere professional excellence can at all aspire to equal . his head is cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration of an ancient bard . His voice , though of little compass , is inexpressibly sweet . He realized to me , in many respects , my conceptions of the poet of love and *viue ; the refined and elegant , though voluptuous Anacreon . The modern poet has more sentiment than the Greek ; but can lay no claim , ( what modern author can ? ) to the same simplicity and purity of taste . His genius , however , is more versatile . The old voluptuary complains of his inability to celebrate a warlike theme ; his lyre will not obey the impulse of his will . But the author of the Fire Worshippers gave us , in the course of the evening , an Irish rebel 's song , which was absolutely thrilling . Anacreon was , however , afterwards restored to us in a drinking song , composed to be sung at a convivial meeting of an association of gentlemen . I can not conclude this brief sketch , without saying a few words of my host . He is a good looking man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hbwever , to true Scottish sense and cordiality in conversation . He has a strong understanding , and a good memory ; and is exceedingly interesting from the long intercourse which he has maintained with , and the intimate knowledge he possesses , of all the eminent literary characters of the age . The memoirs of himself and his times would be invaluable . He has been the Mmecenas of his day ; and , though not the favorite of an emperor , has conferred more substantial rewards on merit , than even the distinguished Roman . Such has been his liberality , that , though millions have passed through his hands , he is , I am told , by no means exorbitantly rich . ' Of the lectures , out . readers have already had some account , in a quotation from the Memoir of Professor WlcVicar . The l ) ortions inclnded in these volumes , arc specimens of a work of considerable extent , embracing an entire view of Roman and Italian literature , and of English literature in its earlier // and most vigorous period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . Compelled by the short space allowed him , and the numerous demands on his time , to derive his principal materials from his own literary recollections , aided by a brief and hurried consultation of authors , the work bears necessarily the marks of haste , yet it attests a mind well furnished , by a large and diligent course of reading , for so comprehensive an undertaking , and shows a celeriiy of literary execution altogether extraordinai*y . How eloquently he could discourse of the great masters of verse in his own and other languages , will appear from the following passages , which we take from his criticism of the great work of Dante . This great poem , with all its imperfections , could not fail to excite the astonishment of the age in which it appeared , and to attract the lasting admiration of posterity . It may be compared to an extensive wood , filled with the tallest trees of the forest , covered underneath with a carpet of the richest verdure , and fragrant with the *vildest , brightest , sweetest flowers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shades , and often perplexed by the devious and intricate paths . Though Dante can not , upon the whole , be styled the first of poets , I should be inclined to place him above all others , for some of the highest attributes of genius . The conception of his great work is grand , original , sublime . He invented images , he established a language for himself . His style is as peculiar as it is original . Not an unmeaning word weakens its intense energy , and not a superfluous ornament impairs its sublime simplicity . He kindles the imagination by a hint ; he rouses the spirit by one trumpet tone ; he affects the heart by one thrilling touch ; he tortures the sense by one appalling image ; and then leaves to the fancy of his reader the labor of developement . The reader of Dante should , therefore , himself be a man of genius . Mere taste is not adequate to comprehend him fully , or appreciate him duly . Yet the general and endutiug admiration with which his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses itself in the main , to the universal sympathies of our nature . What most strongly impresses the reader , is the profound solemnity and earnestness with which it is written . The mind of the poet seems full of the remembrance of the unearthly mysteries which had been revealed to him , and not yet recovered from the awe they had inspired . What he writes seems to be dictated by recollection , rather than by invention . He does not seek to embellish , to heighten , to amplify ; he seems to feel that this would be doing sacrilege to his subject ; he appears to aim at communicating in // the most concise and direct terms , an adequate conception of the images yet vivid in his memory . It is impossible to resist the contagion of that awe , by which the mind of the poet is overwhelmed ; or to refuse , while you read , your assent to the truth and reality of the scenes he describes . You are impressed by the simple , grand , unaffected strains of the Florentine bard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read the poetry of the Hebrew Scriptures . But to make you more familiar with the genius and character of Dante , it may not be amiss to attempt a brief comparison between him and the English bard , who most nearly resemnble* him ; I mean the great epic poet of our language . Milton and Dante both depict the awful mysteries of Heaven and of hell ; but it must not be forgotten that the Tuscan was the precursor . Nor had he any light to guide his path but his own genius . The example of Virgil inspired him to write , but instructed him neither in his matter nor his manner . Dante was the first to sing of Heaven and of hell , not as the dreams of mythological fiction , but as the objects of a real faith . He was the first who launched from this promontory on which we stand , into the vast immensity of the universe , traversed the abyss amidst demons and infernal tortures , and mounting afterwards through angelic hosts and undiscovered worlds , gazed with steadfast eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold and daring course , in which Milton is but his follower . Dante was the Columbus who discovered this new world of poesy ; Milton only the Americus Vespucius who pursued his track . In originality , Dante probably surpassed even Homer himself . We can not now ascertain , how much the Jonian bard was indebted to his predecessors . Time has covered the literary history of that period with utter oblivion . The very perfection of his poems would seem to indicate , that he must have derived some aid from the labors and experience of those who had gone before him . It is difficult to suppose , that he could so far have approached the creative attributes of the Deity as to form out of the chaos of heroic fable , by the untaught efforts of his own genius , those stupendous and matured works , which resemble , in their varied magnificence , in the minute regularity of all their parts , in the adaptation of those parts to make one harmonious and glorious whole , " that universe itself whose image they reflect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfections of Dante , are evidence of his originality ; they betray the first , the yet immature efforts of invention . But , though surpassing the English bard in originality , the gloomy Tuscan was inferior in the perfection of his imagination . He did not conceive an epic poem . Though he had the exampie // of Virgil before his eyes , yet his genius and the times led him to a dramatic narrative , possessing unity indeed in its general plan , yet often fantastic , and not seldom tedious . Milton , on the other hand , though originally inclined to throw his mighty subject into the form of an allegorical masque or mystery , happily gave himself up at length to the inspiration of the epic muse . His creative and comprehensive imagination erected from the materials of his subject a fair and stately edifice , which engrosses and almost over*vhelms the mind , and continues to elevate the spirit , even when employed in the inspection of the parts . The Divina Commedia is like a Gothic cathedral , immense and sublime in its dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rich and picturesque in its ornaments , into whose long and lofty aisles the light streams as if unwillingly , unable to overcome the gloom congenial to the place . The Paradise Lost is like the interior of the Panthebn at Rome . The noble breadth of the rotunda , the height of the aspiring dome , the chaste magnificence which pervades the whole , above all , the perfect unity which , admitting no distraction , combines every part into one undivided effect , create an intensity of admiration . There is but one space , and only a single light . ThG symmetrical , the majestic whole is seen is felt , at a glance . ' The lectures on Italian literature contain versions of several of the most striking passages of the Italian poets . That from Dante , reThting the pathetic story of Count Ugolino , is worth comparing with the translation of Cary . We take our leave of the work , with remarking , that the theological dissertations at the close , bear traces of the same mind , which dictated the travels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
