THE BLACK MAN ; Or , THE SPLEEN The manuscript of The Black Man ; or , The Spleen , in Payne 's own hand , is in the Luquer collection . It seems impossible to decide the date of composition of the unacted domestic play , The Black Man ; for although the source is known , it had been available to Payne for many years . Payne 's work is based ultimately on Gernevalde 's L'Homme Noir , ou Le Spleen , performed first on February 20 , 1778 , at the Thtre de la Haye , and printed in Paris the same year . Its direct source , however , appears to be Maill de Marencour 's adaptation of Gernevalde 's play which was published in 1783 under the same title but with two or three slight abridgments and an altered ending . The central situation of Gernevalde 's play is a domestic problem of considerable interest : the difficult readjustment faced by a wife after her husband develops melancholia , which at the close gives promise of becoming so acute as to be incurable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dnouement , picturing unconvincingly the husband 's sudden recovery and his reunion with his wife ; and it is the sentimental ending that Payne chooses for his play . CHARACTERS Johnson , the Black Man Chevillard Guichard Waiters Mrs. Johnson Betty , her Maid Madame Guichard The action takes place in France Main text ACT I. Scene : Inside of an inn . Enter Guichard and Madame Guichard , Mrs. Johnson and Betty ; and a waiter bearing a travelling bag and portmanteau . Gui . Guichard To waiter Show the ladies to No. 2 on the first floor . Light the fires . Ah , ladies , you 're in luck ! Though I say it , my house is one of the best in France . Bet . Betty Wait a minute , landlord . I 've a word for your ear , when I 've shown up missis . Gui . Guichard You 'll not be the first pretty girl I 've waited for . Exeunt Betty and Mrs. Johnson with waiter . Madame Guichard follows them with her eyes , with curiosity Mme. Gui . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so late in the year ! What does it mean , husband ? What does it mean ? Gui . Guichard What does it mean ? It means you 're always meddling with things that do n't concern you . You 're much too impertinent , wife , really you 're too impertinent ! There never drops in a traveller but you must know what he is , what he is not , where he comes from , and where he 's going to . You 'd make an admirable custom house officer ! I tell you again all you have to do is to find out whether people have plenty of cash , that they may be treated and made to pay accordingly . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard These women do n't seem to lack . Do you think they 're French ? Gui . Guichard What 's that to you ? French or not , it 's all one , if they pay well . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard Why , only that if they 're foreigners they ca n't object ! Stop  --  I forgot  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . Gui. Guichard Oh ! So much the better . I wish the Poet would follow him . I 'm tired of giving that fellow credit . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard I went up to dun him this morning ; but he stopped my mouth with a bundle of little verses , where he calls me Iris , as thick as my arm . Gui . Guichard I wish he and his little verses were far enough . That coin do n't pass in trade . I ca n't afford to keep a poet to make little verses in praise of you . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard Hey dey ! Do n't throw your poet in my teeth ! Is it my fault that the man 's got no money ? Gui . Guichard Oh ! You women can be made to do anything with a little flummery . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard He gives me his little verses , and better them than nothing . Gui . Guichard Better than nothing ,  --  perhaps not ,  --  for time 's only thrown away in reading ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I may make out the Black Man 's bill . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard Take care not to leave out anything . Gui . Guichard Trust me for that . It 's all down . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard Charge a little over . We are always forced to take off enough ; so there 's no harm . Gui . Guichard You do n't think to teach me my business , do you ? Let me alone . He shall pay for the frights he 's given us . Go you and look to the supper . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard Do n't leave out the bleeding . Gui . Guichard I shall take care of the bleeding , do n't alarm yourself . And if he do n't bleed freely ' twont be my fault . Enter Betty Gui . Guichard Well , my pretty lass , what 's your pleasure ? Bet . Betty Landlord , have you many people here just now ? Gui . Guichard Scarcely a soul . This is the dead time of year with us , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel this weather ; I do n't mean that for you , no , no . We 've nobody to keep us , just now , but your party , a poet that do n't count because I have to keep him , and a Black Man who 's been here it will be a fortnight day after tomorrow . Bet . Betty A Black Man ! Gui . Guichard Aye , aye ; that 's a nickname we 've given him , because he 's all in black , from his shoes to his wig . Bet . Betty To his wig ! Do you know his name ? Gui . Guichard Neither his name , nor his nation . Bet . Betty Now if it should by chance to be him ! Gui . Guichard Him ! So you 're looking to find somebody ? He only looks to keep out of the way of everybody . I 've scarcely seen his face myself since he 's been here . When we take the things up to him , he do n't even give us a glance . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , little or much , he says not a word . In short , he 's such an odd being , that I keep my young folks in order by threatening ' em with the Black Man . Bet . Betty I could almost protest from the portrait ' t was my missis 's husband ! Gui . Guichard Pshaw ! You 're quizzing . Your mistress must have had a great passion for matrimony , to take such a man for a husband . Bet . Betty What can a woman do , good Mr. Landlord ! When she ca n't pick out a man , and gets tired of living single , she must n't be over nice ; she 's in luck to get a man at all in these old bachelor days . One must put up with a bear , so one gets a husband . Gui . Guichard Then I think this very likely to be your man ; for he 's as much like a bear as  --  Bet . Betty Is he young ? Gui . Guichard Between the two . Bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guichard Middling . Bet . Betty Nearer and nearer ! Fat ? Gui . Guichard Not over and above . Bet . Betty Better still . Large eyes ? Gui . Guichard Aye , aye ; for they frightened me out of the room the only time he ever looked at me . Bet . Betty The very man . Thick eyebrows ? Gui . Guichard Very , and as black as his coat . Bet . Betty Feature for feature , the identical man we 've been running after for these two months . Gui . Guichard Is it the fashion in your country for women to run after their husbands ? Bet . Betty The Black Man you speak of , is named Johnson . After he had been two years married , he became taciturn , melancholy , brutal ; got out of humor with everybody , even his child , who was then only six months old . Next by degrees , he grew tired of his wife and would pass months without seeing her ; yes , Mr. Landlord , without showing her the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a young woman like my mistress ? Gui . Guichard Is there no remedy for that in your country ? Bet . Betty There was none found but to expatriate Mr. Johnson , and give him a change of air . It 's now two years since he left England , to come to France . Since then we 've heard not a breath of news from or about him . In short , Mrs. Johnson , tired of being a widow , and not able to take a second husband without being sure of the death of the first , determined to come over herself , and find out the truth . Gui . Guichard Ah ! I see ! You come to France to seek out the certificate of his death ? Bet . Betty Pretty nearly , Mr. Landlord ; but when we got to Paris , we heard he was not dead then , but left the night before . Though they say the air of that city has not cured him , we 're not easy yet . Do people live long in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say . We never had it in our family . Enter waiter , with a letter Wait . Waiters Your mistress is ringing for you . Bet . Betty I 'm going . To Guichard Landlord , contrive to get us a peep at that man . Gui . Guichard That wo n't be a very easy matter for he 's mighty close . Stay ! You can do one thing : wait upon him yourself at supper . But perhaps the sight of a petticoat will make him savage . How can we manage ? Bet . Betty Turn it over in your mind . I 'll go and see what missis wants and come again presently . Gui . Guichard Make haste , for ' twill soon be his supper hour , and I like to be to the minute with him for fear  --  Exit Betty Gui . Guichard What have you got there ? Wait . Waiters A letter the Black Man gave me to put in the post . Gui . A letter ? Hand it here . Reads the address London  --  Aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen ; I 'll put the letter in myself . Exit waiter . Enter Madame Guichard precipitately , with the account book , which she claps down on the table . The dialogue is very rapid Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard Husband , I know all . She told me everything . She 's English , got a husband , do n't know what 's become of him , left after two years . Husband had a malady  --  stop  --  what do they call it ? Plin  --  Pl  --  Ah ! Splin  --  such a droll malady that they that have it at last kill themselves as quietly as I should drink off a glass of water  --  Gui . Guichard So , you 've been pumping , as usual  --  Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard Do n't repeat what I 've told you ; I do n't think they want it known . Gui . Guichard It 's in good hands , then . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard There 's your account book . Take good care now . Do n't be afraid of charging twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall make her chat so as to bring you more news presently . Mind the bill . Exit Madame Guichard Gui . Guichar d Mimicking Tattle , tatta , tattee . That 's a downright woman . Prying , tattling , and meddling are her qualities . Let 's see if the letter 'll give us any clue . The superscription 's not to a woman at any rate . Reads " To Mr. Murray . " That 's most likely one of his friends  --  I 've a furious itching to unseal it  --  Aye , but if it should n't happen  --  No matter , here it goes , faint heart never won fair lady  --  Breaks the seal Well ! This is agreeable . My curiosity 's well paid . The letter 's in his own country language and I ca n't make out a word of it . Enter Chevillard Chev . Chev illard Ah , you 're busy , I see ; I 'll come again . Goes out Gui . Guichard Zounds , that 's the very thing . The poet may make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back What , my dear sir ! Gui. Guichard As you know everything , do you know how to read English ? Chev . Chevillard Know how to read it ? I know more , sir , I know how to translate it . Gui . Guichard Look here , then . Tell me what this is about . Chev . Chevillard Taking the letter There 's not an author in the language that I have n't treated . Gui . Guichard Aside So much the worse for them ! They must have had a starving time with you . Chev . Chevillard I 've caught the true spirit of Pope ; I 've given new lustre to Shakespeare ; I have borne Newton to the third Heaven . Gui . Guichard ' T is a great pity you could n't bear yourself as high as the first , for you 're cast mighty low on this earth , unfortunately , Mr. Chevillard  --  Chev . Chevillard What can one expect ? The muses wage eternal war with fortune . Gui . Guichard Make peace with her as soon as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind what the muses say . Chev . Chevillard I 'm about it , Mr. Guichard . I am about to bring out a work , which promises to produce me equal profit and renown . ' T is a melodrame . Never was so black a piece seen . I 've even engaged the manuscript to the London managers , and it will strike two nations with terror on the same night . The scene is laid among the dead . Gui . Guichard Take care the melodrame do n't get laid there too . But we 're straying from the point . Pray tell me what the letter says . Chev . Chevillard Your interest touches me as if it were my own . Puts on his spectacles and as he is going to begin reading , suddenly takes them off and turns to Guichard By the bye , did your wife show you the little verses I made on her this morning ? Gui . Guichard Aye , aye ; but , no offense to your little verses , I 'd rather she 'd have shown me some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more precious than gold . Gui . Guichard Very likely ; but , as I 'm no judge , I should like the gold better . Come now  --  the letter . Chev . Chevillard Your curiosity shall be satisfied instantly . Resumes his spectacles and then takes them off again But a thought strikes me . Gui . Guichard Tell it some other time then . Come , the letter , the letter , pray . Chev . Chevillard What a fortunate circumstance that you happened to have me in your house . You never could have managed this if it had n't been for me . Gui . Guichard True  --  true  --  but make haste  --  I 'm wanted . Chev . Chevillard Then the business now is to tell you what the letter says , hey ? Resumes the spectacles and pretends to read Br  --  br  --  br  --  Ah ! Ah ! Gui . Guichard Well ! Chev . Chevillard Br  --  br  --  the devil ! Gui . Guichard What ? What is it ? Chev .

Chev . Chevillard Returning the letter Your friend in England tells you that one of your relations , being dead , has left you heir to twenty thousand pounds , that 's all . Gui . Guichard They tell me that ? Chev . Chevillard Yes . Gui . Guichard Me ? Chev . Chevillard Yes , you . Gui . Guichard My friends in England ? Chev . Chevillard Yes , in England . Gui . Guichard Bursting into a loud laugh Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Chev . Chevillard That 's right . You may well laugh , Guichard . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Let them laugh that win ! I congratulate you heartily ; and I 'll instantly celebrate your good fortune in some verses to Madame Guichard . Gui . Guichard Why you 're mad , Mr. Poet . I 've no friends in England ; and what 's more , the letter did n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevillard Why did n't you tell me that before ? Gui . Guichard If you did n't treat your authors any better than you 've treated this letter , they have n't much reason to be obliged to you , Mr. Chevillard . Chev . Chevillard They never complained . But I came to ask  --  Gui . Guichard Umph ! You 're always asking . Well , what now ? Chev . Chevillard I hope there 's no harm in my asking what ladies those are that are just come ? Gui . Guichard They are English . What do you want of ' em ? Chev . Chevillard I only saw one of ' em and she 's beautiful as love . Do you think she 'd refuse some little verses with which her charms inspired me ? Gui . Guichard They 've other fish to fry , than to waste time with your little verses . They 're in pursuit of a lost husband . Have you found one ? Chev . Chevillard I should be a little afraid to take him home if I had . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome . Gui . Guichard Hold !

Betty Chance does very odd things , sometimes . Be it as it may , here 's the landlord and he 'll tell you more than I can about it . Gui . Guichard Aye , and more than even I myself expected , too . I 've just got hold of a letter that the Black Man gave one of the waiters for the post . See if you know the handwriting . Mrs. John . Mrs. Johnson ' T is his ! Agitated Gui . Guichard She seems ill . Aside Is it joy , or vexation at finding him alive ? Puts a chair Sit down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind a husband , for it always makes a sort of commotion when  --  During this speech Mrs. Johnson reads the letter , shrieks , and faints Bet . Betty Help , landlord , help ! Gui . Guichard What 's the matter ? What 's the matter ? People do n't make such a fuss in this country about losing and finding husbands ! Madame Guichard running in Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard Somebody cried out . Gui . Guichard Where 's your smelling bottle ? The lady 's ill . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard With great fuss Dear me ! Here ! Quick  --  yes , quick . She feels about in one pocket Hold  --  look  --  I have n't it about me  --  husband  --  run  --  seek  --  stop !

Let him blow out his brains , if he likes it , but not in my house ; every man to his taste , but not in my house ! Bet . Betty Fly  --  run to his room  --  Gui . Guichard Faith , I do n't like the job . He might blow out my brains , by mistake . What do you say , Mr. Poet ? Chev . Chevillard Say ? Why I say ' t would supply matter for the stage , and I 'll profit by the catastrophe . No bad subject for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monody . Gui .

Chevillard Attend . My brain teems with a project which may prove most particularly important in the existing posture of affairs . Gui . Guichard Let 's have it . Chev . Chevillard You 'll find that a poet 's not such a useless piece of furniture as you would make him out . Gui . Guichard So much the better . Come ! Out with the project . Chev . Chevillard Contrive to get me to supper with the Black Man . Gui . Guichard If that 's all your grand  --  Chev . Chevillard Patience , I say .

Guichard No doubt that 's his will . John . Johnson For thee , my dear child , if Heaven has prolonged thy life , I ask pardon for having given thee existence ; ' t is an unlucky present I 've made thee ; but I am about to teach thee how to get rid of it . As for you , my wife , I dispense with your shedding tears upon my grave . With regard to mourning , every widow ought to wear it . ' T is an advertisement to the public that she 's to be disposed of .

Guichard Low I was mistaken . He ca n't mean me  --  John . Johnson And though he was unsuccessful , yet as the will is quite as good as the deed yet I give him a thousand crowns  --  Gui . Guichard Low I really think he does mean me , after all . John . Johnson By way of recompense Alexander caused the works of Homer to be enshrined in gold . I desire that the same homage should be paid to Young 's Night Thoughts ; for never was there a work , to my taste , better calculated to inspire a disgust for life . Such are the last desires of Ichabod Wilkins Johnson . Now all my affairs are in order . I can take leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gui .

Aside He 's as free with his money as his life . Sir , I have yet a little favor to ask  --  if I may be so bold  --  John . Johnson Out with it . Gui . Guichard ' T is about a poor devil that I have lodged and boarded for the last twelvemonth . I do n't know whether ' t is misery , or what , but there are moments when his mind wanders to such a degree , that I fear some of these days he 'll take a notion of walking into the other world , without giving anybody notice beforehand , and even without paying his bill , which is worse yet . John . Johnson Who or what is he ? Gui . Guichard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me frequently to mention him to you , but I never could get a chance . John . Johnson Show him in . Gui . Guichard He 's worth seeing . He 'll make a man laugh in spite of his teeth . John . Johnson I 've no desire to laugh . Gui . Guichard Tell him , pray , that ' tis n't honest for anybody to kill himself without paying his debts . That 's the main point . John . Johnson Does he owe you much ? Gui . Guichard Oh ! No great thing . The living of a poet  --  John . Johnson Throws another purse Hold . Pay yourself , and do n't let the man be annoyed . Gui . Guichard Aside It 's plain this is his last day . He do n't care what becomes of his money . To Johnson Sir , I shall take what is my due , and give him the balance as a mark of your bounty . John . Johnson No . Keep it all . For him I reserve something better . Gui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man a year to kill himself in my house , I should soon make a fortune ! John . Johnson Send him hither . Invite him from me to supper . Gui . Guichard Aside The very thing . Aloud I 'll fetch the poet instantly , sir . John . The sooner , the better . Going , Guichard makes a sign to the waiters to watch over Johnson . During the following soliloquy , Betty , Mrs. Johnson , and Madame Guichard enter softly and hide in the bedroom John . Johnson Alone At last the long procrastinated day is come ! Soon shall I enjoy a tranquillity nowhere to be found except among the dead . Prejudices of the world , which forbid man to end the sufferings of which you are often the cause , which would keep a poor wretch in the midst of you as devils do for the pleasure of tormenting him , now , now , I soar above ye ! The veil is rent . I now see your futility ; ignorance in which you bury mortals , the bondage in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your yoke . Everything tells me that I ought to get out of the world . The earth is weary of sustaining me ; the light seems to regret being obliged to shine upon me ; night brings nothing but horrid phantoms to my pillow ; and even sleep denies me its gentle consolation . I am friendless and without kindred ; I have broken every tie that bound me to those that have unluckily been linked to me by an accident equally unfortunate on both sides . I am now parted from everything but my body and in a few moments I shall bid good night to that . Enter Guichard , followed by Chevillard Gui . Guich ard Come in , Mr. Chevillard , come in ! To Johnson Sir , this is the person  --  you know  --  and here 's another plate and knife and fork . John . Johnson Go . Gui . Guichard Do n't you want a waiter to attend the supper table ? John . No . We can wait upon ourselves . Gui . Guichard Low to Chevillard We shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevillard Not I. Exit Guichard into the cabinet Now to begin my part . John . Johnson Be lieving the landlord gone , rises and double locks the door . Chevillard strides to and fro across the stage and heaves every now and then a deep sigh . Johnson observes him . Goes to a closet , takes a covered plate and puts it on the table and says to Chevillard Mr. Poet , I mean to treat you to a dish of my sort . Chev . Chevillard Aside You 'll have one of mine , in return . After a moment 's silence , regarding Johnson 's covered plate Some English dish I suppose , sir ? Despairingly Oh my ungrateful country ! John . Johnson What has your country done to you to make you exclaim in such a way against it ? Chev . Chevillard What has she done ? What has she not done ! What has she done ! Alas ! She has forced me to endure the fate of those great men , that Rome exiled from her bosom for having rendered her services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right . If this man goes on , he 'll make me laugh . So be it . I shall die the more merrily . Chev . Chevillard I have sought  --  I have sought to reform my native land , and my native land has  --  reformed me . John . Johnson How so ? Chev . Chevillard The most marked ingratitude  --  the most crying injustice  --  the most infamous conspiracy  --  with your leave , we 'll sit down to supper , for I begin to feel rather hungry . John . Johnson With pleasure ; but on condition that you fare freely just as I do . Chev . Chevillard I 'll not let a dish escape ; the middle one above all shall be my mark . Your English dainties are more solid than ours ; and I augur well of that . They sit down to table , facing each other . Chevillard eats voraciously and quickly . Johnson eyes him intently John .

Johnson Are these all the services you have done your country ? Chev . Chevillard They are greater than they appear , sir ; and presently you 'll own it . Let 's take a glass , if you please ; drinking creates an appetite . Drinks You know from the earliest times the ridiculous levity of the French has been a subject of reproach ; but nothing has ever been yet proposed which went to the root of the evil . There was wanting striking pictures , there was wanting images  --  in short there was wanting melodrames . I came , I saw , I conquered . Thanks to my labors , the nation is no longer the same . They have taken a dislike to cheerfulness ; it is an insult to try to make anybody laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Emperor Julian , when Paris was celebrated for its gravity . Fire , steel , poison are become its recreations ; it forsakes paths strewn with roses for those that are embellished with bones , skulls , and corpses . I had only to complete my work with a finished melodramatic specimen to teach my own countrymen how to kill themselves as composedly as yours do Johnson stares , and this I have just accomplished . Such , sir , are the services I have done my native land ; and looking at his clothes such my recompense ! Pray pass that plate , if you please . Since my exile from the capital , I have found no kind bosom to be the depositary of my afflictions ; and it was reserved for you to come from a foreign country to console me in my disgrace , to comfort me in my destitution , to  --  John . Johnson To give you a supper ; for it seems as if you stood in need of one . Chev . Chevillard As a patron of the muses , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I speak of , and which is coming out immediately . John . Johnson Thank you , thank you . Chev . Chevillard ' T is my ne plus ultra  --  my greatest work of all . Shall I read it to you after supper ? The subject is English . John . Johnson You call it  --  Chev . Chevillard The Black Man . John . Johnson Sneeringly A promising title . Chev . Chevillard The hero is a victim of the spleen , who deserts his own country and forsakes wife , children , and friends to come and kill himself comfortably in ours . Johnson appears surprised His wife pursues him , chances to drop into the same inn , and on the very day chosen by him for the catastrophe . John . Johnson Let us hear your melodrame . You excite my curiosity . Chev . Chevillard No doubt I do . Had n't we better first attack that dish in the middle ? John . Johnson Take off the cover . Chevillard takes up the plate and uncovers it , sees two pistols , drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage What ! Terror struck ? A maker of melodrames should be at home among such objects . Chev . Chevillard I do n't mind horror in the way of business ; but this dish , I 'm afraid , would be hard of digestion . John . Johnson Recollect your promise . Chev . Chevillard Really , I 've eaten more than usual , and I 've no appetite left . But pray tell me , what in the world do you mean to do with those instruments ? John . Johnson They were both meant for myself ; but as you happen to be here , you shall have one . Chev . Chevillard You are too civil by half . You must either have powerful reasons for what you propose , or else none at all . John . Johnson Mr. Poet , a man like me would not die without reflection . Draw the account with the world  --  on one side put the strength of man , on the other his miseries , and see if they are proportioned . I have dragged along under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not time I should have some repose ? Chev . Chevillard That 's dying methodically at any rate . John . Johnson Yes , Poet , when the clock strikes twelve , I bid adieu to the earth , and , if you 'll take my advice , you will do the same ; for what part are you playing on it ? Chev . Chevillard No very important one , I grant ; but I 'm not ambitious . John . Johnson Weigh well the horror of your situation . The great despise your misery , and the little make their jest of it ; even Death has deemed you as beneath his notice , or you would have starved long ago  --  take courage , and revenge the indignity . Chev . ChevillardAside I must pretend to give way . Aloud You open my eyes . I see that Death has treated me with marked disrespect . One must be beforehand with him and then he ca n't be impertinent . John . Johnson Now , Poet , you talk rationally . You see you wanted a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his stomach I did indeed . John . Johnson Gaily Your hand , Poet . We 've triumphed ! Bravo , fellow traveller . Huzza ! Chev . Chevillard In the same tone Huzza ! What a pity we 've no fiddlers . ' T would be jolly to die to music ! John . Johnson The hour of liberty approaches . To pass away the time , let 's hear a little of your melodrame . Chev . Chevi llard Willingly . I 'll give you the head of it . Reads " The Black Man , a melodrame in three acts  --  characters , Johnson ,  --  " John . Johnson Surprised Hey ? Chev . Chevillard That 's the name I 've given to the Black Man . You 'll see it 's all English , even to the names  --  " Mrs. Johnson  --  " John . Johnson Gradually more and more surprised Mrs. Johnson ?

Seizing a pistol Chev . Chevilla rd Help ! Help ! All the characters rush in . Mrs. Johnson and Betty tremble . Madame Guichard is in a great bustle . Johnson starts and drops his pistol on seeing his wife John . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? Mrs. John . Mrs. Johnson To save you from yourself . John . Johnson By what means can you have been apprised ? Gui . Guichard The letter you wrote to England fell into my hands and I gave it to the lady , who had just chanced to arrive . John . Johnson Then I am ruined . Gui . Guichard Do you call it ruining you to save your life ? John . Johnson Yes , I detest my life ; and your exertions to save it render you far more odious to me than if you yourselves had taken it away . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard There 's gratitude . That 's what one gets by kindness . If I 'd been your wife , I know what I 'd have done . Fie ! Man , fie ! To turn the house topsy turvy  --  desert your wife  --  forget your child , as if you were not the father , and then try to kill yourself ? And all for a freak ? A whim ? A notion ? A nothing ? Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he of no use to her ! Gui . Guichard Hold your tongue , I say . Mme.Gui .

Guichard If you do n't hold your tongue , wife , your clack will do the work of the pistols . Bet . Betty Landlord , your wife is in the right . It 's a very hard thing , so it is , that any woman should be kept two years in suspense . Chev . Chevillard Sir , do not let all our exertions be in vain . Do not reject the affection which comes to restore you to yourself . You may fancy it bravery to dare death ; but in my opinion the true courage consists in enduring life patiently , and not skulking from the miseries of existence into the grave . He who stands the tug of battle is the man of valor , but he who runs away from it is a coward . John . Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of myself .

There 's no joy like that of an estranged heart returning to its long forsaken home . Mme. Gui . Madame Guichard Now you show you 've sense , Black Man . I did n't mean to be rude to you just now ; but as your wife would n't speak and you deserved a scolding , I thought you 'd better have it from me than not at all . John .
