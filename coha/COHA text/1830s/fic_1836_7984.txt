Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : MOTHER 'S LOVE . from Mother 's love ( 1836 ) The mother 's love  --  there 's none so pure , So constant and so kind , Nor human passion doth endure Like this within the mind . Lightly a soft cheek presses hers , Soft as a nestling dove , And through her thrilling bosom stirs A mother 's tender love . Now pile your gold like Inca 's high , Unveil Golconda 's mine , But not for wealth that thrones might buy Would she her child resign . How hushed she sits beside its bed , And watches o'er its rest , While oft its little helpless head Is pillowed on her breast . Her thankful tears , a gentle shower , Her smiles of love are given To fall upon her human flower , Like light and dew from heaven . And while its charms , to her so fair , Expand beneath her gaze , She reckons not her nights of care , Nor counts her anxious days . The conscious smile , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , These are the pure delights she ' s earned , Pleasures of God the token .
