txt The recollections of a chequered life , spent in various countyies , afford to my mental eye ,  --  with many a remembered scene over which a painful and chilly darkness broods ,  --  many a fair sunny picture , on which it loves to dwell , of the beautiful and noble , in human character . No one can pass through even a shorter term of years , than that from which I draw my treasures of memory , in free intercourse with the thousand varieties of human nature , without meeting with many a character , of which the brightness redeems the darkness of the surrounding waste , and , standing as a living monument of the inherent good , points to the future perfectibility of our nature . Though the pilgrimage of life be over a // weary desert , at the feet of the traveller-besides that there are the stars of heaven overhead-if he will but open his eye and heart , is many a beautiful flower , and around him many a fair oasis , reminding him of the paradise that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my good fortune to meet with many of these bright spots ; and my memory loves still to wander back to them , and linger around their beauty . But amidst all these reminiscences there is no one upon which it rests with a more pure and tender pleasure , the more exquisite from its being slightly tinged with sadness , than upon the image of the heroine of the following little sketch . It is a story of one of that dear and valuable , though much abused class-an Old Maid . It is not , indeed , a common , every-day story ; though a very simple and quiet one : - its scene lies chiefly in a retired little English village , and one of the most beautiful of its class . I have now given fair warning of its subject and character ; - let those readers only go back with me to visit this pleasantly remembered spot , for whom such a story may be likely to possess some interest ; their number will probably be small , but they will be the " fit audience , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in print , though much more elaborately filled out , a tale closely resembling in outline the following sketch , as induced the belief that it was founded on the same facts . That shall not , however , deter me from narrating it simply and truly , from my own recollection of the facts , disguising only the surnames , lest it should meet the eyes of some of those to whom it relates . Received in the right spirit it may , by its example , teach to some reader a sublime lesson of self-sacrifice . Among all the pretty parsonages in England , there is never a prettier than the Rectory of the village of Betley : and among all the good , the venerated , and the loved occupants of those beautiful abodes , there was never a better , a more universally and deeply venerated and loved , than the occupant of this , the Reverend David Morse . I remember both well from my earliest childhood . The closely hedged and planted lane , by which we used to approach that door from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bitterness of disappointment the pretty little knoll upon which it emerged , studded with occasional clumps of trees ;  --  the venerable old church , which stood directly at the foot of the knoll , in its quaint Gothic style , still solid , though beginning to crumble at some of its weather-worn extremities , with its moss-covered roog and ivy-mantled sides , the little grave-yard which slept in its solemn quiet around it , the grotesquely trimmed cypress and yew trees , the familiar old tomb-stones , and the neat hawthorn hedge enclosing all the fair scene of English country loveliness that stretched beyond ; - the winding road towards the left from the knoll , bordered by bright graceful shrubbery , kept in the neatest order , with here and there a rustic seat , and perchance a still more rustic table ,  --  and then the charmed step reached the neat white gate , that led to the tree-embowered parsonage . // It was a most comfortable dwelling , of the cottage style , low and wholly unpretending in its front , though with a spacious portico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; its pebble-dashed walls were half hid by the thick running vines , which clustered round even the upper windows , and perfumed , through the open casements , the rooms within . A fine lawn sloped down the front , adorned with beds of flowers edged with the ever-blooming thrift ; at the foot of which a beautiful little pond of water mirrored the green fringe of the light graceful willow that waved around and over it , interspersed with the lilac and laburnum , fresh with the youth of spring , and opening to give the warmer sun of the season its earliest welcome . A little skiff lightly toppled the mimic waves into which a freshening breeze would ripple its surface , the play-thing of a youth , named Charles Bettley , who resided under the parental guardianship of Mr. Morse . On both sides of the house smiled the prettiest pleasure garden I ever saw ,  --  for taste and simplicity , without display of wealth , should always be attributes of a pleasure garden . Behind , neat offices , the glebe , and the orchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memory . It was indeed a lovely spot , though I have not half described it ! The Reverend Mr. Morse was a younger son of a distinguished family ; he had purchased at the university high eminence as an elegant scholar , at the expense of the stamina of constitution , though he had still been able to reach the period at which a few flakes of snow were beginning to descend upon his high , benevolent , and intellectual brow . He was venerated by all classes within the sphere of which he was the centre ,  --  and loved alike by all . His wife was a meet and worthy helpmate to his beneficent life . A marriage of love had been to them the beginning of a life of love . Charles Bettley was the son of a dear friend , whom the early death of his father , a military man , had left in a state of destitution to the parental kindness of this excellent pair . Through all the struggling with the hardships attending the narrow stipend of a country curate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refer , performed all the duties of the parental relation towards him . By their hearth he hath a home , in hearts the resting places which the active affections of a generous childhood needs , and in the highly cultivated mind of Mr. Morse such advantages of education as could not have been afforded to him by any other means . At the date to which I refer , Charles had grown into a tall , handsome youth of about seventeen , full of the young vigor and spirit , moral and physical , of that age . Mr. Morse had two daughters . The elder , Alice , was nearly of the age of Charles . They had been brought up together , hand in hand , and heart in heart . They had conned , to a great extent , the same lessons , read from the same prayer-book and bible in church , joyed in the same pleasures , wept over each other 's troubles , and at the same knee had knelt to know " Our Father which art in Heaven ! " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and blue eyes , and the mild , yet deep spirit of her father . She was very beautiful and very gentle , yet sportive and happy withal , and had a heart that vibrated like the aspen leaf to the sympathies and affections of those by whom she was surrounded . Charlotte was seven years younger  --  a bright little fairy , with dark eyes and ringlets , archness and mischief ; with a heart as affectionate as her spirits were buoyant and light . Such were the inmates of Betley Rectory , at the date of my earliest recollections of the place . The first grief that came to invade the quiet happiness of that affectionate and pleasant home  --  a happiness before scarcely ever alloyed by a care-was a bitter one , and brought the aching desolation of bereavement directly into the midst of their cheerful little circle . It was the death of Mrs. Morse . The immediate agony inflicted by the blow I need not pause to describe . Her husband bore up against it nobly . An unfamiliar eye would scarcely have guessed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . But he did not yield himself up to it . The storm could not but bow to the dust , but it did not break , the heart of the Christian minister and father ; for the sake of his God , his flock , and his children , he summoned to his aid , and not in vain , the comfort of his religion , and bravely weathered the storm . The last death-bed scene between the mother and children I must not omit . Alice stood hiding her sobs in the bosom of Charles , and one hand unconsciously in his ; the little Charlotte sat on the bed by her side , but imperfectly understanding the real meaning of the scene . She rested her emaciated hand upon the clasped ones of the fair young pair , with a smile of pleasure , and then turned her eye from theirs to the little child , with an expression which both instantly interpreted rightly ; and before the spirit of the mother had risen on the wings of immortality , with which it seemed already plumed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still clung , the lips of the two elder children had uttered the vow , which their hearts had on the instant formed , that the happiness of their young sister should be through life their devoted care . It had always been a custom , and I think a most excellent one , in the Rector 's family , to celebrate all birth-days by some pleasant gift , of which surprise was always a necessary element , to the hero or heroine of the day . On the morning after the burial of Mrs. Morse , both Charles and Alice remembered that it was the birth-day of the former ; but neither made any allusion to it , in the hope to avert the bitter associations which it would excite , with a peculiar poignancy , in the heart of their only remaining parent , whose affliction they would gladly have died to console . He met them with a beautifully serene brow ; and afier the regular morning devotions , and a breakfast that seemed almost cheerful , he led Charles into the garden . They walked for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working with emotions of unfathomable depth . At length he paused , and rested his hand affectionately on the // shoulder of the tall arid noble-looking youth before him . His voice was tremulous as he spoke : " Think not , my son , that I have forgotten this day , thomgh- " His voice did break , and he walked on a few paces in silence , when Charles replied : " Many are the precious gifts , my dearest father , I have received at your hands , but none so precious as the one I have received this daythe example of a Christian spirit shedding holy balm over the lacerated affections of a human heart . " Mr. Morse pressed his hand , and placed in it a sealed packet , saying , " Charles , you are now treading on the heels of the man ; and you must enter the world on the strength of your own capabilities . This contains a commission for a cadetship in the East Indies , where you will find more than one powerful friend to be interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresight , and is her gift ; it was our joint intention to have surprised you with it to day . The duty is now a heavy one ; it sends another dear object from my fireside . But my duty to you is an imperative law . Such arrangements are already complete , beyond recal , that you must leave us on this day fortnight . " He abruptly quitted him , and Charles , in a tumult of conflicting feelings , sought his room . On the small stand in the window , upon which lay the bible which had been her last gift , between the leaves of the sacred volume , was a freshly gathered bouquet of the flowers of the season . l ? i this sweet gift , so beautifully bestowed , he could not a moment hesitate to recognise the hand of Alice . He placed it in his bosom ; and with a trembling hand proceeded to open the packet . Besides the commission , it contained such a letter as no other hand than the mother 's could have penned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little suspected to be the accumulated result of many a sacrifice of indulgen* cies in the Rector 's family . So delicate is the kindness of the truly generous , it would be hid , if possible , even from itself . His conflicting emotions I need not describe ; the high beating of his heart , which had so long panted for admission to the stirring scenes of the world ; his grat ' itude , his grief his pangs at the thought of a farewell to this blessed home of his youth . It will excite no surprise that , after all , the first was the predominant feeling . He was interrupted by the entrance of Alice , pale and breathless , who had just learned this stunning news from her father . The hours that ensued I pass over , as also the remaining days of his stay . It will suffice to say , that the most solemn engagement of hearts passed between him and Alice , and he bore away with him , with the prayers , blessings , and tears of all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * * On Alice 's admirable conduct at the head of her father 's household , as the mother of her young sister , and the never-failing friend of the sur // rounding poor , I need not dwell . In every relation it was beautiful and noble . Within two years after the departure of Charles , Mr. Morse lay by the side of the partner of his life . This blow brought into lifi* all the fine energies of her rare character . They were left almost in destitution . Another incumbent soon occupied their loved and lovely home ; and they left Betley Rectory . Countless doors sprang open to nvite them to a home , respected and loved as was Alice Morse ; but she had a peculiar spirit . She would not acquaint Charles with their situation , for she would not burden or distress him ; from no other xvould she receive , for his sake as well as from his instinctive feeling , the generosity which , however cordial in its commencement , becomes so often doubtful in its sequel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she opened a school , which was soon filled with the daughters of the principal families of the neighborhood . Every day did this noble girl rise higher in the affectionate respect of all who knew her ; nor did her occupation ever have the effect of making her lose caste among the higher classes of her friends-for she had them among every class . She uteadily refused the most advantageous proposals of marriage ; and thus held on the even tenor of her way for six or seven years . How her heart rested on the future may well be imagined . Her love for Charles , of whom she retained a picture , now that all else was gone , rind that her love for her sister seemed , from the remembrance of that death-bed scene , to enter into the affection and the relation subsisting between them , as an element and part of it , came almost to absorb her whole being . A doubt in relation to him never crossed the high , noble purity and pride of her love . His letters were not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to need an apology . His heart was evidently in the exciting pursuits and ambition of his profession : ; though he still loved her and his early home ; he evidently , indeed , also loved many other objects and feelings ; yet it was natural , and she was pleased for his sake that it was so . His letters always breathed the warmest affection , and never contained any thing that could threaten danger to her hopes ; and she labored on faithfully , self-sacrificingly in her toilsome occupation , knowin0 well , in the full confidence of generous love , that her time of rewar&amp; , in that full happiness of which her deep soul was capable , was approaching , and would surely arrive . Charlotte retained her early character-wayward and light-hearted , but most warmly affectionate . She became most splendidly and exquisitely beautiful-more so , in fact , if their different styles could admit of a comparison , than Alice . * * * * * * As said before , above six years had passed since the death of Mr. Morse . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected , and , of course , his bridal with Alice was to take place without unnecessary delay after his arrival . Charlotte was all brightness anti happiness at the thought of seeing her dearly remembered brother , and of Alice 's // approaching marriage with him . The daily deepening intensity of feeling with which the heart of the latter throbbed in anticipation , as , one by one , the intervening days sped their way , what pen could portray ! * * * * * * Charles returned a month sooner than he was expected  --  a tall , noble* looking young man , in the full flush of young manhood , and the happiness and gaiety of spirit of such an occasion . Charlotte was the first whom , on rushing unannounced to the spot where he was to find the bride and the sister of his early and of his future home , he met and clasped to his heart . Having retained in his memory the image only of the pretty young child which he had left her , he was , at the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it surpassed ) , almost confounded with astonishment-astonished and dazzled , so that some moments even elapsed before he thought of Alice ; and Charlotte herself was so transported with pleasure , and at the same time involved in a blushing confusion , that those moments passed with an equal forget* fulness on her part of any other feelings than delight and admiration of her brother and Alice 's husband . It was but for a few moments , however , when she recollected herseli and hastened to communicate that happiness to her sister . The emotions that agitate such hearts as that of Charles , or of Charlotte , may be described . To attempt to describe those of such an one as that of Alice Morse , formed as it had been by her past life , is a different thing . She came to the presence of her betrothed husband pale and trembling ; she extricated herself hastily from his embrace ; and her whole manner during his visit seemed , to the highly-wrought feelings which on his own part broke out in wild transports , reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing , and the similar tumult of happiness and affection , which beamed from the beautiful face of her sister , and spoke in a thousand sportive graces from her equally beautiful form . Need it excite surprise , that , as his eye turned from one to the other , a momentary chill  --  a feeling to which he would not for worlds have given expression , or to himself a definite form-passed over his heart ? About six weeks would bring on his birth-day . Their marriage was fixed for that day . In the mean time a month intervened before the close of the quarter would terminate the present laborious occupation , which filled nearly the whole of her time . Her principles of duty were too high and correct to permit her to yield to the instances of Charles and her sister , to dismiss her pupils at once to their homes . She moreover felt a certain shrinking of maidenly modesty which prompted her to seek not unwillingly this excuse from being constantly in the company of him , from whom few of her thoughts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte , which at their first meeting had slightly , but still sensibly , touched the heart of Charles but with a feeling of disappointment , continued . Besides that // the latter was free from the embarrassment which cast a perpetual restraint upon the manner of Alice , the heart of Alice was not indeed what it had been . She was older , she had been for years in the world , in a situation of responsibility and care , and above all she had been severely tried by affliction . Her heart was no longer in the bloom of its youth ; - though the pressed leaf may retain its odor , may in fact emit a more exquisite fragrance , its freshness can never return . She was sedate , calm , and always rational ; she no longer carried her heart in her hand ,  - -  but , ah ! with what deep pulsations it beat in her bosom ! Charlotte , on the contrary , was in the first flush and brightness of her youth , of the heart as well as of the person . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alice , to know another care since the death of her parents . Every emotion was beautifully mirrored on her countenance . Too yielding an indulgence had been the only fault of Alice 's mode of education of her ; the necessary effect of which was manifest in her character . Her heart was the most affectionate and warm that ever beat ; but she was unreflecting and wayward . She knew not how to examine and govern her own feelings . they flowed forth without restraint , as nature and occasion bade them ; and she knew not whither they went , nor sometimes what they were , until they had gone forth-perhaps beyond recal ! Every day was spent by Charles almost wholly at the dwelling of Alice . Herself he rarely saw , but for brief and hurried intervals . Charlotte was his constant companion . With her he talked of the dear old times , read , played , walked , sang , rode  --  but why linger over the gradations which led , almost of necessity , to the result that all have already foreseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a love that was devotion , madness , before either suspected its nature ! Neither ever breathed a murmur of it to the other ;  --  and Alice-for a long time she dreamed not of it ! But she saw the rich bloom fade from the cheek of her sister , the brightness from her eye , the buoyancy from her step , the ringing lightness from her voice . She saw her redoubled tenderness towards herself and a shrinking from the presence of Charles , contrasting strangely with her former frank , careless bearing towards him . She saw that there was a deep grief at the core of her heart , and a heavy horror upon her conscience . She more than once observed the marks of secret tears . In her betrothed husband she observed similar indications . His visits lost their frequency and length ; his countenance became haggard ; he rarely spoke of their approaching bridal . Towards herself he sedulously strove to preserve an unchanged deportment ; but the effort was too marked to escape the quick eye of the woman . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of the awful truth . The well-meant efforts of both to mislead her kept her mind in a state of agonizing distraction . None , beyond her own // heart , can , I presume , ever fully appreciate the total wreck of the hopes on which she had lived , till they seemed to constitute her whole being , involved in the realization of the suspicion forced upon her by what she could not but see . The eve of Charles ' birth-day arrived 1-Alice 's mind was almost , but yet not wholly , made up : - not that her noble spirit could long hesitate between the affections of her own heart and those of her sister 's , the facts being once clear and certain before it ; nor that she was wanting in energy of mind , and womanly dignity , to decide promptly and resolutely in such a case ; but that all was yet , to some extent , uncertain ,  --  she had no proof ; and the matter was one of an interest too fearfully intense to permit her to decide rashly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moreover , her woman 's heart did , unconsciously to itself ; struggle to shut out the light that was to enter to lay bare its utterly blighted desolation : - alas , poor Alice I-Charles had not appeared that day ; a note had excused him , on the plea of illness . It contained strong expressions of happiaess at the approach of the morrow ,  --  but the composition seemed somewhat elaborate , and poor Alice smiled a smile that was almost ghastly , as her eye rested long and fixedly on them . The preparations for a bridal , quietly , and at home , were all complete . Alice and Charlotte always , as from the infancy of the latter they had done , slept in each other 's arms . On that night the latter rose from a pillow wet with tears , which , though in silence , had still forced their way ; and , unconscious of the eye that watched her , stole to the dressing table , where lay the miniature which had never been absent for a day from the bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indies . She held it long in her hands ,  --  and once or twice approached it to her lips , but checked the motion ere it was half performed , and often . often wiped away the tears that were evidently blinding her sight . Half risen , motionless , almost breathless , the gaze of her sister was rivetted on her . Broken words , too , escaped her lips , which went to the deepest heart of Alice , expressive at once of wretchedness and despair the most utter , and of devoted , self-sacrificing love for her sister , friend , and parent . She finally put it from her , and spent a long time on her knees , in earnest prayer . On her return , after repeatedly and almost conclusively pressing Alice to her heart , she at length sank quietly into such a sleep , upon the bosom of her sister , as had not visited her lids for many a night . As she lay there , the mind of Alice was decided . It must have been a beautiful sight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts ! The marriage was to take place in the morning . At an early hour in the morning , Charles and Charlotte met accidentally ( that is to say , without premeditation , for the same associations of past hours spent there brought both to the spot ) in a pleasant little summer bower in the garden . It was deeply shaded with the shrubbery and creeping plants in which it was emboxvered . They understood themselves and each other perfeetly , // though each strove to dissemble , and their broken conversation was solely of their mutual love for Alice . A slight rustling , and they beheld the beautiful and benign face of Alice , gazing upon them from the entrance , pale , yet with all the expression of an angel from heaven . Both started hastily , and in a confusion , which was not guilty though it seemed such , to their feet . Alice gently pressed them back to their seats . Standing by them , she then spoke in a voice that was perfectly clear and firm , excepting a slight tremor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell , and listened without a word of reply . " Charles , do you remember the vow , which my mother 's spirit registered in heaven as she ascended there , that the happiness of this dear girl through life should be our joint and devoted care ? I have not forgotten it . I understand every thing-all , dearest ones -notwithstanding your generous and affectionate attempts to deceive rite . I grieve only that I did not sooner . It is all right ; and believe me , I am happy in it . Charlotte , dearest , I have of late been your mother-I will be so still , through life . You love each other-God bless your love !  - -  - Charles , we love each other too , very dearly , my brother , and will never cease to do so . This is your birth-day : you have not forgotten our old family custom . I have a more precious gift to surprise you with this time , than ever you had before . Here it is ,  --  and again , God bless it in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver bell , and never did she look more like an angel ! As she spoke , she placed the hand of her sister in his , and while her blessing was still on their ears , the highsouled girl was gone . Charlotte lay long senseless in the arms of her lover . They spent some hours together on the spot . The sequel , as far as they are cor1* cerned , may be imagined . They then sought Alice together , whom they found engaged in the arrangement for the ceremony which she had determined should take place that same evening . She was perfectly cheerful , and apparently , as indeed in reality , far happier than she had ever been within the past fortnight . She had at her heart " the peace which passeth all understanding . " All were so accustomed to bend to her mild , but well-reasoned will , that she without great difficulty in the end overruled their objections , and the wedding-ring ( it was their mother 's ) which had so long been destined for the finger of Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister . * * * * * No change was ever observable in Alice 's deportment . Through that day , the following , and all succeeding , she presided at the table with the same sweet grace which had always been so beautiful in her ; nor had she for many a day looked half so lovely , for there sat upon her serene brow the light of an approving conscience , and her lips were wreathed with the smiles of peace from within her own heart . She has never been known to be gloomy , nor to give one glance of discontent that might // check the happiness she had sacrificed her heart 's love to secure ; - and yet she exhibited no effort to seem , or to be , happy-for , in truth , she made and needed none . She has had many suitors , all of whom , though she received none as lovers , she attached to her for life as the warmest friends . She soon after became the heiress of a large property , which it became one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectual , and unostentatious charity . Aunt Alice still lives , and in her neat cap , her spectacles on her still pretty nose , her kindly smile and kindlier heart , is ( or was a few years ago ) one of the most beautiful old ladies-who does not understand the phrase ? - that I have ever known . She has been the preceptress of all the children , of whom she has always been the idol ; though it was always said by them that she petted Charles , " the image of his father , " the most of all  --  but it may have been fancy . They are one of the happiest families in merry England.
