Covers , Edges and Spine Main text SNORERS . BY THEODORE S. FAY . Thou dost snore distinctly ,  --  There 's meaning in thy snores.  --  Tempest . Has it ever befallen thee , gentle reader , to sleep in a crowded hotel , in an apartment shared by several others , or in a stage travelling all night , or on board a steamboat ? If so , you have suffered from a nuisance , we fear , beyond the reach of satire , viz. snoring . Whether it is an Americanism , like whittling , spitting , putting the feet on the mantel-piece , and wearing hats with a long nap , we do not at this time wish to discuss ; nor whether it is one of those general evils incidental to human nature , but we do say , that your regular snorer is an enemy to society , and ought either to cure his propensity , or turn hermit . Our object in writing this is to solicit the attention of the learned to a subject intimately connected with human comfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of snorers kept distinct from other people , in a different part of the town , and compelled to travel in a line of stages and steamboats constructed expressly for them ; or else to check the propensity in early childhood , by a rigid course of education . Our youth are taught to dance , sing , play the fiddle , sit straight , eat with a fork , and be virtuous , but not a word about snoring ; not a hint of this faculty , growing up in the secrecy of night , like a rank weed , within their character , to break the peace of innocent families , and ruin , night after night , that precious balmy slumber which lies , or should lie , so " starkly in the traveller 's bones . " Snorers ! Why they are monsters . We avoid them in all our rural peregrinations , and smile inwardly on finding their acquaintance cultivated by unwary strangers , who little think what a trap they are falling into . We are one of that extensive class of human creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatically belongs to earth . We yield it without reluctance to care and labor . We toil , we drudge , we pant , we play the hack-horse ; we do things smilingly from which , in secret , we recoil ; we pass by sweet spots , and rare faces that our very heart yearns for , without betraying the effort it costs ; and thus we drag through the twelve long hours , disgusted almost , but gladdened withal , that the mask will have an end , and the tedious game be over , and our visor and our weapons be laid aside . But the night is the gift of heaven . It brings freedom and repose ; its influence falls coolly and gratefully upon the mind as well as the body ; and , when we drop the extinguisher upon the light which glimmers upon the round , untouched pillow , we , at the same time , put out a world of cares and perplexities . What , then , must be our disappointment to find ourself full length , side by side , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sleep is every moment forming on us ; and as often broken by the anomalous , incongruous , nasal vociferations , against which , at this particular moment , we are endeavoring to excite the indignation of the reader ? It is one of the advantages of authorship , however , that even evils , by yielding prolific subjects for the pen , become a source both of amusement and profit . We experienced this the other night , when , returning from a day 's absence , the traveller 's vicissitudes sent us to sleep on board a steamboat , plying between this city and Albany . Fancy our perplexity , good reader ; you know , ( or , for we have been hand and glove with you for so long a time , you ought to know , ) our sly penchant for comfort  --  our harmless pieces of epicureanism on a small scale  --  our enjoyment of a shady , still corner  --  our horror of being pushed and thrust about " any how . " We have even , on occasions , betrayed too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated sometimes by anonymous correspondents , ( those familiar , invisible gentry , ) for preferring a slant of sunbeam through a heavy curtain to one that comes in like other beams . Imagine us , then , in a " night boat , " which even the captain confessed was " slow ; " the wind and tide against us , a hot night , numerous passengers , the engine heaving and working laboriously , with a heavy and regular impulse , that jarred through the massive vessel with jerks and shocks like little earthquakes , and the subtle languor of slumber stealing through our limbs , and hanging on our eyelids . A hundred or two travellers had already " turned in , " and we were ushered below into the cabin , and directed by a clerk to a berth , where , our guide informed us , we were to sleep . To sleep ! We looked at the fellow 's face . It was perfectly grave and respectful . A glance satisfied us he had intended no insult . He left us , and we paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamboat is a melancholy affair to a sleepy gentleman , about eleven o'clock at night . A dim lamp , suspended from the ceiling , shed a doleful light upon the long , low , narrow apartment . The curtains of the berths were mostly drawn . Divers boots , which , when enlivened by their respective legs , had clambered mountains or paced over fields , now lay in groups here and there , and hats , valises , and umbrellas , rested by their owners , being probably the only vestiges of them we should ever encounter . One fat gentleman had just lifted his unwieldy person into bed , and was tying a bandanna handkerchief around his head , preparatory to his lanching off into glorious repose ; while a cross-looking lean person opposite , having wound up his watch , and rescued his feet from his boots , with a prodigious deal of straining and ill-humor ; having with considerable difficulty discovered where he was to dispose of his cloak and other matters ; bumping his head , moreover , while getting into his couch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length also disposed of himself apparently to his satisfaction . Few things , when a man is really out of humor , exhaust his philosophy more utterly than hitting his head sharply against a hard object . My friend cursed the builder of the steam-boat , in a half-smothered growl , and then all was quiet . And now we were floating off into a pleasant sleep , when a low and gradually increasing sound from the berth of the fat gentleman arrested our attention . We listened , all was silent ; and then again the same sound , more palpable and better developed . It was at first a long breath , of the consistency of a loud whisper . We turned over , still it went on . We turned back again , there it was yet . We rose on our elbow , in a passion , and poked our head out between the red curtains . There was the fat gentleman 's berth . We could just detect a glimpse of the bandanna handkerchief , by a feeble glare of the lamp . Our sleepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid down again , but could not , " with all the weary watching of our care-tired thoughts , " win the coy dame sleep to our bed . What was to be done ? Go up and hit the fat gentleman a blow ? Impossible . Complain to the captain ? He would laugh at us . Never was man so weighed down , so oppressed with sleep , and never did man so suffer from a snorer . The fat gentleman , as if aware of our misery , and mocking it , went on , like an orator getting warm with his subject . He grew loud , vociferous , outrageous . We laid and listened . He inhaled , he exhaled . Now the air rushed in between his extended jaws , now it burst forth obstreporously through his sonorous nose . He took it in with the tone of an octave flute , he let it out again with the profound depth of a trombone . He breathed short , he breathed long ; he gasped , whistled , groaned , gurgled . He quickened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had snored with the sound of a rushing , regular stream , hastening onward over a deep channel  --  now it was the brawl , clash , dash , hurry , and discordant confusion of the same tide , hurled down a cataract of broken rocks  --  at last he gave an abrupt snort , and ceased altogether . We were thanking heaven for this relief , when a treble voice from the berth directly beneath , announced new trouble . It was some one  --  whom , we knew not , nor do we ever covet his friendship , who belonged to a different class of snorers . He made a regular , quick , sharp , hacking sound , like that of a man cutting wood . Hack , hack , hack  --  we heard it at intervals all night . The lean gentleman , in the opposite part of the room , now put in his claim as a snorer . He had four notes . It was a tune . It could be written and played any day . We laughed outright , and inwardly resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like by daylight . He played on some time , and then finished with a sudden combination of sounds , among the constituent parts of which we could plainly distinguish a hiss and two sneezes . His exit reminded us of those pyrotechnic creations to be seen at Niblo 's , Castlegarden , &c.; which whirl round and round and round , and then explode with a phiz and a whiz , sure to be bounteously applauded by the enlightened audience . There was something in this gentleman 's snoring which touched our feelings . A fine spirited fellow he was , we warrant . Full of life and animation , and not inclined to hide his light under a bushel . What became of him , however , after the explosion , we can not say . He left a dead silence , and his evaporation we almost lamented . We should like to know , however , whether any law can be put in requisition against these gentry , or why we have not the same right to practise on the trombone , on board the steamboat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear " by such pompous displays of nasal ability ?
