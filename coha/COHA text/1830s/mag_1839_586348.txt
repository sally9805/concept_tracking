txt Not the least important and interesting of the subjects brought before the attention of Congress , in the Annual Message of the President , is unquestionably that of the Census for 1840 , for which the proper provision and arrangements must be made at the present session . It is well , too , that it is one of those subjects that afford a neutral ground on which all parties may cordially meet , without the intrusion of any of those disturbing influences of interest or feeling which must bias the judgment , on the one side or the other , on almost every other conceivable subject of a public nature . For the sake of variety , it will be quite refreshing to meet in truce on such a common ground , undistracted by a jealousy , an alarm , or an interest , of a partisan character , to unite in carrying out this important measure on the most liberal and enlarged principles , and in the most efficient manner , with a single eye to the interesting national objects involved in it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be taken of the opportunity afforded by the C*ensus , on the present occasion , to perform the duty properly incumbent on our Federal Government , which it is a subject of just reproach and regret has heretofore been unaccountably neglected ; namely , that of making some portion at least of those general statistical observations , over the whole surface of the Union , of the principal subjects of national interest , to the proper collection of which it alone is competent . The American Almanac for last year held the following language in relation to it : " All intelligent and judicious legislation must be founded , in a great measure , on statistical knowledge .

At any rate , the considerations suggested in the following extract from the memorial referred to , are fully applicable , at the present period , to recommend the course pointed out to us , equally by the liberal example of all other civilized countries , and by an enlightened regard to the true principles of political science : " It may be considered as one of the characteristic traits of our timesthat , with regard to many branches of importance to the well-being of society , a careful collection of detailed facts , and the endeavour to arrive at general results by a comprehensive view and judicious combination of them , have been substituted for mere theorizing .

If they are patiently and faithfully collected , judiciously arranged and applied , and wisely digested , they lead to a more positive knowledge of the real state of things , with regard to all subjects of which we are able to collect statistics , than any other mode of inquiry . They often exhibit errors , though cherished for centuries , in their real light ; unveil evils never suspected before , or show their roots where they were never expected to be found , thus enabling us to choose the most or the only efficient means of counteracting them . They are , therefore , of the greatest use to the legislator , and to every one whose duty it is to frame general measu* for his community , in whatever branch . " The terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather too narrow limits the proper scope of the proposed measure ; for certainly many of the most valuable fields of observation would be excluded by confining it to " the great interests specially entrusted to , or necessarily affected by , the legislation of Congress . " And the very definition of those terms would involve the whole question of that which is , and always has been , the great issue in controversy between the two parties of the country , namely , the extent of the proper action of the Federal Government upon the " great interests " of the country . It would be very difficult to trace a satisfactory dividing line , where the two opinions differ so widely as to the direction and the principle on which it should be drawn . But we see no necessity for any such rigid limitation . Though belonging perhaps to the strictest class of the strictest school of the State-Rights doctrine , and jealous of every attempt at extension of the federal action beyond the narrowest orbit within which its plainly prescribed functions can be performed , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated central point of observation afforded by the relation of the federal government to the States -- hi formation designed , not as any basis for federal legislation , but for the benefit of the States themselves , and of the country and mankind at large-we can not perceive that exception could be taken by any . In fact it is plain that there are a great many subjects on which it would be in a very high degree interesting and valuable to make a general statistical observation of the kind in question , which are not proper subjects of legislation at all , whether by the States or by the Federal Government-such as the Press , Religion , Benevolent Associations , Fine Arts , Health , &amp;c . And when to these we add the subjects of Agriculture , Manufactures , Mechanic Arts , Commerce , in their various branches , Stocks and Banking , Internal Communi cation , Education , Crime , Social Life , the Political organization of the different States carried out through all its details , Elections , &amp;c. , an idea may be formed of the wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to the proposed inquiry , while a very small portion of the whole might be comprised within the proper sphere of federal legislation or influence . These are all great national interests , though most wisely left by January , // us , either to manage and adjust themselves without governmental interference of any sort , or subject alone to the influence of State legislation , without the overshadowing control of any common , consolidated power of government , radiated in all directions from one common central point of absolute authority , as is the case with all the other great nations of the civilized world ; while yet at the same time the value of the observations to be made of them must depend mainly on their universaflty . It is only out of the combination of the whole that the national value of the detailed observations that could be made by each State within its own borders , can proceed . For such a purpose as this , we conceive , we are a Nation , an ( l something more than a mere league of separate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these great physical and moral interests , that the practical working of our complex system of institutions can be fairly tested , or the whole , as a grand harmonious e pluribus unum , be fully understood , and its benefits made sensible to ourselves and demonstrated to other nations . It is only by an enlightened and comprehensive view of them , on a broader scale than within its own narrow limits ,  --  in their mutual and comparative relations with each other arid with other countries - that each State can intelligently legislate for itself in reference to them . And we feel well assured , that no application could be made of the central facilities within the competence of the Federal Government alone , more useful to the States individually , as well as to itself -- more valuable , interesting , and satisfactory to the country at large , as one combined community of communities  --  or more fully in accordance with the general spirit of our institutions and the leading purposes of our union , according even to the views of the most severe **26;1130;TOOLONG to take the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey that may be found practicable , of the general character above indicated , over the whole surface of the Union . The extent to which it may be thought proper by Congress to carry out this measure on the present occasion , we can not anticipate . We hope it will be on a liberal and enlarged scale , this being a subject on which all parties and all opinions should unite . Mr. Adams ' last General Message , at the session of 1828- ' 9 , expressed regret at the inadequacy of the former provisions of law for the important objects which the Census might and should subserve , though directing his attention then only to the subject of Manufactures . At the third and fourth Censuses , some very imperfect , but still valuable , statistics of Manufactuxes were collected , but the fifth was again , we regret , confined to the mere enumeration of population , though considerably extended beyond that of form ' *r periods , by the more minute subdivisions of age , and by including returns of the blind and the deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V. NO . XIII - JANUARY , 1839 . F // such returns is but half of the dity properly incident to the execution of such a measure . rfhey should be accompanied by such a digest and a.nalysis of the information collected , comparatively with former periods , with forci ii coentries and the different sections of our own country , as would extract from the dry and barren mass of figures and special facts , that essence of political and economical philosophy in which their value consists . The labor of conducting the Census on these improved*rinciples , and of preparing the Reports on the different branches into which the information accumulated would divide itself , would of course be very great , as the duty would be a very responsible one , requiring a great deal more than the mere clerical qualifications which seem on former occasions to have been brought to the task , under the general official supervision of the Secretary of State . We can not know what plan will be adopted by Congress , but trust that it will he one that will not disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all men of intelligence whose attention has directed itself to this interesting subject . With respect to the probable result of the approaching Census , so far as regards the mere enumeration of the population , it will probably not fall short of seventeen millions and a half . The results of the five former enumerations that have been made at th' successive periods of ten years , have been as follows : 1790 , - - - - 3,929 , *7 - - - - 5,305,925-Ratio of increase , - - - .35 1810 , - - - - 7,239,814 " " " - - - .36 1820 , - - - - 9,638131 " " " - - - .33 1830 , - - - - 12,860,920 " " - - - .33 The average ratio ot increase has therefore been about 34 per cent . for every period of ten years , or 3.4 per annum ; which would yield in 1840 about seventeen millions and a quarters to which the great excess of immigration above all former precedent , known to have taken place , will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will not be uninteresting to our readers if we extend the-above table for the last fifty years , forward through the coming century . Those whose attention has never chanced to approach the subject will indeed be astounded at the stupendous result to which it will conduct them . The average ratio of increase may with entire sacety be taken at .30 for ten years . That of the free population has heretofore averaged about 36 per cent. , which that of the slaves , 30 per cent. , has reduced , as above seen , to 34 per cent . We assume .30 , for the sake of moderation , of which the result must at any rate be startling , and to exclude the accidental influence of im-migration ; // 1*50 , - - about *12,090,000 1 ! *ti0 , - - - - " 28,000,000 1870 , - - - - " 37,000,000 18.80 , - - - - " 48,000,009 1890 , - - - " 62000,000 1900 , - - - 81,000,000 1910 , - - . - - " 105,000,000 1920 , - - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - - - - " 231,000,000 ! The imagination is overwhelmed that would attempt to realize an idea of this glorious anticipation . And yet the child has already opened its eyes to the light , that is in all probability destined to close them upon the magnificent spectacle of upwards of two hundred and fifty millions of inhabitants , from ocean to ocean , overshad *ved by the *vaving of the Stripes and Stars ! Nor one alone , but hundreds-thousands-for if the last census exhibited more than a thousand persons of the age of a hundred and upwards , many thousands of infants born about the present period must doubtless live to the year 1910 . And the proportion will certainly be not incousiderable , of the actual readers of this page , who will live to feel themselves , in little more than half a century hence , bound by the ties of citizenship and brotherhood to nearly seventy-five millions of fellow human beings And who will question the probability that the ratio of increase of our population will be , and must be , through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all imagination is bewildered and lost , that which we have assumed  --  a ratio less than has heretofore marked our progress ?

It is in this anticipation that we find the chief reason for the deep , the intense solicitude , which every friend of American liberty and union ought to feel for the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of that grand structure of political and civil society which we thus see rising upward towards the heavens before our eyes-such principles as will be adequate to sustain 5() colossal a fabric . It is for this that the patriot would struggle to reform every vicious institution , the operation of which is found , or is calculated , to exert a demoralizing influence on national character . For this , that he would lament to see the baleful poison of that universal passion for wealth so often ascribed to us , sapping ' and corrupting the roots of all that is truly good and great , accompanied with that spirit of ( lishonest gambling at the grand national gambling table of " the credit system , " which we call by the more specious name of " speculation . " For this , that he would frown sternly upon every attempt to sow discord and jealousy between different sections of the country ; and would anxiously cultivate those feelings of harmony and brotherhood , which can only be maintained between great confederated communities by the peaceful pursuit by each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encroachment on those of another by the advantages of partial federal legislation* and without an offensive interference with each other 's domestic concerns and institutions . And for this that , in the working of our complex political machine , he would be anxious to restrain as much as possible the central action of the Federal Government , and carry out to the fullest extent that diffusion of power , at the greatest distance possible from the centre , on which the preservation of the Union wholly depends . If we should be asked if we believe it possible that this Union can hold together a hundred years hence with a population of two hundred and fifty millions , spreading from Atlantic to Pacific , and northward and southward as their free natural growth should ei*-tend-we answer , yes , provided the theory of the State-Rights doe . ' trifle be but fully and fairly carried outinto practice . Administered as the Federal Government has been for the last half century , we must unhesitatingly answer , no . Too strong an action has been // propelled outward from the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale so vastly enlarged as this supposition assumes . Thus continued , it must infallibly dislocate and dissever the system , so soon as the ( listances and the masses increase to proportions considerably beyond their present dimensions . Such collisioris of interest between great sections of country , as we have seen to grow out of the vicious fe*ral legislation of former times on Tariffs , National BanLs , &amp;c. , must never be suffered again to grow out of similar causes . The danger is now happily past , and North and South are coming cordially together again on common ground ; but its repetition might be fatal even at our present rate of population ,  --  - with such an increase as will ere long have taken place , it must certainly be so.
