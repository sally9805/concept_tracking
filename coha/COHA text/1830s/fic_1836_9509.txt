Note : 1kb THE TRIUMPH AT PLATTSBURG The Triumph at Plattsburg represents the historical play dealing with the war of 1812 . Richard Penn Smith , its author , was born in Philadelphia , March 13 , 1779 , the grandson of Provost William Smith , the patron of Thomas Godfrey . He was educated at Mount Airy , and was admitted to the Bar . He succeeded Duane as Editor of The Aurora , in 1822 , but after five years spent in journalism , he returned to the practice of law . According to his biographers he had a wide knowledge of French and English drama which indeed is shown directly in several of the plays . He died August 11 , 1854 , at the family seat at the Falls of Schuylkill , near Philadelphia . He wrote twenty plays , fifteen of which were performed . His first play to be acted , Quite Correct , was produced at the Chestnut Street Theatre , Philadelphia , May 27 , 1828 . It is a farce altered from the French , as was also Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1833 . The largest group of Smith 's plays may be called romantic comedy or melodrama . The most important plays in this group are The Disowned , a melodrama , played first at the Baltimore Theatre , March 26 , 1829 , and printed in Philadelphia in 1830 , A Wife at a Venture , an oriental comedy , played first at the Walnut Street Theatre , Philadelphia , July 25 , 1829 , The Sentinels , or the Two Sergeants , a clever play on the theme of fidelity , adapted from the French , performed at the Chestnut Street Theatre , December , 1829 , and The Deformed , a verse play , based on Dekker 's Honest Whore , played first at the Chestnut Street Theatre , February 4 , 1830 , and printed the same year . According to Durang and Rees , The Disowned and The Deformed were afterwards acted in London . Smith also wrote a blank verse tragedy , Caius Marius , for Edwin Forrest , which the latter produced at the Arch Street Theatre , on January 12 , 1831 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived , except in fragments . Smith did his most significant work , however , in the field of historical drama . The Eighth of January , in which General Jackson is the central figure , was played at the Chestnut Street Theatre , January 8 , 1829 , and was very popular , being repeated in New York , Baltimore and Washington , and , as late as 1848 , being put on at the Broadway Theatre , New York . It was printed in Philadelphia in 1829 . William Penn , a play in three acts , has as central theme the intervention of Penn to save the life of an Indian chief , Tammany , by name . It was first played at the Walnut Street Theatre , Dec. 26 , 1829 , and seems to have been revived as late as 1842 . The Triumph at Plattsburg is the best of the national plays of Smith . He has avoided actual historical characters , and the conflict is kept in the background , while McCrea 's danger keeps the element of suspense alive . It was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1830 , with a strong cast , and was repeated . Apparently the scenery was quite effective and the national appeal met with a response . For biography of Richard Penn Smith , see a sketch by Morton McMichael in The Miscellaneous Works of the late Richard Penn Smith , edited by H. W. Smith , Philadelphia , 1856 , and an anonymous sketch in Burton 's Gentleman 's Magazine , Vol . V , p. 119 ( September , 1839 ) . For accounts of the performances of the plays , see Charles Durang , History of the Philadelphia Stage , Series 2 , Chaps . 51 , 55 , 56 . The published plays of Penn Smith , The Eighth of January , ( 1829 ) , The Disowned , ( 1830 ) , The Deformed , ( 1830 ) , Quite Correct , ( 1835 ) , Is She a Brigand , ( 1835 ) , and The Daughter , ( 1836 ) , all printed in Philadelphia , are hard to obtain . The following plays are in manuscript form in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Venture , The Sentinels , William Penn , The Triumph at Plattsburg , The Bombardment of Algiers , The Solitary or the Man of Mystery , Shakespeare in Love , and The Last Man .

The village of Plattsburg , in front of Fort Moreau . The fort practicable . Flag flying , Sentinel on duty ; villagers cross stage removing property . ( Enter Corporal Peabody with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ease . Good people , what is the meaning of all this confusion and consternation ? You could not be more alarmed if the whole village were already in flames about your ears . Dr. Drench . Dr. Drench And so it will be , corporal , if we stay here a few hours longer . The case is a desperate one I assure you , beyond the reach of medicine . Is not Sir George Prevost , with many thousand troops , already within a few miles of the village ? Corporal . Corp oral Peabody Very true , but I calculate he will have to come nearer before he takes the village , and that you know he can not do without having a taste of the quality of the Green Mountain Boys . Dr. Drench . Dr. Drench Exactly as you say , but I would just as leave be down at Whitehall during the operation , so I 'll move myself and plunder out of harm 's way . Must have an eye to the main chance , corporal , and take care of my property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to take care of it is to defend it with a musket in your hand . I have one at your service , doctor . Dr. Drench . Dr. Drench Thank ye , thank ye kindly , just as much as though I had accepted of it ; but no occasion at present . Corporal . Corp oral Peabody What , doctor , not afraid to look upon death at this time of day ? Dr. Drench . Dr. Drench Afraid ! La ! no , that 's my trade , and that I may continue to exercise it , I decline your polite offer . Andre . Andre Macklegraith ( Without . ) Stand out o ' the way , man , and make room for Andre Macklegraith , who would see the general . Corporal . Corp oral Peabody What noise is that ? Dr. Drench . Dr. Drench It is Andre Macklegraith , the miller . ( Enter Andre . ) Andre . Andre Macklegraith Corporal Peabody , it warms the cockles o ' my heart to see your good natured face at this present speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' been , and that na lang syne , when I would ha ' preferred your room to your company any day in the week , and ha ' been the gainer by it . Corporal . Corporal Peabody Twist me , but I guessed as much , Andre , but what has worked this sudden change in your feelings ? Andre . Andre Macklegraith Our feud 's at an end , corporal ,  --  Our feud 's at an end . Take a pinch o ' sneezer out o ' my mull , and that you ken will be as binding as though we drank out o ' the same cup together , and the ceremony is more economical  --  take a good pinch , man , you 're welcome .  --  Ah ! doctor , I cry you mercy , it glads one to see your gracious physiognomy ; and how does the world wag with you , man ? Dr. Drench . Dr. Drench Only so , so . Corporal . Corporal Peabody The war is about to drive him from the village , Andre . Andre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old saw , ye ken , that twa of a trade can never agree , and the war I am thinking will do business upon a larger scale than the doctor .  --  Ha ! Ha ! do you take my meaning ? Corporal . Corp oral Peabody Yes , and so does the doctor too ; but he makes a wry face in taking it . Andre . Andre Macklegraith Well I have done as much in swallowing his nostrums.  --  Ha ! Ha !  --  Never look vexed , doctor .  --  A harmless jest will break no bones , and Andre , you ken right weel , is not the churl that would hurt as much as a hair upon his neighbor 's head . Well , Corporal Peabody , as I was saying , our feud 's at an end . You know I always counted you a bonnie laddie when you used to come to my mill on Dead Creek with your grist of white wheat , and as fine wheat it was as any that grew in Clinton County , that I will say for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it too , Andre . Andre . Andre Macklegraith Ha ! Ha ! Let Andre alone for that man ; but de'il a grain more did he take than his lawful toll . Ye canna say that ever Andre Macklegraith lost sight of the golden rule , which bids him do as he would be done by . Well , as I was saying , ye came oft to the mill with your grist , and ye came often without any grist at all , and by my troth you soon wore out your welcome , for I found out that Lucy my handmaid was the attraction . Ha ! laddie , say I not true ? Corporal . Corporal Peabody Why now I reckon you had some reason for your suspicion . Andre . Andre Macklegraith Ah ! let Andre alone for seeing as far into a millstone as he that picks it . I had taken a fancy to the lassie mysel , and with my old mither 's consent , will make Lucy , Mrs. Macklegraith , before we are many days older .  --  So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporal . Corporal Peabody But have you Lucy 's consent out and out ? Andre . Andre Macklegraith Why you simpleton , do you think she could refuse Andre Macklegraith ? I should like to see the lassie who would turn her back upon a man of my substance .  --  Take another pinch o ' sneezer . Take it , you 're welcome , and should be glad to see you at the mill again when Lucy and mysel are bone of one bone  --  but not till then , mind ye . Corporal . Corporal Peabody You are what I call a shocking polite feller . Andre . Andre Macklegraith Let Andre alone for that , he kens bravely how to conduct himself in a beseeming manner in all company . But where is General Macomb ; I have come here in person to speak to the general himself . Corporal . Corp oral Peabody You speak to the general ; you ? Andre . Andre Macklegraith Yes , Andre Macklegraith the miller would speak to General Macomb . What 's wonderful in all that ? We live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange indeed if the voice of the lowly could not reach the ears of those above them . Corporal . Corporal Peabody And what would you say to the general ? Andre . Andre Macklegraith An affair of interest , but as he is not here I will even open my budget to you . Some scouts of the enemy have appeared in the neighborhood of my mill , and as I am afraid they may set fire to my property , and in one hour consume the rakings and scrapings of many toilsome years , of a painstaking man , I would just ask the general to be so obliging as to send a company or two to protect me and mine from the fire and sword of the invader . Corporal . Corp oral Peabody And you think that he will grant your request ? Andre . Andre Macklegraith Think , man ! Hoot , hoot awa ! how can he get over it ? Does not your constitution protect every man , rich and poor , in the peaceful enjoyment of his property , and if you let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hope for emigration ? Corporal . C orporal Peabody Why now there is something in that . Andre . Andre Macklegraith Something .  --  A mickle deal . Let him refuse my reasonable request , and by the cross of Saint Andrew , I 'll come John Doe and Richard Roe over him . Corporal . Corporal Peabody And do you wish the soldiers to guard Lucy also ? If you do , I 'm your man . Andre . Andre Macklegraith And do you think Andre daft or dighted , to set a fox to take care of his pullet.  --  She would be in good hands , by my truly .  --  No , no , if they only keep the Philistines out of the mill , they may let me alone to take care of the lassie . Come , show me the way to the general 's headquarters that I may speak to him with my own tongue , for I never liked doing things by deputy . Come along , Doctor ; never look so gloomy , man ; my jest was a keen one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it broke no bones , and if it had , you have the skill to make all whole again .  --  ( March .

Elinor M'Crea I have already told you , to the enemy 's camp , to seek a husband whom , I fear has deserted me . Six weeks have elapsed since I heard from him  --  My foreboding heart tells me that a fearful destiny awaits me.  --  O ! Stanley , I did not merit this cruel treatment at your hands . Mrs. D. Mrs. Drench Let him go for a good for nothing fellow as he is . Elinor . Elinor M'Crea Alas , you did not know him or you would not speak thus harshly .

He was so kind and obliging that my father and all of us looked upon him as one of the family . We were much together ; he became particular in his attentions to me , and my inexperienced heart was alas ! but too sensible to his accomplishments . Mrs. D. Mrs. Drench Well , miss , I sympathize with you for before I married Dr. Drench I was precisely in the same sitiation with a young cornet in the militia . These military men ! Elinor . Elinor M'Crea He pressed me to consent to a secret marriage , urging as an excuse that my father would never sanction our union during the continuance of hostilities . My heart was his , and I finally gave him my hand without my father 's knowledge . He left me shortly after our marriage and I have not heard from him since . O ! Stanley ! Mrs. D. Mrs. Drench O ! the Bluebeard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd find his match , I war'nt him . Elinor . Elinor M'Crea My situation now became daily more irksome . I felt that I had been betrayed ; I feared to make known the dreadful secret to my father ; I fled from my paternal roof , in quest of my husband .  --  I have not heard from my home since I left it , which is now more than a week ; my father is ignorant of my fate , and perhaps he mourns me for dead . Bitterly do I repent of the imprudent step I have taken . Mrs. D. Mrs. Drench Will you not return , ma'am , to our house ? Elinor . Elinor M'Crea No , accept my gratitude for the protection you have already given me.  --  My determination is made .

Lucy No danger of that , ma'am ; Mr. Macklegraith is too wise and prudent . Mrs. Mack . Mrs. Macklegraith He would go to Plattsburg in spite of all I could say .

Major M'Crea You are from Scotland and several years ago lived in Vermont upon the estate of Major McCrea . Is it not so ? Mrs. Mack . Mrs. Macklegraith It is , but how have you learnt my history ? Major McCrea . Major M'Crea Look at me well .  --  Ten years and recent affliction may have wrought great change in me .

Capt Stanley Pon honor , landlord , you should confine your conversation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you understand , and not hazard an opinion on military matters . Landlord . Landlord Now that beats all nature that Captain Peabody 's opinion on military affairs should go for nothing . I reckon , captain , that you are yet to learn that I was a major in the Vermont militia for ten years , and never missed a training day , that my father served under old Ethan Allen and was at the taking of Ticonderoga , and that my son Nathan is a corporal in the sarvice at this present speaking . Rat it , we are a military family , root and branch , and you will find that I can look upon a field of battle with the eye of a soldier though I do not carry a laced coat upon my back . Capt .

Major M'Crea I did hope to have met you in battle , and there have glutted my private vengeance , but the cup that my soul thirsted for is within my grasp sooner than I anticipated .

I married her secretly , fearing that under existing circumstances you would not consent . I was at Montreal when I received word that my exchange had been effected , and at the same time instructions to join my regiment without delay . I obeyed , and though I have written repeatedly to Elinor , repeating my vows of unalterable affection , it seems that all my letters have miscarried . Elinor . Eli nor M'Crea Forgive me , Stanley , that I could for a single moment doubt your truth . Capt . Stanley .
