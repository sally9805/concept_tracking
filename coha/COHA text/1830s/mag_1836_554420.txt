txt THE title of this book ensures its being opened with an eager curiosity . England , in 1835 , was in the midst of that hitherto peaceable revolution , from whose progress such great things have been hoped and feared . Professor Von Raumer arrived in the kingdom in the month of March of that year , and left it in September , passing the intervening time in London , with the exception of four or five weeks spent in a rapid tour , which extended to some cities of Scotland and Ireland . A fortnight after his arrival , Sir Robert Peel 's government was dissolved , and the Melbourne ministry , " like Antmus , stronger from its fall , " undertook again the guidance of the laboring vessel of the state ; and , about as much time before his departure , the Municipal Reform Bill for England was passed , the most vigorously supported and contested measure , which has yet followed in the train of the Reform in the House of Commons . During the excitements growing out of such a movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enjoying uncommon facilities for observing tile state of opinion and feeling in the highest and the middling classes of English society ; being now a guest at Windsor and Buckingham House , now passing from Sir Robert Peel 's presence tp O'Connel 's , and now enjoying the hospitality of merchants , manufacturers , artists , booksellers , and men of letters . They would have been opportunities lost upon many a traveller , who would notwithstanding have written a very agreeable journal of what he saw and heard , did and suffered . Merely piquant and popular works of this class are among the easiest and most common of all literary productions . Let a man but set down , in decent language , the history of his movements and experiences from day to day in a foreign country , and he can not possibly fail to be entertaining . Let // him be indelicate enough to give personal anecdotes , and reports of conversations with eminent men , and he avails himself of an additional source of powerful interest . Let him traverse a country in search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , if tolerably artful arid industrious , he is likely to find calls for edition after edition rewarding his paltry labor . Poor feats are these ; and as unprofitable or mischievous , as they are easy of performance . But to view the institutions and habits of a country in the lights of a cautious , benignant , and comprehensive philosophy , and so penetrate to their sense and spirit ; and , this done , to use the knowledge acquired , in endeavouring to promote the adoption in one state of what is good in another , and lead the different families of men to more mutual respect and good will , by bringing them to a better mutual acquaintance , is a task for the highest minds , and a worthy service to literature and humanity . It has been well performed by the author of the volume now before us . Professor Von Raumer brought to the preparation of his hook the wisdom of theory , of history , and of active business life . 1-Je had already acquired a distinguished name by several publications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Illustrations of the History of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries , " some volumes of a " History of Europe from the End of the Fifteenth Century , " and " Letters from Paris in the year 1830 , " in which last work it is striking to remark the gay , confident , buoyant strain , so contrasted by the seriousness , the gravity , one might justly say the burdened tone of thought and spirits , which runs through the speculations upon the mighty theme of England . The earliest years of his mature life had been passed in public office , in which he obtained successive promotions till 1811 , when a wish long indulged was gratified , in his appointment to a Professorship of History at Breslau . From this university he was transferred to the chair of Political Science at Berlin , where he still remains , having since had no place in the administrative government , except as a member of the Obercermsurcollegium , or High Board of Censorship , which place he also resigned some years ago , in consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the press . These facts give a marked peculiarity to the point of view , from which " England in 1835 " is described in this iraportant // volume . To the civilized world there are few questions of the passing time , of such exciting interest , as those which relate to the prospects of that kingdom ; and it is an interest , which we Americans , perhaps , feel far more profoundly than any of the nations , whose parchment relations with the fast-anchored isle are the closest . We want much better authorities on the subject , than often are accessible . From the ebullitions of the British press , still in the heat of the unfinished conflict , we obtain little except materials for speculation of our own , which at this distance , is necessarily unsatisfactory and vague . While the Tory press insists that English prosperity has received its death-blow in the recent changes , and the Radicals will have it that only a glimpse of hope has been opened , to he realized in a much more thorough purgation , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both , or how far may we give it to either ? Nor do we feel altogether safe in trusting the judgments of our own countrymen , on the spot , with the disturbing force of their Republican partialities . " Non nostrum tantas componere lites . " We covet the judgments of some present observer , who shall be at the same time a man of theoretical and practical wisdom . A foreigner he must be , or else he belongs to one of the excited parties . And if he is the subject of an arbitrary government , so much the better for us ; for , if he too looks at passing events under a bias , it is a bias of an opposite direction to our own , and whatever he may be found to admit in the face of his political predilections , we have some substantial authority for assuming to be true . All this Professor Von Raumer is ; and , besides all this , he is a person of an uncommonly fair , enlarged , and penetrating mind , of a truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily in possession of the key to all which he is undertaking to investigate . Professor Von Raumer affects but little a parade of sentences . But , at the first view of England , his feelings naturally break out in something more animated than their usual strain . " When I came on deck early on the *2d , we had already left the North Foreland and Margate behind us ; on one side lay the island of Sheppy with its wooded hills , and shortly after the somewhat lower coast of Essex came in sight . Vessels of every kind swarmed around us like sea-birds ; but when we // reached Gravesend , their number increased so much , and the beauty of the nearer and richly-cultivated shores became so much greater , that I was involuntarily overcome by wonder and emotion . Recollections of the gradual upward course by which this happy island had for eighteen centuries been advancing to a pitch of elevation unmatched in the history of the world ; of the deeds and the sufferings , the exertions and the errors , the wars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her churchmen , and her people , - all came crowding upon me . I enjoyed the delight of that high and generous enthusiasm which the ordinary incidents of life can not call forth , and my whole journey seemed to me to be justified and rewarded by this single hour . But this was only rendered possible by my having been for years at home in England , and my having attuned the strings of my head and heart for this Ai*olian touch of external impressions , by solitary historic labor . " - p. *28 . Arrived in London , he divided his time among investigations in the public archives , which were the chief objects of his visit , society , examination of institutions and of objects of art , and the writing of the letters , which , in their English dress , compose the present volume . One of the first scenes he witnessed , of a public nature , was a further excitement to the enthusiasm expressed in the extract given above . On the day of the dissolution of the Peel ministry , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relief of Decayed Authors . " I could tell you a great deal more about the dinner ; but all these particulars lost their interest with me in comparison with one thought . In this very same hour the ministry was dissolved ; and this dissolution was not ( as it so often is in France ) a mere concern of cot*ries and tracass6ries , but had a real , substantive meaning , and tended to real and efficient changes . What a deal of wit , good and bad ; what angry passions ; what hope and fear ; what praise and blame , would have foamed over like c/mompagne moussen , in such an hour , in Paris ! Here , not a trace of the kind . The first toast to the King ( not as with us , with three times three , but with nine times nine , and as sforzato as possible ) ; then to the Queen , the Royal Family , all with the greatest applause ; so , likewise , God save the King . ' It seemed as if all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the waters . The weal of England , her riches , her laws , her freedom , seemed moored to some immovable anchor in the securest and serenest depths of ocean , whence neither winds nor waves can ever tear them loose . The clouds // which flit along the face of heaven , and so often seem , to us timid spectators , to portend a coming storm , may here be regarded as but the passing fleeces of a summer sky ; or rather , as the proof and the earnest of an equable and safe state of the atmosphere . " In short , there was something to my mind in the whole proceeding , - both what was done , and what was left undone , - so wholly peculiar , so above all measure exciting , that in my sympathy with England , ( and have not years of my life been given to this country ? ) I could hardly refrain from tears ; and I earnestly prayed God that this star might not be quenched , but that He would be pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all the spots which partially obscure its brightness . " - pp. 71 , 72 . Here is already struck the key-note to the whole volume . Our author is not one of those , who " travel from Dan to Beersheha , to say that all is barren . " Everywhere , on the contrary , he finds marks of profuse fertility . The more he learns , the more discriminating he becomes , hut not the less satisfied and sanguine . Out-breakings of good-natured judgment , and happy anticipation , like the following , terminating the description of some much vexed subject , are scattered through the book . " I live , therefore , in the hope that England iv II not want skilful steersmen to pilot her through this rocky channel ; whence she will come forth greater and mightier than ever ; to the wonder of those who now understand her not , and to the salvation of the continent from the dangers of the east and of the west . " - p. 191. s letter deserves the greatest admiration for the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I complain of is , that the general impression of England which he produces is a dark one , while I am continually more and more struck with the bright side . Many believe that her last stormy evening has set in , while I feel only the fresh morning breeze that precedes the dawn . " - p. 352 . " Party is opposed to party ; one accuses the other ; and in the end , all are better than they are represented , either by themselves or their opponents . If I fancy myself many centuries hence , - if I , in imagination , set myself the task of writing the History of England , what a different shape does every thing then assume , how do the complaints and the discords die away ! For must not he be prejudiced and narrow-minded who is // unable equally to appreciate Pitt and Fox , Burke and Mackintosh ? Do not the trophies of Wellington , the splendid ability of Peel , the energy of Russell , triumphing by its simplicity , the clear and well-directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , belong to each other ? Do they not , by their reciprocal action , promote what is right ? Would not the picture be poorer , the result more confined , if I should take out , condemn , or throw aside the one or the other ? " - p. 511 . " While Italy still reposes on the laurels of its splendid twofold existence in antiquity and the middle ages ; while Spain , shaking off its compelled inactivity , is now torn to pieces by the fury of internal dissension ; xv hile France can never find permanent happiness , so long as it does not add to courage humility , to dominion self-control , to activity perseverance , and to talents morality ; where is the hope of the world , the guarantee for the future , the safegii**. against the irruptions of barbarism ? IT IS IN THE PRIMASVAL SOUND STEM OF GERMANIC DEVELOPEMENT , AND ITS TWO MAIN BRANChES GERMANY AND GREAT BRITAIN . If these two nations thoroughly comprehend their noble task , if they exert all their energies for its accomplishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their health , the manifold harmonies of life will again resound , and the smallest quarter of the globe will , in spite of all defects , still take the lead in the advance of knowledge throughout the world . " - p. 512 . We may distrust , if we will , the soundness of some of the views upon which are based such bright prognostics . But we shall do well to pay a very respectful attention to the reasons urged in their behalf . Professor Von Raumer is no theorist of the liberal school , that he should think so indulgently of what is doing by those who are . He is very little of a theorist of any kind . His political philosophy recognises more fully than any writer , whom we could name , that , among governments , " that which is best administered is best . " With him the king of Prussia , who ( as much as Louis the Fourteenth wad , ) is himself the state , ' ' is the greatest reformer in Europe , ' ' and " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centralization in all the departments of authority and influence , and has evidently more confidence in reforms accorded by the government , than in those which the governed project and extort . The phrase Rights of Man , in its familiar acceptation , has no place of honor in his vocabulary , while the Well-being of man is with him a matter of transcendent import . So far from // having any sympathy with " the movement , " merely as movemeat , he seems even *o consider the mere general agitation of political questions as likely to cost as much as it is worth . " - , to whom I was introduced by - , called on me . A well-informed , clever man ; but so much a citizen of England , that Prussia and his native city Berlin , appear to him petty , and in all respects behindh and . I know how much of this is true , and how much false ; and , in spite of all my discretion , I could not forbear saying that all trees did not grow with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but that each was a tree nevertheless , and had a bark of its own " The assertion that Prussia has no political education , has only a partial and conditional meaning ; for all real education must eventually have a political significancy , and a political influence ; and if that of Prussia is not conducted by means of parliamentary debates and ne*vspaper articles , on the other hand , many parts of England are wholly without the first elements of instruction . When events demanded it , there was no more lack of political perspicacity , vigor , and enthusiasm , in Prussia than in England , although they arose under other circumstances and other conditions . 1 dissent , however , entirely from the notion that it is incumbent on every man to busy himself perpetually with politics , and to bestow the greater part of his thoughts and energies on public business . This French excitement seems to me just as much a disease , as the apathy which is displayed in some passages of the history of Germany . Where politics exercise an immoderate influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and action , however noble and refined , are apt to fall into neglect . Nor do politics , in a high and large sense , consist in the events or opinions of the day ; but in that statesmanlike science , which can only grow out of a profound acquaintance with the past as well as present condition of mankind . The old complaint , that history and science lose their interest to men excited by the business and the passions of the day , may be repeated with great truth , even in London . " - p. 6 ' 2 . " What battles of words about words how often is an unmeaning or a dyslogistic word accepted as decisive of a question ! One day I had briefly explained to an Irish Catholic member of Parliament the state of religious parties in Prussia . lie replied , Your despot , then , has forced upon you very useful institutions . ' The words despot ' and forced , ' made me wince ; and in spite of all my caution I could not entirely close // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , Yes ; if a kind father is to be called a despot , and the love and gratitude of children to be deemed forced . ' " If ten votes in Parliament had given legal perpetuity to all the atrocities which have been practised against the Irish ever since the year 1650 , would that have been no despotism ' ? and would the observance of a certain form have rendered the question of the matter superfluous ? I repeat , how can men practise this idolatry of forms and formuke , and be so enslaved to them that they either can not understand any thing which deviates from their darling usages , or peremptorily deny its very existence . " - p.67 . Nor is it by any means to a mere facility of temper , inclining him to a favorable judgment of all belonging to a people , among whom he was hospitably treated , that we owe Professor Raumer 's representations of the state and prospects of Great Britain . So far from it , that on many points he is a malecontent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exhibit the grounds on which his judgments rest , we should have to follow him through elaborate discussions of some of the most intricate questions of political economy . The subjects of taxation , tithes , corn-laws , pauperism , the funding system , protecting duties , wages , machinery , and others similar , are treated hy him at large , and with an abundant array of facts , as well as ( in the original , ) with frequent and full abstracts of parliamentary debates , which , if the translator thought them superfluous for English readers , ought still to have been inserted in an edition prepared expressly for American use . He deals with the subject of penal law in a spirit of moderation and liberality . As to the church establishment , he is much impressed with the inequalities of the emoluments of ministers of religion , but does not think the church too rich , nor , as is natural for him , has any favor for the voluntary system of support for religious institutions . With the condition of the Catholics he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , as in his own country , a full share of the ecclesiastical revenues . The institution of a lay English peerage for life , at least as one more component part of the Upper House , appears to him a desirable improvement of the constitution of Parliament . The abolition of the East India Company 's monopoly he commends , as a measure demanded by all reasons of sound policy ; and the obligations of Great Britain to her East India possessions are urged by him in a // fine tone of remark . The requisition of subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles by students at the Universities , he condernns as an absurd iniquity ; and all the British institutions for education , from high to low , strike him as quite inferior to those of his own country , and inadequate to the wants of the times . Poor-laws he would have sustained and extended , while their faulty provisions should be revised , and a stop put to practical abuses . In one suggestion under this head , more prominently than in any other in the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have the government relieve the Irish poor , ( whose misery and degradation he paints in the strongest colors , ) hy converting them from tenants into freeholders ; in short , making them a present of their landlords ' farms . He does well to express his apprehension of the probable dissatisfaction of Whigs and Tories alike , with any such arrangement . It does not approve itself to the judg* ments of any division of the exported Saxon race . Yet it is no new proposal . It is only that a man is not to keep his own , if another , mightier than he , has a mind to make some other disposition of it ; the very point on which the one-headed and the many-headed monster of misrule , despotism and and archy , Ahab and Ba*bius , Achmet and Jack Cade , Frederic William and Robespierre , have always been agreed . So much for matters of the most pith and moment . Professor Raumer is also a practised connoisseur in art , and the state of art among the luxurious islanders by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and painting , " he pronounces to be " now , as formerly , very inferior to those of any of the nations which have acted as leaders of the human race . " Even Chantrey 's works , to his judgment , " lie on this side the line beyond which lay the whole region of art among the Greeks ; at which beauty of form , and the ideal ( in the true sense of the word ) , appear as the proper scope of art . " Nor does modern English architecture please him better . So far from it , that his indignation against the expensive enormities of Buckingham House , which was intended to supply what the King of England has not , a befitting palace in his capital , breaks out in one of the most animated passages of the volume . On the other hand , he does eloquent justice to the noble old Gothic structures . Fountain Abbey , and that grandest of all relics of feudalism , Windsor , awaken all his enthusiasm while at Westminster Abbey he gives vent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure enough to feel , at finding that most awful pile ( would they but let one look on its glory-haunted vastness ) broken up into closets and alleys in favor of the fees of the showmen , whom one would rejoice to pay tenfold for " the charity of their silence . " " On a sudden turn in the road , the magnificent ruins of Fountains Ahbey stood before me , towards which I hastened with my intelligent guide . I thought that I was entering the aisle of the church , but it was only the transept ; and the extent and sublimity of the building again surprised me when I reached the intersection of the cross . An extremely lofty and slender column still supports two bold arches ; the vaulted roof , which covered the centre , has fallen in . The ancient library , the vast refectory , the vaulted cloisters , - they are not the ruins of a single edifice , but an astonishing assemblage of ruins of many splendid buildings . The solemn stillness , the beauty of the scenery , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part completely covered them , presented an image of the bygone world of mind , and the fresh and youthful energy of nature . I have never seen ruins so grand and striking , - I might almost say , so full of thought and feeling . " - p. 431 . " Lord H very obligingly showed us the whole of the castle , much more than is usually shown ; which brings me to the introduction of this letter . Windsor far exceeded my expectations , and made a greater impression on me than all the other castles I have ever seen , put together . It combines the bold originality of the middle ages with the highest pitch of splendor and comfort which our times can reach . It is not an empty , tedious monotonous repetition of the same sort of rooms , over and over again ; but every staircase , every gallery , every room , every hall , nay , every window is different , surprising , peculiar ; in one word , poetical . In the rich , busy , hurrying London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - often looked for a tinge of poetic melancholy , or of fantastic originality . In vain ; no trace was to be found , even in society . Always the sharp outline of reality ; the mathematics of life ; the arts of calculating , of gaining , of governing . In Windsor , on the contrary , England 's history , so rich in interest , with all its recollections , suddenly stands before my eyes . These gigantic towers , bastions , balconies , chapels , churches , and knightly halls in fresh and boundless variety ; at every step , new views of rivers , valleys , woods , and fields ; the fancies of a thousand years crowded together into one instant , and far surpassing everything that opera decorations would dare to represent on paper and canvass. // " IL could understand Versailles , and see Louis the Fourteenth and his court walking up and down in the straight rectangular walks among the formal hedges , fountains , and half fabulous animals ; it was just a scene from Racine or Corneille . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , I fully understood that Shakspeare was an Englishman . Here he reigns as monarch , and his romantic world here finds a local habitation . As we were afterwards whirled along in the royal carriage through the green meadows , and the ancient oaks and beeches , where the wildest nature is interspersed with beautiful gardens and quiet lakes , where richly ornamented boats lay ready to transport us to the distant wooded and mysterious shore ; I felt that I was on the spot where the Henrys reigned , and acted their great and gorgeous tragedies ; where , in moonlight nights , Oberon and Titania sport with their fairy troops ; where Rosalind wanders in the forest , or Jacques indulges in his melancholy musings , or Beatrice throws out her keen jests like bright arrows . " - pp. 249 , 250 . " Westminster Abbey , as I saw it in Paris , - the painted Westminster Abbey of the Diorama , - made a grander , more sublime , and more harmonious impression on me , excited and touched me far more , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one glance ; the whole extent was before me , and an awful stillness seemed to invite the mighty dead from their tombs , although those tombs were not visible . Here , on the contrary , is a perfect labyrinth of wooded partitions , doors , screens , railings , and corners . Nowhere a grand general effect ; nowhere a feeling of congruity , and of regard to the main object , - the architectonic character of the building . It seemed as if all these nooks and swallows ' nests were contrived merely to increase the number of showmen and key-bearers who lurk in them . " - p. 141 . Professor Raumer finds one of the few points on which all opinions agree in England , to be , that the stage " has declined , and is declining . " This fact gives him much concern , and he submits several explanations , occurring to himself , or proposed by others . Some of these , such as the monopoly of the legitimate drama by the two principal theatres the want of police regulations , securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining which have become the fashion ; the size of theatres , inconsistent with the best exertion of the voice ; the costliness of the amusement ; the attraction of concerts and the opera ; and the discontinuance , // under the present reign , of encouragement given to the stage by former sovereigns , do not strike one as going far towards a solution of the question . Other circumstances specified are of a more important character , and probably of much more considerable influence ; such as the increase of the supply of popular books , and of habits of reading ; the character of part of the audience , which theatres attract , and which in England is made conspicuous by a separate place ; and the " indecorous and immoral " character of dramatic literature . Our author ascribes much efficacy to this last cause of the growing unpopularity of the stage in England , and would have it removed by a rigid exercise of the Lord Chamberlain 's authority of dramatic censorship . We have touched upon some topics of Professor Raumer 's exceedingly useful work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sufficient , perhaps , to indicate its general tone and character . If report says true , he is again in England , where we hope he is preparing to send out some testimony of a confirmation of his favorable first impressions . We honor the diligence of his researches , and the abundance of his knowledge ; we admire his candid and philanthropic spirit ; we cordially welcome the conclusions to which he would conduct us respecting the state and prospects of our glorious mother country . " With all its faults , " ( and these it seems determined that we , of all people , shall never forget ) " we love it still , " and that right heartily . Twenty-five yeal 's ago , Mrs. Barbauld , in her poem of 1811 , wrote of it in the Cassandra vein , as follows . It has seen some hard service since , but the prophecy seems now quite as far as then from its fulfilment . Fairest flowers expand but to decay , The worm is in thy core , thy glories pass away ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bring , Commerce , like beauty , knows no second spring , Crime walks thy streets , Fraud eats her unblest bread , O'er want and woe thy gorgeous robe is spread , And angel charities in vain oppose ; With grandeur 's growth the mass of misery grows , " &amp;c . We have been seeing , that much of this is denied by our author . In fact he allows no part of it . He will not admit even so much as that states , like men , are necessarily born to die* His thoughts on this head are too agreeable for us to choose any other for his parting communication with our readers . // " I should not have a drop of historical blood in my veins , if I did not sympathize in the melancholy with which many look hack into past times ; if I could not understand the feeling which urges so many a noble mind to try to retain unchanged the institutions which support the power , and increase the glory of England . But flowers fade , trees decay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Where , then , lies the sustaining and revivifying power ? Not in the unchanging , the uniform , the motionless ; these are rather the signs and characteristics of death , - nay , even death is another name for change and re-creation ; and thus , for the continuance of vegetable life , we require fresh seed ; for the maintenance of the strongest edifice , constant inspection and repair . " The individual man must die ; but he dies and leaves his blessing to posterity . He knows that they will not be like him in every thing ; far from regretting this , he wishes that they should avoid his faults and his weaknesses . " But all this is trivial . I meant to say something very different . I deny the necessity for the utter decay and fall of nations . It is said , nations consist of individuals , - all individuals must die , - therefore all nations must die . The analogy and the inference are false . Because all plants die , does it follow that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of eternal regeneration lie in the great whole ? " No nation has ever fallen but by its own vice and crimes ; and the belief in an eternal existence , - the duty of maintaining that existence , - is the first article of a nation 's creed , the first rule of a national law . - Nil desperandurn . This firm persuasion rests not on selfish presumption ; on the contrary , it is inseparably connected with the recognition of the existence and the permanence of others , and the utter rejection of all lust of conquest and of overthrow . According to the common notions , Athens was doomed to death when the Persian , and Rome when the Gaul , was within her walls ; Prussia , in the Seven Years ' War , and the war with France ; Spain and Russia , when Napoleon entered Madrid and Moscow . But it was not so . " There indisputably do exist incurable causes of ruin . But even then the laurel may overshado*v the grave , as well as the cypress , - witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the means of prolonging national life than any preceding ones . First , in material means , - in the greater knowledge and improvement of the earth and its productions , in more active intercourse and more liberal mutual assistance . Secondly , financial and military , - in the more equal division of all things , and the more equitable claims // on property and life . Thirdly , legal and political , - in the abolition of slavery , villanage , and the exclusive tyranny of any individual or any class . Fourthly , moral and religious , - in the stream of eternal life , which may and should pervade , sanctify , and bless , every relation of life from the fount of Christianity . Therefore , again I say , - Nil desperandum. " - pp. 333 , 334.
