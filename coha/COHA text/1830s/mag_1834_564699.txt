txt TflE event of the execution of Major John Andre , as a ' spy in our camp , in 1780 , and the transaction as connected with the treason of the infamous B'enedict Arnold , i 's incorporated with our history , and will be transmitted to future generation 's . But there are some circumstances relative to that affair which have received credence , either as authentic or traditionary , . which require to be explained and corrected ' . tTrrbi'ased trut'h is a choice material in history , while ambiguous and vague ' surmises form a blemish no less prominent , than ' , in sculpture and painting , would be a false feature in the countenance . But a violation of truth , impeaching personal character , emanates not from an ' honorable and ' intelligent mind , and is a species of slander which admits of no extenuation . In the year 1778 , General Wayne was despatched on a foraging expedition near the enemy 's lines ; he was attacked and a skirmish ensued , but he accomplished his object and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forage . On this occasion , Major Andre composed a satirical poem , called " The Cow C/ease , * which was published in Rivingt'on 's paper , in New-York . It was filled with irony and satire upon the American officers , but particularly pointed at General Wayne , . representing that his baggage was taken , which contained- " His Congress Dollars and- his prog , His military speeches ; His cornstalk : whisky for his grog , Black stockings and ' blue breeches . " The concluding stanza runs thus : ' " But now I end my lyric strain ; I tremble while I show it , Lest this same warrior-drover Wayner Should ever catch the poet . " - 46 V ( YL . VI . // In Judge Johnson 's elaborate life of General Green there is a mistake , which , had it been true , would have been a remarkable coincidence with the prediction in the last line of the song , and this error of the judge led the author of the life of General Wayne to assert that " the unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic strain ; for , when taken , he was delivered to Wayne , at Tappan . " Few facts are perhaps more generally understood than that the captors of Andre delivered him immediately into the hands of Lieutenant-Colonel Jameson , the commanding officer on the lines . By this officer he was delivered to the charge of Major Tallmadge , now General Tailmadge , of Connecticut , who conducted the prisoner to Head-Quarters , at Tappan , and he was not at any time in the hands of General Wayne . It is farther stated by Judge Johnson , that Wayne refused to sit on the court for the trial of Andre . Whether that officer was required by the Commander-in-Chief to sit on the trial , or whether he was omitted , from an apprehension of prejudice in his mind against the prisoner , on account of the Cow Chase , can not be ascertained ; but certain it is that he was not one of the fourteen officers who composed that honorable tribunal . Judge Johnson has unfortun*itely committed another mistake in making C*olonel Laurens , of South-Garolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colonel John Lawrence , who was the Judge-Advocate-General of our army . It is not a little singular that the author of Revolutionary Anecdotes has been led to make the following mis-statement : - " He was actually taken by a party from the division of the army immediately under the command of Wayne . " I feel that I am repeating a trite and wellknown fact when I say that the captors of Andre were not soldiers , but private individuals , employing themselves in ranging between the lines of the two armies for their own benefit . Having been apprised that Mr. Jared Sparks had investigated , in the fullest manner , the subject of Arnold and Andre , both in Europe and America , and had given a lecture in Boston , which was received with the highest applause , I was induced to commence a correspondence with that gentlenian , making a few inquiries . I had published in my Military Journal a narrative of the circumstances , which I witnessed at the execution of Major Andre , and asserted that he was executed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I took the liberty to appeal to Mr. Sparks nearly as follows I can not , at this distance of time , recollect his dress , except his cocked hat , which I never shall forget seeing him give to his weeping servant after he had mounted the cart . When I wrote my journal of occurrences , from day to day , I had no idea that it ever would be published , and whether I inserted the fact of his uniform in the first instance , or at a subsequent review , I am now unable to determine . The general impression among our officers , and among the people , so far as I can judge , has been that he suffered in his regimentals . I will now offer some plausible reasons which may at least give countenance to my assertion . There was an intervention of nine days between Andre 's capture and his execution , during which every proper indulgence was extended to him , and I know of nothing to prevent his recovering his regimentals from Smith 's house , where he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose ; he was permitted to send into New-York for his clothes , and these were sent to him by his servant . His regimentals were doubtless now within his reach if not before . He was visited by a number of our general officers , and it may well be supposed that he retained the pride of a British officer , and would throw off his borrowed plebeian habit , which indicated his degraded condition as a prisoner and a spy . I am aware that it is recorded in my Journal , page 218 , that on his trial before the military tribunal in the meeting-house at Tappan , Andre said that he was then in the dress in which he was taken , and which was not his regimentals . But after his condemnation he was of course relieved from all restraint as to dress , and being still a British officer he was at liberty to resume his uniform . Let us now consider this unfortunate man in the view of execution . It was his earnest desire , and he entreated the commander-in-chief , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not on a gibbet . " Sparing the anguish of his mind , no answer was given to his letter , and the victim was not informed of the mode of his death till he arrived within view of the gallows . With the hope , therefore , of being indulged in his desire of meeting his fate like a soldier , can it be imagined that he would choose to appear in any other than a soldier 's costume ? In the autumn of 1821 , forty-one years after the interment , the remains of Major Andre were exhumed under the direction of Mr. Buchanan , the British Consul , and transmitted to England . Finding no indication among the mouldering bones that the corpse was buried in the regimentals , Mr. Buchanan , it has been said , complained that Andre was , by the Americans , robbed of his uniform ; but a more liberal inference would have been that they were returned to New-York by his servant . I have addressed a letter to my friend , Dr. Hosack , requesting from him some particulars respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am kindly promised his opinion through your correspondence with him . I am also endeavoring to collect the opinions of some surviving officers on the subject , and if I receive any thing interesting you shall be informed of it . Mr. Sparks not being able to decide the point , I could not but feel animated to a thorough investigation for the ascertainment of the real facts respecting the uniform ; and it was not long before I had the happiness to find that my efforts were crowned with complete success , having discovered a document , which places the whole affair in its proper light . There are , in the library of the Pilgrim Society in this town , files of newspapers embracing a period of more than fifty years , a generous donation from the venerable relict of the late Judge William Cushing . In my search , among these papers , I had the satisfaction to find the Continental Journal and Weekly Advertiser , of October 26 , 1780 , printed in Boston , by . Jolin Gill . In this paper there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the very day of the execution , of which the following is a copy " TA PPAN , OcToBER 2 , 1780 . " You have the particulars of Traitor Arnold 's conduct before his getting on board of the Vulture sloop of war , which lay near Stony Point ; but his conduct // Observations relative to since he went into New-Yerk is a still greater proof of his villany ( if greater villany was possible . ) At his arrival with the British , he had about fifty of our warmest friends in New-York taken up and put into dungeons or other places of confinement . But there is a Providence attending the unhappy friends to their country , that puts it out of his isower to injure them other than by imprisonment . Such was the precipitate flight he made to save his neck from the halter , that he had no time to move off a single paper , or any other matter which can be a testimony against those he would otherwise ruin in person and estate . General Robertson came up yesterday to Dobbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it being of so trite a nature , viz , to entreat his Excellency General Washington , at the request of Sir Henry Clinton , to use lenity to Major Andre . It had the effect to respite him for a few hours , as the flag did not return till after five o'clock , which was the hour fixed in general orders for his execution . This day at twelve o'clock it toek place , by hanging him by the neck . Perhaps no person on like occasion ever suffered the ignominious death , that was more regretted by officers and soldiers of every rank in our almy , nor did I ever see any person meet his fate with more fortitude and equal conduct . When he was ordered to mount the wagon under the gallows , he replied he was ready to die , but wished the mode to have been in some more eligible way , preferring to be shot . After he bad opened Isis shirt collar , fixed the rope , and tied his handkerchief over his eyes , he was asked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? He replied , I have said all I had to say before , and have only to request the gentlemen present to bear testimony that I meet death as a brave man . " The flag mentioned to have come out with General Robertson was received by General Green and Colonel Hamilton ; and what is curious , Arnold sent his resignation by desire that General Washington should forward it to Congress , with an insolent letter intimating he never would serve Congress any more , nor need they expect it ; and , moreover , if Major Andre should be executed by order of Generall Washington , that he would strike a blow on some of his friends on the continent that should suflicientlv retaliate for the loss to his Prince . General Green* , wben he had read the letter , treated it with contempt and threw it on the ground before General Robertson. , which he might return to the traitor if he thought proper . " ' * * * " He was dressed in full uniform ,  --  and after the execution his servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was buried near the gallows . " This testimony must be considered as abundantly sufficient to establish the fact that Andre was executed in his regimentals , and that his servant received them after the execution . But I am , moreover , credibly informed that a man , who died a few years since , and who was an eye-witness , has often been heard to relate that Andre was executed in a new uniform suit , which was given to his servant . While preparing this page , I had the further satisfaction of conversing with Mr. John Applin , of Carver , a man of intelligence and retentive memory , who was standing within a few yards of the place during the tragic scene . He has no hesitancy in declaring that the prisoner was attired in full uniform , and that a'fter the execution all the effects of Andre were delivered to the servant to be returned to New-York . He is confident that the place of execution was full - one mile from the house in which the prisoner had been confined . It will now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imputation of having robbed *ajox Andre of his uniform suit . In the Museum of Foreign Literature , Science and Art , for Feb .. ruary , 1834 , there is a very circumstantial narrative of the exhumation of Major Andre 's remains , by the British Consul , James Buchanan , Esq . from which it appears he was stimulated to the measure by the following reasons . In the year 1818 , a resolution passed in the Legislature of New-York , directing that the remains of General Montgomery , // who fell at Quebec , should be removed from that place and deposited in New-York . " The excitement arising fiom that act , " says Mr. Buchanan , " led necessarily to observations and unkindly feelings , and I was hourly annoyed by contrasts drawn from the conduct of the state of New-York , while the remains of the British soldier , who was sacrificed in the service of his country , in the flower of his youth , remain neglected . " Influenced by these considerations , the Consul was induced to address his Royal Highness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British army . An order was promptly obtained from the Duke for the purpose , and Mr. Buchanan personally superintended the disinterment , and the preparation for the conveyance to England , in a manner which reflects honor on his feelings and character . Having consulted Mr. Eggleso , cabinet-maker and upholsterer , of NewYork , a box was constructed by the latter gentleman in the form of an ancient sarcophagus , of mahogany , and covered with *crimson velvet , at the expense of one hundred guineas . His next step was to obtain permission of Governor Clinton , of New-York , to remove the remains from the state , which was readily granted . Mr. Buchanan , now accompanied by the Spanish ConsuJ , Mr. Eggleso , and a few others , proceeded to Ta*pan , and the first house he inquired at for information happened to be the same in which Major Andre was confined when a prisoner . He waited on the Rev. Mr. Demarat , a Baptist minister , residing in the village , who generously expressed his satisfaction at the honor which at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every facility in his power . it had been intimated to Mr. Buchanan. , that some person had gone from New-York with the view of purchasing or renting the field from Mr. Demarat , that he might extort a large sum for the liberty of opening the grave ; but , to his honor , the clergyman rejected the proposal , and *voutd on no account recede from his promise . The fbllowing are extracts from Mn Buchanan 's communication " We proceeded up a narrow lane on a broken road , with trees at each side , which obscured the place where he suffered , until we came to the openi , ig into the field which at once led to an elevated spot on the hill . On reachin* the mount , we foand it commanded a view of the surrounding country for miles . General Washington 's Head-Quarters , and the house in which he resided , was distant about a mile and a half or two miles , but fully in view . The army lay encamped , chiefly also in view of that place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as I could judge , contained from eight to ten acres , and was cultivated ; but around the grave the plough had not approached nearer than three or four yards , that space being covered with loose stories thrown uponand around the grave which was only indicated by two cedar trees about ten feet high . A small peach-tree had also been planted at the head of the grave , by the kindly feeling of a lady in the neighborhood . " As soon as the stones were cleared away , and the grave was found , not a tongue moved amongst the multitude ,  --  breathless anxiety was depicted in every countenance . When , at length , one of the men cried out that he had touched the coffin , so great was the enthusiasm at this moment , that I found it necessary to call in the aid of several of the ladies to form an enlarged circle , so that all could see the operation , which being effected , the men proceeded with the greatest caution , and the clay was removed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffin was broken in the centre . With great care the broken lid was removed , and there to our view lay the bones of the brave Andre in perfect order . I , among others , for the first time discovered that he had been a small man ; this observ // Observations relative to ation I made from the skeleton , which was confirmed by some other present . The roots of the small peach-tree had completely surrounded the skull like a net . " After allowing all the people to pass round in regular order , and view the remains as they lay , which very many did with unfeigned tears and lamentations , the bones were carefully removed and placed in the sarcophagus ( the circle having been again formed . ) After which I descended into the coffin which was not more than three feet below the surface , and with my own hands raked the dust together , to ascertain whether he had been buried in his regimentals or not , as it was rumored among the assemblage that he was stripped ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons of his elothes , which would have disproved the rumor ; but 1 did not find a single button , nor any article , save a string of leather that had tied his hair , in perfect preservation , coiled and tied as it had been on his hair at the time . This string I fbrwarded to his sisters , in England . I examined the dust of the coffin so minutely ( as the quantity would not fill a quart ) that no mistake could have arisen in the examination . Let no unworthy motive be attributed to me for recording this fact ; I state it as one which I was anxious to ascertain for the reasons given . I do not pretend to know whether buttons would moulder into dust , while bones and strings would remain perfect and entire ; but sure I am there was not a particle of metal in the coffin . " How far these facts accord with the rumors adverted to , others may judge ; but it is useful , that all these facts should be brought to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if stripped , those who permitted the outrage , or who knew of it , had no idea that the unfeeling act they then performed would be blazoned to the world near half a century after the event ; or that the future historian should hold up such a procedure to all honorable men . Having placed the remains in the sarcophagus , it was borne amid the silent and unbooght regret of the numerou , s assemblage , and deposited in the worthy pastor 's house , with the intention of reanoving it to his Majesty 's packet on the Tuesday following . " I should be ungrateful did I omit doing justice to the feelings of an aged widow , who kept the turnpike gate on the way to New-York , who , upon hearing the object of my visit , declared that she felt so much gratified that the remains were to be removed from the field where they had so long lain neglected , that all carriages should pass free ef toll on the occasion . Whether she had this power I know not , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to a transaction which a great part of the British public have forgotten , at least those in the humnb'le walks of life that this gate-keeper was . " * * * " Having represented to his Royal Highness the generous conduct of the Rev. Mr. Demarat , I recommended that his Royal Highness should convey to him a snuff-box made out of one of the trees which grew at the grave , which I sent home . But my suggestion was far outdone by the princely munificence of his Royal Highness , who ordered a box to be made out of the tree , and lined with gold , with an inscription , From his Royal Highness the Duke of York , to the Rev. Mr. Demarat . ' While speaking of this act of liberality , I was unexpectedly honored with a silver inkstand , with the following inscription : - The surviving sisters of Major Andre to James Buchanan , Esq . his Majesty 's Consul , New-York . ' They also sent a silver cup , with a suitable inscription , to Mr. Demnarat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which I am now using , ) and shall bequeath it to n'my children , as a memorial which I prize with no ordinary feeling . " The remains of Major Andre were conveyed to England . and deposited in Westminster Abbey , near the monument which had been erected to his memory , and a marble slab placed at the foot of the monument , setting forth their removal by order of the Duke of York . In consequence of the foregoing publication , I was induced to a ( ldress to Mr. Buchanan the following letter PLYMOUTh , MASS . FEB. 25 , 1834 . James Buchanan , Esq. - Bs- itish Consul - Sir ,  --  i beg you will pardon this intrusion from a stranger , since the object is an explanatioms of a circumstance , in which , I perceive , you have in common with the community at large , taken a deep interest . I allude to the execution of the lamented Major Andre . I was present at the execution , and within a few yards of his person , and witnessed the melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be obliterated from my mind . In a Journal , in which I recorded occurrences at the time , and published , I asserted that he was dressed in his royal regimentals and buried in the same . This was my impression till recently it has been called in question , in consequence , probably , of a publication from you , stating that when the remains were disinterred under your direction , no indications were found corroborative of the fact . Hence , you readily inferred that Major Andre was outrageously robbed of his uniform . Anxious , a swellto establish my own correctness , as to repel the opprobrious imputation from my countrymen , 1 was induced to enter into the investigation of the subject ; and it affords me infinite satisfaction that I have been enabled to procure a document . that will exonerate those concerned in the transaction , and place the whole affair in its true light . In the Continental Journal and Weekly Advertiser , October 26 , 1780 , printed in Boston by John Gill , there is a letter , dated Tappan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , detailing the particulars , in which it is expressly said , He was dressed in full uniforis , , and after the execution his servant . demanded his clothing , which he received . His body was buried near the gallows . " This confirms the correctness of my assertion that he suffered in his regimentals , but not that they were buried with the body . 1 had retired from the scene before the body was placed in the coffin , but I have a perfect recollection of seeing him hand his hat to the weeping servant while standing in the cart . It is well known that Major Andre was indulged with permission to send into New-York for his clothes , and that they were brought to him by his servant . It was perfectly natural that the servant should desire to be possessed of his masters clothing , and there could be no kind of objection to his receiving them . I have beers highly gratified by the perusal of an extract from your letter published* in the New-York Albion , which has recently fallen under my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances attending the exhumation of the remains of Major Andre in the year 1821 . We are not to be surprised that you felt an anxiety to ascertain the fact whether the remains of that distinguished officer were deposited in the uniform dress , as a rumor was prevalent that . he had been stripped , and from the result of your close examination , you justly infer the negative ; for undoubtedly metal buttons would have been in a state to be recognized , alt bough forty-one years had elapsed ; but your consecutive inference most be considered as entirely gratuitous . Your words are , " How far these facts accord with the rumors adverted to , others may judge ; but it is useful that all these facts should be brought to light , as it may reasonably be inferred , that if stripped , those who permitted the outrage , or who knew of it , had no idea that the unfeeling act they then performed would be blazoned to the world near half a century after the event ; or that the future historian should hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is now rendered unquestionable that the uniform was delivered to his servant and returned to New-York ; if therefore , in your view , sir , any stigma is still attached to those concerned in that memorable transaction , let me entreat that the above statement may induce you not only to obliterate the impression , but to promulgate a conviction to the " future historian " that no part appear censurable in the view of " honorable men . " of that procedure can I subscribe myself with respect , &amp;c . JAMES THACHER . The inquiry has been frequently made , why Andre was not given up in exchange for Arnold . The following paragraph in Col. Hamilton 's letter to a friend , published in the Independent Ledger , Nov. 27 , 1780 , will go tcs solve that question . " Arnold or he must have been the victim ; the former was out of our power . It was by some suspected Arnold had taken his measures in such manner , that if the interview had been discovered in the act , it might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security . This surmise of double treachery made them imagine Clinton might be induced to give up Arnold for Andre , and a gentleman took occasion to suggest this expedient to the latter , as a thing that might be proposed by him . He declined it . The moment he had been capable of so much frailty , I should have ceased to esteem him . " // From a sense of justice anil d*zty , I feel it incumbent on me to refute a departure from historical truth by a foreign writer , which ought to excite universal indignation . In the " Biographical Dictionary , " by Alexander Chalmers* published in London , is the following paragraph , under the head of Washington . " Granting ( it has been said ) that duty required him to execute , as a spy , the accomplished Major Andre , true magnanimity would have prevented him from insultingly erecting in the view of that unfortunate officer , the gallows , on which he was to be hung , several days before his execution . " This is a most unrighteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety , and it is discreditable to Mr. Chalmers that he was not better acquainted with the illustrious character he was traducing , and the circumstance he was transmitting to posterity . True it is , that the scaffold was erected on the 1st of October , that being the day appointed for the execution , but in consequence of the arrival of General Robertson from New-York , it was postponed to the next day . But so far from " insultingly " erecting the gallows within the view of that unfortunate officer , it was more than a half if not a full mile from the stone house in which he was confined , , and there was a clump of wood standing between , which entirely intercepted the view , and the mode of his death was designedly concealed from him till he came in sight of the gallows , when , with great emotion , he expressed his disappointment but soon recovering his firmness , he said , " It will be but a momentary pang . " As to true magnanimity , Mr. Chalmers must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prominent characteristic of Washington. ; and I must be permitted further to observe , that such was his sympathy and delicacy on the trying occasion , that his hand , as was said at the time , could scarcely guide the pen in signing the death-warrant , and he was not seen by any company on the day of the execution . I must not conclude this little sketch without some animadversion on the very illiberal sentiment of another English author . Stedman 's History of the American War , has been considered judicious and reputable , and , , in general , as impartial as could be expected ; but the following passage can not but affect the sensibility of every American reader . This is his sentence Bright as the fame of Washington shall shine in the annals of America , as one of the most illustrious supporters of her independence , the sons of freedom will lament the cold insensibility that dAd not suffer him to interpose , in order to rescue from his fate so gallant an officer , and even could withhold from him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glance of indignation shall dart from the eyes of her fair and ' compassionate daughters , softened only by the tear of pity for the fate of the accomplished Andre . " Mr. Stedman served under Sir William Howe , Sir Henry Chin . ton , and the Marquis Corn*vaI1is . It is impossible , therefore , to suppose that he was unacquainted with the laws of'war among all civilized nations , that spies shall suffer death , and that in all armies the customary mode is by hanging . Let Mr. Stedmnan and Mr. Chalmers recollect how many unfortunate persons from our army suffered this ignominious punishment as spies , by the British commanders* If an // example of the want of true magnanimity , or of " cold insensibility , " need be specified , I will refer to one which ought to silcnce every complaint from that quartcr . I cite from my Military Journal a narrative written by the late Major General Hull , and which was published in Hannah Adams 's History of New-England . On a certain occasion , General Washington was exceedingly desirous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and future movements of the enemy . He requested Colonel Knowlton , who commanded a regiment of light infantry , which formed the van of the American army , to adopt some mode of gaining the necessary information . Colonel Knowlton communicated this request to Captain Hale , of Connecticut , who was then a captain in his regiment . This young officer , animated by a sense of duty , and considering that an opportunity presented itself by which he might be useful to his country , at once offered himself a volunteer for this hazardous service . He passed in disguise to Long-Island , examined every part of the British army , and obtained the best possible information respecting their situation and ftture operations . In his attempt to . return , he was apprehended , carried before Sir William Howe , and the proof of his object was so clear , that he frankly acknowledged who he was , and what were his views . Sir William Howe at once gave an order to the Provost Marshal to execute him the next morning . The order was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as great a savage ' as ever disgraced humanity . A clergyman , whose attendance he desired , was refused him ; a Bible , for a moment 's devotion , was not procured , though he requested it . Letters , which , on the morning of his execution , he wrote to his mother , and other friends , were destroyed ; and this very extraordinary reason given by the Provost Marshal ,  --  that the rebels should not know they had a man in their army who could die with so much firmness . Unknown to all around him , without a single friend to offer him the least consolation , thus fell as amiable and as worthy a young man as America could boast , with this as his dying observation ,  --  " That he only lamented he had but one life to lose for his country . " Though the manner of his execution will ever be abhorred by every friend to humanity and religion , yet there can not be a question but that the sentence was conformable to the rules of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , however , a justice due to the character of Captain hale , to observe , that his motives for engaging in this service , were entirely different from those which generally influence others in similar circumstances . Neither expectation of promotion , nor pecuniary reward , induced him to this attempt . A sense of duty , a hope that he might in this way be useful to his country , and an opinion he had adopted , that every kind of service , necessary to the public good , became honorable by being necessary , were the great motives which induced him to engage in an enterprise , by which his connections lost a most amiable friend , and his country one of its most promising supporters . The fate of this most unfortunate young man , excites the most interesting reflections . To see such a character in the flower of vouth ,  --  cheerfully treading in the most hazardous paths , influenced by the purest intentions , and only emulous to do good to his country , without the imputation of a crime ,  --  fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the feelings even of his enemies . Should a comparison be drawn between Major Andre and Captain Hale , injustice would be done to the latter , should he not be placed on equal ground with the former . Whilst almost every historian of the Revolution has celebrated the virtues and lamented the fate of Andre , Hale has remained unnoticed , and it is scarcely known that such a character ever existed . To the memory of Andre his country has erected the most magnificent monument , and bestowed on his family the highest honors and most liberal rewards . To the memory of Hale not a stone has been erected , nor an inscription to preserve his ashes from insult . Now let the reader draw the striking contrast between the conduct of the royalists and the Americans , on an occasion where the duties of humanity and benevolence were equally and imperiously demanded . In which instance was a want of " true magnanimity , " or a " cold insensibility , " most clearly manifested ? Hale was summarily condemned and executed by the fiat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before a tribunal consisting of fourteen officers of the highest rank and respectability , two of whom , the Baron Steuben and General Lafayette , were Europeans . It is , however , a matter for sorrowful reflection , that either of these gallant officers should have been sacrificed to the laws of war . It is with peculiar satisfaction , that I am permitted to announce that Mr. Sparks will very shortly favor the public with a full narrative of the affair of Arnold arid Andre . This gentleman has given to the subject the fullest investigation , both in Europe and America , and possessed himself of documents and information which will enable him to furnish a history more complete and correct than has ever been published . After the foregoing pages were prepared for the press , I had the special satisfaction to be apprised that my letter to Mr. Buchanan had been favorably received and duly appreciated . lIe directed it to be published in the New-York Albion , accompanied with the following note to the editor . I have said special satisfaction because Consul Buchanan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courteous spirit , directly the reverse of too many writers from beyond the Atlantic , who are laboring to perpetuate prejudice and undignified sentiments between the two nations . To the Editor of the Lilbion . Sir ,  --  I request , as an act of justice , that you will give an early insertion to the letter herewith sent , which I had the honor of receiving from Dr. Thacher . It not only in my mind , but I should hope in the minds of all who may have read my narrative , or have , through other statements , heard the charge , render inculpable all whose duty required their attendance on the tragic act referred to . Through this public medium I tender my sincere thanks to the Doctor for his well-timed communication , which I shall forward to the editor of the United Service Journal , in London , so that the explanation may circulate wherever the statement has reached .

Dr. James Thacher , Dear Sir ,  --  Circumstances beyond my control have delayed this answer to your letter from Plymouth , received last month , in relation to your Revolutionary Military Journal .

In relation to the execution of 4ndre , it happened to be my tour , as a soldier of the Massachusetts line , to be on duty on the occasion , and to be posted in a situation where I could distinctly observe every part of the deportment of the gallant sufferer , and hear every word he uttered . My recollections of them are fresh , but I much fear , at this remote period , the details will be considered as a twice-told tale . However , as you remark , that the execution in question has afforded one of the most memorable events of our revolutionary struggle ; has excited deep interest and feeling on both sides of the Atlantic and even at this late period , is understood to the disadvantage of our country , I shall venture to give them , as they exist in my memory , as a supplementary test of the accuracy of your Revo. lutionary Journal . Most of them have been long familiar to you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them as you please . Major Andre was executed on the 2d October , 1780 , in the Dutch village of Tappan , ( Orangetown . ) He was dressed in the rich uniform of a British Staff Officer , with the exception , of course , of sash , gorget , sword and spurs . The place of execution was near the centre of the encampment of the American Grand Army , and in full view of many of its regiments . 1'he lofty gibbet was surrounded by an exterior guard of nearly five hundred Infantry , with an inner guard of a captain 's command . None were admitted within the square but the officers on duty and the Assistants of the Provost Marshal . The spectators outside the square were very numerous . Proceeding to the place of execution , under the above guard , Andre was accompanied by two of the officers of the inner guard , which he at first , as I learned , thought had been detailed as his executioners . He had previously requested of General Washington the favor of dying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high sense of duty of the Commander-in-Chief could not grant , and his delicacy forbade him to announce his determination in an answer . The officers of the American Army performing duty on horseback , with General Greene at their head , were formed in line on the road . To those , whom Major Andre knew , particularly those who made part of the Board of-General Officers who pronounced on his fate , he paid the salute of the hat , and received the ADIEUS of all with ease and complacency . The Commander-in-Chief and Staff were not present at the execution ; and this mark of decorum , I was told , was feelingly appreciated by the sufferer . Your Journal , dear sir , has given a very accurate report of the remarks made by Major Andre on this impressive occasion . When the procession moved on the main road , the gallows was not visible ; but when it wheeled at an angle , the place of execution was seen directly in front . On viewing it , the sufferer made a halt , and exhibited emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard , Major Andre gave the answer recorded in your work :  --  " I am reconciled to my death , but detest the mode of it . " The captain rejoined- " It is unaroidable. sir . " Arrived at the scaffold , Andre , after a short conversation with his servant , ( who arrested much attention by the vehemence of his grief and loud lamentation , ) ascended with gaiety the baggage-wagon . The General Order of execution was then read by , I believe , Colonel Scammell , our Deputy Adjutant-General , and the highly-gifted and gallant New-Hampshire officer , who afterwards fell at Yorktown . I he reading was very impressive , and at the conclusion Major Andre uncovered bowed to the General and other officers , and said , with dignity and firmness , " . *1ll I request of you , gentlemen , is that you will bear witness to the world that I die like a brave man . " He added nothing more aloud , but while the preparations for immediate execution were being made , he said , in an under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g. " // Observations , 4*e . Thus died Major John Andre , Adjutant-General to the British Army . The sympathy of the American officers was universally expressed , and the Father of our Country , in announcing his death to Congress , pronounced that he met his fate like a brave man . It was stated at the time in England , and , if I mistake not , in America , that he was buried in his regimentals . This was believed for a long time , and gave rise to the suspicion , if not assertion , that his grave had been violated by our countrymen , as it was found , on the exhumation of his remains , forty This matter you have recently and satisfactorily put to-rights ; and I can add my testimony , to that of others , that I saw the servant of Andre receive the military hat and stock of his master , immediately before the execution . I did not see the body placed in the coffin , but I did see , as I marched by the grave , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On this subject I will only add , that after the execution of Andre , the American Army remained in its encampment five days , and that , during that time : no indignity or violence was , or could have been , offered to the grave . The simple facts respecting Andre 's uniform are , that he wore it when he landed from the sloop of war , Vulture , and during his interview with Arnold at Hayerstra*v ; that he left his regimentals there , and assumed a citizen 's dress , in which he was captured ; and sent to the American army , where he was tried ( or examined ) in that dress . That he had General Washington 's permission to receive clothes and linen ; that after his condemnation as a British officer , he resumed his regimentals-was executed in them , and that they were taken into custody by his servant , and , as I wascredibly informed , in 1783 , were by him carried to New-York on his return thither . An error has been circulated , upon respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the citizen name he had assumed when captured , ) and not as Major Andre . This error has not , to my knowledge , been particularly contradicted ; but there is ample evidence of its incorrectness , and a good opportunity is now afforded to adduce it . It is important , I think , that the public of Europe and America should know the facts in the case . They are furnished in official documents . First-In Andre 's letter to General Washington , dated , Salem , NewYork , written the next day after his capture at Tarry-town , in which he says - " The person in your possession is Major John Andre , Adjutant-General to the British army ; " and to this letter he adds his signature as above . Second-General Washington 's order , dated September 29 , 1780 , for convening the Board of General Officers , in which he says- " Major Andre , Adjutant-General to the British army will be brought before you . " Third-The judgement of the above Board of Officers , ( signed by General Nathaniel Greene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Major Andre , Adjutant-General to the British army , ought to be considered as a Spy from the enemy , and ought to suffer death . " Fourth-The General Order of the Commander-in-Chief , dated September 30 , approving the above opinion , and ordering the execution of Major Andre ; and lastly , the General Order of Execution of the second of October , orders " the execution on that day of Major A dre , Adjutant-General of the British Army . " This mass of testimony is amply sufficient to satisfy every one that Major Andre was not executed as John Anderson . In no one of the preceding documents is the name of John Anderson mentioned or alluded to . Thus , my worthy friend , I have endeavored to comply with your patriotic desire . The details have been extended to an unusual and regretted length . My object  --  and I know it accords with yours-has been to establish three disputed points : - That Andre , although executed in his royal uniform , was not buried in it : - That his grave was not violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of a generous enemy to a gallant offrcer , and not as a private male factor . - I have only room to repeat the esteem and respect , with which I remain Yeur friend and fellow-citizen , BENJAMIN RUSSELL@@183068707.txt AFTER the following article was written , we found the leading idea expressed in a single paragraph of the introduction to the author 's last edition of Ivanhoe , which , by some mischance , had never until then ' met our eyes . We can not , however , consent to deprive the world of the benefit of our own thoughts . We never approved , and therefore would not imitate , the conduct of a rich old man , who , having in " serted the name of a young kinsman in his will , afterwards erased it , because he learned , that a much greater legacy had been left to the young man from a different quarter . We trust that the world will appreciate our motives , and be sufficiently grateful for the gift . It will not do for little streams to cease flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his monstrous floods into the same reservoir . Justice , however , corn pels us to add , that the ocean would owe these little streams small thanks , if they stole their waters from larger streams , and , after long and wasteful routes , gave to the ocean only miserable , dribbling remnants of the ample treasures which they stole ; thus aptly enough reminding one of that part of the taxgatherer 's proceeds , which is finally spent for the nation 's good . Novels , in their numberless forms , make so large a part of the reading and instruction of the young , that it is well to inquire into their character and influence Natural philosophy , moral duty , religious principle , the science of legislation , the doctrines of political economy , are all taught in novels . Thus , if we have no royal road to knowledge , we have , what is much more agreeable , a " primrose path , " strewed with the flowers of fiction , which leads not only to heaven , but to the summit of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon  --  the threshold of life , with a whole world of new and wonderful objects , spread around on all sides to engage their thoughts and swell their little hearts with emotions too strong o be expressed otherwise than by glo*ving looks and inarticulate exclamations of delight , are not permitted to go forth and examine for themselves the thousand beautiful forms , which nature has thrown out as traps , with which to catch their simple minds , and , as it were , decoy them into reflection . Nature is too clumsy a mistress . Their buoyant spirits must be broken - down by the monotonous confinement of a school-room ; and , lest the healthful flush should by any accident be restored to their cheeks by an occasional frolic with the pure breezes of heaven , their leisure hours must be employed in torturing them into a fondness for music , ( if it is their misfortune to be girls , ) and initiating them into the mysteries of fiction . Stories are the first books that are put into their hands , whether at home or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is provided ; if instruction is wanted , a story is provided . If they have done wrong and need correction , a story is read to them . If they have done well and need encouragement , a story is read to them . And when childhood is passed , stories are still their meat and their drink . History is taught in stories , where fiction and reality are so blended , that the child 's instinctive love of truth , and original perception of truth , ( a faculty which neither phrenologists nor metaphysicians have yet had the good fortune to discover , ) may be fairly exercised in sepa // rating what is true from what is false . The Bible itself is so diluted with fiction as to be transformed into story-books for the especial benefit of the young , and stories are written to enforce its precepts and illustrate its truths . Now we beg to have it understood , that we have no thoughts of making a serious attack upon the armies of fiction , which have besieged the very nurseries of our nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to age or sex . We choose not to enter the lists with such fearful odds against us , until we have burnished our armor , improved our skill , and renewed our courage . Leaving fiction in general to whatever fortune may await it , we would seriously ask , What are the character and influence of those tales that are usually called moral tales ? Unless our occasional excursions into these regions have been singularly unfortunate , a moral tale , as the term is generally understood by readers and writers , is a tale in which virtue is rewarded with temporal prosperity , and vice punished by temporal adversity . Great honor , or great riches , or both united , are the attendants of virtue in all its forms , while vice is sure to be followed by disgrace and poverty . Thus Dick Whittington - our critical readers must excuse us if we miscall names and mis-state incidents ; it is a long time since we read these books , and we were never critically conversant with them-Dick Whittington , an excellent boy , makes an immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , whom we once knew , but whose name we have forgotten , having saved the lives of an old horse , a blind man , and a lame sailor , is himself , by the joint efforts of the three , delivered from the murderous hands of a company of robbers ; - events equally natural and in-structive ! But we are behind our age . These hooks have been long banished . Only a tattered fragment here and there is left for the amusement and edification of our children . Tom Thumb is no longer allowed to play his pranks for their benefit . Jack the Giant Killer has been forced to yield to a champion more potent than himself . Robin Hood has ceased to perform his exploits at juvenile concerts , and has taken for himself a high place in perhaps the most delightful of romances . The whole race of tales , that amused our childish hours , has been swept away , and forms that we hardly know now occupy their places . But , in the popular school-books of the day , we read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pedler 's wagon , are recompensed by a basket of oranges ; while the wicked boy , that attempted to steal , is punished by a severe kick from a horse . A bad boy , who lied , and thereby exposed a favorite dog to the imminent peril of a whipping , is himself whipped and sent supperless to bed ; but his honest brother , who told the truth , has the dog given to him as a recompense for his veracity . And , generally , the retributive justice of the ancient dame , who lived in a shoe , with a larger family than she could well manage , seems to have served as a model for no small portion of moral stories for the nursery . But let us come to works intended for children of a larger growth . The same principle is still acted upon by novelists , and approved by moral sages . A novel is generally said to have a moral or immoral effect , according as virtue and vice are recompensed with the good or evil things of this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // that this is always wrong . Many virtues naturally lead to worldly prosperity . Thus he , who would set forth the claims of frugality , will but poorly succeed in his undertaking , should he leave his frugal hero in the arms of want . Frugality is a virtue of this world , and , unless it receive its reward here , it must go unrecompensed . Besides , it is just as natural , that frugality should lead to riches , and that ostentatious extravagance should lead to poverty , as that any cause should produce its legitimate effect . But when benevolence , or a spirit of self-sacrifice , meets with worldly success , we see , at once , that the result is purely accidental ; and if , in a work of fiction , the personages distinguished for these qualities should be thus rewarded , it is wholly by an act of gratuitous kindness on the part of the author . There is no more connexion between the conduct and the reward , Ahan between Noah 's ark and St. Paul 's shipwreck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties , will be not only vain and nugatory , . but positively injurious . In the novel called " Discipline , " the misfortunes of the parties concerned are the natural consequences of their conduct ; and so far the moral is perfect . But when the heroine , with a spirit broken and humbled by affliction , flees to religion as to the only sanctuary that is left , and at length is rewarded for her piety , by the consummation of her earthly wishes , the natural succession of cause and effect is disregarded , and the high claims of religious hope and comfort are degraded . Yet , had she been left to struggle with adversity through life , with no other reward than that mental peace which only a high consciousness of honorable exertion , united with a strong religious faith , can give , most of those , who sit in judgeinent upon such matters , would have been dissatisfied . Paul Clifford is an immoral novel . Why ? Because the hero , notwithstanding his many crimes , is finally rewarded with the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine tenths of the critics , who condemn the work . And in truth his exploits are crowned with a more prosperous issue than gentlemen of the profession are generally blessed with . He attains , if not to a more elevated , at least to a more enviable , station than robbers generally reach . But who does not see that this result is compatible neither with the laws of society , nor with the order of nature ? The fault is not , that crime is rewarded with great prosperity , but that the recompense is altogether arbitrary and unnatural ; and the fact that it is thus arbitrary and unnatural , will prevent any person , who does not more richly deserve a strait jacket than a halter , from following the example through hope of obtaining the reward . The enormity of the crime , and the utter disregard for its consequences , are such , that no rational creature can be misled by them . The cause of good principles suffers far less from attempts to lead crime through the high-ways of worldly greatness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than from attempts to disguise virtue under a garb bedizened with mundane ornaments that she despises , while she is holding out to her followers temporal rewards , which she never covets and seldom obtains . Her own native beauties are concealed by every attempt to trick them out or set them off with foreign splendors ; and her great but unpretending premiums lose their dignity and attraction , when hid beneath a cloud of earthly pretensions . Far better is it to pursue the course which is pointed out in the // world of God 's providence , where the good and the bad , so far as out . ward prosperity is concerned , are placed on equal terms . If virtue were rewarded here by the immediate gifts of fortune , worldly men would be virtuous from self-interest ; and , though honesty is the best policy , it has been well said , that he , who is honest because it is the best policy , is little better than a knave . We would not , therefore , change the order of nature ; still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction . The fraud must sooner or later be detected . The young enthusiast , whose notions of life are drawn from moral novels , comes into the world , and finds that fortune , in the actual distribution of her gifts , is not so favorable to virtue as he had supposed . He there , at least sometimes , sees virtue clothed in rags , while vice fitters in brocade ; and , as the books he has read teach him to look no farther than to l ) resent and apparent success , his confidence is shaken . The good principles , which have been established in his mind on this false basis , can not bear up against the stormy temptations which assail them . But the experienced man , who reads these works , at once detects the fallacy of such representations . Of course , they have no good effect upon him . But there is an evil influence . As the strenuous advocates of virtue make such an outcry when it is not rewarded in this way , and are so perfectly satisfied when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose morals are of a doubtful character , is , that virtue has no higher rewards to offi*r , no higher claims to advance . In belief they may not confess this even to their own hearts ; but it imperceptibly creeps into their practical opinions , and acts upon their conduct . rrllns in novels  --  and especially in the most moral-there is quite too much importance attached to wealth and fame-mere worldly splendor and opulence . But if virtue is to be followed for such a recompense , why is vice to be rejected when it offers the same or greater advantages ? Better that no reward were offered , than that our understandings should be insulted by the appearance of a premium , which is seldom paid , or our eyes turned aside from the really great reward which a higher authority has promised , to gaze upon the tinsel baubles , by which inexperienced children and weak-sighted men are too often dazzled , blinded , and deceived . Virtue loves not such trumpery . She has no desire to be tricked out with such finery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat men into a love of her beauties , or to attract men by favors , which vice equally confers . The moral novelist should proceed on other grounds . lie should permit fortune to remain as she is , and indiscriminately heap her favors on the good and bad . He should take a higher stand and show the power and claims of virtue to be great ,  --  not because the world honors it , hut in despite of the world . Look to the records of our race . Upon what virtuous characters does the mind dwell with the greatest pleasure and devotion ? Upon those who enjoyed the goods of this life ? Are they the men , who have done most to kindle in our hearts the flame of holy zeal , to fill our souls with the admiration of what is good and great ? Are they the men , upon whose lives we love to dwell , whose actions we delight to contemplate , from whose works , as shown in the pages of history , we come away with minds purified , principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the sufferer , the sufferin* patriot , the // suffering advocate of truth , the suffering foe to corruption , the suffering supporter of a falling state , the suffering martyr , whose example acts most powerfully upon our souls . From the flames of suffering martyrdom a voice speaks louder than from the highest throne of earthly grandeur . From the scaffold of suffering virtue comes forth a stream , which does more to purify our nature than all the costly ablutions of pontifical pride . The grave can not hold a martyred saint . He , who has manfully withstood the progress of error ,  --  who , in the face of a corrupt world and at the cost of worldly hopes , has maintained his integrity ,  --  he , who , single handed and alone , has resisted an evil and perverse generation , who , relying upon his internal- consciousness of right , sets the world and the world 's proud lords at defiance , and who falls , slain , but not conquered , in the unequal strife , can not , . when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust . He lives in his actions , he lives in his example Every crucified saint bursts the tomb in which vain man had thought to confine him forever . Every crucified saint bursts the ton'b where his body is laid , and talks by the way with his dejected disciples , whose hearts burn within them , as he expounds the doctrine of eternal truth . His life and character never act so power fully in the reformation of the world , as when tried by affliction , consecrated by suffering , sanctifled2 by death . The power of virtue and the strength of principle can not be known unless put to the severest test . Zeal in a prosperous cause , with no difficulties to try its sincerity , is , at best , of doubtful temper. - The noblest principles of our nature can be called forth only by trial . The scholar , in the midst of affluence , urged by every incentive to study , with all the " appliances and means " of knowledge put into his hands , is not held up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love of knowledge  --  a power able to bear down all opposition , and not merely to give new lustre t'o the comforts , conveniences , and refinements of social life  --  but to supply their place , to raise the soul to such heights that it looks down with pity on them all . Who is not moved by the sublime extravagance of the poor , neglected , persecuted astronomer , who , after the greatest discovery of his age , knowing that those who were to reap the fruit of his labors would only scoff and hoot at the work and its author , thus announces the discovery to a friend ! " The die is cast , the work is done . Jfyou approve , I rejoice ; if not , I can bear it . The work is done ; to be read ' by this century or the next , I care not which ; for if the Almighty has waited six thousand years for an observer , I can afford to wait a century for a reader . " Who ' does not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it manifested in the life of Milton , the inflexible champion of truth , though his party was overcome , and himself in misfortune and disgrace , " in darkness and with dangers compassed round , and solitude ? " Who does not feel his respect for the species raised , when he witnesses the magnanimity with which this great poet announces his determination , at whatever cost , to " live and die an honest man , " and with which he consoles himself for the loss of sight , the severest of depfivations ! ' The consciousness of having done his duty was to him reward , support , consolation enough ; and where is its power more strikingly displayed , except in the lives of others , who may have fallen victims to the performance-of duty ? // Such are the feelings excited by the temporal misfortunes of the good , as we view them in history . The same laws operate in fiction . The novelist should act upon them . His hero should come forth , not to be the favorite of fortune , either at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness be arrayed against him . Let his projects fail ,  - -  his labors prove unavailing . Let friends forsake , and fortune oppose him . Let him stand alone , if you please , friendless and homeless , an outcast from society , a by-word among men . Let him , so far as may be consistent with the nature of things , wander , a fugitive and vagabond opon the face of the earth . It matters not . He has that within , which the world can not take away ,  --  a principle which grows brighter and stronger , more sacred , and more commanding , as evils from abroad assail him . The fire within that lovely , desert citadel , grows more bright and enchanting ; there is something almost divine in its light and warmth , and purity , and calmness , as it burns in solitude , communing with no kindred beams , while darkness is without , and the fierce and merciless storm is raging against it . There is a sublimity in the sufferings of a good man , in his calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortitude ; in his meekness and firmness , his humility and confidence , in the quiet simplicity and deep-toned energy of his thoughts ; there is a sublimity , which far more commands admiration and respect , which far more elevates and sanctifies the soul , than all the pomp and circumstance , that the world can lend . Why , then , should we be dissatisfied , and believe that the moral tendency of a fictitious work is bad , because golden mitres are not showered down upon the most deserving ? So , too , with the bad . Our fleavenly Father permits his sun to shine upon the just and unjust . Why should the novelist do otherwise ? Let his bad men prosper , as bad men really do prosper in society . We need not fear that our moral sense will be corrupted thereby . Let his bad men receive the highest honors . Let them abound in fortune . Let them abound , so far as bad men can abound , in friends . Let the cunning knave succeed in his diabolical projects ; let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let him build high his palace , and walk proudly among his fellow-men . It is nothing . Virtue suffers not , lie has a hell within himself and if that be laid open , and its hideous glare displayed , few will envy his prosperity . Of what consequence is it , whether the burning mount be placed amid the freezing storms of Iceland , in the tropical clime , or beneath the pure Italian sky , so long as it has in its own bosom those fires that never rest ; so long as its vitals are racked and torn by those unceasing convulsions , of whose rage the deep and angry mutterings , the frightful gleams , and dreadful throes , witnessed from abroad , are but feeble manifestations ? Let Satan burst from his prison-house , visit Paradise , sit in its shade , and feel its refreshing breeze . Let him accomplish his fiendish project , and ruin the inhabitants of that peaceful abode , and then let him go back to his followers and proclaim his triumph . Who envies , who would imitate him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keener anguish , if , in his happiest state , he gives utterance to thoughts like these Ah me , they little know Under what torture inwardly I groan , // While they adore me on the throne of hell .

In his own bosom is a never-ceasing fire ; these are tortures which no outward prosperity , no power , nor wealth , nor fame , can alleviate . The cool breezes of Paradise but fan and aggravate this ever-raging fire . These , we confess , are extreme cases , and such as seldom occur . It will not do for novelists to be constantly dealing with angels or demons . Their intercourse with the worlds above and below is not such that they can call out their inhabitants at pleasure ; and were it so , we , the readers , are so linked to earth , and have so few sympathies in common with preternatural agents , that their company soon becomes tiresome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bliss and wo , of absolute perfection and total wickedness . Our orb , at least in a moral sense , is hung midway tween heaven and hell . We are beings of a mixed nature ; flesh and spirit , strength and weakness , vice and virtue , knowledge and ignorance , hold divided empire over us . He , therefore , who would propose examples for our warning or encouragement , must deal with beings of a mixed nature like ourselves . His b*st men must be subject to part of our infirmities , and his wicked men must participate with us in the enjoyment of some of the higher faculties and purer desires . The exhibition , whether of vice or virtue , of weakness or of strength , can not have all the metaphysical distinctness of the sketch that we have drawn . Opposite qualities must be blended together ; they can not stand out with the prominence of abstract conceptions . Still , some characters are more decidedly virtuous or vicious than - others . Novels have been written with the express design of embodying particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the world is naturally connected with the development , conduct , or reward of these qualities , so far let it be connected with them . This is not what we complain of . The scene is laid on earth ; the actors are inhabitants of earth ; they are influenced by earthly considerations ; they are conversant with earthly affairs . Of this we complain not . But we do complain , that this earth engages too much of their attention ; that yirtues , which should ally man to heaven , are made to lose their high character , by being too dependent upon earthly rewards ; while those rewards of a loftier nature , which give power to religion , and dignity to virtue , and which are the invariable attendants of right actions , pure motives , and holy principles , are thrown into the shade , and lose their importance . We are creatures of sense ; but it is the duty of the moral writer , in whatever department , to raise us above its tyranny , and not to coax us into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  by an appeal to our animal propensities . We are selfish beings ; but it is the duty of the moral writer to draw us away from self by teaching us to act from more generous principles . We are formed for heaven ; but the sickly vapors of the earth on which we dwell , raised to a momentary elevation and splendor , by the gusts of passion , or prejudice , or habit , obscure the heavenly vision , shut out the brilliant lights , and dazzle our childish fancy with their counterfeit attractions . It is the duty of // the moral writer to free the atmosphere from these deceitful visions , and not to interpose yet thicker clouds between us and heaven . It is not our custom to set a high value upon the moral influence of any single work of fiction , whether for good or for evil . Where the press is loaded , and bookstores crowded with new books , fortunate indeed must that author be , who , by one or by many works , can mould the public mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and none more than fictitious works , have a powerful influence upon the feelings and character of the community ; if their general spirit is sensual or worldly , as we fear it is , they will do much to fix upon us more firmly the fetters of sense and worldliness ; while , if they breathe a high*toned spirit of virtue and religion , as some do , they can not but help to draw our thoughts from inferior objects , and fix them upon lofty principles and attainments . But it is very easy for the most stupid imagination to re*vard uncommon desert with riches , power or glory , to let the indifferently honest pass safely through their mortal pilgrimage , or to heap upon the wicked any amount of earthly misfortune ; while none but a master 's hand can paint the various happy emotions that swell a good man 's heart , and trace , in their own beautiful colors , the inward satisfaction and enjoyment that proceed from virtuous conduct ; or fix , in lasting pictures , all the fluctuating shades of uneasiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will follow the numberless degrees of guilt and crime , however great their outward splendor and prosperity . We can not close these remarks without adding our humble testimony to the moral character of the great man , who has , more than any other , fixed his impress upon the age . Is it extravagance to pronounce him without comparison the greatest moral novelist that ever lived ? He despises not the gifts of fortune , or the good things of this life , but receives them as the Christian receives every blessing , which comes from his heavenly Father , with cheerfulness and gratitude . He has none of that affected contempt for worldly honors and enjoyments , which bears no doubtful indication of the disappointed *vorldling , who is cast down but not humbled by misfortune . He would not , like Young , convert this wide and beautiful world into a vast funeral pile , upon which mortified affections , disappointed hopes , uneasiness , discontent , and gloom , are placed , that the - smoke of their incense may ascend in one dismal cloud as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delights in all the gifts of Providence . He is equally removed from that old romantic folly , which threw out of sight the substantial *-oods of life , and from that modern wisdom , which acts as if in this life only we had hope . He goes upon the very rational ground , that men must eat , in spite both of sentiment and virtue , but that eating is not the great end of our being . He deals out riches and honors , - not according to moral desert , nor in opposition  --  to moral desert , but according to the laws which usually regulate - their distribution among men . The good may receive them , but not as rewards for their goodness ; the bad may be robbed of them , but not as a retribution - for- their vices or their crimes . What has been happily called poetical justice ,  --  for it exists nowhere but in fiction-is often violated i-n his works ; but our moral feelings are never outraged . Flora  --  to us the most fascinating of his heroines - for keroine we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtuous , the intelligent , and the lovely , disappointed in her fondest dreams , robbed by the executioner of her dearest friend , pale and emaciated with anxiety , privation , and grief , resigns her only ornament of value  --  a princess gave it her  --  and seeks retreat in a convent of nuns . We weep over her afflictions , but not as without hope . We know that she carries with her , to that obscure retreat , a soul , which rests on heaven , which can not fail even iii this world to make her happy in acts of kindness and devotion , and which is sure of a place in a brighter mansion beyond the skies . Why need we name The Heart of Mid-Lothian , the most eloquent moral tale that ever was written ? It abounds in every species of excellence . What passage in the sermons of Massillon before the court of France , so moving as the appeal of the simple Scotch girl to her queen ? " Alas ! it is not when we sleep soft and wake merrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our hearts are waxed light within us then , and we are for righting our am wrangs , and fighting our am battles . But when . the hour of trouble comes to the mind or to the body  --  and seldom may it visit your Leddyship  --  and when the hour of death comes , that comes to high and low-lang and late may it be yours-O , my Leddy , then it is na what we hae dune for ourselis , but what we hae dime for others , that we think on maist pleasantly . " The whole conduct of this story , - its general texture , the filling up of the outlines , the actions , speeches , and fortunes , of the various characters , together with the reflections which the author makes in his own person-afford a perfect exemplification of the principles , which we would lay down for the conduct of a moral tale . Every where we see the superiority of the soul over external circumstances . Vice in all its shades , from the deep guilt of a settled villain , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravings of a distempered mind to the cold-blooded calculations of confirmed fraud , is truly depicted , and its influence upon the feelings portrayed . The misery* which invariably follows in its train , is neither modified nor concealed by external prosperity or adversity . Virtue too is exhibited in a great variety of forms , from the benevolent Argyle and his delightful circle , to the inflexible presbyterian , David Deans , and the honest , but not altogether unprosaic Reuben Butler , and his matchless wife ; and every xhere , according to its degree and form , it carries something of that peace which springs only from a consciousness of right action and motive . The simple , erring , Effie is married to a lord , and l ) laced in a state which has dazzled many a wiser body than herself ; but so skillfully is the story conducted , that no one can envy the feverish unrest that waits upon her steps . Amid all the blandishments of fortune , the aching heart is seen , and though , in the eyes of foolish men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness she sinks infinitely below , and we almost wonder that Jeanie should have given way to even a momentary pique of jealousy ; which , however , is instantly subdued by the judicious question : " Surely I am no sic a fule as to be angry that Effie s a braw lady , while I am only a minister 's wife ? " Such a thought would never occur to the reader . The " braw lady " is to him but an object of compassion ; and for her sake he rejoices , when she leaves the fashionable world to pass the remainder of her life in all the formal observances , vigils , and austerities of the Catholic faith . For he can not but agree // with Butler , that " any religion , however imperfect , is better than scepticism , or the hurrying din of dissipation , which fills the ears of worldlings , until they care for none of these things . " We have dwelt thus long upon this tale , not because we had any thing new to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks we had made . The great moral excellence of Scott , as a novelist , consists in his making the rewards of vice and virtue independent of the world . In this he is unequaled as a writer of fiction ; and indeed we know not a divine or a metaphysician , who excels him . Inferior writers are dependent upon the distinctions of life : they are obliged , in support of virtue , to appeal to the prejudices of men , and to strip vice of all worldly prosperity , in order to show its misery and helplessness . But he would as soon strip the tortoise of his shell to prove that it is not a man , as rob vice of its outward pomp that he might prove its inability to confer happiness . WhIle under the influence of his pen , not only painted hypocrites , but transgressors of every kind , are seen through the disguise they wear . No temporal splendor blinds us to theirmisery. rrhe most fortunate among them are objects more of pity than of anger or envy ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are never forsaken by the highest of enjoyments . Many and many are the thanks that we owe to this great man for the lessons he has taught us in virtue and religion . The good , which he has in this way done , will , we trust and believe , help to fill *up the measure of his enjoyment , when his fame among men , nay , when man himself , shall have vanished , like a thin cloud , from the earth .
