PREFACE . During the wars waged by the Western Roman Empire against Persia , the Emperor Valerian , after being defeated by Sapor , King of Persia , was taken prisoner , by perfidious means , and treated with refined cruelty :  --  made to serve as the King 's footstool , exposed to popular outrage , kept in captivity till his death , flayed alive , and salted , so as to expire in excruciating torments ; his skin then tanned , painted , and nailed to a palace wall . Julian the apostate , some time afterwards , undertook his celebrated expedition against Persia ; having with him , as commander of the Roman cavalry , Hormisdas , a Persian prince , who had deserted his country , and been promoted by Constantine , the uncle of Julian . An attempt , by Persian spies , on the fidelity of Hormisdas , failed : but Julian abandoned the siege of Ctesiphon , the Persian capital , burned his large fleet , and marched his army to the interior , where they were continually harassed and reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortally wounded by an arrow . Apprized that speedy dissolution would ensue , he drew the arrow from his side , and expired in the arms of victory , philosophizing on death and fame . The army immediately proffered the Roman Empire to Sallust , a duke and prfect of Gaul , and an eminent member of the Christian sect , then establishing itself throughout the Roman possessions  --  who at once declined it ; whereupon the soldiers proclaimed Jovian Emperor . He commanded the imperial guard , and was a dissolute soldier , whose only service consisted in leading the remnant of the army home ; where he soon died , and was succeeded as Emperor by Valentine , commander of the Targeteers in Julian 's army . To these historical characters and events , the fictitious additions of Zopyrus , Esther , Sophia , Ishmael , Thersites , and Cheops , have been made , for the composition of a dramatic poem , by a very young essayist ; who , discarding lovers and villains , attempted to develop ambition , patriotism , pride , remorse , and selfishness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess a moral always results in retributive justice . History , teaching by examples , affords a sufficient lesson in the contrast of Julian 's pagan virtues with the Christian merits of Sallust . The name and character of Zopyrus are assumed from the prince whose adventures at the siege of Babylon are narrated in the 143d  --  149th chapters of the third book of Herodotus , who mutilated himself by cutting off his nose and ears , clipping his hair , and scourging his body ; and thus disfigured , feigned to desert from Darius 's army to the Babylonians . Having gained their confidence , by a system of perfidy , he was promoted to the command of their army , and betrayed the city to the Persians . Instead of introducing supernatural beings , Ishmael and Cheops are intended to represent the Arabian and the African characters as really existing in the sorcerers and astrologers of those nations . Ishmael , the dwarf , is an Arab of the desert , as this unalterable race was found lately by Volney ; smaller , leaner , and darker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bellies shrunk to their backs , not more than five feet high , living to a great age , on the smallest quantity of the poorest food . Cheops , on the contrary , is a robust and imposing negro , in the fantastic dress of Egyptian astrologers . The doctrine of the general resurrection , and a future state of rewards and punishments , existed among the Arabs from time immemorial ; whose temperance , learning , longevity , and permanence of character , imparted to them appearances of superhuman knowledge and power . The Persians , says Herodotus , have neither statues , temples , nor altars ; the use of which they censure as impious , not believing that the gods partake of our human nature . Their custom is to offer , on the summits of the highest mountains , sacrifices to the expanse of the firmament . They also adore the sun , the moon , the earth , fire , water , and the winds . In all their prayers , their sovereign and nation must be comprehended . Their sacrifices are always attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent horsemen and archers , profound admirers of martial courage , and abominators of falsehood . The scene is laid among the delightful natural beauties and the magnificent structures and artificial embellishments of the Persian metropolis , when it was the admiration of the world . The costumes of the Persians , as described by Xenophon and Herodotus , were , like their climate and dwellings , splendid with ornaments ; painted faces , false hair , necklaces , rings , bracelets , and girdles , being worn with their tiaras , tunics , and trowsers ; at least vieing with , if not eclipsing , the graceful and elegant equipments of Roman warriors . Herodotus gives the following minute account of a Babylonian gentleman 's dress : Two vests , one of linen , which falls to the feet , another over this made of wool  --  a white sash connecting the whole . The fashion of their shoes peculiar , but resembling those of the Thebans . They wear their hair long , covered with a turban , and are lavish in the use of perfumes . Each person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is carved like an apple , a rose , a lily , an eagle , or some other figure  --  for it is unlawful to have a cane without a device . CHARACTERS . Julian .

But , see ! the Emperor , and at his orisons : For ever fighting , writing , slaying , praying , The pride of soldiers , sciolists , and alehymists , The flower of Rome and blight of Christendom ZOPYRUS .

Our crime is that we are Hormisdas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we escaped When flight or death was all the option left , To cast ourselves on Roman clemency , As erst our father did , when he withdrew From wrongs at home to foreign vindication . He fled before us , and has raised a name  --  With nought to found it but a trusty sword  --  Sole remnant of a princely appanage  --  Grateful to Rome , and hateful to his country . Give me with him to be revenged : I long To brand my native land with malediction , To raze its palaces , warray its provinces , To lay it waste with havoc , fire , and sword , Till bloodshot tears and sighs of servitude Prevail where peace and plenty used to reign None , Sire , have felt our father 's dire advent , Like his discarded and devoted offspring ; None like the son of such a parent burn To emulate him in exploits of vengeance .

Jovian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first who led to victory , Bareheaded , and on foot , as is his wont  --  The Emperor led the column , sword in hand , While crags of rock , and fiery missiles poured In cataracts upon the desperate onset . SALLUST . Sallust But who sustained him ? ' T was the Christian troops ; Silent and steadfast as the march of death , Strewing their way with hecatombs of slain , Their valour conquered every obstacle ; And now their brave survivers are insulted By heathenish and impious superstition . JOVIAN . Jovian Does it become your age or station , duke , To sow dissension in the Roman camp  --  Discord , the worst of evils , worse than war  --  By idle and intractable disputes Of creeds and worship ? What are they to men Whose calling is to die in arms , unblessed , Reckless of all but discipline and victory . SALLUST .

Sophia By that which I was taught to dread  --  by LOVE . The lesson of my life has been , beware of it As sit for only humble spheres , not palaces ; For artisans and cottagers , the vulgar ; But unbecoming those born to ambition , The bonds of states in politic alliance . Thus schooled , from sequestration I was brought Abrupt into the camp of Rome 's fair chiefs . I was to be the Emperor 's bride , they thought ; But who can regulate the ways of love ? From the first moment that Count Jovian flashed In all his peerless manhood on my sight ,  --  My vanquisher , my saviour , and my wooer ,  --  Our hearts embraced , and we have sworn to  --  HORMISDAS . Hormisdas And hast thou told him of thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ; and he has sworn his troth . They told us that the Romans are barbarians , Their skies for ever gloomy , and their sun Cold as the moon shines on our auburn maids . But , oh , how false ; no Persian prince can burn With warmer heart than animates Count Jovian . HORMISDAS Hormisdas ( aside ) . The victim of that selfish profligate , Who thus controls our destiny : so , then , Bitter first fruit of hesitation . But , I will no longer pause .  --  Come , Zopyrus , Sprung from my loins accursed , come forth , my son , Fate calls us , and we must abide the call . Enter Zopyrus . ZOPYRUS .

Zopyrus Lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dying a martyr in my country 's cause . My blood shall be the seed of thousands more , Sworn as I swear to lay the aggressor low , Or perish in the attempt  --  inform thy master  --  To scatter disaffection through his ranks , Decoy his legions into dark defiles , With pestilence and famine aiding us , To waste and harass them till none remains Vultures suspended on the tainted breeze , And gaunt hynas howling from their lairs To banquet on their carcasses unburied .

Yes , for t is well nigh gone : And well got , too ; ransomed from slavery , The galleys , and a malefactor 's death : In the arena as a gladiator , I saw thee make thy fortune sword in hand .

Cheops Sorcery and magic 's subtlest arts Shall be explored in all their parts To ascertain and to propitiate fate , And fix , puissant Emperor , your date : When dogstar dews by moonlight glisten , And myriads of glowworms listen , The hieroglyphs of Heaven shall be scanned , And its interminable arches spanned , To work the problems of astrology , And draw its corollarics from on high . JULIAN . Julian Long since , when I was resident in Gaul , A druid , deeply skilled in divination , Predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sped by royal arm , Should pierce me in the arms of victory  --  My death requited by the slayer slain . I can not from such consummation shrink , But court and thank the glorious providence . Yet , if thy arts can raise or rend the veil , And bring the doubtful future full in view  --  CHEOPS . Cheops Illustrious potentate depend upon me ; Nothing lies hid from my astrology . JULIAN . Julian I would fain read the register of death . Go , therefore , to thy incantations , sage , Conjure the powers of darkness , and extract The revelation :  --  Let me know my fate . CHEOPS . Cheops Your slave , imperial Sire , will circumvent The circles of mysterious enchantment , Reckon the stars that light the firmament : Their heavenly essences will analyze , And earth 's malignant genius exorcise , Good auspices to gather for his master , And save him from all peril of disaster .

Prfect , since first we met upon the Seine , Your counsels oft have been my guide . Say now What doth the Emperor of Rome behoove In this conjuncture ? Speak with all thy frankness . SALLUST . Sallust Most gracious sovereign , I am old enough To bear in vivid memory that noon When your illustrious uncle , Constantine , Of British Helen the inspired son , Fresh from Verona and from Turin 's fields , O'erthrew Maxentius near the walls of Rome , Contending for the empire of the world . Heading our nimble cavalry of Gaul , Constantine , foremost in the rushing charge , Routed the ponderous cuirassiers of Italy , And Guards Prtorian seldom seen in flight ; Then as they fled , beneath the Milvian bridge Stifled by thousands in the city 's sight  --  The hosts of infidelity exterminated . Your majesty is swayed by auguries :  --  Oh ! had you seen the supernatural sign Which in the Heavens eclipsed the noonday sun , The sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The signal of salvation to mankind , Of charity , humility , the sign , Virtues till then unheard of , Heaven-born , Unknown to Greece and unconceived by Rome , The sign of peace on earth , good will to man , The standard of the outcast Labarum Which your immortal predecessor took And all his army graved upon their arms At that for ever memorable hour  --  His bright example I need hardly plead When I advise a Roman Emperor To whom almost the world pays tribute , Sire , Upon whose realms the sun for ever shines  --  To sheathe the sword of conquest , and to bless Mankind with respite from atrocious war ; To cultivate the nobler arts of peace , Arts which Aurelian and the Antonines Have raised above the ruffian fame of bloodshed . JULIAN . Julian Thus far on Alexander 's zodiac To march triumphant  --  Now to retrograde ! And hybernate in dull pursuits of peace ; Forego the fiery stimulus of war , Rapt'rous emotions and absorbing hopes , Battle 's intoxication , glorious death  --  Instead of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic being And die at last excruciate by disease :  --  Jovian , I must appeal to you  --  but flatter not . JOVIAN . Jovian Camp-born and bred , I 'm but a soldier , Sire , War both my calling and amusement too ; And as a nobleman should be am ignorant Of every thing that is not military : Yet for my gracious sovereign 's creed I feel The reverence that becomes a faithful subject , If then your deities are adverse , Sire , Can you not leave the capital behind And lead your army to the fertile south Whither the Macedonian marched before ? Hyrcania stretches out her limbs supine , And spicy India blooms o'er boundless plains . The solstice threatens pestilence , which soon Will bar your entrance on those latitudes . SALLUST Sallust ( aside . ) The parasite !  --  ( to Julian )  --  Leave Ctesiphon behind ! To separate us from our reinforcements ? JOVIAN . Jovian Leave it to starve . SALLUST . Sallust Forsake our fleet too ! JOVIAN . Jovian Burn it . SALLUST . Sallust What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian A Roman Emperor never must retreat ; Onward for ever , is his countersign , Subsisting and recruited from his conquests . What say you Valentine ? VALENTINE . Valentine Excuse me , Sire , If my opinion differs from you all ; I neither would retreat nor turn aside , But scale those bulwarks or be buried under them . ' T is now too late to be deterred by omens , Though wrote in lightning and proclaimed by thunder . Give but your order for the storm to night , Let all the elements of warfare loose , And mount and regulate the onslaught , Sire , Our eagles , with their plumage all unfurled , Shall win their way resistless into Ctesiphon . What are all portents when the trumpet sounds ? What is all counsel to the shout of battle ? Your troops no sign but your commanding voice  --  Calm on a fiery charger , need  --  but forward  --  Christians and Pagans from all realms conscribed , Italians , Germans , Greeks , and Gauls , one mass Invincible of disciplined array , Banded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen Emperor  --  Will rush to conflict , and despite of fate Sweeping triumphant where your falchion points , Will captivate success and conquer portents . Enter Hormisdas , Zopyrus , Sophia , and Ishmael . JULIAN . Julian Thrice welcome , Prince , our cynosure , who bring Your satellites to guide our march benighted . Fortune has thwarted us ; distracted counsels Superadd their ominous perplexity . The Gods themselves admonish to spare Ctesiphon . Shall we then burn our fleet and seek the south ? HORMISDAS Hormisdas ( aside ) . Is there not respite in that question ? Jovian Has not denounced us , or the Emperor Would not ask counsel  --  Spy , thou art reprieved . JULIAN . Julian Conquest the flamens found , but drenched in blood  --  The stoutest champions of the Roman host Strewed like autumnal foliage on the ground , Discord and slaughter , rout and retrograde , Vexing the victor vanquished in his turn .

Hormisdas Oh ! let me kneel , and bathe your hand with tears Of joy , that gush from parent 's gratitude . Thou , too , dear son , thou wilt acknowledge this , With all the fervent thanks of youthful heart . ISHMAEL Ishmael ( aside ) . The hour of retribution is not come For prostrate Persia to demolish Rome . JULIAN . Julian Rise , Prince , I ask not thanks , but services : Teach me the way to Persia 's fastnesses  --  ZOPYRUS . Zopyrus Scourge of my country , take thy lesson , death ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zopyrus attempts to assassinate Julian , but is prevented by Hormisdas , who wrests the dagger from Zopyrus . ) HORMISDAS . H ormisdas Traitor and parricide !

Strike , slaves , I dare you ; butcher me at once , Or send me forth to public execution : Racked and dismembered , with my latest gasp I will defy and curse the power of Rome . JOVIAN . Jovian Demoniac murderer ! VALENTINE . Valentine Thus take thy doom ! ( Jovian and Valentine rush together on Zopyrus . Hormisdas interposes . ) HORMISDAS .

JULIAN . Julian To your protection I commit them , Sallust : Let no licentious indignation harm , But send them safe escorted from our camp . Counts Jovian and Valentine , attend me .

Sophia My father , ah , my father ! Nay , dear brother , Is there no comfort for him , no relief ? ZOPYRUS . Zopyrus None that I care of . I am as a stone , Impenetrable to all filial love ; Oppression has deprived me of a father , And left me none to care for but my country . HORMISDAS . Hormisdas Farewell , Sophia ! SOPHIA .

The deep foundations of this caverned hill , Crowned by dilapidated palaces Which shadow forth my country 's fallen state  --  Those caverns comprehend the catacombs Of Persia 's countless catalogue of kings ; An Eastern sepulchre , vast and mysterious : A subterranean passage from the crypt Leads underneath the river to the city , Elaborated in those ancient days , Whose marvellous works transcend our modern means . That burial-place and avenue are known Alone to princes and their confidants  --  With sacred rites and awful oaths divulged ; A solemn secret , kept from age to age , The sanctuary of the royal race .

But where is your Egeria ? Where 's the Princess ? JOVIAN . Jovian Taught all the secret of your straights , I left her , And hastened to the rescue .

JULIAN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop and rally them ; Routed , dismayed , they threw their eagles down , Endeared and sanctified by all our battles , Which never saw a Roman eagle vailed  --  Whole cohorts , panic struck , confounded fled , Borne down by clouds of archers and of horse  --  Fled , and were slaughtered as they routed ran . The day was lost  --  but for a noble charge Which Sallust headed with the Christian troops . The Persian tumult , rampant with success , Was overthrown and driven from the field , By his resistless onset strewed with slain . Broken and beaten by him , they have gone : While , covered by his sure and steady wing , The guards were gathered from disgraceful flight . JULIAN . Julian Thanks , from the heart , my Gallilean friend  --  Thou art the frequent saviour of the State . SALLUST . Sallust How fares it with our gracious sovereign ? JULIAN . Julian Why , well : How should it fare but well ? Surrounded by the loyal brave , I lie Within the temple victory has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasures of a posthumous renown . Enter Valentine , with Soldiers . VALENTINE . Valentine Good tidings , Sire ! the victory is yours : Attacked in front by tribes of cavalry , In flank annoyed by troops of elephants , Our men , intimidated , yielded ground ; Defeat was imminent  --  had not the Prince  --  JULIAN . Julian The Prince , then , lives ? VALENTINE . Valentine Rome 's most intrepid champion  --  JULIAN . Julian Most grateful tidings ! Let me see him , quick : Time presses with me . VALENTINE . Valentine See , he comes , my lord . Enter Hormisdas , wounded . HORMISDAS . Hormisdas Victory ! Victory ! Great Emperor ! JULIAN . Julian Welcome , my faithful friend  --  come to my arms ! Rome shall acknowledge your fidelity With all the honours empires can bestow On constant patriots and faithful subjects . HORMISDAS . Hormisdas Yes , I am proud of this  --  ' t is my last boast : Just in the crisis on the army 's fate . Upon my peerless charger , breathing fire  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce Euroclydon subdues the waves , Destroying all resistance  --  I arrived , And plunged into the elements of battle . Wherever danger was , this falchion streamed Like forked lightning in the thick obscure , Till , by the bright example , Romans , roused From dastard fear 's unmanning influence , Did prodigies of valour on my countrymen  --  Slaughtered , discomfited , who fled before us . My gallant horse , pierced with a thousand wounds , Bowed his proud neck , till then in thunder clothed , And fell , as I shall fall , in foreign harness , True to his master to the last  --  to death . JULIAN . Julian Now 's the accepted time for me to die : And oh ! how glorious to expire a conqueror , Ere age or weakness , dagger or disease Inflict their ravages on poor mortality . Who is it that would cling to life ? I 've lived For fame , not pleasure ,  --  for renown , not ease .  --  Studying life 's noblest lesson  --  how to die , Earning its richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farewell  --  Companions of my toils and victories , adieu . Serene and brilliant , as autumnal sunset After a short but profitable day , I leave my radiance to adorn the world . ( Julian draws the arrow from his side , and dies . ) HORMISDAS . Hormisdas Not long before thy slave : To kingdoms born , By wounded pride  --  which who can bear ?  --  dislodged From my bright birthright 's orbit , and condemned Eccentrie honour 's errors to abide . I would have fallen in the thick of battle . But Cato 's noble Roman death be mine  --  Old Ishmael , do thine office , the last proof Of thy fidelity and mine . Farewell ! ( Ishmael , with averted countenance , holds Hormisdas 's , sword , who falls on it at Julian 's feet . Thou hast obeyed thy master 's last command , Whose wasted strength sufficed for suicide . Witness , ye Romans all , I die a Roman : Wherever native , and however wronged , Death puts the seal of constancy upon me . ( Dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With blood torn from the breast . And nurtures its young brood To treachery and blood . SOLDIERS . Soldiers Duke Sallust chosen Emperor  --  Shield him , shield ! ( The army spread their shields , and proceed to raise Sallust on them , as elected Emperor . ) SALLUST . Sallust No , soldiers : I decline the Roman Empire :  --  Life 's remnant I devote to higher duties . SOLDIERS . Soldiers None but a Gallilean for the purple ! SALLUST . Sallust Nay , comrades , I am fixed immoveably . I too have been enthusiast in war , And rioted in victory 's intoxication : But I have learned to shudder at the madness Which goads mankind to gild a barbarous strife , Appropriate only to a savage state , With the allurements of misguided glory . The seythe of time destroys enough . Man need not Usurp the attribute of his Creator , But rather live in peace and love on earth . The transient being of our pilgrimage . SOLDIERS . Soldiers Let us elect Count Jovian , then . Count Jovian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( The soldiers make the platform of their shields , and raise Jovian on it . ) JOVIAN . Jovian Unworthy as I am , yet to decline Were unbecoming as to court this honour . With deep humility I then submit To undertake the Empire you confer , Brave conquerors and suffragans of thrones : And my first act of sovereignty proclaims Peace , and the end of this severe campaign . SOLDIERS . Soldiers Peace ! no more war ! Huzza for Jovian 's reign ! Lead us to triumph , Csar ,  --  lead us home ! Huzza for Jovian , Emperor of Rome ! ( The scene closes , with Jovian uplifted , on the soldiers ' shields , Julian extended on the litter , Hormisdas at his feet . ) THE END
