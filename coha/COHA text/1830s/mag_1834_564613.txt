What a fine title for a writer , who publishes his lucubrations in the pages of a magazine . I remember , in college , there were certain subjects , which were considered as excellent themes for forensic discussion , because they opened a maze of diversity , and one might dispute on them forever , without coming to any conclusion . Something like this is a discourse on human life . It is a circle hazy and wide , embracing all subjects , from the pig-sty to the palace ; and I defy the reader , even if he should be goodnatured enough to honor this piece with his attention , and ' a very Yankee at guessing , to surmise what is to be the ' tenor of my remarks . 1 place my covered dish on the table ; and no man can tell , by the sight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metaphysics or the poultry ( not poetry ) ' of Romance and Love . Human Life ! Let me see ,  --  what did I understand by this term , when I was joyous and young ? Human life , to me , was then the gay vision of a bridegroom 's dream , on the morning before marriage . I saw before me a long succession of enterprises , efforts , successes , // honors , and enjoyments , which reason told me were possible , and a san irne temperament assured me would not fail . I was not such a fool as to suppose that the rainbow could exist without the cloud , or that the sky above me was never to he darkened by a tempest . In picturing future life , therefore , I always used to throw in some sombre shades ; but they were just such shades as suited the imagination ; just such shades as a painter puts into his picture , to show off , by contrast , the lighter and gayer parts . They were sorrows formed by fancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be visited by some imaginary goddess ; poor enough to bear my poverty with the spirit of a hero ; in disgrace enough always to come off with final honor ; and in danger enough at last to escape . I can truly say , I have been more disappointed in my pre-conceived misfortunes , than I ever have in the brightest pictures of fore-imagined bliss . I knew better how to draw the roses of life than its thorns ; I could picture the robin , with his red bosom and delightful song , better than the lizard or the toad . My sorrows , seen in perspective of the sun-light of the brightest morning that ever glittered over a human head ; my pre-conceived orrows , I say , have had about as much resemblance to real sorrow , as the bowls and daggers of a play-house have to real bowls and daggers . 0 ye visions of youthful bliss , ye dew-drops of the morning ! I complain not that ye have fled ; it is the common lot , and I ought to have suspected it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How unlike the tales which passion and imagination told ! The armor , which I had prepared , was the foil of the fencingschool , and not the spear for the battle . Human life is a science , which no theory can teach ; it must be infused gradually by experience . All young men think alike ; and they must think alike , because there is nothing within , to meet with the response of consciousness , the testimonies they may have from books or men . I remember a poor old man , who dwelt near my father 's , who used to go round with two shingles and a wheelbarrow , picking up the manure in the road for his land ; the whole patrimony of which consisted of three acres and an half . If he was asked by a kind neighbor after his health , his reply was , a long string of complaints ; a pain in his shoulders ; a pain across his kidneys ; a pain in his joints ; a pain every where , where there was a sensation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clods of the valley ; and his spirit , I hope , is in a world where all pains cease , and all tears are wiped away . But if I could be indulged with one half hour 's converse with his disembodied spirit , I would not fail to ask his pardon that I formerly heard his tale of suffering with so little sympathy or belief . I have since been taught by experience . Yes , reader ; and grim experience is the only thing that will ever teach you . We begin life in the spring ; and the orchard of one of the Brookline farmers looks not more diversely in a morning of May and January , than human life looks , seen in prospect and retrospect . We commence our voyage near the head of the river , near its healthful banks and grassy fountains : its trees shade us ; its birds soothe us ; its breezes fan our bounding pulses and burning cheeks ; and , as we glide softly and smoothly down its silent waters , we see no danger , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be thus ; // we are forewarned of the sterility and chillness , through which the current winds . But the silent waters , which are slipping beneath us , and bearing us along , are teaching the only effectual lesson . Why should the rareness of religious faith be taken as an argument of the non-existence of spiritual things ? We are as incredulous to the evils of old age , in the hey-day of youth , as we are to the pains of eternity , amid the intoxications of life . There are hours , however , when every thinkina man feels that external things can not satisfy him . The pursuit of business , the accumulation of wealth , leaves a void in his heart . The round of pleasure becomes tasteless and tiresome ; and the life of life dies before death . Almost every one has been compelled to complain , in some sad hour . " How weary , stale , flat , and unprofitable , Seem to me , all the uses of this world The sun loses its lustre ,  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the current of life to preserve it from putrefaction . There are two causes which produce this emptiness of heart-this vacancy of interest . The one is exhausted novelty ; and the other , the coming of sore disappointment . 0 ! in the sad hour when sorrow takes hold of a man ,  --  when privation sweeps away his enjoyments , and grief wrings his bosom-he looks round and finds the world converted into wilderness . He sees human life in its true colors ; the ordinary topics of moral declamation have a meaning , which he never saw or felt before . In the sadness and depth of his moral despondency , he looks round and asks- " Is there no refuge ? Is this the sum of existence ? Is there no cure for the *vounds of the heart ? Is there no medicine for man 's higher nature ? Is th*r* no balm in Gilead ? Is there no physician there 7 " Such a man is in a state at once favorable and unfavorable , to appreciate the gospel , and to receive its spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable state , inasmuch as he estimates the prospects of the world more correctly than he ever did before . Our neglect of religion , and indifference to its duties and claims , is not , perhaps , a primary emotion of the soul . We first love , inordinately , what God forbids ; and then are disturbed that he forbids it , and willingly withdraw our attention from a subject , which only serves to damp our pleasures and alarm our fears . The mind has often been compared to balances ; in one scale lie all the motives to a life of sense ; in the other , the motives to a life of piety . It would seem , then , that when you have destroyed or lightened all the weights in the sensual scale , the other must preponder* te , and the whole roan be consecrated to duty and to God . Religion consists , substantially , in two gre* t discoveries ; the one is the emptiness of temporal things ; the other is the satisfactory nature of things eternal and divine . Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why stop here ? Why ( does not the ruin show the need of the recovery ? Why should not the crown of thorns lead thee to the cross ? The grand evidence of the truth of the gospel consists in its adaptation to our condition and our wants . This is the only thing which carries conviction to the heart , after all the elaborate volumes which // have been written on the evidences of Christianity . Suppose a man to be walking on the side of a rivulet , on a summer 's day ; the water flows before him ; he is thirsty ; he stoops to drink ; his thirst is quenched-his spirits are refreshed , and he goes on his way rejoicing . There can be no doubt , in this case , that water quenches our thirst , or that , if there is a design in creation , that God made it for that end . All the metaphysics of the schools would not dissuade such a traveler from such a conclusion . Now , what water is to the fainting traveler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked by privation , and reason is purified by experience . It gives an end and an aim to all creation . It shows that man was not made in vain . It carries sweet conviction to a humble heart . There are some objects , which are seen best in the twilight ; fhe sombre hues of the evening are more refreshing to the eye , and set off these forms with more beauty and lovelier attraction . So there are hours of seriousness , when the evidences of religion strike the mind with deeper force . To a man recovered from the delusions , with which we all begin life , and viewing his present existence and future prospects in the light of reason and truth , the consolations of religion assume a new value . Once he slighted them ; for he felt , in the succession of his pleasures and occupations , he wanted them not . r* he hunger of his mind was satisfied by other food ; and he imputed to all men the gaiety and joy that danced in his own heart . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-lined pea-jacket , as he was going on a long voyage in various climates . As he sailed first through tropical regions , he was tempted to despise the maternal gift , and was about to part with his garment for some luxury which hit his fancy . But , as he advanced into polar regions , amidst storms and snows , he found the warm jacket not so contemptible a gift . Such are the consolations of religion ; no man knows their value until the hour has come in which he needs them . The objects of revelation are invisible ; they do not lie before us like a house or a tree ; they are seen only by an internal light . They are seen by faith ; and faith is produced , so far as human endeavors can produce it , by reflection . Now the man , awakened from the dreams of life , is disposed to reflect . He must pause and think . His disappointments turn his eye inward on himself , and forward beyond the grave , and upward to his God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day are over , to catch a glimpse of those objects and images , which are seen only by the mental eye . He is a meditative being , and is most busy when most alone . Perhaps it will here be thought , that I ought to mention the power which affliction has to humble the heart , and give it that child-like simplicity of temper by which the kingdom of heaven must always be received . But alas ! I doubt the fact ; our pride follows us even in our sackcloth and our ashes ; nor shall I impute that to affliction , which ever has been and ever must be the work of grace . But there are several things , which render the hour of affliction not so favorable to the reception ofreligion as might at first be supposed . Religion ( at least the religion of the gospel ) is not , as some suppose , a disease of the mind ; it is the choice of its most sound and // healthy state . It is true there are a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call religion. , by the murky operations of a disordered mind . When the disappointed girl leaves her parties of pleasure for a convent ; when a broken merchant joins the Shakers , or a lady of suspected reputation suddenly reforms and joins the church ; all these are but impressions made on the fancy , which leave the heart in the same rebellious state , in the sight of Heaven , which it was in before . Such persons , we may venture to predict , will soon repent of their repentance , and pass their lives under the forms of religion entirely destitute of its consolations or its power . So general and indefinite are our ideas of that religion , which it is man 's sole wisdom to know , that we mistake almost any shadow for the substance , and baptize , by the name of piety , the gloomiest de . pressions or the wildest caprices , which ever sported over the human breast . We include , in a general name , objects which have no other resemblance than their outward appearance ; and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piety as shadowy as were the images of our wandering pre.conceptions . One of the deceptions of a mind , pausing under a cloud , is the view which it takes of the grave . To most men it is a terror to die . Death is awful even in its privations . To say nothing of the world to which it introduces us , we know the social joys arid warm pursuits from which it will take us away . No more the sun these eyes shall view ; Earth o'er these limbs her dust shall strew , And life 's fantastic dream be o'er . But , to a heart depressed and wounded , the grave assumes a new appearance . Its shades dissipate ; a fantastic chasm is thrown around it ; and we conclude that , as all is empty and vain on this side of it , all must be serene and reposing beyond it . This state of mind has been pictured in the book of Job , and repe*ted by a thousand subsequent poets . There the wicked cease rosn troubling ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest together-they hear not the voice of the oppressor . The small and great are there ; and the servant is free from his master . H/lierefore is light given to him that is in misery , and ife unto the bitter in soul ; which long for death , and it cometh not , and dig for it more than for hid treasures , which rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave . We have the same state of mind described by Montgomery . There is a calm for those that weep , A rest for weary pilgrims found ; They softly lie and sweetly sleep Beneath the ground . The storm that sweeps the wintry sky No more disturbs their sweet repose , Than summer evening 's latest sigh , That shuts the rose . I long to lay my weary head , &amp;c . Such a state , no doubt , implies a great revolution in a man 's feelings .. Because he wishes for death , he supposes he is prepared for it ; because // he is tired of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression for repentance , and the slumbers of passion for the renovation of the heart . But let no one deceive himself . The change , accomplished by the Divine Spirit , in making a man a Christian , is very different . It reveals before him the majesty of a holy God , whom , by his sins , he has offended , and prostrates him in the dust before that spotless throne , before which the best of us might tremble to appear . It teaches him that , without the shedding of blood , there is no remission of sin . It infuses a new sorrow into the heart , other than that sorrow of the world , which worketh death . G.@@183068624.txt FOR about nineteen years , the thunders of the fortress and the ship of war have in a great measure ceased to roar . The martial steed has been ploughing the field. , or contributing his part to the interchange of business , thought , or amusement , through the widest empires , and the flower has been permitted to bloom , the lamb to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their songs and nurture their young , where thousands of swords and bayonets had for ages gleamed with horrible coruscations . There is little danger , however , of a morbid stagnation ; of a calm too great , too general , or too lasting . In proportion as international xvars have been suspended , civil rights have come into discussion . Disputes have arisen between sovereigns and subjects , and often between one citizen or district and another . These debates are sometimes comrnence ( l with moderation ; but it is in their very nature to accumulate more and more of apparent importance and consequent feeling ; to transform themselves into a kind of warfare , in which the desire of victory may absorb every nobler passion , if it does not end in blood and carnage . Apart from the corrupt propensities of mankind , two principles of our nature have a conspicuous influence on our political discussions and transactions-thirst for novelty , and attachment to custom or antiquity . These conflicting passions often set a man at variance with himself and , in the ten thousand different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society , they might be expected to produce many a storm of words. , if not of war . The God of our fathers , by his unremiting care , has preserved our favored land from those dissensions atid tumults , which have threatened many other countries with all the fearful uncertainties of revolution ; and yet our capitol , our confederate halls of legislation , and our forums of popular discussion , have often resounded with the voice of keen dispute , between the abettors and the opponents of change . For ten or twelve years , our civil constitutions have been frequent subjects of argument or declamation . Some of these debates may , it is probable , be regarded as conflicts between philanthropy or patrioLism on the // one side , and selfishness , corruption , or party spirit on the other . In most cases , however , a candid mind will impute them to the influence of passions and feelings , which are neither culpable nor commendable in any high degree ; and it may serve to mitigate the usual asperities of these discussions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfold those principles of human nature , from which they flow . Two of the most efficient principles in our nature are those of selflove and benevolence , which are of the utmost importance in the conduct of life , aiding as well as checking each other , and thus securing the happiest results . To the philosophic eye two other principles of unspeakable moment present themselves , which bear the same relation to each other , that is observed between benevolence and selfLlove , an apparent opposition , hut , indeed , a friendly alliance . I speak of the principles named above ,  --  our natural passion for novelty , and the attachment we naturally feel for those things to which we are accustomed . Mr. Addison mentions novelty as in itself a source of pleasure to the mental taste , and we need not look beyond the circle of our own experience for a demonstration of the fact . In many instances the same object is viewed with interest or indifference in exact proportion to the rarity or frequency of its occurrence . Still , it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , in many instances , an attachment to that , which is old or familiar , simply because it is so . These apparently opposite passions are not always found in the same proportions . In some , the passion for novelty is greatly predominant ; in others , an attachment to antiquity or custom . Indeed , the same person , in the progress of life , undergoes in these respects very great changes . As a general thing , the young have an insatiable thirst for novelty . For this a good reason may be given . On the threshold of their being every thing is new to them . Heaven and earth present themselves at once to their admiring view , feeding their curiosity , firing their imagination , and leading them on from one object to another in rapid succession and perpetual fluctuation . In the ardor of their feelings they are not generally disposed to investigate deeply ; their views are superficial* they do not become acquainted with the intrinsic worth of things , nor allow themselves time to form those attachments , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant , indeed , may be attached to its nurse , and the child to its baubles , arid the bashful youth may have a strong preference for the scenes and the faces , with which he is most familiar ; but time , of course , must be required to form attachments of this kind , and the longer they are continued , the stronger they become . Hence friendships are formed and confirmed . We set a value on the habitations , to which we have long been accustomed , above what we should feel for others , though in themselves more commodious or attractive . The horse and the dog are exalted almost to the rank of associates ; and , in our imaginations , articles of furniture and instruments of labor become sensitive , if not colloquial beings . For attachments of this kind it is not difficult to account . The kindness of ourfellow*creatures , and the utility of inanimate things , address themselves directly to the heart , and mingle with the strongest // feelings of nature . The history of every person , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long been conversant , is blended , perhaps , with many events , which have a strong hold on our recollections and our feelings , and opens channels for that easy flow of thought , which , if not the most profitable , causes many an hour , that might otherwise be tedious , to pass calmly and perhaps delightfully over us . I add that , in the active pursuits of life , the facilities of habit contribute much to strengthen the attachments we are now considering . It is hardly necessary to observe , that custom diminishes original difficulties , and renders every thing but impossibilities easy . Hence those modes of operation , which , in themselves , are far from the best , may be preferred by those , who have long been familiar with them ; and not only so , but they may be indeed the best for them , and especially if far advanced in life . As observed above , the passion for novelty and change is most conspicuous in the young , and attachment to things already familiar is a characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admire the wisdom of Providence . The young have every thing to learn and every thing to do . Their bodily powers are to be in a sense created . Their limbs and organs are to be trained to facility and promptness in a thousand diversified employments ; and the mind , by which those outward operations are to be directed , is to be nurtured from an embryo into a mature state . After all this , provision is to be made for the ease and enjoyment of future years , and especially for the decline of life . Hence it is evident that children and youth require some powerful excitement to action ; such an excitement as may be found in a boundless curiosity , and an ardent love of change . When the bodily and mental powers have been in some measure habituated to their proper employments ; when , by superficial views of surrounding scenes and objects , a few of the first principles of life and action have been learned , it is of the utmost importance that the fervor of puerile feelings should abate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the nature and worth of those objects , whose outward aspects are more inviting ; and that we should become more and more tenacious of the attainments we have made , in proportion as we have found them to be indeed valuable . in the order of nature and the design of Providence , every year renders a person more contemplative , more regular in his pursuits , and , as I believe , more fervent in those feelings , which are of the greatest importance to human virtue and happiness . I do not mean the fervor of animal spirits , which is unquestionably greater in the young than in the old , but , in that chastened sensibility , which is the effect of habitual and deep thought . As we advance in life , perpetual action becomes unnecessary as a mere discipline for our limbs or our minds . It would be fatiguing to us . We want rest . We have an increasing relish for tranquility ; and hence our increasing attachment to the persons , places , and modes of life , with which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two principles or passions we have now been considering , constitutes the safety and happiness of every community , civil or sacred . The world , as well as every individual of mankind , has its infancy and childhood , and should be constantly looking forward to improvements , to which the present state is no more than the // dawn to the meridian day . Our advancement in every thing valuable we must owe in a great measure to the enterprise of those , who can never be at rest , who are continually hungering and thirsting after something new . These spirits , however , are often too fickle to retain their most important acquisitions . They need the aid and control of very different dispositions ; of those , " who hold fast that which is good ; " who reverence antiquity , and pay a sacred regard to the lessons of experience ; whose views are too comprehensive and too minute to be cheated with mere innovations under the name of improvements . Errors and abuses can never be sanctified in their eyes by the customs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a principle or practice a reason in their mind for discarding that , which has been found to be innocent and perhaps beneficial . The passion for novelty is not indeed the noblest of our feelings . Indulged to excess , it is a great obstruction to final improvement , and may render a human being , however long he may live , and whatever stature he may attain , a perpetual child ; and yet , there is something in this disposition , which entitles it to indulgence , or tenderness , at least , even in its aberrations and excesses . As an undoubted principle of nature , indeed , and one which is calculated to promote , in an eminent degree , the great purpose of our being , it may fairly claim something more than forbearance on the part of those , who feel themselves constrained to counteract its eccentricities . It is entitled even in the young to a degree of respect . The opposite or controling principle , however , attachment to custom or antiquity , may justly demand a higher degree of tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the great purposes of our being , to final improvement and durable happiness , , private and social . This sentiment , like its counterpart , is indeed liable to excess . It may degenerate in one heart into apathy and sloth , and in another into obstinate or peevish intolerance of every thing new . Naturally , however , it is attended with many favorable associations . It is blended with a variety of recollections , cheerful or pensive , which have a good influence on the spirit . It mingles with our veneration for age , and often flows in the *arne channel with our gratitude to those , to whom we are indebted immediately or remotely for privileges or enjoyments . In the complicated machinery of government , we should guard with a jealous eye against the spirit of innovation . In the great mass of the community , this spirit , when allowed to vent and exert itself , will always , I believe , be found predominant . Thousands and thousands of those , who have an equal right of suffrage with others , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just value on their present advantages , and are therefore too ready to imagine that any change in their political situation will conduce to their benefit . This infirmity of the people is obvious to those , who , without any solid merit , are always aspiring to places of honor and emolument , and who will not fail for their own advantage to cherish and gratify that restless spirit , which threatens the loss of every thing most dear . Nay , if it be once understood that there is nothing fixed in our civil constitutions , we should have enough to fear , though all our public men were the sincerest patriots in the wojrld . Those recruits of young legislators , which every year produces , would , in the ardoi- of their feelings , overwhelm // us with new propositions of amendment . These propositions , of course , must be discussed , occupying the time of the whole legislature , days , and weeks , and months , perhaps , and , after each has involved an expense of many thousand dollars , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful innovator may encourage the attempts of many others , and put the whole fabric in danger , and especially when the waves of party feeling beat , as they often will do , with peculiar violence . A xvise man will not disturb the wall of a lofty and compact temple , though he may discover here and there a brick , which was burned somewhat too much or too little for the general complexion of the building . While they fill their place , and exclude wind and water , it is incomparably better that they should remain . The tree of forty or fifty years standing will not be improved by an attempt to bend and straighten the trunk originally crooked , and far less to give a graceful curve to one that was straight . A slight infirmity would never induce a man of sense to commit himself even to a skillful physiciau , if , in doing that , he must become a subject for the experiments of every one , who made the least pretensions to the art . Every citizen of Massachusetts will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for reducing the number of representatives ; but time may prove , that they have tampered too much with this charter of rights and privileges for their children 's children . It may be remembered , that , some fifteen or twenty years since , a miller in the state of Vermont thought to supply some defect of water by cutting a channel from a neighboring pond* For this purpose he pioughed a single furrow , and the water began to run . As the soil was light , the channel became deeper and wider , till , in a few minutes , the whole pond was in motion , and a torrent produced , which ploughed a deep ravine , and , in one hour , swept away dam , and mill , and pond , and every trace of his former prosperity .
