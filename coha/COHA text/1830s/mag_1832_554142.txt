txt When a trying question was once submitted to the court of Areopagus , that venerable body , anxious that justice should be relieved from the prejudices of the hour , directed the parties ( with perhaps too little regard for their convenience ) to appear in court ' again at the expiration of a hundred years . They considered this time amply sufficient to allow for prejudices and passions to die away . Could they , by any prophetic vision , // have foreseen the question concerning the guilt or innocence of Queen Mary , they might well have doubted whether their term of adjournment should not have been extended , by at least another century . Here is the example of a Queen , who has engaged the general interest and attention , more than any other of her sex that ever existed ; who has been condemned , again and again , by able and popular historians , and defended by those whose works have never obtained any considerable circulation , and yet the public mind is not made up ; her accusers have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a perpetual suspicion , that those histo-. rians were more governed by prejudice than conviction ; and , as the amount of testimony which they were able to adduce , bore no proportion to their confidence , men in general have determined , wisely and properly in our opinion , to regard her as innocent till she is proved guilty . It is sometimes supposed* that this tenderness toward her is owing to the renown of her beauty ; if it were so , one would suppose that the same charity would be extended to Helen , Cleopatra , and other ladies of that description , who are by no means treated with the same forbearance , though equally celebrated for personal charms . We have , in our own times , had an opportunity of seeing how soon even folly can destroy the sympathy of the nations . Never was there more enthusiasm than that inspired by that delightful vision , ' the late Queen of France ; but , since the world has learned that her indiscretions did much to injure her unfortunate husband , lovely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether Mary were guilty or not , there is no doubt that she was basely injured ; but we believe , that unless the world had been firmly persuaded of her innocence , their sympathy would have subsided , almost as soon as her beauty was changed into dust and ashes . It is fortunate for the reputation of Mary , that her trial has thus been continued from one age to another ; for it is evident , that there has been no time , during the last two centuries , when a Catholic or a Stuart could have gained an impartial hearing . But now , a new spirit is busy in the records of English history ; religious prejudices and their results are sternly examined ; political prepossessions are also made subjects of inquiry ; and it begins to be doubted , whether the cause of truth is materially served by exchanging one passion for another . With respect to crowned heads , a feeling begins // to prevail , similar to that expressed by the guide of the Spanish satirist , who in vision went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment allotted to kings , and , on seeing it , expressed his wonder that so few were there . Few , ' said his conductor , there are all that ever reigned ! ' We do not mean to say , that the public mind is yet impartial ; but it has broken part of its chains . The prejudice against the Catholics has had the most decided effect upon historical representations . We have no sympathy with the Roman faith , and we bless the reform which broke up the deep foundations of its power ; but every enlightened Protestant now admits , that the feeling of the reformers , though not too severe , perhaps , against the faith of the Catholics , consideiing the evils to which it led , was far too indiscriminate and unsparing in its condemnation of their characters and persons , and amounted at last to intolerance much resembling that which they condemned in the Catholics themselves . It has led historians into an infinite variety of errors ; it is truly surprising to remark , how events and persons , seen through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true form , colors , and proportions . Thus , in reference to Catholic intolerance , they have almost made the stones cry out for vengeance upon that spirit which kindled the fires of martyrdom , and every heart joins in the disgust and abhorrence they express ; but they have converted this into mis-representation , by sinking the fact , that Sir Thomas More , Cranmer , and John Rogers , the former an enlightened Catholic , the two latter Protestant apostles , approved and encouraged the burning of those whom th&amp;y considered heretics , regarding it , as it was evidently regarded in that day , as nothing more than a fair and rightful use of power , and only to be condemned when personally applied to themselves . The name of bloody ' Mary has been held up to the detestation of ages , as in truth she well deserved it ; but something less than justice is done , when they conceal the fact , that the blood of Catholics flowed as fast in the days of Elizabeth , as that of Protestants in her sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burlesque in the grandeur with which they boast themselves of her , whom they call ( lucus a non lucendo ) England 's virgin ' queen . A woman of great ability she undoubtedly was ; but they can see no weakness in a toothless old lady , aping the dress and graces of fifteen ; and it does not occur to them , that it was not the most glorious // time for their country , when the nation trembled before a vixen , who swore at her Parliament , boxed the ears of her generals , and cuffed her ladies of honor with her own royal hands . We shall dwell no further on this , than to say , that we do the majority of Protestant historians no injustice , when we observe , that they seem to have thought , that all was corruption in the ancient Church , and , that before their Rhadamanthus-like tribunal , the word Catholic was synonymous with guilty . We feel , therefore , that the opinions they have filed against Mary are of little importance , except so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another reason which has been unfavorable to Mary is , that her name was Stuart ,  --  a name which has been unpopular in England for a long time , and with good reason ; the question , however , is not so much whether the Stuarts were a bad race , as whether any other line , unrestrained by their subjects , would be any better . There is no doubt of their determination to enslave their people ; but where is the royal line which is not equally resolute in claiming every inch of power , which the spirit of freedom and endurance will allow them ? Kings look upon power as their property ; and they regard the patriot as the citizen the tax-gatherer , believing that he has a perfect right to all that he can keep back from the publican 's exaction . The difficulty was not so much in the character of the Stuarts , as in the notions of sovereignty which they inherited , and in the corrupt state of institutions , which gave them power to oppress . The late King of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any European sovereign ; but education and habit rendered him unable to see the position in which he stood , tmd as when the ship is sunk , every sailor knows how she might have been saved , ' he is commonly regarded as a wrong-headed fool . But though the fate of the Stuarts was very similar to that of the Bourbons , we are free to confess , that we can see nothing in the mind or heart , in the l ) Liblic or private character of the Protestant succession , with which they need blush to compare . Their history resembles a torrent , breaking out from the northern mountains , which moves on in desolating grandeur , till it spreads and sinks on the plain , and leaves its channel dry . We do not admire them in their greatness , but we sympathize with them in their fall . There is something affecting to us in the thought of Charles , however misguided , laying down his gray // discrowned head ' upon the block ; of James , when he heard that William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait , that he might not disappoint his friend ; of Henrietta , unable to rise for want of a fire , in the palaces of France ; of the young chevalier , making a desperate attempt to regain the kingdom which he believed his own ; and the whole heraldry of their race , at last sinking unhonored to the dust . The only vestige of their line now existing , is the descendant of the Duke of Berwick , natural son of James IL. , who is one of the grandees of Spain . Historians have *mplicitly followed the advice of the Fool in Lear , when the great wheel goes up hill , let him haul thee after ; but when it goes down , let go , lest thou break thy neck with following it . ' They have thrown contempt on the Stuarts from Mary downward , and shown a diligence in flattering the talents and virtues of the Brunswick line , which indicates that they knew what would suit the pQpular feeling , and who were best able to pay for praise . Now when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what power a popular historian has over the feeling and judgment of his readers ,  --  a power which grows out of our familiarity with works , which interest us day after day ,  --  works , to which we yield a grateful confidence , because they have entertained us in many vacant hours , it is matter of surprise to us , that the public mind should have so long hesitated to pronounce judgment against Queen Mary . No historian has been more read than Robertson in this coun* try ; though now the world begins to acquiesce in Johnson 's opinion , that he would he crushed by his own weight . ' Hume , too , another great enemy of Mary , has exercised an unbounded influence over American readers , insomuch , that several years ago , the youth of our country , though sworn friends of freedom , were almost unanimous in favor of the unfortunate but usurping Charles , and were ready to justify transactions in the English history , which were most decidedly opposed to their own feelings and opinions . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one knows that it has created a strong suspicion of Mary , and as this is a subject of general interest , we propose to give a slight view of the evidence in support of that indictment , to which she pleads not guilty . ' The controversy began with the work of the celebrated Buchanan , who was patronized by Murray and encouraged by Cecil , and was naturally swayed by the strong feelings of // gratitude and hope . No one in this age doubts the unscrupubus ambition of the good Regent , ' or the excessive dissimulation of the English secretary . They were probably nearly as well understood in their own times , but they took care , in all their enterprises , to secure the favor of the great Protestant party ; and the world has probably never seen the time when a party would hesitate to justify its idol , even at the expense of truth and honor . Buchanan could by no means excuse Murray 's treatment of his sister , except by pronouncing her guilty of enormous crimes ; and he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutality , doubtless believed that a Catholic was , as a matter of course , capable of every sin . His statements were contested by Lesley , bishop of Ross , and others ; but the tide was setting altogether in one direction , and the English public , with that candor for which it was always distinguished , was , like old Transfer in Zeluco , willing to hear reason when it had made up its mind . ' The controversy was revived at a future time , by the attempts of the Stuarts to regain the English throne ; nothing was so acceptable to the winning side , as attempts to dishonor the birth and ancestry of the exiled princes . But the question was not debated with much research or fairness , till after the decisive year 1745 . Then Mr. Goodall , Librarian to the Faculty of Advocates , published an examination of the Letters attributed to Mary . Robertson 's history appeared four years after ; and it is easy to see , that a collection of ancient documents , which none but the antiquary would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with a history , which by a favor , not perhaps fully deserved , was found on almost every table . By a curious self-contradiction , Robertson creates sympathy for her , as one who died the death of the innocent , though she lived the life of the guilty . As we have already said , he was supported by Hume , whose philosophical narrative will always be admired , though his historical inaccuracy is now so clearly proved , that he never will be cited as an authority in matters of fact again . Tytler 's defence does not seem to have gained a very extensive circulation ; and the same may be said of Whitaker , who published a work on the subject in three octavo volumes , without one word of index at the beginning or end . The work of Chalmers on the same side , which appeared in // together without the least regard to heaven 's first law , ' and in which one searches for a fact as for a needle in a haystack , with an oppressive feeling of despair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence has been , that these works , like the gun at Mahomet 's siege of Constantinople , which was with great ado fired seven times a day , have been wholly ineffectual in modern warfare ; and this mismanagement confirms the saying , that the indiscretion of friends is more injurious at times , than the worst enmity of foes . Lingard , in his history , gives no opinion concerning this question , but merely narrates the facts , and leaves them to make their own impression . Sir Walter Scott does not profess to speak with confidence on the subject , but leans toward the unfavorable side ; still he speaks of the saintly patience ' with which she endured the misery and exile of her later years . We might remind him that this is not the kind of virtue , which adulterers and murderers are most apt to - display . On the whole , we have no doubt , that in England , one may know a priori from the party in which a man is interested , what his opinion is concerning the innocence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such disturbing force in the way of forming deliberate opinions ; and as , when we began our investigations of the subject , we had little doubt of her guilt , we have the more confidence in the conclusion to which we have arrived at last , that she was innocent of the greatest of crimes . But we must make one remark concerning this controversy ; each party have gone to the extreme ; if the one have proved her innocent of murder , they speik as if no reproach remained ; if the other have proved her guilty of imprudence and folly , they leap to the conclusion , that she was accessory to her bushand 's death . We think it necessary , therefore , to say , that we do not exalt her into an angel , when we declare our conviction , that her husband 's death was owing to other counsels and other hands . The first piece of direct evidence brought to prove that Mary was concerned in the murder of Darnley , was the confession of Paris , a French servant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bothwell before the murder , in which that event was plainly alluded to ; but this confession was wrung from him by torture , by those who were most deeply interested in proving Mary guilty , and the circumstances are so suspicious throughout , that such evidence // would not now be admitted by a country justice in a case of trover . Here they had a most important witness ,  --  the only human being who could testify to this fact , which they were so earnest to establish ,  --  but was he brought before Parliament or any unprejudiced court , where his testimony might be crossexamined and sifted ? So far from it , lie was hurried to execution , and what they chose to call his confession was offered in his stead . This is sufficient to show that it does not deserve the name of evidence ; but there is yet more . Paris , and the others who made confessions , spoke to the spectators at their execution ; and the bishop of Ross , addressing the King 's lords , said , We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of their own hearing , that John Hepburn did openly cry and testify , as he should answer before God , that you were the principal authors , counsellors , and assisters with his master ( Bothwell ) in this infamous murder ; we can tell you that Hay , Powrie , Dalgleish and Paris , took God to record at the time of their death , that the murder was by your counsel , invention and drift , committed ; they also declared , that they knew not the Queen to be participant or aware thereof . ' Mr. Laing thinks this statement false ; but we are evidently bound , without disrespect to him , to pay less regard to what he says than to what lie proves . ' Morton , the bitter enemy of Mary , confessed before his death , that he promised to join the conspiracy against Darnley , if Bothwell would procure a sign of the Queen 's consent ; but this he was unable to do . The confession of Paris is easily disposed of ; and there is no other direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which came into possession of the Earl of Morton . This contained letters , contracts and sonnets , said to have been addressed by herself to the Earl of Bothwell . The story spread concerning it , unsupported however by any evidence , was this ; that on the 20th of June , 1567 , Dalgleish , a servant of Bothwell , was seized with this casket in his possession . It had been sent for safe-keeping to the castle of Edinburgh , and Bothwell sent this servant to demand it of Sir James Balfour , the governor of the castle . The box was taken from Dalgleish , and the fact established by the oath of the Earl of Morton . No hint of this momentous discovery was given till the 4th of December . The lords say , that Dalgleish was judicially examined before the Earls of Morton and Athol . Not a single // question was put to him on this subject ; he was not confronted with Sir James Balfour , from whom he was said to have received the box , nor with the servants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His confessien , in which he admits his share in Darnley 's murder , contains not one word respecting this box ; but the enemies of the Queen , interested as they were in establishing the fact , had no curiosity upon the subject , and said not one word about it , till several months after the death of the only person , whose testimony , supposing it to have been in their favor , could have done them any good . Dalgleish died , asserting the innocence of the Queen , and charging the murder upon the Earls of Murray and Morton . It will be observed , that this box was said to have been discovered on the 20th of June , 1567 . Not a word was said about it till December 4th of the same year ; and the fact , that Morton seized it in the hands of Dalgleish , was not made known till the 16th of September , 1568 . Many important events , which imperiously required some such evidence , took place between June and December . A proclamation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evidence or the guilt of the Queen , who was then in the hands of the Protestant lords . An ambassador came from France to inquire the cause of their treatment of the Queen , but they did not produce these substantial reasons . They spoke of her to Throgmorton with respect and reverence , ' and while they were earnest to impress him with a conviction of her guilt , did not employ these papers . They compelled the Queen to resign her crown , but resorted to frivolous pretences to justify their violence , when the contents of this box , had they possessed it , would have thrown into confusion all the friends of Mary . The only reply made to these arguments is , that it would have been unsafe for the lords to have produced them before ; unsafe to produce the evidence of her guilt , while it was perfectly safe for them , without evidence , to treat her as if she were guilty ! So absurd is it to suppose , when all the power of Scotland was in their hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is said that the lords feared Elizabeth , who , at this time , was really interested in favor of Mary . Believe it who will ! Add to this the improbability of the fact , that Bothwell should leave such papers in such a place , when they were of no use to him after his marriage with the Queen , and yet contained perfect evidence of // the guilt of both ,  --  that when his affairs were in the most threatening position , he should have left these papers in a castle where he dared not take refuge himself ,  --  that when he might have destroyed them at any time , he should have suffered them to exist , and at last sent a servant , not to destroy them , but to bring them to him through the midst of his foes ,  - -  that Daigleish , the well known servant of Bothwell , should have passed into the city through a gate guarded by four hundred and fifty hostile soldiers , and that , when he reached the castle , Balfour , who had deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box without hesitation , are circumstances which we shall feel excused in not believing . The only reason we can imagine , why Dalgleish was not pressed to confess these things when under the torture , was a natural fear , lest his confession should prove too much like his dying declaration on the scaffold . So much for the manner in which the papers were procured ; and next , we are to see for what purpose the lords employed them . They first allude to them in the act of a council assembled on the 4th of December , 1567 , in which the lords declare , that in order to justify themselves , they must make an open disclosure of the whole matter ; and go on to state , that their seizure of the Queen 's person , on the 15th of June , and her imprisonment in Lochleven castle , and all other things inventit , spokin , writtin or donne by them or onny of them , towiching the saied queene hir person , ' from the 10th day of February , until the date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters , writtin and subscrivit with her awin hand , and sent by her to James ErIl Bothwell . ' The story of the seizure of the box upon Dalgleish was not published till the next year , when they had , probably , forgotten the exact statements of this act in council . So that it appears by their own declaration , that the lords rose in insurrection on the 10th of June , fought against her on the 15th at Carberry hill , and imprisoned her on the J 6th , entirely in consequence of evidence of her guilt , which accidentally fell into their hands on the 20th of the same month in the same year . On the 15th of December , the lords applied to Parliament for an act approving the severity with which they had proceeded against the Queen . No investigation was invited or permitted ; but these letters were mentioned as the ground of their defence ; and in the act of Parliament , ( which still exists ) VOL. xxxIV. - NO. 74. 20 // it appears that the subscription to them was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are expressly mentioned as subscribed with her own hand . They never afterwards pretended that she had subscribed them . Mr. Laing accounts for this material discrepancy , by proposing to read in the act of council , writtin or subscribed ' instead of writtin and subscribed , ' - with a confidence like that of Archimedes , that if he can only find a place to stand upon , he can move the world . The lords probably thought a slight alteration unimpoltant as well as Mr. Laing . Humne and others say , that it was , doubtless , a secretary 's blunder . However accounted for , it is certain that they were subscribed by Mary on the 4th , and on the 15th the subscription had disappeared , no one knew how . To us it seems easily explained ; Mary still retained hei ' sea , so that it was not pretended that the letters were sealed ; and though in the secret council , it might be credited that Mary had sent unsealed letters to Bothwell , containing distinct intimations of adultery and murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story likely to be helieved by the world , and , therefore , the subscriptions were withdrawn . The letters next appear at the celebrated conference , ' as it was called , held by three sets of commissioners , appointed by Mary , Elizabeth and Murray severally , the object of which was , to establish charges against the Scottish Queen . The usual charges were brought against her , to which her agents opposed a triumphant reply . They stated , that so far from believing Bothwell guilty of her husband 's murder , she had seen him acquitted by a regular trial , in which three of Murray 's commissioners , ( who now accused her of allowing an unfair trial , ) sat as judges ; -.  - -  that she had willingly parted from Bothwell , as they had themselves seen ; and so strongly did she support the various positions of her defence , that Murray had nothing to reply , and Hume himself confesses , that up to this period of the trial , Mary had the advantage . It was , therefore , necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they accordingly come , re-inforced by contracts and amatory sonnets addressed by Mary to Bothwell , and Morton swore that all had been found in it at the time when it came into his possession . Here again , the intrepid Mr. Laing declares , that the Scotch dialect includes all papers in the general name of letters ; ' though that language is sometimes // considered harsh , it is singularly accommodating to him ; still we shall take the liberty of believing , that the Scotch do actually see some points of difference between love songs , marriage contracts , and privie letters , ' as the act describes them . It may be observed , that these important documents were secretly shown to Elizabeth* s commissioners , who were satisfied of their authenticity by comparing them with specimens of the Queen 's hand-writing , furnished also by . Murray . When the conference was transferred to Westminster , the papers were again submitted to the English commissioners , after they had been sworn to secrecy ; but this mysterious proceeding does not seem to have produced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly demanded to see the papers , said to have been written by their mistress ; but this was denied ; they then demanded copies , and pledged themselves to satisfy the commissioners from these alone , that the papers were forged ; this also was denied ! and as their demand grew pressing , Murray was permitted to leave the trial on purpose to carry back the papers to Scotland , after which they were seen no more . Elizabeth informed Murray at the close of the trial , that she acquitted him of all charge against his loyalty ; and on the other hand , declared that nothing was proved against Queen Mary . rJ7hat this was a voluntary declaration on her part , all her subsequent treatment of Mary authorizes us to question . It appears from a letter of the Spanish ambassador to his King , that the English lords displayed some spirit on the occasion , and checked the *varmth with which Cecil was hurrying on the fate of Mary . Certain it is , that many of the first nobility treated her as guiltless after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , that a great proportion of the best and noblest of her Scotch subjects placed no faith in the evidence adduced against her . And how could it be otherwise ? Though the forms of law may vary in different ages , human nature remains the same ; and the suspicious form of this testimony ,  --  the interest which those who produced it had in convicting the Queen , together with the underhand manner in which they brought it forward , all excited doubts , which their reputation for stratagem served rather to confirm than to do away . It seems , then , that these celebrated letters first made their appearance in the hands of Morton , Mary 's bitterest foe . No attempt is made to authenticate them , They are said to have // been produced to a council , all of whom were enemies of the Queen . It does not appear that they were shown to the Scotch parliament at all . When they are produced at the conference in England , it becomes necessary to give some account of the manner in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no evidence , excepting that of Morton , though Bothwell 's servant , from whom they were said to be taken , was long in Morton 's power . At the conference in York , these letters , with additional papers never heard of before , are produced to the commissioners hostile to Mary , but strictly withheld from all her friends . When the conference is adjourned to Westminster , it is found necessary to produce them in public ; Murray accordingly produces them , with copies which he has prepared , requiring that the copies shall be compared with the originals on the spot , and the originals immediately restored to him . All this is done by the enemies of Mary . Her friends repeatedly demand permission to see the originals ; this being refused , they request to see the copies ; but this is also denied them , and Murray receives leave from the council to return to Scotland , with the papers , which never are seen again , and never from first to last are allowed to come under the eye of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were forged . Hume says , that Murray gave Mary an opportunity of exposing him by producing the letters , and a few pages after , says , that Elizabeth finally refused copies to Mary . It is certain , that these things made an impression on the commissioners ; for they agreed that Mary had a right to appear before Elizabeth as she desired , a request which Elizabeth refused ; and from the record of their proceedings , as it has come down to us altered and interlined by the hand of Cecil , it is evident that they could not be brought to give a verdict against the Scottish Queen . Some time afterwards , Elizabeth directed that the copies which Murray had left with Cecil , should be published ; which was done in Buchanan 's Detection . ' In a letter to Walsingham , the ambassador in France , Cecil requests him to circulate copies of the work there , adding these expressive words , they will serve to good effect to disgrace her ; which must be done before other purposes can be attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing . It has been already seen , how mysteriously they were withheld from all Mary 's friends , till they were at length // published by order of Elizabeth . If written by Mary , they would be in the French language , and in French they accordingly appear . But still they are guarded against examination ; for the editor does not pretend that they are the original French , but mere translations from a former Latin translation . The original French never appeared , and indeed never seems to have existed , for Murray himself first speaks of them as written in Scotch , which they certainly would not have been , if written by Mary . This filtration through so many different languages , seems like an attempt to obliterate all those peculiarities of style , on which internal evidence so much depends . Such documents would hardly be admitted as evidence in any modern court of law . Again ; these letters were at first dated . The two first are said to have been written on the 23d and 24th of January , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last answer being written by him after dinner . Now Murray 's Diary , which has come down to us , mentions that Bothwell left Edinburgh to go into Liddesdale on the night of the 24th , and did not return till the 28th . Mr. Laing , who is great in solving difficulties , proposes to consider this as a mistake in the Diary ; but we fear that the mistake is in a different quarter . Hume and Robertson both exhort their readers to place little dependence upon dates , and it will be seen that the lords were afterwards of their opinion . Mary is represented as writing two of the letters , on the night that she remained at the house where her husband was murdered ; and yet Bothwell had just left her ,  - -  he was no farther distant than Holyrood house ,  --  she would of course see him in the morning ,  --  but the Queen sits up to write him letters of meaning or importance ,  --  which can serve no earthly purpose except to betray her guilty passion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sleep and deliver them into his hands . Within the year before the conference in England , the lords had probably discovered that these dates would not answer ,  --  they might be examined too minutely ; we accordingly learn from Camden and others , that the letters made their appearance in England without any date whatever ; thus presenting the curious anomaly of letters unsealed , undirected , unsubscribed , and undated ,  --  letters , which no one ever knew to be written or delivered ,  --  which might as well have been written to any one else as Bothwell , since he is only once mentioned in them , and then in the third person , // brought as the only evidence which was to fix the charge of adultery and murder upon a queen . Again ; these letters are brought to prove that she was accessory to her husband 's murder ; if so , she must have known that Morton and Maitland , who were afterwards clearly convicted of that crime , were concerned in it ; but the letters contain no intimation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the displeasure of the other lords , and then , Paris 's confession , which was ' taken after the quarrel , contains the first suggestion that Maitland was guilty . But if these letters were not written by Mary , it may be asked , by whom were they written ? They were intended to throw the odium of her husband 's death upon her ; but if it appear that others , with whom she could have had no collusion , were the authors of the murder , it may be easily understood why they were interested to throw suspicions upon her ; and if this kind of forgery were not an uncommon thing in that day , it will not be thought incredible that they should have resorted o it . Darnley had made himself odious to the great lords of the court ; he was vain , ignorant , and brutal , as all allow ; when intoxicated , be had often insulted them ; he had accused Murray of an attempt to assassinate him , and had required Mary to dismiss Maitland from the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . At first , they proposed a divorce to 1*iary , a plan devised at Craigmillar castle ; but she would not listen to it , saying , that Daruley might reform . If she had wished to get rid of her husband , here the way xvns open , and certainly an easier one than shedding his blood ; but she declined it so firmly , that the plan was necessarily abandoned . Huntley and Argyle related these facts , in order to show that Murray was the original proposer of the plan to remove Daruley ; and since in his answer to them he does not deny it , we may reasonably presume that the charge was true . A divorce being out of the question , they suggested the project of assassination , it may seem shocking to us , that one should have dared to suggest such a thing to the other ; but , when we remember how coolly they had proceeded to murder Rizzio , and how complacently , at a much later period , Cardinal de Retz speaks of his precious scheme for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however revolting . It appears that a bond was then drawn up by Sir James Balfour , which styled Darnley n young // fool and tyrant , and bound the subscribers to remove him , each engaging to make the deed his own , by whomsoever it might be done . This is proved by the confession of Ormistow , since he was in the hands of those who had no wish to draw from him acknowledgements of this description ; and it is a singular fact , that Paris 's confession , which is suspicious , so far as relates to Mary , because it was evidently made to propitiate Murray , who had him in his power ,  --  this very confession states , that Murray , instead of signing the bond like the rest , declared that he would neither help nor hinder ' ; so that he knew of the consJ ) iracy agitated by his friends ,  --  did not reveal it ,  --  placed no obstacles in the way of its success , and only cared to keep himself out of danger . Mr. Hume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain by the death of Darnley ,  --  nothing truly , but the Regency of Scotland , with more than royal power . No one can believe that Mary was associated with such conspirators ; and it is easily understood , why they should arrange every thing in such a manner as to throw the odium on her , by way of removing it from themselves . No one denies that Mary loved her husband , and treated him with tenderness , whenever his violent and capricious temper would allow it ; but it was known that he had treated her with such insolence as often to make her shed tears , and had actually insisted upon it , that Rizzio should be murdered in her presence , ' though there was every reason to believe , that her life and that of his unborn child would be the sacrifice . The public , knowing these things , could not believe in her continued kindness to him , though every thing shows that it was sincere , and they felt as if she was more interested than any other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , the lords could find any external evidence to fix the crime on her , they would be able to screen themselves , and it was apparently for this purpose that the letters were written . They may possibly have been letters originally addressed by her to Darnley , but it is more probable that they were forged . This was a common practice at that day . Randolph , the agent of Elizabeth , is well known to have forged letters to advance the ally of Elizabeth , the Earl of Morton . Kirkaldy was imposed upon by a forged letter in the hands of Morton . Since , according to Camden , Maitland acknowledged to the English commissioners at York , that he had often forged the hand-writing of // Mary , it is no breach of Christian charity to believe that he did it on this occasion , when his own safety was so deeply concerned . Scott openly speaks of the plot of the lords at Craigmillar to assassinate Darnley ; we do not know how he can suppose that Mary could have conspired with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brought one word of evidence against her , except the letters . If they did so conspire among themselves , and there is no doubt of it , it would seem to be clear that they were the murderers , and that it was to cover their own guilt , and favor their own ambition , that they accused , imprisoned , and at last destroyed the Queen . It does seem to us , that those persons who engaged so heartily in the cold-blooded murder of Rizzio , were more likely than a tender and delicate woman , to engage in a new act of blood . If any one ask , what was the temptation to engage in the Craigmillar conspiracy , he is easily answered . Mary had made liberal grants of the crown property to Murray , Morton , Maitland , Bothwell , and others ; but the Scotch law gave her the power of revoking these grants at any time before she had reached the age of twenty-five . Darnley , who detested the lords , had already persuaded her to make a partial revocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no doubt that Darnley , had he lived , would have urged her to pass a general act of resumption , before her age deprived her of the power . Here was a great temptation ; but we suspect that the character of the lords was such , that even a less one would have answered . Seventy years since , Dr. Johnson said , that the forgery of the letters was made so apparent , that they probably never would be cited as evidence again ; and we have no doubt that all future historians , following the example of Sir Walter Scott , will reject them , however convinced they may be that Mary was guilty . This distinguished writer , in a note on this subject , quotes with seeming approbation a remark of Hume , who , when he was told that a new defender of the Queen had appeared , asked , has he shown that she did not marry Bothwell ? if not , he gives up the whole question . ' Mr. Hume , being satisfied of Bothwell 's guilt himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction ; and if she had married him , knowing that he was her husband 's murderer , although it would not prove her accessory to the murder , it would form a strong presumption against her , we allow . But Mary had only known // Bothwell as a loyal nobleman , faithful and interested in her service ; and beside that the lords had proposed a divorce to her at Craigmillar , she knew the fancied interest they had in destroying the King , and how careless of blood they had shown themselves on another memorable occasion . If Mr. Hume could have shown , that Mary had reasons to believe Bothwell guilty , and to acquit the others , in her own mind , his remark would be just ; but we think that the Queen had sufficient evidence for ascribing it to the real authors , who used Bothwell as an instrument , and for regarding her husband 's death as part of a great conspiracy , of which she was to be , as it afterwards appeared that she was , the second victim . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence of all accession to the murder of her husband . But next comes the question of her niarriage with Bothwell . Her enemies allege that this was her object , in all her previous proceedings , and offer it as the main proof of her guilt . Her defenders say , on the contrary , that it was the result of a conspiracy which delivered her into the power of Bothwell in order to dishonor her name , and that she was so treated by him , as to make a quiet submission to her marriage the only course she could pursue . Bothwell , with a large body of horsemen , seized her person the question is , was this the result of collusion between them , or was it violence , offered against her will ? The decision here must depend very much on the proofs of attachment she had previously given to Bothwell . So thought the lords , and for this reason so much stress was laid upon the sonnets and letters . If they were genuine , there was no doubt of her lawless passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all presumptions founded upon them as falling to the ground . Her enemies labored hard to show that she was unscrupulous in her attachments , and to prove this , Buchanan charged her with being the paramour of Rizzio : but even Robertson repels this accusation as an unnecessary slander , and Knox , who would have been too happy to confirm it were this l ) OsSible , does not include it among his charges against the Queen . Scott declares that her fame was untainted with reproach , till her name was connected with Bothwell 's . The history of her connexion with him is therefore very important . For many years he had enjoyed her regard , in consequence of his faithful services to her mother // and herself , and contemporary writers assure us that he was an equal favorite with the nation . In 1563 , Mary imprisoned him for some conspiracy in which he was engaged . He afterwards went to France , but was ordered by Mary to return for trial , or be proclaimed an outlaw . He returned to stand his trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by five thousand men , he dared not appear , and was obliged to retreat to France ; whence he did not return till Mary was married to Darnley . It is acknowledged on all sides , that Mary was passionately attached to Darnley till after his murder of Rizzio . Bothwell was married in the month preceding this murder to a young lady of rank and beauty , and Randolph assures us that at this time , Botbwell was open in his resistance to the Catholic tastes of the Queen . Previously to the Queen 's confinement , it is acknowledged that Bothwell had but little influence witfi her ; and from July 19th , 1566 , when her month of confinement ended , to the first of October in the same year , is the time in which Mary 's passion , according to her accusers , begun and grew till it ended in guilt . That a young mother should in so marvellously short a time form such an attachment , exceeds belief . And what is the evidence of it ? XVe are told , that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as keeper of that country , and was there accidentally wounded in the discharge of his duty . Here Mary 's l ) passion was first manifested by her flying , as Robertson says , with all the impatience of a lover , ' to visit him at Hermitage castle . We know not what the Doctor 's ideas of a lover 's impatience may have been , but the fact is , that Mary was in that neighborhood on the 8th of the month he was wounded on the 7th , and she flew , ' as the Doctor has it , on the 16th to see him , and returned the same day . Such are a great historian 's opinions concerning the impatience of love . It is said that Mary showered favors upon him but it does not appear that he was in any special favor till after Rizzio 's death , and the only favors conferred on him after that time , were a grant of crown-lands , and the castle and lordship of Dunbar . it has been seen , that Mary had extended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enjoying any peculiar favor , the contrary would rather appear to be the case ; for he opposed the recall of Maitland from exile , and quarrelled with Murray on the subject in the presence of the Queen . This was in August ; but Maitland was restored , and Bothwell was com // pelled to surrender to him lands , which , after Maitland 's exile , had fallen to his share . On the whole , without admitting the authenticity of the letters , there is not a shadow of pioog that Bothwell was even an object of her love . Buchanan indeed asserts it ; but to assert is one thing , and to prove is another ; and as his authority is so often quoted in this controversy , it may he *vel1 to mention , that Cecil says Buchanan wrote not in his own name , but according to instructions to hym given by common conference of the Lords of the privy council of Scotland ; by him onely for hys learning penned , but by them the matter ministred ; ' and Camden assures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live so long , till by recalling the truth , he might , even with his blood , wipe away those by hi aspersions , which he had s bad tongue , unjustly cast upon Mary . ' We should have mentioned , that Mary is accused of hurrying on the trial of Bothwell with indecent precipitation . All allow , that immediately after the murder , she conducted herself like an innocent woman ; she offered a reward of two thousand pounds for the discovery of the murderers , and took the necessary steps to trace them . A placard was affixed at night to the Toibooth , charging Bothwell with the crime . Mary directed an answer to be made , stating , that if the author of the placard would appear and substantiate the charge , he should receive the reward . No one however appeared . Lennox , the father of Darnley , required that all who were charged in the various placards should be imprisoned ; but Mary very properly informed him , that she could not , without an abuse of pmver , imprison noblemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earl of Bothwell and others ; and though he professed that lie had no evidence against him , Mary ordered a trial , which was appointed by her privy council to be held on the 12th of April , 1567 , and proclamations were made accordingly . It appears , that only twenty-four hours before the trial was to take place , Mary received a letter from Lenmiox , requesting that Bothwell might be imprisoned , and the trial deferred , till he had collected his proofs and his friends . This would have been neither reasonable nor just ; and the jury on the trial , composed of persons not particularly friendly to Bothwell , were obliged to acquit him . Those who are satisfied by the evidence of later times that Bothwell was the murderer , should reflect that this evidence was not then // brought to light , and the Queen had as much reason for suspecting any other of her great lords as Bothwell . It will be remembered , that at Craigmillar castle , the lords agreed to support the author of the murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus afford conclusive evidence of their accession to the crime . Killigrew tells us , that he dined with Bothwell at the Earl of Murray 's , twenty days after he had been placarded ; and at his trial Bothwell appeared , supported by Morton and Lethington . This is all consistent with the supposition , since confirmed , that they were in the conspiracy , and goes equally far to prove the innocence of the Queen . So far , the whole proceeding seems like a plan on the part of the lords , to make use of Bothwell , a fearless and unprincipled man , as an instrument of their own ambition . Having once encouraged him to take the guilt of blood upon himself , it would have been in their power at any time to destroy him ; and should he accuse them as accessory , it would be easy to ascribe the charge on his part to hatred and revenge . But as his ambition began to rise higher , and even to aim at royal authority , they saw that it would be also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the murderer , and making it appear that she was associated with him in his crimes . They knew and were able to prove Bothwell 's guilt ; but it does not appear that Mary did know it , or had more reason to suspect him than others ; indeed she had reason to believe him in. * nocent , because his name was connected in the placards with her own , and if the charge against her were malicious , she might naturally infer that the accusation was preferred against him by the real conspirators , in order to cover their own guilt . Bothwell immediately began to play his desperate game of ambition . He sued for a divorce from his wife , and this also is matter of charge against Mary ; but the veracious historians who mention this fact , forget to tell us that the lady herself , with every appearance of collusion , sued at the same time for a divorce from him ; he , who was a Protestant , applying to a Catholic court , and she , who was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby their opinion of the easy virtue of the opposite religious party . The rebel journal states , that Lady Botliwell signed a procuratory for the purpose , on the 5th of April ; the Queen was seized on the 24th , so that her step could hardly be owing , as they would have it // appear , to his connexion with the Queen , and in fact the reasons alleged by her have no reference to Mary . The contemporary Memoirs of Crawford inform us , that Morton and Murray kindly interfered , and helped forward the business to a favorable result ; for which they doubtless had sufficient reasons . Here we have an instance of Robertson 's consistency . Like a zealous Protestant , he tells us that in 1 566 , Mary deprived the Protestant Court of Commissaries of all authority , by way of restoring the Catholic religion but in the next year , as we learn from him , Lady Bothwell prosecuted her suit in this very court , which was retained by Mary for her Protestant subjects , while the Catholics appeared before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of both being properly consulted . The lords foresaw , that the design of Bothwell to secure the hand of the Queen might be easily turned to their own purposes ; and , witlout the least regard for honor or con* science , they aided him in his designs upon her person , in order to effect the ruin of both . The clear evidence of this is found in the famous bond of Aiuslie 's Supper . ' Bothwell invited the principal members of Parliament to meet him at Ainslie 's tavern , where he was to give them an entertaiument . He then made known to them his design to marry the Queen , and proposed to them to subscribe a bond , which declared him free of all suspicion relating to the murder , and recommended him as a suitable match for her ; the subscribers agreeing to advance the said marriage , by all the exertions and sacrifices in their power . Every thing about the transaction shows , as even Scott acknowledges , that the lords were prepared for this . Morton and Maitland of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example was followed by eight bishops , nine earls , and seven lords . From the nature of the case , there could have been no compulsion . The. *Earl of Eglintoune , the only one who declined subscribing , withdrew without molestation . The rest were probably engaged in the party either of Botbwell or the lords , who each believed that they were taking advantage of the other . It will be seen , that both l ) arties had an interest in representing the match as acceptable to the Queen ; Bothwell , in order to excuse his own presumption , and the lords in order to involve her in the guilt of Bothwell , which they intended to prove as soon as he was connected with her by popular opinion , in such a manner that the blow aimed at him should be death to her reputation . It is // impossible to take any view of this transaction , which xviii not exhibit these noblemen in the most disgraceful light ; and when it is considered that some of them were the worst enemies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging Bothwell at the expense of their own honor . Having thus , as he thought , prepared the way , he determined to seize her person ,  --  a plan winch was perfectly consistent with the habits of the age and country . We see no reason to doubt the account which Mary herself gives ,  --  that he endeavored by humble attentions to win her favor , but finding no success , determined to resort to violent measures . Assembling one thousand horse , under the pretext of border service , he met the Queen as she was coming from Stirling , and seizing the bridle of her horse , made himself master of her person , and suffered most of her attendants to go free . The author of Crawford 's Memoirs says , his men took the Earl of Huntly , Secretary Liddington , and me , and carried us captives to Dunbar ; all the rest were permitted to go . There the Earl of Bothwell boasted he would marry the Queen , who would or who would not ; yea , whether she would herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowed to go home . Mary herself says , that finding herself in his power , without any one to advise or aid her , and no attempt being made to rescue her fron his hands , she reproached him with his ingratitude and baseness . He humbly protested , that he was driven to the act by his passion for her , and his apprehensions for his own life . Finding that he made no favorable impression , he produced the bond signed at Ainslie 's supper . This showed her how little aid she was to expect from those who held the power of the kingdom in their hands , and she felt that she was given up to him as a prey . From the time of her capture , April 24 , to the 3d of May , he remained constantly with her , pressing his suit by all the arguments in his power . The rebel journal , an authority most unfriendly to her , says , she was by fear , force , and ( as by many conjectures may he well suspected ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Melvill says , the Queen could not but marry him , seeing he bad ravished her . ' The rebel journal says , he had in three months found such hap in an unhappy enterprise , that by the murder of the babe 's father , he had purchased a pretended marriage of the mother , seized her person in his hands , environed with a continual guard of two hundred harquebusiers // as well day as night . ' As Scott remarks , not a spear was lifted , not a sword was drawn , to save Mary from the power of that atrocious ruffian . ' Well might he add , that strong suspicions arose , that Morton , Lethington , and others of Mary 's counsellors were treacherously and ungratefully concerned in a plot , which was at once to destroy their sovereign 's fame and power . ' They did all in their power to force her into this ill-omened marriage , quieting the people by representing her as guilty , and confirming her guilt by pointing to these very circumstances , into which she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one whom they knew to be a murderer . Those who suppose that this seizure was the result of a conspiracy with Mary , are hound to show what temptation she had to engage in a plan , which would have carried deception on the face of it , supposing her to have been guilty . Mr. Laing and others say , it was to justify her precipitate marriage . But where was the inducement , on her part , to hasten the marriage ? According to their own account , marriage could give nothing to her more than she possessed already . They tell us , that Bothwell and Mary were living in open adultery ; that Bothwell had unbounded power in the State , and they can point out nothing that the Queen could have expected from such a sudden connexion ; while , on the contrary , it would seem as a public acknowledgement of her shame , and her enemies took care so to represent it . One remarkable circumstance must be carefully observed . The letters and sonnets , as we have said , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It so happens , that in one of the sonnets , she says , that she shed many tears , when he made himself possessor of this body , of which he had not then the heart . ' If these sonnets were genuine , then they afford conclusive evidence in this passage ,  --  the only one in which direct reference is made to Bothwell ,  --  that there was no attachment before the marriage ; for it must be remembered , that the sonnets were not written by her to mislead the public , but , as her enemies represent , were kept secret as the grave . If the sonnets were forged , as they doubtless were , this passage was introduced in order to help forward a charge against Both*vell , on which he was afterwards convicted , of seizing the person of the Queen . It is impossible to preserve consistency in misrepresentation ; and , when the enemies of Bothwell first ruin him by this charge against him , and afterwards dishonor the Queen by charging // her with throwing herself into his arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . One of the proclamations issued by the lords , with Morton at their head , begins thus : The lords of secret council and nobility , understanding that James , Earl of Bothwell , put violent hands on our sovereign lady 's most noble person on the 24th of April last , and thereafter warded her highness in the castle of Dunbar , which he had in keeping , and before a long space thereafter , conveyed hei ' majesty , environed with men of war , and such friends and kinsmen of his own as would do for him , ever into places where he had most dominion and power , her grace being destitute of all counsel and servants , during which time the said Earl seduced , by unlawful means , our said sovereign to a dishonest marriage with himself ; which from the beginning is null and of no effect . ' The proclamation was closed with a resolution to bring Bothwell to punishment , for ravishing and detaining the Queen 's person . ' Mary was already in their hands , but they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when that was resolved upon , the charge against her appears for the first time , according to the practice of that day , which seems to have been to manufacture charges and proofs , only as fast as they were wanted . The act of forfeiture against Bothwell , is the testimony of the lords themselves to the Queen 's innocence . After the King 's advocate had laid before Parliament his proofs to sustain the indictment , he was adjudged guilty by the three estates , for treasonably and violently arresting the Queen 's person on the high road ; for carrying her forcibly the same night to Dunbar castle , and therein detaining her by violence for the space of twelve days , and by force and fear compelling her to agree to marry him . ' if the accusation against the Queen had been thought of at this time , it would certainly have been brought forward ; they had nothing to fear ,  --  she was in their hands and in their power ; but they probably never thought of accusing her , till their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deprive her of her crown . The whole conduct of Mary after the marriage , shows that it was not the result of affection on either part . He kept her under constant guard , and showed by his treatment that he had no hold upon her heart . Melvill tells us , that he insulted her in such a manner before her attendants one day , that she called for a knife to despatch herself with ; and declared , that if this // resort was denied her , she would find some means to destroy her wretched life . The lords themselves , in a memorial to Throgmorton , state , that she could not have lived with him half a year . Melvill describes her appearance at Carherry-hill on the 15th of June . Many of those who were with her , were of opinion , that she had intelligence with the lords , then in arms and facing her , especially such as were informed of the many indignities put upon her by the Earl of Bothwell since their marriage . He was so beastly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in patience , without making her shed abundance of tears . ' It is strange , that in the short space of a month , their passion , supposing it to have existed , should have been changed into aversion . It seems clear , that no attachment ever existed ; but that Bothwell forced her to marry him in order to exalt himself , and that she yielded only when she found herself abandoned by all , dishonored in person , and given over to him by a confederacy of the nobles of her kingdom . The minister who published the banns , declared that he detested the marriage , but that the best part of the realm approved it , either by flattery or silence . Her conduct at Carberry-hill confirms what we have said . Mary was not the person to abandon one whom she had ever loved ; but she invited one of the rebel officers to a parley , agreed with him to order Bothwell away , and sent the officer himself with the order . Bothwell went away , and no farewell passed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then gave the officer her hand to kiss , and suffered him to lead her horse by the bridle over to the insurgent party . This officer was the celebrated Kirkaldy of Grange , who pledged the loyalty of his party to Mary , on condition of her dismissing Bothwell . Finding that they were disposed to treat the Queen with indignity , he resented it as an affront to his honor ; but in order to silence his scruples , Morton produced a pretended letter from Mary to Bothwell , in which she promised to meet him again . The forgery produced its effect on the unsuspecting soldier ; but after it had served the purpose of the moment , could never be seen nor heard of again . Sir William Kirkaldy was the Bayard of the age ,  --  almost a solitary example in Scotland , of chivalrous generosity and honor . He was probably convinced by his own observation , that the Queen was the victim of unprincipled men . Certain it is , that he embraced her party when her fortunes seemed most desperate , fought gallantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , and by Elizabeth 's or ( lers basely delivered over to Morton , died on the scaffold with a resolution worthy of his fame . It seems to us , that nothing but Mary 's aversion to the connexion with Bothwell could have made it nec.essary for him to seize her person . Had she been willing to marry him , the way was open . The first nobility of her kingdom had declared him innocent , and recommended him as her husband . Daraley was regretted by no man , and for all that appears , she might have formed this new connexion without a word of resistance or reproach . If her accusers say , that a sense of shame prevented it , they should remember , that their object is to prove that she was dead to shame ; that she was already connected with Bothwell in an infamous manner , and that she was continually publishing her own dishonor by showering honors on his head . Now if Mary were such as they represent her , it seems perfectly incredible , that she should resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required it . By pursuing the course which the lords had opened for her , her character would have been much less hazarded . They all confess , that she was a woman of admirable talent and address , and surely such a person would not have resorted to what they term a poor trick , ' when it was wholly uncalled for . A little attention to the proceedings of the Scottish lords from the beginning , will strengthen the presuml ) tion , that the difficulties in which Mary was involved , were owing to their conspiracies and crimes . When she first returned from France , they determined to resist her power from motives of interest and ambition , and were constantly encouraged in their resistance by the unprincipled policy of Elizabeth and her advisers . When she determined to marry Darnley , foreseeing that this connexion would put a stop to Mary 's unbounded liberality , they combined to prevent it ; and Murray arranged a plot , as was stated by Argyle , one of their number , to murder Daraley and his father , imprison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he afterwards attained and always had in view . Mary 's energy defeated their purpose , and they consoled themselves by signing a bond , in which they engaged to effect their object , at the same time requiring Elizabeth to give the aid which she had promised them . This conspiracy , attested by Melvill and Argyle himself , a rebel lord , throws abundant light on all the rest of their proceedings . Elizabeth // gave the aid which she promised ; but Mary marched against them with an army of eighteen thousand men , and drove them out of the country . Murray hastened to London , where he fell on his knees before Elizabeth , in presence of the French and Spanish ambassadors , and declared that the English Queen had never encouraged the rebellion against Mary . After driving him from her presence with contempt , she rewdrded his meanness by a paltry allowance for his support . Such was the beginning of their attempts to ruin Mary . There were several lords engaged in this enterprise , who had not committed themselves so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were Morton , Maitland of Lethington , Lindsay , and Ruthven . Finding Darnley discontented with Mary , who sometimes checked his brutal excesses , they induced him to make common cause with them . In Rizzio , Mary had a shrewd and friendly adviser , whose sagacity and influence they leared . They attempted to excite Darnlcy 's jealousy against him , and succeeded , though all historians now allow , that the charge is one which could not possibly be true . These precious associates hound themselves to murder him and sevemal others , each stipulating for a palt of the spoil , which they doubted not would soon fall to their share . Rizzio , as is well known , was murdered under circumstances of atrocious cruelty , both to him and to the Queen . Murray and Argyle left England as soon as they heard of it ; but Mary 's loyal subjects sustained her in such a manner , that Darnley was compelled to disavow all connexion with the murderers , and they fled from Scotland . The lords considered the murder of Rizzio as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protecting them according to the bond , he had acquiesced in the measures against them , they determined to have their revenge , both on him and Mary . As Murray and his associates were not then known to have been concerned in this last affront to her person , Mary generously forgave him , when she banished Morton and his companions , requiring him at the same time to renounce all connexion with the latter . Murray joyfully acceded to this , and this kindness on the part of Mary was , as might have been expected , repaid after the manner of the viper ; it was the cause of her future woe . At the time of Murray 's flight , the Earl of Bothwell was his enemy , and of course rose as he fell . Bothwell is described // by Buchanan , as remarkably unattractive in person and manners ; and if so , he was not the most likely man to fascinate the Queen . But he had always been loyal , and at the time of Rizzio 's murder , had made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much desperate courage , with very little intellect and no principle , his personal qualifications , together with his interest with the Queen , pointed him out to the lords as a suitable instrument of their designs ; and by promising that his reward should be the hand of Mary , they engaged him to murder her husband . Scott says , Maitland , Huntley , Argyle , Bothwell , and others , were accessory to these dark consultations , and we can not suppose Murray wholly ignorant of them . ' The fact of the conspiracy of the lords to murder Darnley , is now well known ; and it is perfect evidence of Mary 's innocence of this crime ; for that she conspired with such associates , no one will pretend . They took advantage of that facility of disposition , which was her ruin ; and , during the festivities at the christening of her son , prevailed on her to consent to the recall of Morton . The plan of divorce , which would have released her without difficulty from her worthless husband , she firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blood . Paris 's confession , which the enemies of Mary rely much upon , states , that Murray knew the plan , and declared , that he would neither help nor hinder . Morton confessed at his trial , that he was acquainted with the design , but refused to take part , unless by authority from the Queen , which Bothwell could not obtain ; he , however , was fully proved guilty . We do not see how it is possible to maintain , that Mary was connected in a conspiracy with such persons , who were afterwards her accusers , and yet were never able to bring one particle of direct evidence against her . It seems clear to us , that the charge could not possibly be true . What was the conduct of these lords after the murder , when suspicion , directed probably by themselves , began to fix itself upon Bothwell ? He was present at Murray 's entertainments , and at the very trial which they afterwards coodemned as so lawless a proceeding , he was attended by Maitland and Morton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from friendship for Bothwell . They unquestionably had a design of their own , which was to help him forward in his career , till he was connected with the Queen in such a manner , that by ruining him , which was at any time in their power , they might involve het* // in the same destruction . But the single circumstance of their consenting to second a villain and murderer , ' whose guilt they confess that they were fully acquainted with , is enough to cover them with disgrace ; and assuredly we should hesitate before we credit charges advanced and sustained by such accusers , especially when they pretend to be actuated by a zeal for good morals and reformed religion . Nor was this the only suspicious and dishonorable circumstance in their conduct . When Bothwell demands the price of his guilt , and finds that he has no interest in Mary 's affections , they sign an instrument , in which they acquit him of all charge and suspicion , and recommend him as her husband . The chivalrous Lord Herries lifts up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joins him , though they afterwards profess to be so much shocked and disgusted at the proceeding . One word from them would have arrested Bothwell , as it afier*vards did , when he was in greater power ; hut the time to speak that word was not yet come . They give her up to him , on purpose to be dishonored , and when they think that her hold upon the respect and affection of her subjects is lost , they turn upon Bothwell , charge him with treason for acting in accordance with their own recommendation , and for marrying the person whom they had placed in his hands . Till he is ruined , they profess the utmost attachment to Mary ; they never intimate that her fair fame is darkened by a shadow of suspicion ; and they declare , that Bothwell , for forcing her to a marriage by extraordinary and unlawful means , ' the nature of which is darkly hinted , is a traitor , and that they will pursue him to the death . Let it he observed , that when Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerfully to their own terms , they never ask that Bothwell shall be secured ; they request her to send him away . The reason is obvious ; they knew that if he were seized , he might bring out evidence enough against themselves ; they therefore give him an oppor* tunity to escape from the country ,  --  a course which they would not have pursued , if they had known themselves innocent , and desired to punish him simply for his guilt . When Bothwell is thus disposed of , the time for Mary 's ruin is come . They send assurances of respect and loyalty to her by an honorable soldier , and as soon as she trusts their honor , and puts herself in their power , they treat her as a prisoner , tmd throw her into Lochleven castle . In the face of theh ' // previous declarations , they now declare , that so far from being forced into a marriage with Bothwell , it had been the object nearest her heart . rfo effect it , she had murdered her former husband ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just declared Bothwell an outlaw , was no violence , but a stratagem planned by herself , to cover her impatience to unite herself with her lover . This is an acknowledgement that their charge against Bothwell was untrue . How they sustain the charge against Mary , we have already seen . Taking into view the whole course of their conduct , as successive disclosures have now made it manifest to the world , it is difficult to doubt , that they had marked out a purpose for themselves from the beginning , which they pursued with an unscrupulous and unrelenting zeal . They place Mary in a prison , where she shall be most expose ( l to insult and privation ; there they torture her into an abdication of her crown ; her illegitimate brother , Murray , who owes all to her generosity , rises upon her ruin , and becomes Regent of the realm ; some time after his death , his power devolves on the Earl of Morton . Such was their object , and the means by which it was accomplished . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to languish in prisons , and at last to be murdered under the forms of law ; but her enemies , who , even supposing her guilty , were certainly profligate and hypocritical men , did not escape their share of retribution . Murray was shot by a man who had been injured by one of his favorites ; Morton was tried and executed for the murder of Darnley ; and Maitland escaped the scaffold by putting an etid to his own existence . We certainly consider Mary as their victim ; but we are confident , that when hereditary prejudices have passed away , the impartial voice of history will pronounce her not guilty . The fate of Bothwell was such as his crimes deserved . He fled to the Orkneys , and after a short time was taken by the Danes , and imprisoned in consequence of some alleged piratical attempts against their trade . A curious manuscript , found in the royal library at Dr*ttningliolm in Sweden , has lately been translated and sent to England , authenticated in a manner , which places it beyond suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevalier de Dantzay was residing in the north , as ambassador from France to Sweden and Denmark . During his residence at Copenhagen , the Earl of Bothwell arrived . Lie had fled with his followers in several vessels from Scotland , // and being unable to land , and driven about by contrary winds , had been thrown on the coast of Norway , and there taken by Danish seamen , who carried him to their own country . While in prison there , he sent a memorial to M. de Dantzay , who took the requisite steps in his behalf . This memorial is only valuable , as showing how so notorious an offender proceeds in his attempts at self-justification , lie attributes all his OWfl misfortunes to the agency and coalitions of Murray ; and , in fact , it is evident enough that Murray opposed the Queen 's marriage , in the hope of being her successor ; and that when this hope was destroyed by the birth of a prince , his ambition contented itself with the reality without the name of royal power . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles in Scotland were principally owing to English machinations . He declares , that Mary imprisoned him shortly after her return from France , in consequence of false charges brought against him by Murray ; but he did not consider it evidence of oppression on her part , because there never was a time after her return from France , when she had any thing more than the shadow of power . He also mentions , that at the time of Rizzio 's murder , he was himself marked out in the instrument signed by Darnley and the lords , for a similar fate ; and here he is supported by other testimony , from which it appears ; that Bothwell , Huntley , and four others , were to have been assassinated at the same time . He says , that the way in which they escaped , after offering an ineffectual resistance , was by leaping from a window at the back of the building . Thus far , his narrative is consistent with other evidence , and is , probably , true ; but from the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give any clear account of his conduct , and , therefore , passes lightly over all subsequent transactions . He says , that when the lords determined to murder Darnley , they endeavored to make him their friend , in order to destroy him more effectually , and he confesses , that he did intercede with the Queen for their restoration to favor ; but he declares that he acted without any interested motive , and solely from his natural good feeling . After the murder , they endeavored by reports and placards to fix the guilt upon him . When he had been fully acquitted by the Parliament , they offered to promote his marriage with the Queen . He says nothing of the seizure of her person . He says that the Queen did not send word to him to retire from the field at // Carberry-hill , till she was already secured in the hands of the rebels by false professions , which he advised her to distrust ; on the whole , it would seem that he tells the story correctly enough , with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew that all deceivers must insert as large a measure of truth as possible , in order to give a coloring of probability to the falsehood . Having thus represented the facts bearing on this question , as fairly as we are able , we must remind our readers , that if they should not he satisfied with Mary 's marriage with Bothwell , it will by no means follow , that she was guilty of her husband 's death . If that thorough-going villain did actually gain a place in her affections , ( and we see no proof of it ) it seems impossible , considering the persons with whom he is now known to have been connected , that Mary should have had any share in that atrocious crime . We think that all her reproach and sorrow were owing to a base conspiracy to destroy her life and power , which Cecil himself confesses could not be done without dishonoring her fame . She was a woman of extraordinary talents , no doubt ; but she was cast at once without preparation , into the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusion , in which he represents the rude waves as growing civil at her song , ' has no more foundation in fact , than the compliments which he pays to the vestal fame of Elizabeth . The whole conduct of the Queen of England with respect to Mary , can not be regarded by any good mind without abhorrence . In the first place , she abused the power which accident gave her over a rival , in circumstances where , if she had had one spark of generosity or common principle , she would have given her countenance and protection ; instead of this , she kept her in close confinement , and with , necessity , the tyrant 's plea , excused her devilish deeds . ' All the luxuries of life were taken from her one by one , and at last , she was in want of those comforts , which the state of her health rendered necessary . It was doubtless thought , that this treatment would destroy her , but as her miserable existence was still prolonged , Elizabeth , in a letter which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to murder their prisoner , and complained of them for not having done it before . Assassination is not to the taste of Englishmen , and slavish as they were in other respects , they declared that they would not be induced by any consideration , to take the guilt // of blood upon their souls . She then orders Davidson , the secretary , to forward the warrant for iVIary 's execution ; and the moment it is done past recall , declares , with much affected sorrow , that it was done in defiance of her orders , and ruins the secretary for his obedience to her command . It was , however , the only act of kindness she had ever done to Nary , who , though accused of living in adultery and murder , died with the gentle , sweet , and hoiy firmness of a martyr , rejoicing to go and appeal to that tribunal , where sovereigns and subjects are equal ,  --  before the King of kings . We have made no reference to Mr. Bell 's Life of Mary , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this question . His limits as a popular writer , did not allow him to dwell at great length on this part of her history . His work is a pleasant narrative , and well calculated for general use in this day , when it is become so common to expand a little matter into two octavo volumes , that readers have been almost in despair . He takes a favorable view of Mary 's character ; hut seems free from prejudice either for her or against her . In one respect , his candor is excessive , in our opinion ; he seems to think , that the advocates of the Queen have injured her cause by their severe treatment of Murray . It was certainly deserved ; for whether Mary were innocent or guilty , his conduct to a sister , who had treated him with tinwearied kindness , and loaded him with favors and distinctions , was ungrateful in the extreme ; it is folly to attempt to defend it . Whatever his traditional reputation in Scotland may be , it will not be easy to persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conspiracies of the day was to advance his power , he himself was ignorant of them ; that others , who had every thing to lose , were committing every kind of crime for his benefit , while he himself , who had every thing to gain , was unconscious of their guilt . With this exception , we can recommend Mr. Bell 's work to our readers ; and we believe that the statement he gives of the transactions of that day is substantially just.
