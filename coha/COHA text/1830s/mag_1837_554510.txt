txt JUDGE Hall 's work reached us at a late period of the passage of this number through the press , and we have only had opportunity to look at the " preface , " which , to use his language , he " appends " thereto . Of this , our journal is the principal theme . Judge Hall is at issue with us respecting the merits of his previous publication , the " Sketches of History , Life , and Manners in the West , " reviewed in our ninety-second number That he should be , is the most natural thing in the world ; it is on this very point , that author and critic are likeliest of all to differ . We were entertained with his work , and we gave him praise enough for it , one would think , " To fill the ambition of a common man . " // But we had a character for critical honesty to maintain , and we threw in the following qualifying paragraph . " Judge Hall is not an accurate writer . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he informs us that Sir William Johnson purchased of the Six Nations , in 1768 , their claim to the lands on the northwest side of the Ohio to the Great Miami . This does not appear on the treaty . Page 251 represents two grants from the Cherokees to Henderson and his company ; whereas it appears there was only one , the other being a grant to the Crown in 1770 . On page 31 ( Vol. ii. ) he alters the date of the purchase of Louisiana , from 1803 to 1795 , probably confounding it with the Spanish treaty of 1795 . On page . 36 , he comes to the conclusion that there was nothing treasonable in the Spanish conspiracy on a dispassionate consideration of the whole matter . ' But in this dispassionate consideration , he has wholly omitted the most treasonable features , saying nothing of the proposal made through Power in 1797 to withdraw from the Federal Union , and to form a government " wholly unconnected with that of the Atlantic States " ; nothing of the one hundred thousand dollars offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and nothing of the concealinent of the whole matter , by all concerned All this looks a little treasonable . On page 119 he calls Kaskaskia a garrisoned town , when the fort was unoccupied , and the town defended only by militia ; and , on page 124 , he tells us that the capture of Vincennes in 1779 led to the settlement of Louisville in 1778 . " Hiuc ilice laclmryrnce . " The paragraph , " says Judge Hall , in the first place , " is not original , the allegations contained in it having been earlier made in a Western periodical by Mr. Butler , the historian of Kentucky . " So be it . The charges are none the less likely to he true , for being made by two witnesses instead of one ; nor is a critic to blame , for consulting different sources of information upon the subject which he treats ; nor is want of originality any fault in a historical argument . On this subject of originality , Judge Hall will do well to revise his conclu* *f he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too original , lie confounds too much the departments of history and romance . Let him give to the incidents of his histories less originality , and to those of his romances more , and he will find that both will profit . Does he remember how Blumenbach once spoke of a book ? It was thus ; " There are in it many things which are new , and many which are true . But the things which are new are not true , and the things which are true are not new . " - Our own remarks , which he disputes , relate to questions of history . So we but show them to be true , we are not careful to have them appear to be fruits of any inventive genius . " Judge hall , " we said , " informs us that Sir William Johnson purchased of the Six Nations , in 1768 , their claim to the lands on the northwest side of the Ohio to the Great Miami . // This does not appear on the treaty . " The treaty in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , in the Appendix to Mr. Butler 's History . We repeat , the cession spoken of is not there . There were two ways for Judge Hall to meet us on this point . One , hy referring to the passage , in which he supposes the conveyance to be made ; the other , by denying the printed treaty to he a true copy . He has done neither ; and the only reasonable conclusion is , that he sees himself to have fallen into a mistake , which he does not like to acknowledge . Yet it would have been better to acknowledge it , than to fall out with us for good-naturedly , though truly , charging it . - What he does in his embarrassment , is a thing wholly irrelevant to the issue . He quotes Mr. Butler as saying , " this title , as has been maintained , was alienated to the British Crown , " &amp;c . But if Mr. Butler had averred , not only that the cession had been maintained to have been made , hut had been indubitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been nothing to the question of accuracy between Judge Hall and ourselves . We suppose that he was led into the erroneous statement by a misapprehension of those very words of Mr. Butler , which he now quotes in his attempt at defence . Again , we said ; " Page 251 represents two grants to Ijenderson and his company ; whereas it appears there was only one . " Judge Hall replies , that he has in his possession the original documents , which he will show us , if we will call upon him . We will not fail to do so , the first time that we go to Ohio , if he remains as well disposed towards us as now , and as much inclined to accompany us in our historical researches . Meanwhile , we are quite sure , upon the faith of his statement , that two deeds were given ; and we are about equally sure , that , in some way , we are playing at cross purposes with him , upon this point . We presume we may venture the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can a proprietor give two successive deeds of an estate , though he may give duplicate copies of the same . If a first grant is entitled to the name of a grant , it conveys ; and that which is conveyed is not retained , to be the subject of future conveyance . In the present instance , the lands which were the subject of what Judge Hall calls the second deed to Henderson and his company in 1775 , are specifically described by him ( " Sketches of the West , " Vol. i. p. 251 ) ; and they are the same which , by the treaty of Lochaber in South Carolina , October 13th , 1770 , had been granted by the Indians to the Crown . In Butler 's History ( introduction , p. li. ) , the domain may be found defined in an extract from that treaty . What kind of document Henderson , five years later , took from // the Indians in relation to it , we can not conjecture ; but it would be wasting words to argue , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense the subject of a transfer from them to his company . What Judge Hall calls the next count in the indictment in our article , relates to the date of the purchase of Louisiana , which we said he had changed from 1803 to 1795 , probably confounding it with the Spanish treaty of the latter year . - To this he replies warmly , averring that " there is not a single date of any description on page 31 , Vol. ii. , nor is the purchase of Louisiana stated , on that or any other page of the work , to have occurred in 1795 . " He had , however , at the place referred to , after speaking of events of the year 1795 , proceeded as follows ; " It happened that , very shortly after these events , the purchase of Louisiana , by the government of the United States , settled the long agitated question in reference to the navigation of the Mississippi , " &amp;c . We supposed , when we read this , that we were reading English ; and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if- remarking on a writer , who had spoken of the strife of parties at the close of Mr. Adams 's administration , and then had added , " shortly after , the election of Mr. Van Buren to the presidency caused a temporary cessation of hostilities , " - we had suggested , that the date of Mr. Van Buren s election in 1836 , had been confounded with that of General Jackson , in 1828 . Henceforward , however , we stand corrected in the premises ; and should we undertake again to criticize Judge Hall , we shall remember not only how " cunning of fence " he is , but how unsafe is the application to him of an argument founded on the usages of language . We understand him now to say , that when he spoke of certain events , as having occurred " shortly after " others , which belong to the early part of 1795 , he meant that they took place in 1803 . But really , if he is disposed to such a fantastic use of words , he should accompany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Else , as historical authorities , the peculiarity of his rhetoric will render his works as unsatisfactory , as xvould the want of proper information . Of our fourth assertion , relating to the so- called " Spanish Conspiracy , " Judge Hall says , that " it consists of several distinct misapprehensions and misstatements . " Of the " several , " he simplifies our labor by specifying two ; one , that we suppose the merely being addressed by treasonable proposals to be a treasonable act ; the other , that we have believed and affirmed , that the proposals made by the Spanish governor were treasonably concealed by some of the persons solicited . In respect to // the first , the fault is with the finder . We have entertained no such thought as he supposes , nor implied that we entertained it , having , on the contrary , expressly rested the suspicion of treasonable purpose on the ground of concealment . As to the second point , when Judge Hall ventures a denial of such concealment , he does it in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings of the Kentucky Legislature , in the year 1806 . In that year , an inquiry was moved into the conduct of Benjamin Sebastian , a Judge of Ap* peals of the State of Kentucky , and a Committee was appointed with power to send for persons and papers . By this examination was the fact brought to light , that Sebastian , while in high official station in Kentucky , had been receiving for years an annual pension of two thousand dollars from the king of Spain . Before the same Committee , Judge Innes disclosed the treasonable offers made to himself and others , nine or ten years before . This concealment of nine or ten years , was , according to Judge Hall , no concealment whatever . He vehemently rebukes us for calling it so . Yet Judge lanes thought otherwise ; for he was at no small pains to excuse himself before the Legislature , for not having earlier revealed what had been done . Our fifth animadversion was , on the description of Kaskaskia by Judge Hall , as " a garrisoned town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defended only by militia . " He urges , on the contrary , that a town which has a fort is fortified , and one which has militia is garrisoned . Here , again , is but a question respecting the lawful and convenient use of words . If , in the next edition of " Statistics of the West , " its author should see fit to qualify Cincinnati and Louisville as " garrisoned towns , " this is a free country , and there is no authority to stay him moreover , both Cincinnati and Louisville have decaying forts , and a militia quite as good as was that of Kaskaskia . But his readers ought to be forewarned , that his use of language is peculiar . There was an ancient who professed , " ficum voco ficum , et ligonem ligonem " ; but Judge Hall is not of his school . As we do not find that he has taken notice of our last observation , upon the anachronism , by which the capture of Vincennes was represented as a cause of the settlement of Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hastily speaks of having refuted " each of the several charges of inaccuracy , brought by the North . American . " Judge Hall , having found fault with our censure , proceeds to find fault with our praise . After partly discharging our consciences in relation to his slips , we proceeded in our good-will , to say , " these are small matters , " and to " recommend the // Sketches ' to our readers as a work full of entertaining anecdote and description . " At the inconsistency of this , he is confounded ; wondering and chiding , that we should recommend a work as not wanting in entertainment , which we said was wanting in accuracy , and some other merits . But that which is a problem to Judge Hall* was none to Dr. Samuel Johnson . He said , of a hook of his day , in language stronger than our benevolence suffered us to use , " though it is sufficiently defective to crush the vanity of its author , it is sufficiently entertaining to invite readers . " Judge Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what , he says , a volume is generally furnished with a preface to proclaim , viz , that " none are so indifferent as to its fate , as him who gave it existence , " turns upon us , towards its close , in the stoutest Iliercies ' vein , with what they call , in the schools , an argumenturn ad invidiam . In the article , which has offended him , we took occasion to speak of the character of the population of the West , and particularly of the Kentucky character ; and we gave , substantially , the same account of it , which has been given by various writers . We said it was a cha *cter of impulse , both in its merits and defects ; that , warm , generous , free , and bold , it was also inconsiderate , unconstrained , and headlong . We went so far as distinctly to imply , that the Kentucky genius contained the elements and the promise of a character of the most singular vigor and elevation . But , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius tended ; and , respecting ourselves , and those of whom we were writing , we chose not to speak of those faults vaguely and tamely . All this Judge Hall understands as outrageous denunciation , comparing , in his lively way , a part of the language in question , which happens to come at " the sequel of the article , " to " the drop of poison upon the sting of the venomous insect . " If we supposed this to be artifice , we should be content to tell him , that he underrates the nobility of nature of the western people , and wildly overrates his own capacity , when he thinks he can excite their displeasure against a discriminating statement of their faults and virtues ; and it might help him to understand this , if he would observe the fact , that the article he censures has been quoted with strong commendation in the Kentucky journals . But we are rather fain to regard the erroneous interpretation , which he puts upon us , as hut a further proof of that idiosyncrasy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have remarked above . Nothing more is the matter with him , in this instance as in the rest , than that he has crude perceptions of the settled force of language.
