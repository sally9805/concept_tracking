TO HIS EXCELLENCY , LEWIS CASS , GOVERNOR OF THE TERRITORY OF MICHIGAN , THE ABLE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO HIS CHARGE , AS WELL AS OF THE EXTENSIVE AND COMPLICATED CONCERNS OF THE NUMEROUS TRIBES OF ABORIGINES , INHABITING THE COUNTRY OF PONTIAC , THIS PIECE IS DEDICATED , BY HIS FAITHFUL AND AFFECTIONATE FRIEND , THE AUTHOR . 1826 . PREFACE . The scene of this piece is laid at Detroit , in the Territory of Michigan , and it is founded on historical facts . In the year 1760 , the British forces in America obliged the French to abandon all their posts on the Canadian Lakes , and took possession of them . The Indians , confederated under Pontiac , their Great Chief , were in alliance with the French ; and , although their allies were forced to abandon their possessions to the British , the Indians were determined not to yield , but to endeavour , by every possible means , to drive the British out of their country , and regain all that the French had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chief of extraordinary abilities and enterprise . His influence over the savages was unbounded , and his views not less extensive . He conceived the grand design of attacking simultaneously all the posts within his reach , and the Indians , under his direction , did actually surprise and take by stratagem Verrango , Le Boeuf , Presqulc , Michilimackinac , Sandusky , Miami , St. Josephs , and Massac . The attack on Detroit Pontiac reserved for himself , it being , in his opinion , not only the most difficult but the most important enterprise . His plan for the surprise of Detroit is correctly stated in the Drama , and the whole piece is historically true , with the exception of the capture of Pontiac on board the Gladwin , and the manner of his death . The vessel was attacked as stated , and the Indians withdrew on the firing of the great guns as represented . The manner of Pontiac 's death has been variously stated . By some it is represented that on the general pacification of the Indians , Pontiac , finding himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the English , fled to the Illionis . By others , that Pontiac , who was an Ottawa , married a Peori , whom he abused in so shocking a manner , that his wife 's tribe sought an opportunity of surprising him when he was alone , and killed him . The Ottawas , one of the most warlike nations in the northern parts of America , felt the loss of their Chief so severely , that they resolved to take revenge , made a descent on the Peories , who inhabited the country bordering on Lake Peorie , and exterminated the whole race . But Carver , who travelled in the Indian country about this period , relates , that after the peace concluded at the Miami towns with the confederated tribes by General Bradstreet , when on his way to the relief of Detroit with a considerable force , Pontiac manifested a friendly disposition , and seemed to have laid aside the animosity he had hitherto borne towards the English , and apparently became their zealous friend . To reward this new attachment , and to insure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handsome pension . But his restless and intriguing spirit would not suffer him either to be quiet or to be grateful for his allowance . His conduct at length became so suspicious , that in the year 1767 , going to hold a council in the country of the Illinois , a faithful Indian , who was either commissioned by one of the English Governors , or instigated by the love he bore the English , attended him as a spy ; and , being convinced from the speech made by Pontiac in the council , that he still retained his former prejudices against those for whom he professed a friendship , plunged his knife into Pontiac 's heart , as soon as he had done speaking , and laid him dead on the spot . The forces employed against the French and Canadians in this war were composed of Royal and Provincial troops . The former were raised in Europe , the latter in the American Colonies , now the United States . It was universally known , though not acknowledged by the British officers , that the Provincials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the American continent . This efficiency arose from their mode of life , their knowledge of the woods , and especially of the manners , character , and habits of the Indians and Canadians . The Colonists entered into the war against the French and savages with great zeal , and exhibited on all occasions uncommon firmness , perseverance , and enterprise . Still there always existed great jealousy between the royal and colonial troops , arising partly from the assumed superiority of the former over the latter , but mostly from the uncourteous manner in which the latter were treated , both by the British commanders and their subordinate officers , who pretended to regard the Americans as their inferiors . The Americans , although naturally unassuming , could not tamely submit to such arrogance . Hence repeated banters and retorts among the younger officers ensued , which often led to consequences of the most fatal character . PROLOGUE . This night , good friends , are offered to your view Scenes of a nature altogether new : The savage native of this blessed land Will now in character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nature so , But ' t is because depressed by us so low . When first we saw him in his pristine state , The native knew not what it was to hate . Free as the air he roamed the forests o'er , Rich in that freedom , otherwise quite poor . The stranger then might move through all the land , And meet the savage with a naked hand ; A hearty welcome in his wigwam find , And every treatment of the generous kind . The streams and woods supplied his scanty fare , Whoever called , with him that fare he 'd share ; And little else than these did he possess , Not e'en a covering one could call a dress ; Yet , having once received the stranger 's hand , He gave to him the freedom of his land , To plant , to hunt , to trade , to settle too , With all the comforts which the Indian knew . The game was soon by the white stranger killed , And next the earth in various ways he tilled , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the miseries of the savage life , No hunting more , no living free from strife ; The pois'nous liquor made the natives mad , Destroyed their happiness , and left them sad : Their conduct then put on a furious mien ; Murder and strife among themselves were seen ; Disease next followed in the dreadful train , With all the vices ever known to men . When thus enfeebled by this dreadful state , The wily white man leaves them to their fate . They quit the salt seas , the fresh lakes to roam , And find new comforts in a distant home . The French , who settled on the Iroquois , Joined with the natives in the savage law ; They learned their language , and their manners too , The hunter 's life with them they did pursue . At length , the crafty French , to circumvent These Colonies , a powerful army sent , To plant her flag on Britain 's thin domain , And with the Indians all her posts maintain . A war ensued ; the Gaul was overcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Indians now contend in single hand , Try to regain possession of their land ; Their brave Chief Pontiac commands the whole , And of this war renewed he is the soul : None better skilled in warlike enterprise , In daring action he each foe defies ; He stakes his life his country to defend , And in that noble duty finds his end . Historic record , with tradition true , Brings all these subjects now before your view , Should they but interest and please you too , There 's nothing more remains for us to do . DRAMATIS PERSON .

SCENE I. A street in Detroit .  --  Ultina standing near a door . Ultina . Ultina Why shall I disclose to the white man the plots which Pontiac meditates for his destruction ? Have the British people done any thing to deserve mercy at our hands ? No ! no ! they have not . Still we ought not to condemn all , for the acts of those who use power for gain , rather than for the benefit of their fellow-men . But the great white Chief has been kind to me , and to my family . I can not leave one so good to the wrath of Pontiac ; for implacable is his raging ire , and more dreadful his revenge .  --  But woman 's heart leads her to save , not to destroy . Pontiac 's secret schemes I can not withhold from the good white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gladwin . Colonel Gladwin How strange it is to see yon Indian woman still meditating in the open street , instead of retiring to her retreat , the shady woods .  --  Come hither , Ultina , and tell the cause of thy remaining here , and whence this seeming sorrow ? Ult . Ultina O great Chief ! I am indeed perplexed . Designs of death are brooding now , more terrible than the tempest , more portentous than the earthquake . Regard for you has checked my course towards my leafy home , while duty to my country urges me to fly this place . Glad . Colonel Gladwin Why these forebodings ? Dost thou apprehend that the white man will harm thee or thy people ? Ult . Ultina No , no , great Chief ! quite otherwise . Glad . Colonel Gladwin What then ? does any thing disturb thee ? Relate it , that all may be righted . Ult . Ultina You know not my thoughts , nor the preparations on which they dwell ;  --  but for your sake alone I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickets surround our camp , the chiefs of all the tribes for more than three days and nights have been in council met . Famine and death have greatly afflicted us poor creatures of the forest , and now Pontiac calls aloud for vengeance on the authors of our miseries . Against you and all your people does he direct his wrath . He has already fully convinced his warriors of the justice of his cause . His plan , which I overheard , is thus laid :  --  On the day fixed for the approaching council , to which you have invited Pontiac and his warriors , they are to come prepared , with their fire-arms all shortened , the better to conceal them beneath their robes ; and , when in his address Pontiac adverts to a particular well known act , he will drop the wampum from his hand , a signal for the attack and massacre of yourself and all within and without the Council-hall , save our good allies , the French . " And thus , " said he , " having destroyed our natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long-lost independence . " Thus spoke the Chief , and all approved and applauded what he said . Glad . Colonel Gladwin Is it possible ? ' T was but yesterday we mutually resolved on a truce , that we might settle the terms of a peace .  --  ' T is well .  --  I think thee , Ultina , for this intelligence , however ill it suits my views . Thy fidelity shall not go unrewarded . Return to thy camp . Should'st thou discover aught of movement , straight let me know . Exit Ultina , L. H. Enter Major Delzel and Major Rogers . Glad . Colonel Gladwin You have arrived most opportunely . Yon faithful Indian woman has just disclosed to me Pontiac 's designs . Delzel . Major Delzel And what are the designs of the savage chieftain ? Are they still hostile , after the council of yesterday , held within these walls , when the basis of a peace was discussed ? Glad . Colonel Gladwin Yes , Delzel , his designs are deeply hostile . He views us as the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the endearing appellation of brothers . To-morrow , at our meeting in council , Pontiac is to appear at the head of his red warriors , who , like himself , are to come with the face of peace , whilst treacherously concealing their arms beneath their blankets ; and , the Chief , in the midst of his address , is to give the signal for a general massacre by the dropping of his wampum , and then he designs ferociously to butcher every British subject within his grasp . Delz . Major Delzel Scarce can I believe that Pontiac could act so basely , for he has long been counted a brave and generous foe . But never did his reputation stand so low as now in my estimation . Perhaps the maid , whose zeal has brought her hither , may fancy all , and really know nothing . Yet , as my counsel has been asked , I would advise strict secrecy , to avoid all alarm among the women and the weak-hearted , but to prepare for the event . Glad . Colonel Gladwin Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ability to counsel well on this affair . So let me have your advice . Rogers . Major Rogers Since I am called to give my opinion , I shall be brief , but freely speak my mind .  --  Pontiac is well known to be a deep-designing Chief , skilled alike in dissimulation and surprise . To be prepared at every point now becomes our solemn duty ; and a counterplot , to meet his fell designs , appears to me the plan most proper to be pursued . Then , without giving information of the scheme which the Indian Chieftain meditates , strengthen every guard . Let that at the main gate be double , for thereat alone the savages are permitted to enter the city ; and , having allowed a free passage to a sufficient number , including Pontiac , let drop the portcullis , and seize the wretches . Ascertain the fact , whether or not they be armed with concealed weapons , as Ultina has told us . We may then detain the faithless chiefs as hostages , and punish them as they deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honest course are means most apt to make him fear our power and respect our persons . Glad . Colonel Gladwin Thanks to you both for your good advice . In the Council-hall we 'll take our seats . In our rear , against the wall , let our dauntless grenadiers be posted , facing like ourselves the places assigned the wily Pontiac and his painted warriors . The King 's troops and his brave provincials will be paraded at their respective posts , to preserve peace within , and repel every attack from without . These are my commands .  --  Now , then , each depart , and be prepared against the coming council . Exeunt Delz. and Rog . L. H. , Glad . R. H. SCENE II .

They arrange themselves on each side of the stage ; Pontiac somewhat in advance of the rest . ( Col. Gladwin addresses Pontiac , L. H. ) Glad . Colonel Gladwin The war , which has so long been waged by the King of France and his Canadian subjects against our great King and his good people , is at length terminated . The hand of friendship is now extended to you and your nation by our good King , who , though all-powerful , knows how to forgive as well as to conquer . color=redPage 19 Pontiac . Pontiac At your request , with my chiefs and warriors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said we have listened . On what you propose we must reflect . The war , which seems to have been so dreadful to you , was to us but a pleasure . Against the enemies of our race it is our duty as well as our pride to contend . How comes it that you should invade these distant regions , and leave a country and a King you delight so much to praise ? Is war the trade of the British King ? What brings him here to destroy our friends and allies , and to ruin us ? From the day that the British King sought conquest and dominion in these distant parts  --  these plains and forests , these rivers and these lakes , have been the scenes of nought but dismay , rapine , desolation , and murder . Was it for the destruction of the red people , or was it to contend for the skins which the Great Spirit gave the animals of the woods and waters , to protect them from the heat of the summer 's scorching sun or from winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals were the property of our ancestors , and are the right of our remaining tribes . We are poor , but not so depressed as to forget that it is our duty , as well as our interest , to protect our race from the oppression of strangers . We can not consent to your remaining here , where you have no land , but what you acquire by force and usurpation .  --  Retire then from our lakes and woods , and we may listen to your over-tures of peace .  --  Till then , the sons of the forest can not offer a hand to shake or a pipe to smoke . Glad . Colonel Gladwin You may undervalue our friendship , Pontiac , and pretend to despise our power . But for these warriors of the king , your cowardly designs might have been attempted . Why did you not let fall the wampum , as the signal of your treachery ? Well may you hang your heads . Do you suppose that aught you do or think is not known to me ? The Great Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advise them of the evil intentions of their enemies . It is now within our power to retaliate , Pontiac . I advise you to peace . Learn to cultivate your fields , and pursue no longer the precarious chase . Return to your camp , and on another day come and say that peace is your wish , and you may claim the King 's protection ;  --  our mercy you now experience , and hereafter you 'll esteem our friendship . Pontiac . Pontiac I 'll consider your proposition , when my warriors are in camp assembled . You 'll find me ready , at my country 's call , to ask for peace , or to lead our brave men to battle . Music .  --  Exeunt Pontiac and Chiefs , L. H. Glad . Colonel Gladwin What means this artful fellow ? His words are equivocal , and his gestures strange .

A distant view of the Indian camp from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Yelling and firing of small arms are heard without . Flourish .  --  Colonel Gladwin and Major Rogers enter from opposite sides of the stage . Glad . Colonel Gladwin What 's all this noise ? Rogers . Major Rogers No sooner had Pontiac and his chiefs passed the barrier , than they turned furiously on the outer guard , and made a general attack . The place is now surrounded , and in full beleaguer . A thousand pities that we had not taken instant vengeance , and disarmed and punished the murderous dogs . Glad . Colonel Gladwin The crafty chief has proved your words too true ; but England ne'er would sanction a just revenge against these savages , without our first trying to convince them of her power and her generosity . Let us repair to our troops , animate our men , and see that the defence is made with due regard to every circumstance . I rely on your brave Americans as on the king 's own troops . Assure them to that effect . Exeunt Gladwin , R. H. , Rogers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Quarters of the Commanding Officers . Enter Col. Gladwin and Major Delzel , L. H. Delzel . Major Delzel The savages still closely besiege the city . There is not now an avenue left , by which access to the French inhabitants is free . The war is waged against us alone . The French are still esteemed their friends , and perhaps take part with them . Our provisions are getting scanty , and ere long , without relief , the garrison will be straitened for food . Glad . Colonel Gladwin The king 's vessel , which bears my name , from Niagara Falls , has long been expected with full relief . ' T is now many weeks since her despatch ; our present circumstances call loudly for her arrival . Meanwhile , let every care be taken of our present stock ; serve it out with close regard to saving all that can be useful in still greater need .  --  Enter Franois , L.

Although a Frenchman , he acts with candor , and always has shown himself a sincere friend . I wish much to have his counsel on the wisest plan to treat the savages and win them over ; for serious thoughts have crossed my mind , that a flag might bring about a parley , and so time , if not peace , might be obtained . Here comes Monsieur Navarre . We 'll greet him as one of our best friends .  --  Enter Mons. Navarre , L. H.  --  You 're welcome , and we greet you kindly . The state of things demands our serious attention , and your experience in the present case may lead to peace , which we so much desire . Navarre . Navarre In affairs like these , firmness is most becoming . It presents a bold aspect , and teaches man to respect the obligations of society . Perhaps good Father Pierre may be prevailed on to sound the native warriors as to their present mood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surprise this place ; and will not readily yield , until he has proved to his jealous chiefs his prowess and his policy . To fail in any scheme of war is disgrace with these wild men ; and so completely have you frustrated his designs , that he will hardly trust even a holy priest within his camp .  --  But here comes our reverend father , whose judgment deserves respect , and whose holy office leads to universal good and peace . Enter Father Pierre , dressed in his cassock , with a cross suspended from his belt , L. H. Glad . Colonel Gladwin Good father Pierre , you have my salute , kind and respectful . Your prompt attendance demands my thanks . Reverend father , it is well known that your pious labors have greatly tamed the savage heart ; and with these tribes now about the place your Christian efforts have been most successful . We would then submit to your judgment the measure which it is proposed to adopt , in order to bring about a reconciliation and end the war with Pontiac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herald and a flag to Pontiac , and once more try to settle our quarrels . How do you think , reverend father , it would accord with Pontiac 's temper ? I crave your sage advice ? F. Pierre . Father Pierre There is much to dread from that implacable Chief . Already he suspects that we , whom he has heretofore considered as his allies , are now leagued against him . His frustrated plan has mortified him much ; and he attributes to the French his ill-success . It were better , perhaps , to send an officer of your own army to Pontiac 's camp , with due formality , bearing the white ensign of peace , an emblem well understood , even by the native chiefs . An interpreter should accompany him , but no one else . Both should go unarmed , and in open day . The watchful warriors in yon shady grove will soon perceive the approaching flag . In the open plain let your herald stand , till Pontiac is advised of the mission , and sends forth his chiefs to conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your delegate , and unalterable firmness must grace his port . In this there will be danger , as the savage observes but little etiquette , except when it suits his interest . Glad . Colonel Gladwin The times demand decisive steps , and risk must be hazarded to promote the general safety .  --  Young MacDougall has made extensive acquaintance with the French inhabitants , and will , perhaps , through them , be able to obtain a friend , who can interpret our wishes to the Indian Chief . F. Pierre . Father Pierre Most aptly thought . His easy port and good demeanour have endeared him to our people . Among them he may find one whose assistance will give easy access to the Indian camp . Glad . Colonel Gladwin Since you approve the course , I will pursue it . Ho ! there without !  --  Enter Adjutant , L. H.  --  Adjutant , wait on Captain MacDougall with my respects , and bid him call on me forthwith . Exeunt , R. H. SCENE II .

But what say you , Capt . Freeman ? How do you like appearances ? Capt . Freeman . Captain Freeman Things do not look so prosperous as one could wish ; but discipline and good conduct may keep all right . L. Boast . Lieutenant Boaster Discipline ! what know ye of that ? It might become the Royal troops so to talk ;  --  but for the Yankee provincials , it 's what they never knew . C. Free . Captain Freeman If not of discipline , we may , without boast , put in our claim for good conduct at least . L. Boast . Lieutenant Boaster If you call good conduct facing the enemy , the thing is doubtful still . Lieut . Brheme .

We shall have fighting enough ere the siege is over ;  --  till then , defer your private quarrels . ( They sheathe their swords and sit down . ) L. Brheme . Lieutenant Brheme It 's too much to hear such insolen : reflections on my countrymen , and those too who saved Braddock , and would have done that which neither he nor his Royal troops , with all their discipline , could effect . Pray let me ask you , Mr. Boaster , was it British discipline , or American bravery , that saved the remnant of the defeated army at Fort du Quesne ? Perhaps Colonel Washington could tell something of that affair . C. Bragg . Captain Bragg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Occasion now offers , when the heart and nerves of all may be tried . The skulking savages , who now besiege the town , may venture out from their lurking-places , should we show ourselves beyond the pickets .

Then we 'll try your metal with the tawny boys , and when you run , we 'll cover you from their pursuit ; but ere we go , we 'll leave the gate open for your activity . C. Free . Captain Freeman Trust not too much to British discipline , nor count yourselves more active than the Indian warriors .

Captain MacDougall I come the messenger of peace , to invite you to suspend hostilities , and to confer on honorable terms for that result . Pontiac . Pontiac ' T is bold indeed thus to insult a people you have so often wronged ; whom you have deceived , nay , despoiled of the very land on which you live ; and now to seek us in these distant woods , further to practise your deceptions !  --  No , no ! so long as there is a red man to draw a bow , and Pontiac to lead him , so long will we refuse to listen to any terms of peace whatever .

The poisonous liquor which intoxicates our people and debases them to the lowest state , was long forbidden by the Christian king . He was our friend , you his enemy . He sleeps now ; but he will come again to see justice done us and to avenge our wrongs . Seize the intruder , warriors , and keep him for our further determination .

And so they send this messenger with terms of peace , to entice us into a snare and then destroy us . No more let us listen to proposals of peace , till every Briton return within the limits of his ancient bounds , repass the mountains , and retire to the rivers which run into the briny sea . There in peace let them live and end their days . Thus far we have acknowledged their domain , but all beyond is our own and our ally 's territory . Augushaway .

But if you take my advice , you will not sacrifice till the sun goes down and rises again , as the offering would not be acceptable to the Great Spirit . Therefore , let the prisoner be well secured , and let him know his fate . As the rising sun illumes the morn it is proper that the pile be lighted . Pontiac .

The sun has long gone down . I fear some evil has befallen poor MacDougall . Rogers . Major Rogers There is not a doubt but the crafty Pontiac has detained the flag ,  --  perhaps e'en worse ,  --  sacrificed him to his barbarous fury , to appease his disheartened warriors . Delzel . Major Delzel The altercations , which your youths have been engaged in , may now perhaps be turned to good account . A sally on the Indian camp may make a diversion favorable to MacDougall 's escape , while the affair will try the prowess of our respective troops . Too high has the blood of our royal youths and our provincial auxiliaries been excited by mutual bantering ; a little drawing of some extra blood would not hurt our cause . Glad . Colonel Gladwin The impetuosity of youth should be checked rather than encouraged . It is too apt to lead to disaster , and bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble Rogers ? Rogers . Major Rogers I agree with you , Sir , that bantering is unmilitary ; but , since the honor of my countrymen is at stake , I can not oppose in the present case a fair trial of their native bravery with that of the British ; and so I freeely yield to the proposed sally , although I dread its consequences , as the British troops , unaccustomed to Indian warfare , will perhaps find more terror in their savage yell than in the Frenchman 's arms . Glad . Colonel Gladwin What ! believe that your young Americans will set an example to the British lads ? No , never . Let them try . Such opinion must be tested in the open field . Rogers . Major Rogers I 'll head the Americans myself . The occasion is worthy of our best endeavour . Delzel . Major Delzel And I our British blades .

Pontiac makes a signal with his tomahawk , and all the Indians halt and face towards him . He then addresses the Indians :  --  Pon . Pontiac Chiefs and warriors ! I am informed that the enemy proposes to march out of his strong hold and attack us . He finds it difficult to obtain supplies . We must intercept him and surprise him . You need not care much for the red-coats ; they know nothing of the woods ; but the blue-jackets are old enemies of ours , and know what they are about .

Your conduct and that of your brave countrymen have shown a bright example to our forward boys . To your discretion , valor , and prudence too , we owe much . Your skill is not less worthy of mention . Rogers . Major Rogers My skill , like my discretion , deserves but little praise . Our wars have taught us that the savages act with caution , wonderful and subtile . And , to oppose them with effect , the same must be practised towards them ; but as the British Officers believed that no lesson could be taught them in what concerned war , it was in vain I cautioned them . The time may come , when e'en these sons of the forest will introduce into the tactics of European armies that activity , which seems so much wanted , yet so much despised . Enter Navarre , L. H.

It must be the Gladwin ; no other vessel sails these waters . The wind is light , to stem a current so strong . The savages in great numbers keep watch on the island to intercept your only supplies . This is the arrangement of Pontiac , their great leader . Glad . Colonel Gladwin ( looking out with his spy-glass . ) ' T is true enough . The Gladwin lies close to yonder isle .

Captain of the Gladwin My respects first , in duty . Now let me tell you all our difficulties .  --  A light breeze wafted us up the stream to yon little isle , where the savages , finding us becalmed , had the temerity to board us , tomahawk in hand .

Send , then , your young companion to your chiefs and warriors , and notify them of your captivity . Tell them that you are desirous of making peace . Pon . Pontiac Never let it be said that Pontiac recommended to his people any thing so disgraceful . No ! he has recommended to them eternal war , rather than that they should sue for peace on any terms except that the British quit the country , and leave us the undisturbed possession of our native empire . Rather let me perish at the stake , than even hint to my warriors a proposition for peace on any other conditions . Glad .

I have called you together , to consult with you on the propriety of making another attempt at peace . Pontiac , the mover of the war , is now a prisoner in our power . His people must feel his loss , and perhaps , to regain him , may willingly come to terms . I therefore propose , that we send a flag by the young warrior who was captured with Pontiac , to acquaint the Indians that Pontiac is in our hands , and that the same good feelings still actuate us in the desire to settle all our differences with them , and to conclude a peace on honorable terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . The Indian prisoner will give a good account of what he has seen ; but we must separate him from that monster Pontiac , as he will tell his chiefs and warriors to fight it out , and prolong the war . His hatred is indeed deadly . He 'll never yield with life to any accommodation . While Pontiac lives , our frontier settlements will be in constant dread . I would therefore advise the keeping of Pontiac as an hostage , and guaranty for the fulfilment of any treaty we may conclude . Glad . Colonel Gladwin Bring forth the young prisoner , and we 'll despatch him forthwith from the council to the camp .  --  Exit Lieut . Boaster , R. H. , and returns with Otscheo in chains , and under a guard of two soldiers.  --  Young warrior ! you have seen our force . You see your great Chief subdued and a prisoner .

Boast . Lieutenant Boaster But , Jack , how came you to catch Pontiac , if he was so nimble as you say ? Sailor . Sailor Why , d'ye see , that fellow made fight , and , followed by his young warriors , almost cleared the whole deck himself . He is as active as a cat , and as bold as a lion . Boast .

Augush . Augushaway So let it be . It will depend most on yourselves . Where is Pontiac ? Glad . Colonel Gladwin Pontiac is a close prisoner  --  he has no business here . His enlargement will depend on your present determination for peace or war . Augush . Augushaway It was and is the nation 's wish to conclude a peace ; but Pontiac , who began hostilities , ought to join in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its continuance . But as it does not seem to meet your views that Pontiac should partake in the conference , we chiefs and warriors present will conform to the good wishes of our people . The release of Pontiac and all other prisoners must form an article in our convention , and all past animosities must mutually be forgiven and forgotten . Glad . Colonel Gladwin This article must be reciprocal , each releasing prisoners and forgetting wrongs . Bring forth the treaty in its present form , containing all that has been agreed upon ; and , to impress its conditions more strongly on each others ' hearts and memories , we will ratify it with our proper signs . ( The treaty is brought forward by the Adjutant , who , during the conference , is seen writing . ) We agree then on all points .  --  First , Peace from this day and for evermore shall exist between the Chippeways , and other tribes confederated with them , and the British King and his subjects .  --  Second , All prisoners to be delivered up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this instrument , as a pledge for the faithful fulfilment of this present agreement .

I 'll neither smoke the pipe , nor shake the hand  --  both are forerunners of our ruin and disgrace . I 'll ne'er consent to such dishonorable terms .

Now , then , when you are released from bonds only by our wisdom in concluding the present treaty , you still show your proneness to war , and your determination to rekindle it , when you shall be once more free to act . In the present instance I am representing the nation , and will insure the peace which is now solemly concluded , and thus put it out of your power hereafter to break it . ( Draws his dagger and stabs Pontiac . ) There is a sacrifice , to our country 's peace , of one of the bravest warriors and most consummate Chiefs . Pontiac .

At the entrance of the cavern is a large rock , which serves to close its mouth . A fire is burning near the cavern to give light . Two Indians are seen removing the stone from the mouth of the cavern , by means of wooden handspikes . On the top of the cavern is a white cross of wood , and on each side of the cross is a post painted red and white , with a small white flag upon it . Music is heard at a distance , playing Pontiac 's Dead March . The procession moves on in the following order :  --  First , An old Indian Priest in a white robe , holding a white wand in his hand . He is followed by four boys , and four girls , all dressed in white ; the boys wearing white feathers in their heads , and the girls wreaths of flowers ; they carry baskets of flowers , which they strew as they pass along , and at the cavern when they arrive there . Then follow four warriors finely dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bier . On the breast of the corpse is the bow and quiver of the deceased . Next follow young warriors carrying baskets of provisions , which they deposit with the corpse in the cavern , intended to subsist the deceased in his journey to the world of departed spirits ; and , for the same purpose , his bow and arrows accompany him . Then comes a train of Indian warriors , and next a train of Indian women , all dressed in white  --  the women wearing their robes over their heads . Then the American troops without arms ; then the British troops , also without arms , followed by their respective Officers ; and finally , the Catholic Priest and Judge , and Col.

Gladwin , Maj. Rogers , Father Pierre , and Judge Navarre move up to the cavern , when the stone is placed at its entrance , and closes up the tomb ; and the curtain drops to solemn music , a kind of finale to the Death- Song .
