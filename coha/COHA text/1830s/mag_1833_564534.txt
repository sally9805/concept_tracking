txt The writer , who furnishes us with a good life of John Howard , does to mankind a service similar in kind , though , of course , inferior in degree , to those of the great philanthropist himself . We are such creatures of imitation and made of such flexible stufl that our characters are almost invariably moulded after some model which caught our fancy in early life . Such books as the life of Vidocq and Stephen // Burroughs , are to the philosophic observers of human life , manufactories of rogues , putting it into boys ' heads to steal , lie , and cheat , and giving the charm of heroic adventure to the life of a cowardly swindler . How many apprentices have been induced to run away and go to sea , by Robinson Crusoe and Cook 's Voyages ! Happily , it is not to evil alone , that mankind are prone , though it is vastly easier to be bad than good . In how many young men has the spirit of religious enterprise and devoted self-sacrifice been created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Brainard and Henry Martyn ! There is something peculiarly inspiring in the example of a great philanthropist . His vocation requires no extraordinary gifts of genius or advantages of circumstance . All men can be philanthropists if they wish to be so . The will and the power are simultaneous and nearly identical . Hence arises the almost magic influence of such men as Howard , Oberlin and Pestalozzi . Their own zeal and benevolence are transmitted with electric impulse from breast to breast , and thousands catch a glow from the divine flame that warmed and animated them . John Howard was born about the year l7*7 , at Clapton , in the parish of Hackney , near London . He was born to a competent fortune , and might have lived the life of an English country gentleman , with great satisfaction to himself and very little use to other peopleshooting partridges , *etting swan-traps and spring-guns for poachers , hunting foxes , riding to the assizes , and developing the beauties of the poor laws . But Mr. Howard was a man of finer mould . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his principles strictly moral and religious . He loved books , domestic life , and rural employments . His first marriage was a striking proof of the romantic disinterestedness of his character . The lady was double his age , and he married her , by way of gratitude for her kind and motherly attentions to him during a severe illness . She died in two years afterwards . To his second wife he was fondly attached , and , during the fifteen years of their marriage , he enjoyed that perfect happiness arising from the exertions of benevolence and the best affections , cheered and supported by one who entirely sympathized with him in every taste and feeling . He was an excellent and kind landlord and master , and much beloved by his tenants and dependants . He traveled much in England and on the Continent , from motives of curiosity and the desire of improvement . He was fond of science , and was a member of the Royal Society . The life of that Howard , whom the world has so long venerated , does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at that time chosen Sheriff of the county of Bedford . The duty of inspecting prisons , commonly undertaken by a deputy , Mr. Howard performed in person ; and the terrible condition of those under his charge , filled him with deep sensibility , and awakened in him a strong desire to remedy the evil . For this purpose , he made a tour of inspection of the prisons throughout England . Their condition at that time was a Mrs. Farrar thus describes The English prisons were , for the most part , too small for the numbers they contained ; they were therefore crowded ; and as the windows were very few and // very small , the prisoners wanted air as well as room . They were not made secure by being well built , or by having proper walls around them , or proper guards ; and therefore the prisoners were loaded with irons , to prevent their making their escape . Damp , unwholesome dungeons , many feet under ground , were used as sleeping apartments , and in many places no bedstead or bedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished ; the damp earth was all the poor creatures had to lie on . Very often the prisons and yards were without any drains or sewers to carry off their moisture and filth , and without any wells or pumps within the wails ; and so offensive were the cells , dungeons , and even upper apartments of such buildings , that the bad ak- produced a fever peculiar to prisons , and known by the name of the gaol-fever . This frequently carried off more prisoners in a year than were condemned to death by the law . It spread as rapidly as the yellow fever , and was often as fatal . Such was the terror it produced , that when it made its appearance among the wretched inhabitants of a prison , their condition was rendered worse , if possible , than ever , from the fear that was felt of approaching the infected rooms . Instead of allowing them snore air and better attendance , instead of removing those evils which produced the fever , and thus giving them a chance of recovery , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their misery . Even the medical attendants , hired to take care of the health of the prisoners , were sometimes allowed to stipulate , that if the gaol-fever appeared among them , they ( the medical men ) should be excused from attending in the infected wards It makes the heart sick to think of such a shocking state of things among beings that call themselves civilized . If the safety of society re'quires that the hardened sinner , who can not be kept in any other way from crime , should be deprived of his liberty , he ought to be securely confined ; but even then he should be allowed to breathe a pure air , to eat wholesome food , to take necessary exercise ; he should be comfortably lodged and clothed , and treated as a. being capable of amendment . But what shall we say when we learn that this ill usage of prisoners , at the time we are speaking of ; was not confined to convicted felons ; persons waiting to take their trial , and perhaps entirely innocent of the offence laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shocking treatment we have described , and sometimes died of the gaol-fever before they could be brought to trial . Another class of unfortunate beings , who , in the opinion of many , ought not to be imprisoned at all , those who are unable to pay their debts , were at that time frequently shut up with the most abandoned criminals , and subjected to the miseries already described , where the gaols were not large enough to allow of their being lodged separately , or where the regulations were such , that unless the poor debtor could pay for better accommodations , he was obliged to share the felon 's apartment . It appears to have been the intention of the government that all prisoners , even condemned criminals , should have clean straw to lie upon , and good bread and water in sufficient quantity to support life ; but owing to the avarice and inhumanity tinf those concerned in supplying them with these necessaries , they were often very scantily furnished , and sometimes the bread was of a very bad quality . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better food , could obtain it ; but where the gaols were small and ill-constructed , money could not save a man before trial from being shut up at night , in a damp , unwholesome dungeon , with condemned criminals for his companions . The hardships of such an imprisonment , must have been severely felt by those who were put in gaol to await their trial for offences , of which they were afterwards proved to be innocent ; but what must be the feelings of a poor , pennyless creature , who has thus suffered , and on being acquitted in court , thinks himself once more a free man , when he is told , that unless he can pay a heavy fee to the gaoler , and another to the turnkey , he must return to his loathsome dungeon ! What indignation must he feel at such injustice and oppression ! in what dreadful despair , must many have returned to their prison-house This was the great , the crying evil of gaols , which first stirred up the benevolent spirit of Howard . He first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , but , to his surprise and concern , he found it a very general custom . This unjust and cruel demand , on the part of gaolers , had been so long allowed them , that they considered it as a right ; and in many places it was a source ofso much gain to them , that they received no salary from the county , but made their living by such extortions practised on the prisoners . // Mr. Howard now was fairly engaged in his philanthropic enterprise to which he devoted the remainder of his life , lie made several tours through England and the Continent , visiting , at various times , nearly all the gaols , prisons , houses of correction , &amp;c. in the civilized world . Though of delicate health , his strict temperance in eatine , and drinking enabled him to go through a great amount of labor , and preserved him unharmed in the midst of infection and death . lie published in 1777 a quarto volume , entitled , " The State of the Prisons in England and Wales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prisons . " In 1730 and 1734 he published a first and second appendix to the above , containing the information which he had acquired in the mean time . In the latter part of his life , his attention was called to the subject of the plague , and the management of lazarettos ; and with characteristic self-devotion , he sailed from Smyrnato Venice , with a foul bill of health , in order that he might be subjected to all the regulations of the quarantine in the lazaretto , and learn them by personal observation . In 1789 , he published an " Account of the principal Lazarettos in Europe , with various papers relative to the plague , together with further observations on some foreign prisons and hospitals , with additional remarks on the present state of those of Great-Britain , and Ireland . " Throughout the whole of his philanthropic labors and journeys he appears equally engaging and admirable . His character never acquired any thing of wildness or austerity . His devotion to great objects , never blunted his sensibility to individual suffering . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . He never forgot , neglected , or overlooked any body . His modesty was not the least remarkable of his traits . He shunned notoriety , and when it was proposed , by his friends and admirers to raise a statue to him , he resisted it with such strong sincerity , that the design was at once abandoned . His moral courage , too , was of the highest order ; and a striking instance of it may be found displayed in his interview with Joseph II . of Austria , thus related by Mrs. Farrar The Emperor , Joseph 11. had shown a laudable zeal in the improvement of such estahlishments , and Howard saw with great delight the good effects of his personal attention to these matters . On the eve of his departure from Vienna , he received an intimation that the Emperor wished for an interview with him . Knowing that the etiquette of the court required that persons presented to the sovereign should kneel before him , and having a great repugnance to such a servile act , he excused himself , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Emperor disappointed him , however , by offering to receive him at the earliest hour he chose to name , and he could not escape the interview . The objectionable ceremony of kneeling was not required of this privileged philanthropist , and he had a very satisfactory conversation of two hours with the Emnperor , in which he opened his mind to him on the subject of hospitals , prison discipline , &amp;c. with the utmost freedom . He told the monarch that he had seen in his prisons many things that filled him with grief and astonishment . " The torture has been said to he abolished in your Majesty 's dominions , " said howard , " hut it is only so in appearance ; for what is now practised is in reality worse than any other torture . Poor wretches are confined twenty feet below ground , in places just fitted to receive their bodies , and some of them are kept there for eighteen months . Others are in dungeons , chained so closely to the wall that they can scarcely move . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here the Emperor seemed to feel some uneasiness , and abruptly said , " Sir , in your country they hang for the slightest offences . " " I grant , " replied Mr.Howard , " that the multiplicity of her capital punishments is // a disgrace to England ; but as one fault does not excuse another , so neither in this case is the parallel just ; for I declare I would rather he hanged , if it were possible , ten times over , than undergo such a continuance of sufferings as the unhappy beings endure who are confined in your Majesty 's prisons . ' When speaking of work-houses , Mr. Howard did not forget to give the Emperor a hint of the great mischief he had done by changing the discipline of that at Ghent ; and on being asked where he had ever seen a good institution of this kind , he emphatically replied , " There was one at Ghent ; but not now , not now At this speech the monarch started , and seemed a good deal shocked , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , he shook him cordially by the hand at parting , and said he had given him much pleasure . The Emperor afterwards told his minister that he was greatly pleased with Mr. Howard 's visit , - that he was a man without ceremony or compliment , and that he liked him the better for it . Mr. Howard died in his vocation . He had taken up his residence at Cherson , a Russian settlement on the Black sea , where a war with Turkey had occasioned the assembling of a large military force . Here he devoted himself to the patients in the naval and military hospitals , and mitigated , as much as possible , the horrors of war . Although it is a long quotation , we trust that our readers will not object to Mrs. Farrar 's account of his sickness and death After the Russians had taken Bender , the winter was so far advanced that hostile operations were suspended , and the commander of the Russian army at Bender gave permission to several of his officers to visit their friends at Cherson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the Russian arms , by balls and masquerades , which were attended by the officers from Bender , and the neighboring gentry . These festivities had continued but a short time when several persons were attacked with a fever which was believed to be of an infectious kind , and brought by the military from Bender . Among the number thus affected was a young lady , who resided twenty miles from the town , but who had participated in the gayeties of Cherson . The disorder soon assumed an alarming appearance ; as Mr. Howard had acquired the reputation of a skillful physician by his successful treatment of patients in the hospitals , he was earnestly requested to visit her . This he at first refused to do , alleging that he was a doctor only to the poor ; but hearing that she was in great danger , he was finally prevailed upon to attend her , and made her two visits in the latter end of December , 1789 . Having prescribed what he thought proper , he returned to Cherson , leaving directions with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , of which however he had little hope . A letter informing him that his patient was improving in her health , and urging him to visit her again without loss of time , was desp tched to Howard , but miscarried , and did not reach him till eight days after it was written . As soon as he received it , he resolved to go immediately . The weather was cold and tempestuous , and the rain fell in torrents . No carriage could be readily obtained , and rather than delay his visit , he mounted an old drayhorse , and proceeded as fast as he could to the residence of the lady , whom he found in a dying state . He gave her something to produce perspiration , and watched its effect by her bed-side . The malignancy of her disorder rendered the atmosphere of her room very offensive , and it was the belief of Mr. Howard that he took the fever of her , when he felt her pulse under the bed-clothes , which he did , to avoid checking her perspiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , wet ride of twenty miles , he was less able than usual to resist infection . The young lady died the next day , and her medical friend returned to Cherson . Two days afterwards , he was able to dine with Admiral Mordrinof who lived a mile and a half from his lodgings . He stayed later than usual , and walked home in a cold night . He soon found himself unwell , supposed he had the gout flying about him , and prescribed for himself accordingly . The next day , however , he felt the symptoms of fever , and had recourse to an emetic , and then to his favorite remedy of James 's powders . Prince Potemkin sent his physician to attend him , but his own prescriptions were never interfered with . Howard soon considered his case as hopeless of cure , and believed himself to have the same malignant disorder of which his female patient had died . The few memorandums which he made during his illness show his resignation to the will of God , // and the perfect calmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was also strongly exhibited in his conversaticn with his friend Admiral Priestman , who , missing Mr. Hoxvnrd 's daily calls , came to inquire after his health . The sick man told him his end was approaching very fast , and , as he had many things to say to him , he was glad he had called . The Admiral supposed from this , that his friend was in a melancholy mood , and tried to turn the course of his thoughts . But Mr. Howard said , in a very impressive , yet cheerful , manner , " Priestman , you style this a dull conversation , arid endeavor to divert my mind from dwelling upon deeds ; but I entertain very different sentiments . Death has no terrors for me ; it is an event I always look to with cheerfulness , if not with pleasure , and he assured the subject is more grateful to me than any other . I am well aware that I have but a short time to live : my mode of life has rendered it impossible that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you do , eating heartily of animal food and drinking wine , I might perhaps , by altering my diet , be able to subdue it . But how can such a roan as I am lower his diet , who has been accustomed for years to live on vegetables and water , a little bread and a little tea ? I have no method of lowering my nourishment , and therefore I must die . It is such jolly fellows as you , Priestman , who get over these fevers . " He next spoke of his funeral , and of the place where he wished to be interred . " There is a spot , ' * said he , " near the village of Dauphigny ; this would suit me nicely ; you know it well , for I have often said that I should like to be buried there ; and let me beg of you , as you value your old friend , not to suffer any pomp to be used at my funeral ; nor any monument , nor no monumental inscription whatsoever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the earth , place a sun-dial over my grave , and let me be forgotten . " The spot thus selected for the grave of the philanthropist was situated in the grounds of a French gentleman who had shoxvn him much friendship , during his residence in Cherson , and he now pressed the Admiral to hasten and secure it for him . This he at last reluctantly did . During his absence , Mr. Howard received a letter from a friend in England , who had lately seen his son , and thought his health improved . Thomasson read it to him , for h was too ill to read it himself : it affected him deeply , and he repeatedly charged Thomasson to tell his son , 5 if ever he were restored to reason , how much and how fervently he had prayed for his happiness , during this last illness . When Admiral Priestman returned to tell him he had executed his commission his countenance brightened , and he testified his satisfaction and gratitude . He then handed the Admiral the letter from England ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his languid head on his pillow , and said , " Is not this comfort for a dying father ? " He themi expressed a repugnance to being buried according to the rites of the Greek church , and begged the Admiral not only to prevent all interference from the Russian priests , but himself to read the burial-service of the church of England over his body . This was his last request , amid nearly the last words he spoke . He died on the morning of the 20th of January , 1790 , verityiug the Scripture testimony , that " the end of the good man is peace . " His funeral was not suffered to be so private as he had wished . A long train of carriages and of horsemen followed his body to the spot , which he had chosen for his interment , and between two and three thousand persons accompanied it on foot . A small brick pyramid , instead of a sun-dial ; was erected over the grave , and is still pointed out to travelers as a memorial , of which even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretofore spoken of Mr. 1-Joward : It remains for us only to do justice to his biographer . It is a beautifully written and most attractive work ; such as no one , we think . who had read the first page , would lay down till he had finished it . The style is easy , simple , and fiowiug-tho sentiments an ( l reflections always excellent and frequently heautiful. it is full of admiration of Howard 's remarkable qualities , but free from extravagance . It is a valuable addition to our literatmre , and we hope that Mrs. Farrar will often employ her pert in thus making virtue lovely , , and religion beautiful . * He never recovered his sem*ses , but died in the A*31um at Leicester , Ia 1799. // The Martyr 's Triumph : Buried Valley : and other Poems . By Grenville Mellen . " Gentle reader , " can you tell us " what is poetry , " - or , more intelligibly speaking , what poetry is ? Read the book whose title is our text , and then tell us whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , then , that fine sentiment , or wise maxims , or the utterance of important truth , does not constitute poetry . The most prosaic man that ever felt his gorge rise at the idea of poetry , on whose birth the Muses frowned and Apollo scowled , can utter " wise saws and modern instances , " laud virtue to the skies , and be the very priest of truth . On the mere ground of his moral precepts and Christian principles , Mr. Mellen can not , therefore , he considered a poet . He may be , and we think he shows himself to he , an excellent man ,  --  and for this we respect him ; but to prove him any thing more , these facts are inadmissible . We say that verse is not poetry that a man may write volumes of metrical composition , quartos of rhyme , and folios of blank verse , and be no more like a poet than Vulcan was like Pho*bus . The puerile " Ener , mener , moner , mite , Barce-lona , bona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some writers would call it ; but who calls it poetry ? One of the pages of Mr. Mellen 's book says " We dedicate a holier shrine Than temples years have made divine ; In them the heathen knees did bow , But hearts are hent before Thee now . " But who calls that verse poetry ? If versification and the jingle of rhyme were poetry , however , we might deny the poetical character of the book , which we are noticing , on the ground of its countless sins against harmony , 1 ) 0th in the measure and in the rhymes . In the first stanza " on " and " warn " are brought into unnatural union as brother sounds . Then we find " shapes " and " breaks ; " charm ' ' and " calm ; pahn ' ' and warm * ye** and sky * " steps " and " depths ; " and countless others , which offend the ear most unpardonably . In stanza 25th , occurs this couplet , of which the last verse should be an Alexandrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , Turning night 's very darkness hideously red ! " On pages 67-8-9 , are found the following monosyllabic violations of the laws of measure " My eye could not but look , and my ear hear . " " Wealth that once made some poor vain heart grow light .
