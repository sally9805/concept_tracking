txt WERE you ever in the Highlands of New-York ? Did you ever spend a week at West-Point ? Did you ever clamber up each mountain side from Breakneck to Anthony 's Nose , and , from their bold summits , survey the deep channel , which , with its thousand vessels , hears the products of the west to the mart of cominerce ,  --  look upon the broad sea of Tappan , the rich lands of Duchess , the distant course of the Delaware , and , in the valley below , the ruined fortress of the Revolution ? Did you descend into that valley , and observe the small pile of stones , which made the hut of the living soldier , and , not far ofi ; under the shade of the cedar arid the hemlock , the raised turg which marks his repose in death ? And , resting upon that green bank , did you think of all the toil , self-denial , tears and blood , with which he bought for you an inheritance of freedom and peace , glory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these , in vain have you sauntered on the shores of Nahant or mixed in the fashionable crowd at Saratoga , or crossed the Alleghany , or even acknowledged , in silence and wonder , the power of Niagara : For , depend upon it , you must go beyond this continent for a place , more rich in the grand , the beautiful , and the historical in scenery , than the Highlands of the Hudson . They commence at Stony Point , the head of Haverstraw bay , and extend to the bay of Newbnrgh , about eighteen miles . During this whole distance , the river is forced into a narrower channel , by vast precipices of rocks , rising to mountain heights , of the most irregular , but wild , and sublime aspect . These rocks are , in the language of the geologist , primitive , and surely not even he can doubt that they are original formations from the hand of Omnipotence . The numerous peaks , which rise abruptly to great heights from the river side , have received various and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of each , than with // the wishes of sentimentalists . Some of them have derived their appellations from the singular appearances which they assume , when viewed from certain positions . One , especially , is an object of curiosity , from being the exact resemblance , on an enormous scale , of the human profile , and called St. Anthony 's face . Another is St. Anthony 's nose . Indeed , this St. Anthony seems to have taken possession of many places in this neighborhood , probably from his being a great favorite with the early settlers , the Dutch . Another peak is called the Sugarbag from its conical form ; this is the height , from which Col. Rufus Putnam rolled the celebrated rock , which has taken his name . The highest of these hills ascends from the east side of the river , near the town of Fishkill , and is called Beacon hill , from the fact that General Washington used it , as a signal post , during the revolutionary war . Till very recently , the decayed timber , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still to be seen . A winding road led up its side from the village of Fishkill , and many a stranger would ascend it , to contemplate the wide-spread land , and refresh his memory of former times . Just opposite to this , is Breakneck , which rises , almost perpendicularly , from the edge of the water , and seems the frowning guardian of the pass . A melancholy incident , which lately happened here , gave a strong propriety to its name . An enterprising young man , educated at West.Point , had returned to the neighborhood in search of minerals . For this purpose , he , with two or three others , had crossed from the opposite shore , and begun to ascend this mountain rock , when , finding their ascent difficult and dangerous , his comrades stopped , and urged him to desist ; he , however , continued on ; after ascending about one hundred and fifty feet , he missed his foothold , and , falling from rock to rock , reached the ground mangled and lifeless ! Numerous other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mountains , which , with scarce a level acre , constitute the Highlands . In the very centre and bosom of these , surrounded by threatening precipices , which CC stand , As if to sentinel enchanted land , " projects into the river , the small , green plain of West-Point . And , if the fairies themselves had , indeed , selected it as their knoll , what of the sweet , or wild , or grand , could they have added to give another charm to feeling , or a greater power to devotion ? Stranger-thou , who perhaps hast ascended to the sources of the mighty Missouri , slept on the Cordilleras , or breathed the fragrance of Arabia ,  --  book upon that scene ; see the deep and dark Hudson , sullenly compressed within those high and frowning rocks ; see every white sail gliding upon its surface , as small beneath those lofty mountains , as is the art of man compared with the power of the Creator ; see , stretching across the opening passage , yon cultivated shore and its smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shawungum hills , and , far as the eye can reach , piled up against the sky , the gray ridges of the Cattskills , and tell me , tell me truly , if thou hast poetry , devotion , or sentiment in thee , if ever they were so kindled , up , so strongly prevalent in any other scene beneath the circuit of the sun . // But man , as well as nature , has contributed to make this spot remarkable . No one could visit it , even if the story of the revolution were not familiar , without perceiving that , at some former period , it had been the object of great solicitude and strong defences . On every side , a mouldering parapet , a ruined hut , or neglected grave , reminds us of war and its ravages . No less than fifteen forts and batteries have been observed on or near the Point . Of these , the one most known , and best preserved , is old Fort Putnam , whose gray walls , perched on the mountain cliff are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dreary and lone , as the scenes that surround thee , Thy battlements rise midst the crags of the wild ; Yet dear are thy ruins , for , brightly around thee , T was here the first dawn of our libedy smiled . " This fortress was built by General Parsons , of the Connecticut line , in the year 1773 , and called from General Putnam , who then commanded the post . Jt was repaired by Presidents Adams and Jefferson . Subsequently , however , it was neglected , and , becoming private property , was rapidly dismantled of every thing valuable , and left to ruin . Nothing is now left of it except the bare walls , and some damp vaults , once the abode of the garrison , but , now tenanted by toads and reptiles . Two of these are deep under ground , and perfectly dark . They are supposed to have been the prisons of the fortress . Cheerless , indeed , must have been their inmates , confined in cells , whence Trenck cotild not escape , and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture to penetrate . It has been said , among other things , that Andre was confined here , and the visiter will be so told . 1 am informed , however , by Colonel Tailmadge , who personally attended Andre from the moment of his arrest , to that of his execution , that , this story is incorrect . He was carried to West-Point , but not imprisoned there . Two sides of this fort rise from the very edne of a steep precipice , which , with its own height and massy structure , give it an air of grandeur , I have never seen in any other work of art . Indeed , it has that mysterious and venerable appearance , so often described by poets , and romancers , as belonging to the ancient baronial castles . Like them , too , it is fast crumbling away , and though time and decay must bear heavy upon it , before these vast stones shall be leveled , yet fall they will , and no monument shall stand here to tell the observer of the men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remain , and the ground be historic , classic . " Age shakes Athena 's tower , but spares gray Marathon . " Just above West-Point is " Washington 's Valley , "  --  a secluded , and romantic spot , at the junction of a mountain rivulet with the Hudson . Here , before the revolution , a gentleman by the name of Moore , allured by the love of solitude and romance , selected the site of his dwelling , built a fine house , planted fruit trees , cultivated a garden , and literally made the " wilderness to blossom as the rose . " Dunn * the war , it was the frequent resort of the officers , who found there agreeable society and rural pleasures , to soften the harsh ( luties of their profession . The world , however , delights not in sentiment , and the valley was long known , as " Moore 's Folly . " Why it has since been called by the name of Washington , I know not. : he was , indeed , a frequent visitej : . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now gone to ruin , the trees nearly destroyed , and the garden a potato field ; the name and the recollections alone remain to tempt the stranger . A little further up , the brook passes through a deep ravine , and , tumbling over a pile of rocks , forms a striking cascade . A walk thither is one of the pleasures of the Point , which no stranger , certainly no sentimentalist , neglects . The dark shade of the lofty hemlock , the solitude and roar of the torrent , are no unfit companions , amid lonely mountains and deep glens , for the soul of an enthusiast , or the imagination of a lover . Still further up the stream , on the hill side , are seen the graves of the forgotten dead . With no monument save the cedar , darkly green over their heads , with no memorial , save the fragments of their former huts , we can only guess that they were of the patriot band , who were content , for the love of liberty , to sustain trial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleep of the dead . ' " The flowers of the forest have brightened that spot , The wild rose has scattered its bloom on that ground , Where lonely they lie-now forgetting-forgot , Unawaked by the mountain storm thundering around . " Here let us pause . By the tombs of the vast mass who live and die , in the ordinary walk of humanity ,  --  by those even of the great and powerful , we may pass without other notice than what arises from the sad remembrance of mortality . But , who would so pass the monument of Howard ? Who the resting place of Washington ? or , even of this poor soldier , who , perchance , in coming here , has sacrificed , all that they could do-property and life for the welfare of others ? Let us , then , linger around his grave , and , communing with the spirits of the departed , learn by what high impulses they withstood the degeneracy of hum* n kind ; and , comparing ourselves with their high standard of ( luty and morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherited glory of being not less virtuous than free . Oh ! it is good thus to unite the living and the dead ! thus to bring before us the examples of departed worth , and acquire an interest in " the ministerinn spirits " that are around and about us , through the pathway of life . Near those graves , on a small plain , is the modern burial ground . There the Cadets of the Military Academy have erected a monument , sculptured with much taste , to the memory of their deceased comrades . The place has an air of quiet and retirement , harmonizing well with the scenery and the object , though as yet less interesting to many than those unnoticed fragments of the post , which are found under the shade of the forest , and in the depths of the glen . On the eastern side of the Point , partly under the river bank , is Kozciusko 's garden . A garden it is not , but , a most romantic retreat , formed hy a ledge of rocks , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick foliage , and accessible only by a narrow , and rugged pathway . When I first visited it , a few rough steps , cut from the rock , and a broken gate , marked the way to this singular dwelling of a warrior . The sweet-brier , the rose , and the lilac , though long neglected , still grew , and bloomed freshly and sweetly ; and there they still grow , nourished by the hands of the young , and the free . // There long may they grow , not more the memorials of the unhappy hero , than of his unhappy land . The students of the institution have since made a gravel-walk leading to the garden , cleared out the weeds , made seats , and placed a small fountain there , inscribed with the name of Kozciusko . They have also commendably erected a monument to his memory . It stands near the garden on the ruins of old Fort Clinton ,  --  a marble column , placed at the extreme verge of the Point , and visible far above and below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a broad , flat rock , on which was formerly placed a water battery , to command the great chain , which was stretched from it to the opposite shore of Constitution Island . This chain was long preserved in the public stores here , an object of curiosity and admiration . I was lately sorry to learn that its destruction had added another to the many Vandal acts of modern times . It was sold for old iron . In the information communicated by Arnold to the British was the fact that he had severed several links of this chain , under pretence of repairing it , that it might break at the slightest concussion . On the opposite shore of the river may still be seen the Beverly I-louse . It was the head-quarters of General Arnold , during the period of his treason , and thus became connected with history . It was related by General La Fayette , when last here , that he , with General Knox , was at dinner with Arnold , when the letter of Colonel Jamieson , with the papers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent for , and the guests were left alone to finish their dinner ,  --  their host , as is known , not returning to participate in the stirrup cup . Many other historical localities and interesting spots might be pointed out . Indeed , the whole ground , from Newburgh to New-York , was a constant succession of camps , and posts , and fortresses , during the revolution , and is yet unrivaled in beauty , or grandeur of scenery . But , I have wandered long enough among these charms of nature , and these relics of history . Thousands will visit , but few contemplate them , to indulge in sentiment , to recall the memory of other times , to encourage devotion , or gratify taste . The utilities of life are all this generation seek , and they will turn from the sublime and beautiful , to study and examine the scheme of science and morals , which regulate the great institution , here erected , for the youth of the nation . Nor is it inappropriate for the good citizen , or watchful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall , therefore , proceed to consider the history , instruction , and condition of the Military Academy . As civilization advances , the more necessary becomes the science of war . Men no longer contend , as among savages , with the mere urnsdes of the body for superiority of strength , nor , as in the age of chivalry , " with spear , and belted brand , " thinking it a disgrace on their fame not to accept , however ill prepared , the loud challenge of the foe . A battle is no longer a tournament ; it depends less on the hai*d than the head , and is decided less by the personal exertions of the warrior , than by the closest combinations of science and intellect . With this change in the nature of war , it is not to be denied , there has come also a correspondent change in the profession of arm* Military fame is no longer the brilliant point in men 's imaginations . Deprived of // the frequent exhibition of personal daring , lofty enthusiasm , and romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition and necessity . We may not hope its final extinction , till , in a better age , the evil passions of men shall be subdued by the bland spirit of Christianity . The idea of military education is not a modern one , though it has partaken largely of that spirit of improvement , which every where attends the progress of science and civilization . Military schools had a very early origin ; for we learn from Xenophon that the Grecian boys of that day were systematically trained in the arts , discipline , and exercises necessary for the skillful conduct of war . Subsequently they had their " Tactici , " - professors of the military art . So also among the Romans there were the " Campi Martii . " In modern times , the French , in their nature so warlike , have paid much attention to Military education . L ' Ecole Fleche , containing five or six hundred pupils , was established by Henry IV . The school at Brienne is celebrated , as the theatre of Buonaparte 's early adventures . The Polytechnique and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that spirit of violence , change , and insubordination , which so strongly characterizes revolutionary France . In England , also , they have the Military Academy at Woolwich , and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst . The United States Military Academy was established in 18052 , and had its origin with General Jonathan Williams . His plan was extensive , and corresponded with the real dignity and strength of the nation . The economical disposition of that day , however , did not permit its adoption , and the law first passed was rather a satire upon what the institution ought to be . It constituted the Corps of Engineers , then consisting of about half a dozen officers , with a teacher of French , and a teacher of Drawing , the Military Academy . To these were attached the Cadets of the army , for instruction , and the whole were stationed at West-Point . In this manner the Academy existed till the war of 18152 excited a new spirit , and required new preparations . During these ten years , only eighty-five were commissioned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service . Several of these are among the most efficient and distinguished officers of the army , though they can not be said to owe much to their instruction at the Academy , for it was then very limited in extent , and loosely enforced . In 18152 , Congress passed a new act upon the subject , creating a Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy , with an assistant ; a Professor of Mathematics , with an assistant ; a Professor of Engineering , with an assistant ; teachers of French , Drawing , and Fencing . These , with two hundred and fifty Cadets , under the superintendence of the Chief of Engineers , were to constitute the Military Academy . By this law , Congress had created the body of a really useful institution , but had omitted all that was necessary to give it vitality . There were neither duties prescribed to its officers , regulations to guide them , nor responsibility to their acts . The consequences natural to such an organization followed . The military superintendent and the civil professors soon cailie in collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cnviable distinction in science , w ore anxious , for their own reputation* // sake , to establish a system of studies , and acquire for the institution a character for utility and science . To do this was no easy matter . They had to contend with ignorance and idleness among their inferiors ,  --  obstinacy and folly among their superiors ,  --  to bring confusion to order , and intelligence from obscurity , without any other aid , than their own personal influence and exertions . The correspondence of these professors , with the various departments of the government , their resistance ,  --  under the inquisition of personal arrests , threatened trials , violent slander , and all the oppression of power ,  --  to the violation of laws , and the exercise of authority , illegally exerted , would afford an instructive lesson to future legislators , upon the weakness of legislation struggling against that most arbitrary of all principles-military discipline , and to republican citizens upon the care and restrictions , with which power should be delegated . They , however , finally accomplished their purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , enabled it to discern the evil , and apply the remedy . Academic regulations were adopted , regular examinations enforced , a systematic course of instruction established , and efficiency given to the details of the institution . Its early history , with many other similar examples , illustrates the ease with which our laws may be evaded , or , with impunity , disobeyed . It was the remark of one of its then professors that , " principia non homines , " was a good maxim ; but that it ought always to be remembered that the principles were to be enforced by men . What future generation will believe that , during four years , in which more than two hundred Cadets were annually at the Academy , and its expenditures more than four hundred thousand dollars , no examinations were had for admission , nor any afterwards upon their subsequent studies ? - that the three winter months were a vacation , and the three summer ones an encampment , without study ? - that officers were commissioned in the corps of Engineers , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all this was done , not only without the countenance , but in direct opposition to the written law of the land ? I shall pass to the present state of the Academy , with the single remark that , from the accession of the present superintendent , in 1817 , and the adoption of a system of studies , nothing within the executive power of himself or the government has been omitted , to make the Academy reputable or useful . It still , however , needs many things , to give it the maximum of credit and utility . These it will no doubt in time acquire , but it must be by the full exposure both of what it now is , and what it requires . A brief statement of these , I will now make , premising that , a Board of Visiters are annually appointed , by an executive regulation , to report upon its condition and necessities . These reports have for several years been made , and are before the public . They advise several improvements , but , with no exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean no objection to the accuracy or acumen of the gentlewien who made them , when I say , that their recommendations regard rather the increase of buildings , and the enlargement of salaries-things certainly worthy of regard ,  --  than those alterations in the moral and mental constitution of the Academy , of infinitely greater consequence to the pupil and the world . Indeed , a caviler might say that the Board , as // organized , was not the best possible jury to decide upon works of science , or speak without prejudice of the acts of government ,  --  that they were selected with less reference to their science and erudition , than their political merits ,  --  and that , even an enemy may be supposed , after a pleasant journey , at the expense of government , amidst the most attractive charms of nature , astonished by the highest of intellectual entertainments , touched by the flattery of polite attention , and not insensible to the delights of sparkling Champaign ,  --  to go away anxious to praise , and averse to censure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their praise is justly bestowed , and many of their suggestions may be profitably adopted ; at the same time , many others might have been made , with credit to the board , and usefulness to the institution . What they are will appear from the following remarks . I shall speak , 1st. of the requisites , and mode of admission ; 2d . Of the course and mode of instruction ; 3d . Of the cost and results of the Academy ; 4th . Of what it still requires . 1st . The legal requisites for admission are that the candidate should be fourteen years of age , and be well versed in reading , writing , and the ground rules of Arithmetic . Upon their arrival at the Point , they are immediately placed in barracks , arranged in squads for drill , and , at the proper time , about the 20th of June , examined . Low as these requisites are , some are always found deficient . Those who pass are admitted on probation ,  --  their warrants , by a regulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the January examination , six months subsequent . This is analogous to the Collegiate Matriculation . When admitted they are placed in camp , and subjected to military drills and discipline , till the first of September , at which period the academic term commences . 2d . Course and mode of instruction . The general course of study at West-Point is well known to the public . It is almost wholly scientific , and embraces very little that belongs to the study of arts , language , or literature . The Dead Languages , the Belles Lettres , Composition , Criticism , and even Geography , are not required for admission , and form no part of the course of instruction . In a merely military point of view , this is sufficiently proper ; for it can not be supposed that either grammar or Latin is necessary to the attack and defence of fortified places , or that the graces of composition are necessary to the art of castrametation . The pupil of the Military Academy is , however , to be a member of civilized society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  and in this respect , it may well be doubted , whether he should not be inducted into some of these studies and accomplishments , which may give him a sympathy with the world in which he lives . The only branch of this sort , which he now at all pursues , is a brief course of grammar , moral philosophy , and nationallaw , which , from the short and hurried time allowed , affords a very inadequate glance at these important subjects . In respect , however , to the pure sciences , the Academy has obtained an undoubted superiority over every other institution in the country . No other has carried them so far , or instructed in them so accurately . The Cadets literally graduate excellent professors of Philosophy and Mathematics . Whether so much science , so abstractly pursued , and so deeply extended , is the proper end of their education , many will doubt ; I , however , have no // fears that any one will ever be too deeply imbued with either the prin* ciples of science , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy has been given to these sciences , with those branches , collateral and consequential , connected with them . Engineering , military and civil , is taught ; the French language , also , as being , strictly speaking , the language of war ; Drawing and Chemistry , as auxiliaries to Philosophy and Engineering . In all these studies , the instruction is complete , and the proficiency of the pupils much greater than in any of our collegiate institutions . In Mathematics , a great improvement has been made by the introduction of the modern invention of Descriptive Geometry , with its applications to Shades and Shadows , and Civil Engineering . It was long since introduced into the schools of France , by Monge , who first systematized it . In the Military Academy , it was for some time taught orally by Professor Crozet , and now from the excellent treatise of Professor Davies , who has just published an interesting treatise on its application to Shades and Shadows . It is remarkable that a branch of science , so practical in its details , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced into our colleges . I observe it now makes a part of the programme of studies in the college of New-Jersey ; to all the others , I believe , it is vet a stranger . They must keep up with the spirit of the times , or lose much of their influence and usefulness . In Mechanical Philosophy and Astronomy , from their previous acquisitions in Mathematics , the pupils of the Military Academy are rather proficients than students . In Drawing , also , their acquirements are much beyond what most young men have an opportunity to make . But it is not the quantity learned , so much as the mode of instruction , and discipline of the mind , which is the great object , either to the student or the public . He , who has learnt how to study , will seldom be idle ; and he , who has once trod the paths of knowledge , will tread them still , though hedged in with thorns , and terminated by the mountain cliff . In these respects , other institutions may well go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind are there-by the aid , indeed , of extraordinary authority-disciplined and exercised to their utmost limits . Experience , in the business of instruction , has sufficiently taught three elementary principles : 1st . That only a certain number can be successfully taught by one instructer ; 2d . That all can not progress alike ; 3d . That strong motives of ambition are necessary excitements to industry and emulation . These principles have , at West-Point , been faithfully carried out . The new class is , at the commencement of the term , divided into sections , of about twenty each  --  a class of one hundred , for example , into five , arranged alphabetically . This number is found sufficient for one instructer , in the period of three hours allowed for recitation . These are all , at first , placed in the same treatises and subjects . At each recitation , they are individually marked according to their merits , and at the end of the week the sum of these marks ascertains the rank of each . The names of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office for inspection , and so on during each week . If , at the end of any given time , any one is found * Some excellent remarks upon the subject of military educatien may be consulted in a recent number of the Edinburgh Review , in which the writer contends that prefcssers are not so touch vanted , as those who can epply their mica. vom*. iii . 35 // uniformly best , he is transferred to a higher section ; if worst , to a lower one . In this manner , before the January examination , the sections , from being alphabetically arranged , are placed nearly in the order of merit . That examination completes the arrangement , and those , who are found deficient , are refused their warrants , and return to their homes . An entire section are , at this time , usually discharged . This mode of marking and arrangement continues throughout their whole academic course ; and not only this , but the weight of each set of marks , in each respective study , is graduated according to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those studies , as it respects time and usefulness . Thus the maximum of Mathematics , Chemistry , and French , is in the ratio of three , two , and one ; i. e . Mathematics is considered twice as important as Chemistry , and three times as much so as French . At the end of each annual examination , those , who are found deficient , are turned back one year , and if once more so , discharged . Under a stimulus and discipline like this , it is obvious that no one can graduate without talents and industry . Indeed , a class consisting of one hundred , upon its entrance , is ordinarily reduced to forty , at its graduation  --  a sufficient commentary upon the rigor and exactness of the ordeal they have to pass . Nor is this all ; their rank in the army depends upon their standing in their class , nor can it be altered in time of peace by any after conduct . Such severity of discipline and excess of demand can not be expected from colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasury , which give vigor and efficacy to them at the Military Academy . But , though this is not expected , the division of the classes into smaller sections , the greater number and more exactness of rewards , the variation of text-books with reference to capacity , may well be imitated by any and all places of instruction . The sections must be small , or the instructer can not take up all , at each recitation , and , unless he does so , the boys soon learn to calculate the chances , and neglect much of their study . In some of our colleges , not less than forty or fifty are heard by a single teacher , and not more than eight or ten taken up at once . The idle and the irregular soon take advantage of this , and superadd , to the want of proper instruction , the evils of negligence and dissipation . In addition to this , though distinctions and rewards , of various kinds , are made a part of college discipline , yet they are not immediately and constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distant rewards of his whole academic career , than excitements to his daily vigilance ; and the whole world can tell how little the good or evil of the future weighs , in comparison with the events of the passing hour . We trust , however , that this improved method of instruction and discipline will soon be generally adopted , and that the utmost liberality of means , breadth of acquisition , and exactitude of requirement , will , in accordance with the onward spirit of the age , be made to enter into all the institutions of letters and knowledge . 3 . The Expenditures of the Academy are necessary to a complete view of it , but are certainly not to be considered in that unprofitable manner , which places money in competition with science . This government can well afford to make the Academy what it pleases , and the economy , which would leave it deficient in any of the requisites // for a high and superior education , would never find countenance in the good sense and patriotism of the people . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants a strict accountability in the application of means . The pecuniary management of the Academy has , I believe , for several years , been strictly frugal and exact . In the chrysalis state , before alluded to , it was , however , anything else ; and the same disregard of specUic appropriations was manifested here , as was also in many other departments of the government . The annual pay and subsistence of the regularly authorized officers and cadets of the institution , are about ninety-three thousand dollars . If to this we add twenty thousand dollars to the Quarter-Master 's department , and seven thousand dollars for extra compensation allowed many officers attached to the Academy , the Board of Visiters , and several miscellaneous heads , we shall have an annual aggregate of about one hundred and twenty thousand dollars , as the expense of the Academy . The average annual number of graduates is forty . Dividing the annual expense by the annual number of graduates , it gives three thousand dollars , as the precise cost to the nation , of each graduate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , but never graduate . This , therefore , is the cost of those only who enter the service . The materiel and appurtenances of the Academy are in every way liberal and respectable . The library contains near ten thousand volumes , chiefly scientific , and very many of them , especially those On the history and science of war , are in French . Probably no library in the country contains , not only so many works on exact science , but , so many maps , charts , and works relative to topography and civil engineering . Those on history , poetry , and literature generally , are not so numerous as many would desire , but the chasm may speedily be filled , as there is an annual appropriation for the support of the library . The apparatus of the Chemical and Philosophical departments is sufficiently extensive , and a handsome Mineralogical cabinet has been procured . The buildings , military preparations , and grounds , afford , in their extent , perfect police , and neat arrangement , the tout cnsemble of an enlarged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , I would now make a criticism , which to some may appear too nice , but which , I am confident , is just in itself , and for the best interests of the country . The first suggestion to be made is in reference to the requisites for admission . It must be obvious , from what has been said , how very slight these requirements are , in comparison with those of any of our colleges ; and it must be equally obvious to what results , in the subsequent studies of the cadets , this early deficiency has led . From the large amount of merely military ac* juisitions necessary to their education , and the great extent of their scientific studies , geography , literature , the languages , and even religious instruction , are almost entirely excluded from their thoughts . Now , as some knowledge of these things is absolutely essential to those who move through life in these places , and with that distinction , which is expected from the graduates of the Military Academy , it follows , that they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they leave it . The former is not required ; and the latter , from the indolence natural to human nature , and the temptations of // youth , can not be expected of any , but the severely studious and the intensely ambitious . It would be far better , then , to demand higher requisites for admission , and put them , in this respect , upon something like the level of collegiate students . For example , let it be required that they should come well versed in Arithmetic generally , English Grammar , Geography , and the rudiments of the Latin . Of the three former , the necessity is urgent ; of the latter , the utility need scarcely be vindicated ; at this period of enlightened education , few need be told that the Latin is the foundation of our tongue , that its grammar is the grammar of all modern languages , and that , whilst the Greek , and even any thing like classical attainments generally , may be safely disregarded , the rudiments of the Latin must be thoroughly understood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . It is also a necessary preliminary to the study of French , which constitutes so large an item in the academic course . This additional knowledge might be more readily required , by adding another requisite-that they should be sixteen years of age before admission . This suggestion derives a strong argument from the high order of studies , to which they are immediately introduced , upon their admission to the academy , compared to the slight acquirements they have previously made . How can it be reasonably expected that a boy of merely ordinary capacity , at the early age of fourteen , with no knowledge , but that of the ground rules of Arithmetic , should be capable of immediately entering upon the most abstruse branches of the Mathematics , and , in two years , acquire a standing in them equal to that of many , who are thought good mathematicians ? Yet this is precisely what is expected at the Military Academy . In fact , it is impossible for ordinary abilities to accomplish it , and a great injustice to demand it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in advance , or possessed superior talents , abundantly shows . By fixing the age of admission at sixteen , and raising the requisites to what we have mentioned , they would not only be far better qualified for the studies of the academy , but would be able to judge , before admission , whether their capacity and industry would endure its fiery ordeal . Another improvement that might be made , respects the permanency of the teachers . Of the thirty teachers employed at the academy , but ten are permanent instructers , appointed under the law ; the rest are officers of the army , stationed there , as assistant teachers , sometimes remaining one year , and sometimes longer . The department of Chemistry is altogether unknown to the law , and exists only by executive favor . One of the French teachers is employed in the same way ; and the Professor of Ethics has no legal assistant . Such an organization has a very unfavorable effect , both upon the teachers and the pupils . The former feel insecure in their places , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits of a uniform and steady manner of teaching . The proper Professorships and a sufficient number of permanent assistants should be authorized by law , and the vacancies filled by the best talents in the country , wherever found . There is one other suggestion , I would make , with as much deference and diffidence as its delicacy demands . There is a want of what people in general think a sufficient religious instruction , or rather , if we except one sermon a week , there is none at all . This // deficiency operates against the academy in various ways , and has already given rise to a charge of open infidelity . Though this is utterly untrue , yet , the cause which originated it is regretted not less by the prudent than the pious . We have arrived at a period of the world , in which a professed regard for Christianity is required by public opinion in every portion of Christendom . However numerous the lights and shades of sects , creeds , and opinions , no one covets or can long endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every college , and every academy in the Union , has its morning and its evening prayers , its public worship and its biblical instruction ; nor , could they long exist without them . And why is public opinion thus unanimous in its calls for such instruction ? Is it not , that , however strong the guards against temptation , however severe the punishment of depravity , yet they do nothing , in after life , to dam up the heart against the surges of vice and crime , without the aid of those positive precepts , and pure principles , derived from early moral and religious instruction ? The government have provided every other species of building , at West-Point , but a Chapel : there is , however , a large room in the Lyceum , which has always been appropriated to this purpose ; but it is insufficient for the accommodation of more than half of those who are , in one way or another , attached to the academy , and entitled to the benefit of public worship . It is altogether incommodious and unfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Methodist chapel , which , by the subscription of individuals and the permission of the Superintendent , has been constructed out of one of the old storehouses . In that , a Sunday School of eighty or ninety scholars is instructed , and a small but zealous congregation of the attach*s of the academy are regularly assembled . The Chaplain , who is a gentleman of elegant acquirements and acute understanding , is also Professor of Ethics , and experience would seem to show that his double duties were too onerous for the full performance of both : indeed , it ought not to be expected or required . The offices should be separated  --  a Professor of Ethics appointed  --  and the Chaplain required to hold morning prayers , and hear those simple , biblical recitations , which are entirely free from bigotry and sectarianism . This is as little , I should think , as should be tolerated in a seminary of young men , and is yet enough to give them some of those positive precepts of moral government , without which all the negative restraints of isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be melancholy to suppose that so many ardent spirits , so brilliantly educated , so aspiring in ambition , and so full of talent and promise , should go forth to the world , with no principle of action , but a reckless selfishness , and no determination towards that moral eminence , which is attained only by " the pursuit of noble ends by noble means . " Their influence upon the character and conduct of their country will be great ; for , after all that is said and bruited about freedom , the vast multitude are moved and regulated by the ambitious few ,  --  the iiien of disciplined talents and vigorous action . Is it not , then , of momentous consequence that every system of education should contain the elemerits of a pure , and sound , and high-toned moral government ? The tendency of military systems is not only to arbitrary but to licentious principles . This is also the tendency of human nature . It may easily // be imagined , then , with what ease the military student pursues the downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and conduct , which , in civil society , are such strong restraints upon the passions of men . The tendency of the government itself is to corruption , and no guards against it can be too strong . A remark of Montesquieu , in his L ' Esprit de Loix , should be engraved in golden letters upon the pillars of the capitol ,  --  that Honor is the principle of Monarchies ,  --  M2wleration of Aristocracies ,  --  Virtue alone of a De mocracy . D.M.@@183068353.txt THE human judgement is never more deeply deceived , than when it is led astray by an involution of errors ; that is , when an erroneous theory has produced an erroneous practice , and the truth of theory is argued from the necessity of the practice . I can best illustrate what I mean by an example . Bonaparte was a sagacious man ; he looked on the world with a penetrating eye ; and having himself made many experiments on human minds , he was an excellent judge of causes and effects . Yet , with all his sagacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were speaking , during his confinement in the island of St. Helena , of the restrictions of the Sabbath in England . A poor man was not allowed to work . " That is wrong , " said the abdicated Emperor ; " it may be very proper to restrain the rich from their employments ; but , they ought not to limit the poor . If a poor man does not work on Sunday , he will certainly be intoxicated , or gambling , or in some of the haunts of dissipation ; " and these observations he believed he could support from experience . Now , mark the involutions of error in his views . The want of a consecrated Sabbath in France had rendered the common people very dissipated . From their practice this keen observer had taken his views . If now he had given such a people as the French one day in seven for repose , no doubt their practice would have confirmed his theory . It never seems to have entered his mind , that a different populace might have exhibited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation produce errors in practice , and errors in practice confirm errors in speculation ; and the human mind is never more deeply deceived , than when it is so confined to its mistakes by a double chain . I recommend these remarks to all those honest foes of man 's happiness , who have spent their whole lives in hanging weights on the wings of human improvement . Respecting all our measures , we reason from facts ; and we deem that reasoning strong . Facts are stubborn things ; facts are the will of God ; facts can never deceive us . But let us not be too hasty in this career of confidence . Who made these facts ? Who ascertains them ? Who applies them to the question in debate ? The truth is , facts are only stubborn things in the view of obstinate minds . Man often makes the facts he abuses to his own selfish designs . Facts may be very stubborn things ( if we only ascertain them , ) respecting the motions of the planets , or the ebbing and // flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fickle , variable , intellectual , soaring man , the facts , which confirm your error , may be the effects of a previous error ; and if they stand in the way of improvement , let us go to work and make a new series of facts ; for the man of the last century is not the man of this ; he is born to change . It is precisely this involution of error , which has stood in the way of female improvement . Let us suppose the proposal to be carried to the Turks of Constantinople , to open the doors of the harem ; to release their females from their bonds ; and to endeavor after something like domestic enjoyment . With what astonishment would the proposal be heard ! How impossible would it appear ! What , trust woman to herself ! Give liberty to such a childish , trifling , faithless class of creatures ! And no doubt he could argue from facts . Their women are the creatures of ignorance , and confinement alone can preserve their morals ; for those that find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . But the woman of a Christian land is a very different being from a follower of Mahomet . The former has a soul , the latter , almost literally , has none . But have we reached the highest point , to which the elevation of this moiety of the world may be carried ? Has female education received the attention it ought ? Let us never tire in our efforts , until both man and woman have reached the elevation for which God designed them , and the gates of paradise be restored . The truth is , there is no one subject on which we may indulge better hopes , or in which the past is less a pattern for the future . In these last ages , there has been a wonderful revolution respecting the female character . Since the fall of the Roman power , whose refinement has been so vastly overrated , and since the Gothic nations broke in from the north , first to afflict , and then to mend the human race , there has been a charm thrown over domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is perfectly new . The ancients knew nothing of it . It is like the soft hues of an Italian sky , which a traveler sees , and can estimate from no other sky he has ever seen . It is one of those accessary ideas of the imagination , which sometimes strangely arises , and which , the more we endeavor to account for , the more we admire . It sprang up partly from chivalry , partly from religion , partly from the influence of their songs and romances ; but chiefly , from the higher elevation to which women themselves rose . I shall not say , that this new passion has not been productive of evil as well as good ; that it has not strewn some thorns , as well as some roses in the sober path of life . Earth is no paradise ; and fiction must forsake a man some time before he reaches the grave . But when one compares the respectful attention paid to a modern lady , with the gross familiarity used to ancient woman ; when we place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious sensuality of the old Pagans ; when we pass from the grossness of one of the odes of Horace to the better sentiments of one of our most ordinary novels , it is impossible not to own and admire the mighty change . It is a privilege for a woman to be born in these latter days . She is sure to secure the best influence , as soon as she deserves it . // In considering female education , let us first consider the character which woman sustains , and the station which she is called to fill . A good education must have reference to both . If we had not seen the vast influence of different objects in forming the mind , we might suppose the distinction of sexes reached to the human soul ; that the intellects of females were cast in a different mould ; and that God did not design them for such different occupations , without originally imprinting on the secret springs of their conduct an impression and bias , which would perpetually distinguish them even in a world of spirits . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the operation of other causes . Souls are formed by their interests and objects ; their original texture is lost in the thousand webs , which custom , education and society have woven around them . flow astonishingly do men differ ! What opposite beings are the American savage and the Hindoo ! The common professions of life will sometimes alter the whole structure of man 's mind , and shape all the passions of the heart . The difference , therefore , in the minds of the two sexes , it seems to me , may be fully accounted for , in their being born to different interests , and those interests separated by impassable lines . There is no sex in the soul . Their abilities , their capacities , their affections , are equal . If , at the natal hour , all who are now acting in the affinities of fathers , husbands and brothers , could have exchanged souls with those , who are now filling up the gentler stations of mothers , wives and daughters , the world would have been just what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same abilities displayed . The lawyer would have plead his cause ; the preacher would have mounted his desk , and the general would have gone to the field of battle . It is , therefore , an object of some importance , in cultivating minds , to remember , that spirits have no sex . Men are masculine women , and women female men ; we have each of us a vital spark from God , which can only . blaze when it is kindled by improvement . It has been customary , I believe , to pay the female sex a compliment respecting their virtues , at the expense of subtracting just so much from their abilities . I question both these representations . Women are neither angels nor fools . They are human beings under a weaker structure , and in a peculiar form . I question whether there is more real goodness found in their hearts , than among men . But do not misapprehend me . I am not contending that the decencies of life and a higher tone of morality are not better-preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moral . This is to be expected . The point which I question , is , whether , when an impartial God comes to trace ouf actions to their spring , and to weigh our faults with our temptations , he will not find as much goodness among the sons of Adam , as the daughters of Eve . Alas ! we can not reproach each other ; we are both miserable sinners . Hand in hand our parents left the garden of Eden together ; and hand in hand we have gone on in the paths of transgression ever since . Thus , it seems to me , in estimating the original and distinctive character of the female sex , we may say , they are not so much below their counterparts in point of abilities , nor so much above them in point of heart-virtues , as is commonly supposed . Perhaps there is no difference . // But though the foundation of souls may he the same , it is impossible not to see that the two sexes are called to occupy very different stations . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Men must force their way by resolution and activity ; women win most by modesty and retirement . Man must mingle with the temptations of life , must leave his home , must sometimes cross the seas , must encounter the dangers of foreign enterprise and foreign climes ; but , woman must adorn the circle , guide the house , soothe by her polished affability , and instruct by her silent example . The trades and professions of men are various ; but women have only to learn the common art of being good daughters , sisters and wives . Laying religion out of the question , which knows no distinction , the objects for which they live are not so various . A virtuous woman is almost the same being in all stations ; and , in all the ranks of life , she is called almost precisely to the same duties . If she would be respected , she must be something of an intellectual being ; if she would meet with kindness and affection , she must show them in her turn ; if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise man has mentioned-her husband also praiseth her ; - if she would win these praises , ( seldom won without merit , ) she must manage her family with neatness , economy and skill . The object of her life is extremely simple ; and the only difficulty I can conceive of : , is , in uniting the ornamental and useful parts in one beautiful proport*on ; in passing from the parlor to the kitchen , without confounding or losing the character suitable to both ; and this difficulty is not insuperable , for thousands have overcome it . Now the object of education must be to draw forth , in the best manner , these native powers to their appropriate and life-assigned objects . Women are not inferior to men in their intellectual structure ; but you can ' never make them feel that their interest , their success , their happiness are combined with the severer sciences , and the most laborious literary efforts . They never will make those desperate struggles to become great scholars , which can only be called forth when a man is contending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , let them rise to their proper level ; let them keep pace with the improvements of the world ; let them become qualified for the best society and the wisest conversation ; let them prepare themselves for the sphere in which they are to act , and the compound characters which they are to sustain and should there be among them some soaring mind , qualified by God for that bold eminence , where all fear , none aid you , and few understand , and willing to make the sacrifice-why , let her climb . No one has a right to forbid her . She must lose much , and she may gain much . She must give up the gentler suavities of life , and she may gain the iron throne of philosophy ; but if she has counted the cost , no one has a right to . forbid her . If a woman will leave the garden of Eden by plucking the tree of knowledge , she is a free agent , and must be permitted to rise or fall . But whatever course you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must remember that nothing useful is gained without application and perseverance . All we acquire is the effect of toil , and the powers of youth should not seemingly , but really , be devoted to efforts preparing us to act our part in life . In the cultivation of our minds , false labors will in time be detected . It is not the hours spent in the // school ; it is not the name of a study ; it is not even the lesson imprinted on the memory , which will raise you above the common level of icrnorance , or entitle you to the credit of a good education . You must soar above the levity and conquer the indolence of our natures . You must learn the inestimable value of youthful time . Tbese hours roll away with speed , and when they are gone it is impossible to recall them . Our minds never can become susceptible again ; our opportunities never can return . Idleness , in this period , is peculiarly criminal , for its effects will remain through life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very vain , not possessed of any wonderful endowments at the outset . She begins life with small intellect and its usual attendant-much conceit ; and her little stock has been still less improved . She has spent her childhood in romping - in roving-in giggling-in vexing her teachers , and in deceiving her parents , until she leaves school with as small a stock as possible without absolute disgrace . But some people say she is handsome ; and other some are sure to tell her of it ; and she is sure to believe it . We will suppose she had a comely face , and when you have said that you have said all . She is married ; and balls and parties must now give place to the sober duties of life . Alas , her days of happiness are gone . The transient ornaments of youth pass away , and no solid attainments remain to supply their place . Neglected time returns to take long years of vengeance for the hours that have been lost . She has learned nothing-she knows nothing  --  and she is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth : he may not use her ill-he may not reproach her ; but he may and must regard her as an insect buzzing over his path-adding nothing to his happiness-sometimes hardly attracting his notice-never admitting her as a counsellor in his plans-often mortified when they go into company  --  and never amused , or instructed , or interested , in the least degree , when they are left alone . They are paired , not matched ; they endure life ; they never enjoy it . The parlor of such a woman is as cold and as joyless as the sepulchre . She is dependent wholly on company . She has no home . She passes her days in exile . The only smile she ever wins from her husband is that insulting smile of stifled pity , which makes us feel as if we were less than nothing . Do you fear this ? Then be diligent . It is the misfortune of women that the contrast is far greater between the prospects of their youth and their final experience than it is in our sex . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us see life through a false medium . But while men wake by degrees , as they see flower after flower fade along the descending path of life , in the lot of woman it is often but a single step from the garden to the desert . The trials of life come before they are hardened to them . They are often admired and flattered beyond all bounds in youth , only to be neglected and despised ever after . In the distribution of happiness , I can not persuade myself that an impartial GOD has so far departed from our conceptions of goodness as to set one sex much above the other . Both have their trials and advantages-their peculiar sorrows and peculiar consolations . But it ought not to be concealed that the life of woman , whilst it knows nothing of the triumphs and defeats of the public stage , is often shaded by those domestic evils , which , // though they never startle the imagination , waste the spirits by a constant wearing . Yours are incommunicable sorrows . It is household unhappiness . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the unkindness which you can not utter , because you are afraid to increase it . You must bear the returning trial with patience , when patience is exhausted . You must summon your fortitude when your strength is gone ; and endure the mortification , which drinks up the spirits , with no relief but tears , and no witness but GOD . Where now is your refuge ? and to what sanctuary will you fly for a shelter and a friend ? Nothing but the Gospel can support you . So far as the wants of this life are concerned , religion is far more necessary to you , than self-sufficient man . In you it would be not only criminal but impolitic to neglect it . Morality is a part of your reputation ; you can not swerve from it without becoming infamous ; and religion you need as an anchor to the soul ; as the healing medicine of a wounded heart . This will teach you to look beyond the world-to carry your sins and your sorrows to . God  --  to take shelter under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . It will preserve your tempers from being soured by affliction ; it will present one great aim for which you are always to live . It will preserve , in all conditions , a sense of your dignity when you remember Christ died for you as for all sinners ; it will keep you humble amidst flattery and success when you remember you are sinners . The Gospel is a great leveler-it levels all things . It levels our privileges and levels our guilt-levels our hopes and levels our fears . The Gospel is woman 's ornament and woman 's hope ; without this , you are on the ocean , you have no anchor ; the storm is abroad  --  the rocks are near . Then come , my blooming readers , and lay your first foundation in the love and the fear of God . Begin with a kncwledge of yourselves , as helpless , dependent , frail , dying creatures . Let the very cornerstone , on which you build your characters , be a humble heart . Be Christians-sincere and thorough Christians . To real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality . Cultivate your minds , enenlarge your views , and increase your knowledge , as much as you can . This will put power into your hands , which , if you know how to use it , will make you more useful . But whilst you feel that you are intellectual beings , never forget that you are women . That is your station ; there you are to act ; there you must be useful ; there you must find your happiness , if it ever be found . Every acquirement you make should take a tinge from your sex . I have heard some ladies of great excellence complain and sayWhat avail all the studies of woman , and all her youthful hopes , when she must , after all , be crushed down to the dull detail of domestic life ? How can she remember her books amidst the cares of a family ? Would it not be better for her to read the art of cooking and the seventy-five recipes , and never think of soaring to knowledge every particle of which she must forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But these complaints come from not knowing how to use the materials . There is a passage from almost every species of knowledge , to some species of usefulness ; and it is for you to find it . There is a general impression abroad , that a learned woman is an unnmiabl* character . It generally suggests the idea of something // rough , unmanageable , disputative , haughty , vain . But the impression is not correct . It is not the learning which makes the woman unlovely , but the affectation which accompanies it . Remember your duties ; remember your stations , and you may be as learned as you please . And , after all , many of your accomplishments are founded on your virtues . Where there is a humble heart , and modest pretensions , the smallest and the greatest abilities will be respected . It is pride which makes poor human nature ridiculous and contemptible . This is the great enemy of your sex as well as ours . Perhaps I can not give a more inportant direction than to say , Beware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hartz mountains lived a knight who was generally known by the name of Eckbert the Fair . He was about forty years of age , of the middle stature , with short , light hair hanging smoothly and thickly over a pale and sunken forehead . He led a very retired life , and never interfered with the affairs of his neighbors ; indeed , he was seldom seen without the walls of his own castle . His wife was equally fond of seclusion , and each seemed happy in the other 's affection ; nor did they find any reason for sorrow , but that it had not pleased Heaven to bless their union with a single child . Eckbert was but seldom visited by strangers , and even then he would make but little change in his usual manner of life , exemplary as it was for the temperance and frugality by which it was ordered . He was , at these times , gay and happy , and it was only when alone that a deep , still shade of melancholy was seen to darken his countenance No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a man with whom Eckbert had formed quite an intitnacy , because he found in him an attachment to Indians seldom attempt to storm a fortified place . However , individuals desirous to gain a name , will rush upon the enemy 's entrenchment , tomahawk in hand , strike a blow , and then retire with the same celerity . This exploit is reckoned equal to slaying an esiemy in fair battle . // those pursuits in which he was himself particularly interested . His residence was in France , but he frequently spent a few months in the neighborhood of Eckbert 's castle . Passing his time in collecting and arranging plants and minerals , he lived on a small property , and was perfectly independent . Eckbert often accompanied him in his retired walks , and with every year a closer friendship grew up between them . There are some moments , when we are troubled that we have concealed any secrets from our friends ; even those secrets which we have , till that hour , kept with the most anxious care . The soul feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection , to make it more sacredly its own . It is at these moments that delicate hearts become acquainted with each other , though it may be that one of them shrinks back from the view that is revealed to it . It was on a stormy night in autumn , that Eckbert , with his wife Bertha and his friend , was seated by his cheerful hearth . The blaze of the fire cast a clear light through the apartment , and gleamed brightly upon the ceiling . Night looked darkly in at the window , and the trees without were waving and rustling in the rainy tempest . Walter was little disposed for a long ride home , and Eckbert invited him to pass a few hours in friendly conversation , and to rest in an apartment of his house . Walter accepted the invitation , wine and supper were brought , the fire was replenished , and their conversation became more free and confiding . When the supper was removed , and the servants had again withdrawn , Eckbert took Walter by the hand , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once hear the strange story of my wife 's early days . " " Gladly , " said Walter ; and they seated themselves again at the fire-place . It was already quite midnight , and the moon appeared rolling in a sea of deep ciouds . " You must not consider me obtrusive , ' commenced Bertha , " but my husband says you are so generous , it would be injustice to your friendship to keep any secrets from you . But do not consider my relation a fable , however wonderful it may appear to you . " I was born in the country , and my father was a poor herdsman . The household affairs of my parents were so badly managed that they were often unable even to procure their bread . But what troubled me most , was , that my parents quarreled over their poverty and bitterly reproached each other . I was myself frequently upbraided as a silly , stupid child , unable to perform the simplest labors ; and , indeed , I was so extremely awkward and helpless that I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to sew or spin , knew nothing about housework , and understood nothing hut the extreme misery of my parents . That I understood deeply . Often would I sit , and fill my imagination with what I would do for them if I were suddenly to become rich ; how I would pour out before them gold and silver , and delight in their wonder ! At such times I would see spirits rise before me and point out some hidden treasures , or give me little pebbles which would immediately change into precious stones . In short , the strangest fancies encompassed me , and when I was forced to rise , and help to do or carry something , I was still more unfit th imaginations , was always , e more I had indulged in such blessed cruel to me , because he found me so entirely useless ; he often treated me most harshly , and it was seldom that he favored me with a kind word . I was now eight years old , and my father determined that I should begin to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstinacy in me , that I might pass my time in idleness ; he terrified me with the most harsh menaces , and when these proved unavailing , lie beat me in the most cruel manner , and threatened the same punishment every day , unless I ceased to be a mere useless burden . " Through that whole night I wept bitterly , and I felt myself so utterly forsaken , that I wished I might die . I feared the approach of day-I knew not what to do . I prayed for all possible skill and aptness , and could not conceive why I should be less handy than the other little children of my acquaintance . I was near despair . " As day was dawning , I arose , and , almost without knowing what I did , opened the door of our little hut . I passed over a field , and soon reached a wood , into whose recesses the light of morning had not yet penetrated . I ran forward very swiftly , without looking hack ; for I felt no fear-when I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my attempted escape to still severer cruelties . When I again came out of the wood , the sun was high , and I saw some vot .. isj. 38 // thing black lying before me which seemed a deep , thick cloud . Sometimes , in my course . I clambered over hills , sometimes took a winding path among the rocks , and I now knew that I had reached far into the neighboring mountains . I began to be much alarmed . Living on the plain , I had never before seen these places , and the very word AIountains , to my childish ear , had always been a sound of horror . I had not the heart to go back , and my very anguish pressed me forward ; but I often shuddered as the wind rustled among the leaves in my path , or , as at a distance , a felled oak crashed in the stillness of the morning . As I met the miners , who lived among the mountains , and heard their strange language , I almost sank to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages , and begged of the inhabitants , whenever 1 was troubled with hunger or thirst . When they questioned me , 1 made out pretty well with my answers . In this manner , I wandered about four days , when I happened to fall in with a footpath , which led me continually farther from the main road . The rocks about me assumed here a different and very singular appearance . They formed a pile of cliffs , so heaped upon each other , that it seemed as if the first whirlwind would tear them asunder . I knew not how I should get farther . I had often slept in the woods during the mild weather , and in remote shepherd-huts ; but here I could find no inhabited dwelling , and knew that it was in vain to seek for one . The rocks about me were steep and frightful ; I was often obliged to pass over deep and dizzy abysses , and at length the path ceased from under my feet . I was hopeless . I wept and shrieked , and my voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was surrounded . Now night broke upon me , and I sought out a mossy place where I might rest myself . But I could not sleep . During the night I heard frightful noises , sometimes I thought from wild beasts , sometimes from the wind which whistled among the rocks , and again from strange birds . I prayed , and , late towards morning , fell into a slumber . " I awoke when the light of the sun shone upon me . Before me was a high rock , which I climbed , in the hopes of seeing some outlet to this wilderness , or perhaps some habitation of men . But when I stood upon its top , every thing , as far as my eye could reach , wore the same aspect as the spot immediately around me . All was covered with a thick mist , for the day was dark and cloudy . I could discover neither tree , nor meadow , nor bush ; and the only signs of vegetation were a few shrubs which had grown up from the clefts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolateness of the scene . It is indescribable , how much I desired to look upon the face of a human being , even if I were to be obliged to fly from it . In the mean time , I was suffering under a painful hunger , and I seated myself and resolved to die . But after a while , the desire of life triumphed . I rose up and wandered about the whole day in tears , and broken sighs . At the end of it , I was hardly conscious of existence , wearied , exhausted , yet desirous of life , and fearing death . " Towards evening the region about me assumed a more friendly appearance ; my thoughts and wishes were again animated , and a desire of life thrilled through every vein . I thought also that I heard the humming of a mill at a distance , and redoubling my haste , proceeded on so lightly and easily , that I soon reached the last of the desolate rocks , when I saw meadows lying before me , with woods and pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a land of misery to a Paradise ; the solitude and my helplessness were forgotten . " Instead of the expected mill , I met with only a waterfall , and this was another disappointment . I scooped up with my hand a draught of water from the brook , when suddenly , at little distance , I heard a low coughing . Never was I so agreeably surprised as at this time , when , on going nearer , I saw at the edge of the wood , an old woman , who seemed to be resting herself . She was clothed almost entirely in black . A black cap covered her head and a great part of her countenance ; in her hand was a crutch . " I approached her and begged her assistance ; she suffered me to sit down by her , and gave me some bread and wine . Whilst I was eating , she sang in a shrill tone , a spiritual song . When she had finished , she told me to follqw her . " I was rejoiced at the proposal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange to me . With her crutch she went along rapidly , and at every step so distorted her countenance , that at first , I almost laughed outright . The wild rocks receded behind us , as we passed over a pleasant meadow , and then through a long wood . While we were coming out of it the sun went down , and I shall never forget the appearance and feelings of that evening . Every thing // 299 was molten into the softest red and gold . The trees stood with their tops in the sunshine , and a bright glory was shed over the fields . The woods and the leaves of the trees were still , the pure heaven seemed like a disclosed paradise , and the murmurs of the streams , mingled from time to time with the rustling of the leaves , resounded through the calm silence as in a melancholy joy . My young soul began , for the first time , to understand the world and its delights . I forgot myself and my companion ; my soul and my eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a hill , planted with birch trees , which continued to a green valley below , in whose midst stood a little cottage , half concealed by the over-shading branches . A lively barking was heard , and a little dog sprang out on the old woman , wagging his tail ; he then came to me , and after a close examination , returned with friendly looks to the old woman . " As we were descending the hill , I heard a wonderful song , which seemed to come from the hut , and resembled the voice of a bird . It ran thus : Jo the quiet of the wood And its holy solitude , Joy is shed upon our way ; i*till to-morrow as to-dayThe sole joy is solitude And the quiet of the wood . These few words were continually re-echoing , with sound like that produced by the strains of a flute , mingled with those of a bugle . " My curiosity was very much excited , and without waiting for an invitation from the old lady , I stepped into the hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was arranged with neatness . Cups were standing on the mantelpiece , some vessels of different kinds on a table , and , in a glittering cage at the window , hung a bird , who undoubtedly had sung the words which attracted my attention . The old woman panted and coughed , for she seemed unable to recover herself ; sometimes caressing the little dog , sometimes speaking with the bird , who replied always in the words of the sarrie song ; in short , she appeared entirely to disregard my presence , and acted as if she had been alone . Whilst I was looking at her , her countenance was in continual motion , and her head seemed to be shaking from extreme age , so that I was unable to ascertain her original expression . " When she had recovered , she lit a lamp , set out a small table , and placed upon it the evening meal ; then looking towards me , she bade me take one of the twisted-reed stools . I sat down opposite to her , and the light stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , so distorting her features that I was again fearful of breaking into a laugh ; but I was very careful not to give her any cause of anger . " After supper , having again prayed , she led me into a small and low chamber , where I was to pass the night ; sleeping herself in the sitting-room . I was soon lost in slumber , for I was exceedingly fatigued ; but during the night I woke up several times , when I heard the old woman cough and speak to the dog , and sometimes to the bird , which seemed in a dream , repeating single words of his song . These sounds , with the rustling of the birches before the windows , and the song of a distant nightingale , formed so singular an union , it appeared to rue that I had fallen into another and still stranger dream . " In the morning , the old woman waked me to show me about my labor . I was obliged to spin , which I learned very easily ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird . 1 was soon able to work about house , and became acquainted with all the places around . It now happened , as in such cases it always roust , that I no longer thou , , ht the old woman had anything strange about her , that the house was peculiar and remote from all human creatures , or that there was anything extraordinary in the bird . His beauty had always struck me , for his plumage glanced with all possible colors ; the most delicate blue and the brightest red , changed on his neck and body , and , when singing , he raised himself so proudly that his plumage seemed still more brilliant ! " The old woman frequently went out and returned at evening , when I went to meet her with the dog , and she called me child and daughter . I at last began to love her , as the mind in childhood accustoms itself to love every thing . In the evening , she taught me to read ; an art which I soon acquired , and which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude ; for the old lady possessed many ancient manuscripts which contained many wonderful things . " The remembrance of my manner of life at that time seems strange to me even to this day ; visited by no human being , and brought up in so small a family , tlv // 31J0 dog and the bird made the same impressions on me that generally grow up among those who have been for a long time friends . I have never been able since to remember the strange name of the dog , however often I was then used to call on him . " I had lived four years with the old woman , in this manner , and was now about twelve years old , when she at last began to confide in me , and entrusted me with a secret . This was , that the bird laid every day an egg , in which was found a pearl or precious stone . I had always observed that she busied herself about the cage secretly , but had never felt much curiosity on the subject . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her absence , and putting them into certain strange vessels . She would now provide me with sustenance , and stay away weeks and months in succession . My little wheel hummed , the dog barked , the wonderful bird sang , and every thing was so serene in the valley about me , that I have no recollection of any tempest or thunder-storm during the whole time I remained there . No human creature wandered there ; no wild beast came near our dwelling ; I - as happy , and labored on so from one day to the next . One might really be called happy , who could in this manner continue life to its close . " From the little which I read , I formed the strongest ideas of the world and mankind , as I took all my notions from our own little society . When reading of happy people , I could not imagine them different from our little dog ; fine ladies seemed always like the bird , all old women like my wonderful mistress . I had also read of love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I imagined a beautiful knight , and adorned him with every excellence , without exactly knowing how he helped me from all my troubles ; but I really felt very wretched when my love was not returned . Then I framed long appeals to his affection , and sometimes spoke them aloud , to win him back . You smile ! we have indeed long passed this season of our youth . " It was always pleasant to me to be left alone , for then I was mistress of the house . The dog loved me , and did whatever I wished ; the bird replied to all my questions with his little song ; my wheel spun on cheerfully , and I was troubled neither with desire nor regret . When the old woman returned from her long wanderings , she praised my attention , and said , that her household , since I had belonged to it , had gone on uncommonly well . She rejoiced at my growth and good appearance , and in short , treated me altogether as if I had been a daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once said to me in a stern tone , whilst you continue so , it will always be well with you ; but they have never prospered , who wander from the right path ; punishment reaches them sooner or later . ' Whilst she said this , I did not even attend to her , for my whole thought and being were full of joy ; but in the night , her words returned to me , and I could not divine what she had meant by them . I thought over all the words as she uttered them ; I had , probably , before read of riches , and it at last occurred to me that her pearls and gems were something precious and costly . This thought soon returned to me still more forcibly . But what could she mean by the right path * In short , I was then unable entirely to comprehend her meaning . " I was now fourteen years old , and it is a misfortune for us , that we can acquire knowledge only at the expense of innocence . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the absence of the old wotnan , to take the bird and the jewels , and then to seek out the WORLD , of which I had read so much . Sometimes , too , it seemed probable that I might meet the beautiful knight , whose image was always in my thoughts . " At first , this thought occupied me no more than every other thought ; but when I looked upon my wheel , it came back to me involuntarily , and 1 so forgot tnyself as to dream of being magnificently ornamented , and surrounded by knights and princes . After I had been thus deceived , you may imagine that I used to be sorely grieved , on again finding myself in our little cottage . As for the rest , when I did my work , the old woman used to trouble herself but little about my behavior . " One day my mistress came to me and said that she was now obliged to be absent longer than usual , and that I must take uncommonly good care of things , a*md @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands . I lingered with a certain fear upon her departure , for it seemed to me as if I should never see her a , ain . I looked long after her as she went away , and yet could not tell why I was so anxious ; it was as if my purpose were even then before me , though without shape o. definitene 5. // " Never before had I attended so carefully to the dog and bird , which were now nearer to my heart than ever . The old woman had been some days absent , when I rose , with the fixed determination to leave the cottage with the bird , and seek what I had seen called the WORLD . My feelings were oppressive and disquieted ; I wished still to remain , and yet I burned to be away ; there was a strange contest in my soul , as the struggle of two conflicting spirits . At one moment , the quiet s ? litude appeared all beautiful to me , and again the expectation of a new world excited me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide , the dog sprang on me continually the sunshine brightened gaily over the fields , and the green birches gleamed with beauty . I had a feeling of being obliged to do something quickly . I seized the little dog , bound him fast in the cottage , and took the cage with the bird under my arni . The dog cringed and whined at this unusual treatment , and looked at me with imploring eyes ; but I was afraid to take him with me . I took , besides , one of the vessels that were filled with the precious stones . " The bird twisted his head in a strange manner as I went with him out of the door , the dog struggled to follow after me , but was obliged to stay behind . " I avoided the way towards the wild rocks , and went to the opposite side . The dog barked and whined incessantly , and it went to my heart to hear him ; the bird sometimes began to sing , but as we were travelin* he was obliged soon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew weaker and weaker , till at length it ceased altogether . I wept , and was on the point of returning , but the desire of seeing novelty urged me onwards . " I had already passed over hills and through several woods , when evening came on , and I was obliged to stop at a village inn . I was very weak when I entered the tavern , but they gave me a little room and a bed , where I slept rather quietly , but dreamed of the menaces of the old woman . " My journey was very tiresome , but the farther I went , the more I was troubled by the thought of the old woman and the little dog . It occurred to me that without my help he would probably die of hunger ; and it often seemed that the old woman would come out of some thicket of the wood through which 1 was passing . Thus in tears and sighs I went on my way ; but whenever I rested , and placed the cage on the ground , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded by it of the beautiful home I had left . As human nature is forgetful , I believed that my former journey in childhood was less tedious than the present , and wished again to be in my former situation . " I had sold some precious stones , and after a few days wandering , I arrived at a village . From my very entrance , my heart misgave me ; I shrunk back and knew not why , until I discovered that it was the very village in which I was born . How much was I overcome ! I wept for joy , at a thousand strange recollections . Every thing was changed , new houses were erected , those which formerly stood there had disappeared , and I found traces of an extensive fire ; every thing was much smaller and narrower than I had expected . I was overjoyed with the hopes of seeing my parents again after so long an absence . I found the little house , the well known threshold , the latch was just as it had been formerly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had left it ajar . My heart throbbed violently ; I opened the door hastily , but entirely strange countenances were in the room , and stared at me . I inquired after the shepherd Martin , and was told that he and his wife had been dead for three years . I stepped quickly back , and went weeping out of the village . " I had thought with great delight on surprising them with my wealth ; for by the strongest chance that event had actually happened , of which I was wont to dream in my childhood . Now it was all in vain . They could not enjoy it with me , and that which I had always hoped for was entirely lost . " In a very beautiful town , I hired a small house with a garden , and procured a waiting maid to live with me . The world did not seem to me so wonderful as I had anticipated , but I gradually forgot the old woman and m former dwellin - place , and so , on the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sung for a great while ; I was much frightened , therefore , when one evening he burst out with a sudden and altered strain . He sang : Far away the leafy wood , And the quiet solitude ; Present pleasure all forget Cherish former pleasure yet . The sote joy i. sohil.ucle* And the quiet of the wood . // " All my anxiety returned , and I felt more deeply than ever that I had acted wrongly . When I arose , the sight of the bird was peculiarly disagreeable to me ; he continually looked towards me , and I was troubled by his presence . He did not cease from his song , and sounded it more shrilly and loudly than ever . The more I looked at him , the more fearful I became ; at last I opened the cage , thrust in my hand and grasped his neck , pressed my fingers together , when he looked mournfully at me and I released him ; but he was already dead . I buried him in the garden . " I now became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , and believed firmly that she would either rob or murder me . I had been long acquainted with a young knight who struck my fancy ; I gave him my hand , and with this , Sir Walter , my story is ended . " " You should have seen her yourself at that time , " said Eckbert ; " her youth , her beauty , and the indescribable grace which her solitary education had given her . She was indeed a perfect wonder , and I loved her more than I can tell . I had no property , but through her love I came into this affluence ; we have lived here , and never repented a single moment of our union . " " With my chatting , " resumed Bertha , " it has gone far into midnight-it is time for us to retire . " She arose and went to her chamber . Walter kissed her hand , wished her a good night , and said : " Noble woman , I. thank you . I can easily imagine to myself how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Strohmian . " Walter also retired , but Eckbert remained pacing to and fro in the apartment , exceedingly disturbed . " Is not man a fool ? " he at length exclaimed ; " I first prevailed upon my wife to tell her story , and now I repent of my confidence . Will he not misuse it ? Will he not impart it to others ? May he not , perhaps , for such is the nature of man , wish to possess our riches , at whatever hazard , and lay a plan to rob us of them ? " It struck him that Walter had not taken leave of him so cordially as might have been expected , after such an instance of confidence . When the soul is once excited to suspicion , it finds food for it even in the most trifling circumstance . Then Eckbert reproached himself for a mean distrust of his noble friend , and was yet unable to be divested of it . He wearied himself through the whole night with these unpleasant reflections . Bertha was sick and unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , and took leave of Eckbert in perfect indifference . Eckbert could not comprehend his conduct . He went to the chamber of his wife , who was in a high fever , which she said must have been brought on by the exciting narrative of the night previous . After this evening , Walter visited the castle of his friend but seldom , and when he came there went away after a few indifferent words . Eckbert was pained by this conduct in the highest degree ; he did not intimate any thing on the subject to Bertha or Walter , but each of them must have perceived his deep disquietude . Bertha 's sickness became every day more dangerous , and the physician despaired of her life . Color had fled from her cheeks , and her eyes were glazed and glowing . One morning she called her husband to the bed side , and commanded the servants to retire . " Dear husband , " she began , " I muSt disclose something to you which has almost deprived me of reason , and destroyed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifling circumstance . You know that whenever I have undertaken to relate the story of my childhood , I have been unable with the greatest trouble to remember the name of the little dog . On that evening Walter said to me : I can easily imagine to myself how you fed the little STaoniaiAu . Was this mere chance ? Did he guess the name , or did he know it , and mention it on purpose ? And how is my fate connected with his ? Sometimes I struggle with myself , and try to believe that this strange affair is mere imagination ; hut it is true , too true . A cold shuddering came over me when I saw my . memory thus assisted by this stranger . What sayest thou , Eckbert ? " Eckbert looked upon his afflicted wife in deep emotion ; he continued some time silent , till at last , he spoke a few soothing words and left the room . He retired to a distant apartment , where he remained pacing to and fro in indescribable anguish . Walter had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the only human being whose existence mortified and pained him . It seemed that he // 303 should be entirely free and happy if this man could be removed from his way . He took his crossbow , and to dissipate his gloomy thoughts went out to hunt . It was a raw winter day . Deep snow covered the cliffs , and bowed down the branches of the trees . He rambled about , and the moist drops gathered on his forehead , but he found no game , and his disquietude was increased . Suddenly he saw something stir the branches at a distance ; it was Walter , gathering moss . Without knowing what he did , he raised his bow . Walter saw him and threatened him with a dumb gesture ; but at that moment the arrow flew , and Walter suddenly fell . Eckbert felt relieved and free , but yet a cold shudder came over him as he approached his castle . He had a long way to return , for be had wandered far into the woods . When he arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had spoken many times of Walter and the old woman . Eckbert now lived long in the most retired solitude . He was still continually in a state of disquiet , for the strange story of his wife did not cease to trouble him , and he was always in fear of some unfortunate event . The murder of his friend incessantly stood before his eyes , and he lived in unhappiness and gloom . To get rid of his bitter reflections , he sometimes sought the society and amusements of the neighboring city . He wished to find some friend to fill the void in his soul , and yet , when he thought on Walter , he shrunk back from the conviction that in friendship he could never be happy . He had lived so long with Bertha in a delightful quiet , the friendship of Walter had been so many years a joy to him , and both were so suddenly snatched away , that his life , at many moments , seemed to him rather as a strange dream than a reality . A young knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and appeared to entertain a true affection for him . Eckbert was very much overcome by friendship , thus shown to him where he so little expected it . They were now frequently together , and the stranger showed towards Eckbert every possible complaisance . They always rode out together , they met in all the places of amusement , and , before long , were seldom apart . Eckbert was never happy but a few moments together , for he felt that Hugo loved him only from ignorance . He knew him not and was unacquainted with his story , and he conceived an irresistible desire to impart it to him , that he might discover whether he were in truth his friend . But fear held him back , and the dread of exciting his abhorrence . Sometimes he was so overwhelmed with his unworthiness , that he believed no man could think him deserving his affection , except he were an entire straiiger . Yet he could not withstand the impulse . During a solitary ride , he related to his friend the whole history , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugo was affected , and sought to console him . Eckbert rode on with a lighter heart to the city . But it seemed to he his evil lot to grow suspicious in the very hour of confidence and they had scarcely entered the saloon , when in the light of the many lamps , he mistrusted the countenance of his friend . He thought he observed a malicious sneer , and that Hugo spoke little with him , but conversed much with those around . An aged knight was in the apartment who had always conducted himself as the enemy of Eckbert , and iii a marked manner inquired about his wife and his riches ; to this man , Hugo attached himself , and they remained talking together a long time , glancing occasionally at Eckbert . His suspicions were thus confirmed ,  --  he believed himself betrayed , and a terrible phrenzy crept over him . Whilst he was looking at them , he suddenly beheld the face of Walter-all his expression , the perfect features of that well-known countenance , and was convinced that no other but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unutterable , he suddenly rushed from the assembly , left the city in the night , and after many times losing his way , arrived at his castle . As a restless spirit hurried him from room to room , no thought relieved him ; he wandered from gloomy reflections to others still more gloomy , and no sleep came to his eyes . He often thought that he was mad , and only imagined these dreadful visions ; then he remembered the death of Walter , and all was still more a mystery . He resolved again to travel , to compose and quiet his reffections . The thought of friendship , the desire of a companion , he had given up forever . He rode forth , without having decided on a particular way ; but he thought little on tha country that was before him . After some days , while he was riding at the full speed of his horse , he suddenly found himself in a labyrinth of rocks , from which there was no outlet . At last , he met with an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay over a waterfall ; he wished to give him a piece of // money by way of thanks , but the old man refused it . " Why is it , " said Eckbert to himself , " that I can not imagine this man to be any other than Walter ? " And lie looked once again , and indeed it was no other . Eckbert spurred his horse swiftly over meadow and through wood , till at length it dropped under him from fatigue . Unconcerned at this , Eckbert pursued his journey on foot . He is ascending a hill , lost in reverie , when he hears , at a short distance , a lively bark , and the rustling of birch trees , and a voice singing in wonderful tones : Joy in holy solitude , And the quiet of the wood . Here I know not care or pain , Envy may not wound again . Joy in holy solitude , And the quiet of the wood ! Recollection broke upon the mind of Eckbert ; he could not unriddle the mystery , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife , Bertha ; the wonderful was so mingled with the real , the world about him seemed enchanted , and he was master of no thought , no memory . A crook-backed old woman came up the hill coughing , supported by a crutch . Brin , est thou my bird ? my pearls ? my dog ? she shrieked out to him . Behold ! unrighteousness is punished . It is I who was thy friend Walter , thy friend Hugo . God in Heaven cried Eckbert to himself*-in what an accursed solitude have I then passed my life . dnd Bertha was thy sister . Eckbert fell to the ground . Why did she wichedly leave me ? Every thing would have turned out well and happily , for her time of trial was near to its end . She was the daughter of a hnight , who gave her to a poor husbandman to educate ,  --  the daughter of thy father ! " Why have I always cherished this horrid thought ? " uttered Eckbert . In early youth thou hast heard thy father relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the care of his wife , as she was the offspring of a previous marriage . Eckbert lay on the ground senseless and expiring ; more and more confused and dim became the words of the old woman , the bark of the dog , and the still repeated song of the bird.
