txt THESE volumes are exceedingly interesting ; not because the biography is ably managed , however ; for the writer is not by any means the one we should have chosen for the office his want of grace and skill in writing would be a sufficient disqualification for an undertaking , which requires taste and diselimination in the highest degree , to enable him to produce his materials to the best advantage . But we will not speak in dispraise of a work which appears to have been conscientiously done , and will simply express our regret , that he had not given most of his attention to that part of his subject , which will have most interest for the public mind . The Life of Hannali More covers a large space in literary history , reaching back from the present times , to those of Garrick , Johnson , and Burke ; she was thrown into acquaintance and intimacy with a great variety of characters , and all who were capable of appreciating character seem to have felt great respect for her excellent heart , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious and penetrating , than original ; but by turning all her attainments to the best account , both in conversation and xvriting ; - by knowing xvben to speak with effect , and when to be silent ; - and by manifesting in every word and deed , that benevolence which implies a well-disciplined mind , she secured the respect and attachment of such a variety of eminent persons , that we are actually confounded at the wide reach of associations which her life brings before us in a single view . There is Horace Walpole on one page , with his lordly foppery writing to his dear St. Hannah ; on the other , we see the melancholy majesty of Johnson . Here is Garrick , whose death eclipsed the gaiety of nations ; ' there is Burke with his wonderful powers , resembling that pavilion in the fairy tale , which could cover the territory of a nation , or be contracted to the dimensions of a sentry-box , at pleasure . But it would take too much time even to run over the list of memorable names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of *nmothing except the Waverley novels , which brings so many various characters before us , and we can not help thinking that a // writer , thoroughly versed in literary history , might have made a work from these materials , which would have taken as fast hold of the public mind , as J3osxvell 's Johnson . Say what we will of that writer 's coxcombry , nothing is more certain , than that his work is the model for a hiography , since it tells what the reader wants to know . This is the great point , on which success in this kind of writing depends , - to tell what the intelligent reader wants to know . In the case of Johnson , he wants to know his conversation , - his familiar remarks , because they were the evidence of his strength in writing the Life of Hannah More , this would not have been the point toward which curiosity would have turned , and Bosxvell , had he undertaken it , would have liked nothing better , than sketching an illustrious group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , all would have been life and bustle , and not grave and inanimate as a dance of death . We acknowledge that there is a difficulty in the execution of such works as this , arising from the circumstance , that the character requires to be considered in various aspects , while the biographer feels a particular interest in one , and perhaps is wholly unqualified to judge of the other . The life of Cowper is an example . Hayley regarded him as a literary man , and was well able to estimate his character , in that point of view . But Cowper 's life exhibited a remarkable case in pathology , which required great accuracy of observation , to determine where moral agency ended , and insanity began ; these facts the biographer did not think it well to publish , though he could not quite suppress them ; and accordingly , whoever wishes to understand the nature of the complaint from him is disappointed . Again , Cowper was eminently religious , and was partial to a particular view of that great subject , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has undertaken to exhibit him in this light , and his biography , though a very feeble performance , has obtained a very general circulation , because the public are interested to know what Cowper was in these relations . There are , then , several classes of readers ,  --  one wishing to know the literary , another the religious , another the domestic and social character of the person described , and the chance is that the biographer , if disposed to satisfy them all , shall be able , from his habits of mind , to satisfy the curiosity of but one . The same difficulty exists , though not to the same extent , in the case of Hannah More . As her gay sister Sarah // said of her , Hannah was of the christian faction ; and her biographer , without any exceptionable amount of party spirit , considers this the most important light in which her character can be presented . So without question it is ; but the way to exhibit it to admiration and example , is not to hold it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a daily beauty to her life , preserving her simplicity , when she was caressed by nobles , princes , and what was still more flattering , by illustrious men , and how it enabled her to turn away from the high society which sought her , to devote her life , her powers , and her sel1* made fortune to the glorious enterprise of doing good . Let the biographer show the effect of christianity in the life and intellectual exertions ; this is the way to do it honor ; he may show how it kept Cowper 's mind irn tune , during the lucid intervals , when it waked sounds so fine , original and sweet , that the world stood still to hear them ; and bow it made Hannah More lovely and attractive to persons of all descriptions , while she lived , and secured to 11cr , after death , a name of lasting renown . As this work is likely to be very generally read , we shall not pursue the thread of the narrative , except so far as to make observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most valuable , because they take us into the midst of a literary society , unequalled for its splendor . Hannah More was the daughter of a schoolmaster , and his five daughters were bred to the same profession . *h worthy man is said to have had a great dread of female pedantry , but probably communicated unconsciously to his daughter , a taste for such pursuits as interested his own mind . There was , however , no cause for apprehension ; for , remarkable as she was for the variety and extent of her attainments , she never took her place in society , simply as a literary lady , and this is one proof of her ability , since there are but few persons so situated , in whom the consciousness of having a reputation to sustain , would not interfere with lightness and grace of motion . In her childhood she read the Spectator , - a book which , in that day , had attractions for children : it would be worth while to put it into the hands of a child , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of intellectual enjoyment suited to an early age are multiplied a thousandfold . Of this there is no question , but it may admit of doubt , whether the intellectual enjoyment is increased in any thing like the same proportion . VOL . XL. - NO. 86. // We do not find the best appetites , where there is the greatest amount and variety of provisions ; nor are we at all sure , that this vast increase of luxuries in reading , bodes any good to the health and happiness of the youthful mind . It makes them read more ; but not to more advantage . The author 's remark upon the Spectator is very characteristic of his usual style ; he says that it was , if not of profundity enough to ground a correct taste , at least of sufficient grace to direct it in a due course of exercise and cultivation . ' the place of her residence in youth was Bristol , where her sisters kept a boarding-school . The first on the long list of her distinguished acquaintance , was the elder Sheridan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . He was struck with her prematurity of talent , and was doubtless a good judge of real ability , though his life was too roving and unsettled for him to accomplish much , even in his chosen pursuit . At the time when her intellectual gifts led him to cultivate her acquaintance , she was only in her sixteenth year . Ferguson also , who was delivering astronomical lectures in Bristol , was one of these admirers . To have her acquaintance sought by such men of note , was exceedingly flattering to one so young ; but the only effect of it seems to have been to encourage to a literary effort . She wrote a pastoral drama , called the Search after Happiness ; whether it succeeded or not , we are wholly unable to tell ; her biographer merely says , in the Delphic style , the attempt succeeded as it deserved ; ' we can see no reason why it should not deserve to succeed ; but we have many doubts whether its fate was so happy . At this period she became acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Langhorne , a person of some distinction in his day . Some of the letters of the latter are inserted , parts of which are light and graceful enough , but have no particular claim to insertion . But the friend to whom she appears to have felt most indebted , was Sir James Stonehouse , who had relinquished a large practice as a physician to take holy orders , and was then residing in Bristol . Besides encouraging her to cultivate her talents , he did much to draw out and cherish those religious feelings , which grew constantly stronger as she advanced in years . She was also the object of a more tender attachment ; a rich old bachelor fell violently in love with her , and she accepted his offers ; but some caprice on his part induced him to defer the marriage from day to day , // till she resolved to be trifled with no longer . The engagement was dissolved by mutual consent , and the discarded lover became her friend . Without the fear of a suit for breach of promise before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon her , and by the persuasions of her friends she was induced to accept it , though with long hesitation . At his death he left her a legacy of a thousand pounds . All her affairs of the heart seem to have been disposed of in a summary manner in early life . Her hand was again solicited and refused , but by whom , or what , history does not say . Of these two transactions her biographer remarks , there is on the face of them a stamp of that high-mindedness and moral strength , by which the dignity of her character was illustrated in the various xvalk of her christian life . ' What he may see in them we do not know ; to us , the face of the latter of the two appears singularly destitute of features ; in the other , we have no doubt she conducted herself with great propriety ; at the same time there is nothing to call for a long and solemn flourish of the trumpets of his praise . This is all the biographer has been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was born , till 1774 , when she went to London ; we believe this was the year , but her vicious neglect to date her letters on many occasions , lcaves us uncertain at times , when we wish to be sure . This , he says , brings her to that stage in the progress of ardent inexperience , when the blooming speculations of hope and fancy are to be exchanged for vulgar verities . ' Very fortunate was she if her ardent inexperience lasted to the age of twenty-nine , and if her blooming speculations could then be exchanged for such vulgar verities as the acquaintance of Johnson and Carrick , in one sex , and Mrs. Montague and Mrs. Carter , in the other . We are not informed what conducted her to London , nor to what good fortune it was owing that she became at once an object of flattering attentions . A provincial reputation for talent , be it ever so great , is not often a passport to London society , and as for her works , we hear of scarcely anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to suppose , did not meet with unusual success . Garrick , it is true , had some reason to be prejudiced in her favor ; he accidentally saw a letter in which she described her own delight at witnessing his performance of Lear : he was pleased with her critical remarks , and doubtless thought the subject very happily selected . Thus Prepossessed in her favor , he sought an introduction to her , and // finding his favorable impressions confirmed , he introduced her to his own circle , which included the eminent , the fashionable , and the great , - if we may use that conventional term to describe the noble , in presence of the majestic Johnson , and the sublime and beautiful Burke . Nothing can be more interesting than her account of such persons , - particularly Johnson : curiosity is never satiated with notices of this great man , of whom some moderns speak with a foolish affectation of contempt . Faults and follies no doubt be had ; hut the single circumstance that these were so thoroughly sought ont and exhihited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his character , is enough to prove that his place is among the great . The account given of him in this work confirms what was more than suspected before , - that most of the impatient remarks and thnndering rejoiiiders which appear in Boswell , were aimed at the head of that worthy himself , who provoked them by his officiousness and affectation . When Hannah More first saw him , and waited his appearance as if she was expecting a ghost , she was relieved by seeing him present himself with a smile on his countenance and a macaw of Sir Joshua 's in his hand . When she went to his house with Miss Reynolds , he received her with the most polite attention . Miss Reynolds told him that before he came in Miss More had seated herself in his great arm chair , hoping to catch something of his inspiration . lie laughed and told her it reminded him of a night spent by Boswell . and himself in Scotland , near the spot where the witches appeared to Macbeth ; their enthusiasm prevented their sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thrown away , and that the place in question was in a different part of the country ; for he never sat in that chair . She often met him in company and always found him disposed to converse , generally in the style of playful argument ; one day lie reproved her with pretended sharpness for reading Catholic books of devotion . She was beginning to defend herself ; but he took her band , and with a tear in his eye , said to her with affecting earnestness , Child ! I am glad that you read such books , by whomsoever they were written . ' She says that she never saw him angry but once , and that was when she happened to allude to a passage in Tom Jones ; he said , I am shocked to hear you quote from so vicious a book ; I am sorry to hear you have read it ; a confession which no modest lady should ever make . I // scarcely know a more corrupt work . ' With respect to Boswell , she gives the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good humored creature , not destitute of talent , but with a singular absurdity of mind . His greatest failing was his convivial propensity ; he gave offence to Miss More on* one occasion , when be was mightily elevated with wine , and was reproved by ber so severely , that he shows some little resentment in his book ; not saying anything decidedly against her , but representing her as a great flatterer of Johnson . She was certainly a prime favorite of the giant arid this perhaps was one cause of Boswell 's unpleasant feelings . She gives an equally pleasing impression of Garrick ; and in truth the only imputation ever thrown on . him was that of avarice ; and this , there are instances of liberality enough recorded of him , to disprove . Perhaps it arose from the excellence of his domestic character , - a character , which implied much virtue in him whose profession exposed him to many temptations , and whose social powers were such that he was admired and sought for by all . Garrick explained to Miss More the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him ; and this was , that being conscious of far superior merit , it was not in human nature always to look with complacency upon his friend 's superior success ; for while Garrick was rich , Johnson was poor ; and while Garrick was courted by the noble , Johnson seldom received any attention from men of rank , though Boswell has made the most of a few instances in which he was invited into their circle . Miss More was in raptures at witnessing Garrick 's performance on the stage , where she had the singular good fortune to see him act his parts for the last time , before bidding farewell to the stage forever . She speaks of his reading as unrivalled ; the common idea is that be did not excel in this department of his art , but she gives an example of his talent which must he admitted as conclusive so far as it goes . i 'll tell you the most ridiculous circumstance in the world . After dinner Garrick took up the Monthly Review , ( civil gentlemen , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eldred , with all his pathos and all his graces . I think I never was so ashamed in my life ; but he read it so superlatively , that I cried like a child . Only think what a scandalous tIming , - to cry at the reading of one s own poetry ! I could have beaten myself , for it looked as if 1 ' thought it very moving , which I can truly say , is very far from // being the case . But the beauty of the jest is this ; Mrs. Garrick twinkled as well as I , and made as many apologies for crying at her husband 's reading , as I for crying at my own verses . ' She gives a lively idea of the interest inspired by the farewell performances of this great actor . She says that the eagerness to see him was inconceivable ; duchesses and countesses were glad to get places in the upper boxes , and those who were formerly too proud to *o , would then courtesy to the ground for the worst seats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more general resort than it has ever been since ; and Miss More , though she was always serious in her religious views and feelings , did not then regard the stage , as she did some years after . She even caught the dramatic inspiration , and wrote her tragedy called Percy . Garrick exerted himself to have it produced under the most favorable circumstances , though he had left the stage himself ; his interest was great , and his taste and judgment were regarded as established law . He wrote the prologue and epilogue himself ; on the night when it appeared he went with her to the theatre , where they had the gratification of finding it received with unbounded applause . When he had finished his prologue and epilogue , which are excellent , he desired I would pay him . Dryden , he said , used to have five guineas apiece , but as he was a richer man , he would be content with a handsome supper , and a bottle of claret . We haggled sadly about the price , I insisting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pot of porter ; and at about twelve we sat down to some toast and honey , with which the temperate bard expressed himself perfectly contented . ' Such touches as this are worth volumes of biographical description . The profits of this play amounted to six hundred pounds ; but it brought her approbation , which was worth more to her ; Mrs. Montague wrote her warm congratulations ; Dr. Percy returned his best thanks for her invaluable l ) resent , ' and presented the thanks of the Duke of Northumberland , and Earl Percy . Mr. Ilonie called to rejoice in her success , while he was mourning for the untimely fate of his own Alfred ; the Man of Feeling , though as far off as Edinburgh , declared that he had shed tears in reading it ; but while the town was ringing with her success , a look into her apartment shows that she was spending her time in reading such works as Locke on the Epistles , and West on the Resurrection . // Several passages in ber letters give an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her turns of slight illness , she says , Garrick , the other day , told me that he was in a violent hurry ; that he had just heen to order his own , and Mrs. Garrick 's mourning , - bad settled every thing with the undertaker , and now called for a moment to take a few hints for an epitaph . I told him he was too late ; I had disposed of the employment a few days before to Dr. Johnson ; but if I thought he would praise me most , I should be glad to change ; as to hints I had but one to give ; which was to romance as much as he could , and to make the character as fine as possible . ' But it was not long before he became himself the subject of an epitaph ; in the following year , 1779 , he died , and was sincerely lamented by a large circle of friends . Cumberland records that he saw Johnson at the funeral service , bathed in tears . He appears to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conversation hrilliant and exciting , but savoring of art borrowed from his profession ; kind and generous in his feelings , hut fond of admiration ; with no faults worth mentioning , and many virtues deserving unqualified praise . For many years , Miss More was an inmate in the family of Mrs. Garrick , who called her her chaplain , and who appears to have sympathized with her in her religious feelings . One of the most singular friends in her large circle , was Horace Walpole ; he is so constantly associated with old times , and his father 's administration , that lie is generally set down among the ancients , nearer Queen Anne than George the Third . But he lived till the close of the last century , and most of his works were puhlished after he had reached his Inaturer years . He was so fastidious and shy in his whole character , that one would hardly expect to find him cultivating an acquaintance with strangers like Hannah More , and that too , on account of her literary pretensions , which he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life to secure some literary renown ; and the probability is , that had she been of the other sex , he would have thought of her rather as a rival than a friend . But at this time he went freely into select society , where he was welcomed and treated with respect , as a man of elegant taste , and an amusing clironidc of old times ; and happening to meet with Hannah More , he was struck , like every one else , with her talent , liveliness , and general attraction . He invited her to his baby-bouse at // Strawberry-hill , where he exerted himself strenuously to entertain her ; afterwards he kept up a correspondence with her for years ; but though many of his letters are inserted in this work , we find very little that is characteristic of the writer ; they are labored and formal , arid all seem as if it was an effort to write them . In truth , there could be little , except formality , between two parties so entirely opposed in all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed by her known seriousness and reverence , developrnents in which he was entirely deficient ; he sometimes alludes in a playful way to these qualities of his dear St. Hannah , as he calls her , hut takes care not to express sentiments with which she might be offended . But we have not room for these poriraits , which sxveep by us in such rapid succession ; events which were of small moment at the time , but have since grown into importance , by their connexion with distinguished names , abound in her letters written about the time of the American War . She attended the first representation of Sheridan 's play , the Rivals , ' which did not succeed , and of Ueneral Burgoyne 's ' Maid of the Oaks , ' which did succeed much better than his military expedition ; she passed an hour with Lord Howe , who complained bitterly of the ingratitude of his country , which was a little hard , considering that he had done nothing ( for the particulars of his persecution , the reader must consult the Ebeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion ; ) she lived when Curnberland 's Odes appeared , and tried in vain to persuade Richard Owen Cambridge to read them ; she attended the trial of the Duchess of Kingston , and heard Dunning , whose manner was insufferably bad , coughing and spitting at every three words ; she was admitted to the friendship of Mrs. Delany , who had been the intimate of Swift , and was within hearing of the cry , when Guiscard stabbed Lord Oxford . She received calls from Dean Tucker , and Edmund Burke , on the same morning , and rejoiced that they had not met , since it was just after Burke l1ad attacked the Dean in the House of Commons ; she dined one day with Gibbon , Sterne , Harris , Burney , Chambers and Ramsay , and the next with Bishop Porteous and Jonas Hanway ; she met the author of Evelina , just after that work appeared , and was surprised that with her youth and modesty , she could have picked up so much knowledge of life ; she was told by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death-bed , not being able to carry a glass of jelly to his mouth , was in such a passion , that he threw it into Lady Chatham 's face , and expired ; she read Mason 's Life of Gray , when it first appeared , and was a believer for a time in the antiquity of Rowley 's poems ; she heard the storm which raged round Dr. Johnson 's impassive head , when his Lives of the Poets a p - peared ; she was invited to Mr. Thrale 's to an assembly , on the very day when the master of the house so suddenly died of the luxuries of his table ; she received classical compliments from Bishop Lowth , and flirted with General Paoli ; she saw Mythology Bryant , who had been that morning to present his book ; one of the little princes requested to see it , and holding it a few minutes upside down , pronounced it an excellent work ; she quarrelled about the slave trade and the English language with Lord Monboddo , and was received with pomp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her friend , Dr. Kennicott 's Hebrew Bible , aud conversed with Sir William Jones ; she found an admirer in the person of General Oglethorpe , whose gallantry was not extinguished by his age , which exceeded ninety ; she was one of the first to be struck in conversation with the amazing abilities of the conceited Lord Erskine ; the veteran Lord Bathurst lent her his collection of the original letters of Swift , Pope , Bolingbroke and Queen Mary , and Leonidas Clover sung his ballad called Hosier 's Ghost to her , when he was past the age of eighty ; she played at children 's games with Lord North , and had long and serious conversations with Burke . But this was near the close of that brilliant period ; star after star was fast going down : Johnson soon died , and she l1eard all the discordant elements of biography , which gave battle to each other over his grave . Her own feelings also changed ; she never had been fond of fashionable society , though circumstances had thrown her into the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned , though her second attempt was nearly as successful as the first ; her conscience was always reproaching her with living only for self-gratification , and from this time she began to execute the purpose , which she had long deliberately formed ,  --  that of devoting her time and means to useful and charitable actions , and her heart to religious duty . About this time she removed to a small cottage near Bristol at a place called Cowslip-green , and visited London only at distant intervals . She kept up a correspondence with Mrs. Boscawen , // the lady mentioned with so much respect in Boswell 's Jobnson* and Mrs. Montague , who by reason of her larTe fortune and intelligent conversation was an acknowledged leader in the world of fashion and taste . he wrote often to Sir William Pepys , who , though letter-writing was not his forte , wrote her with great length and puoctuality ; and occasionally a irnssive from Horace Waipole pursued her into the shade . The pubFe favor was so securely her own , that she felt no anxiety upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her early productions ; doubtless they had great merit , but there was nothing in them which one would have thought could so fasten itself on the public taste , as to scud every one of them through a long succession of editions . With this consciousness . that she was approved by the wise , sought for by the great , and ' loved by the good , - with property enough in possession and in her power to secure a comfortable support , she began to give her mind wholly to religious subjects ; and the chapte* which commences in the history of her life is entirely new , and even more honorable to her tl an the last . Her associates and correspondents were now in general of a graver cast ; David Garrick was succeeded by John Newton2 a man of great excellence and fervor , hut somewhat too fond of describing himself as the old African slave . She ( lid not wholly abandon London ; she returned to it on occasional visits , and was received with the same warmth as ever hut at Coxvslip-*reeri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious character ; her fine practical understanding prevented her from subsiding into a useless devotee , and her conscientiousness made her co* suit utility rather than profit and popularity in her writings . The subject of the slave-trade was then beginning to agitate the public mind , and Wilberforce was entering public life as the champion of this sacred cause ; the opposition to reform was powerful , headed by such statesmen as Dundas , supported by philosophers likc Monboddo , not to speak of popular writers like Boswell the two great statesmen of the day were interested on the riaht side , though they would not make the question the chief object of their attention ; but the amount of interest on the other side was so great as to make the result of the battle doubtful . Hannah More took the most anxious interest in these proceedings ; wishino to do her part to exert favorable influences on the public mind , she wrote her poem called the Slave-trade . We do not know what . // effect nor what amount of circulation it had , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less poetical authouity* Bishoe Watson . Walpole laughed a little at her blaclcssansty , not being able to comprehend why she , who had no slave , should be interested on one side or the other . As her writings were always popular , we may p resume that she did her part in correcting the error of the public mind ; but the question was soon decided , and the attention of all was drawn to the tempest which was rising in France . No one comprehended it , nor did any pretend to anti p ate the result ; the friends of liberty rejoiced to hear the breaking of chains ; the advocates of the established order of things trembled to see how violently all things were shaken ; probably there never was atime in history when the minds of men were so entirely unsettled ; they knew not whether there was anything to hope for , nor how much there was to dread . Nothing but the unbounded confidence which was felt in the moral energy and statesmanlike resources of Pitt would have enabled England to weather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity of seeing much of the thshionable and the great , and she was fully convinced that the whole spirit of social life , in the higher circles , was adverse to the cultivation of religious principle . Many practices tolerated in it seemed to her to indicate an entire disregard to religious considerations ; such for example as Sunday concerts , the form of denying themselves by the words not at home , ' and the prevailing want of sympathy with all those to whom they were bound to do good . Believing that some impression might be made , at least upon a few , she wrote her work called Thoughts on the Mann* of the Great , ' and sent it without her name into the world , where it soon excited much attention . It was not difficult to trace the author ; but many of those against whose practices it was aimed , and who had always considered themselves very tolerable christians , found it quite difficult to understand her drift . One of them told her , that he admired the institution which gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be meantfor people of fashion , since , as they did nothing on any day , it could not be necessary for them to give that one to rest . But though many could not comprehend it , it was read by all , and some received suggestions from it , which produced a change in their habits of life . Apart from its moral bearing , it was needed in another point of view ; the spirit which went before the French revo // 164 Ljfc and Correqondence of Hannak More . Jan. lution was breaking up those associations , on which alone the noble depended or securing the prescriptive reverence they claimed ; for a long time the feudal feelings had been de .. dining ; Lady Mary Montague in one of her letters complains bitterly of the manner in which rank had fallen in public estimation , even in her day ; of course the natural tendency was to still greater decay . Obviously the only way to prevent this bad result was for the great to be made to feel their obligations to those beneath them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to fear . Hannah More appeared to feel something of this necessity ; while to most others it seemed necessary to do nothing , but suppress or tame don that fierce spirit which was rising against established institutions , merely because those who seemed most interested in those institutions were too proudly careless of them . But to attempt under these circumstances to reform the great , though not easy to be accomplished , was too easy in the efforts required , to fill her high sense of duty . She had also found vices prevailing among the poor , many of which she thought were owing to their entire want of instruction . She determined to exert herself for their reform , as far as her infinance extended ; and as her sisters had now been able to give up their school , and to retire with an adequate support for the rest of their lives , her plan was , with their assistance , to educate the poor children of the neighboring villages . Her design was conceived with as much judgment as generosity ; but it met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who were to receive the benefit of her gratuitous services . We are not surprised at this , considering the alarming state of the nation at that time , when Pitt , like Sisyphus , was staggering under the stone , which required but little additional weight to make it crush him ; education was then , as it is now , spoken of as if it included the cultivation of the intellect alone ; and there were many , who doubted whether intellectual improvement alone would be a remedy for all the disorders of the social system . Education in its wide sense , that is , its true sense , is no doubt the power by which society is to be raised , and at the same time quieted , and secured ; but to suppose that a knowledge of a few sciences will produce this great remalt , or necessarily lead to it , is almosttoo absurd to be denied ; and yet , when education is understood in this limited sense by those who advocate , and those who oppose it , it is not sur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous experiment upon the public mind . But Hannah More was no visionary ; to make the subjects of instruction wiser and better was , in her opinion , what education was bound to do ; she did not believe it was possible to make them better , without making them wiser ; but she knew that they might he made wise for evil as well as for good , and therefore directed all her efforts to the moral and religious improvement of the children . She selected Cheddar , a romantic village ten miles from Cowslip-green , as the scene of her first experiment . The first person to be propitiated , for she was obliged to solicit permission to do this favor , was a rich farmer , whom she was able to conciliate only by flattery and attention . The vicar of this place lived at the University of Oxford , and the curate at a place txveive miles distant ; in this hopeful region she commenced her enterprise , by hiring a house and a mistress at her own expense ; though the parents were suspicious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was encouraging . Though formerly , when divine service was performed there once in the sabbath , eight was considered a sufficient audience in the morning , and twenty in the afternoon , when the y bad carried on their school for a year , it was attended by two hundred old people , and as many children . The success which they met with here encouraged them to extend their operations , and in a short time they had twelve hundred children under their care . Their own resources were not equal to all these demands ; but they were sustained by generous friends , like Wilherforce , who stood ready to supply whatever was wanting . Considering that some of the villages were inhabited by miners , so rude and ferocious that officers of justice dared not venture among them , and that such persons were distrustful of an enterprise which they could not understand , their success might appear surprising , if there were not a thousand examples to show what kind and cheerful views of religion , a spirit of disinterested regard for others , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the fears excited by the French revolution prevailed more extensively in England , and found support in the approbation of revolutionary principles , which was openly expressed by a large party in that country , the attention of alarmists began to turn with apprehension to examine every thing that was new ; among others , her *r4winl* hpenn-w suspected ; they were // institutions which bad grown up at about the same time with the new political system ; they were riot in the books ; no one could suppose , that anything less than a deep political design was the inspiring cause of so much effort and self-devotion . At first the chief difficulty had been with the young converts when the subject of religion was first embraced hy their minds , they were anxious to distinguish themselves by doing some great thing . Her thorough good sense bad always recognised the truth , that holiness of life was the only sure test of the religious character , and she was obliged to labor unceasingly , to prevent the ardor of her converts from spending itself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the absolute necessity of their seeing not merely the truth , but seeing it in its proper light ; since those to whom it appeared in a gloomy , unsocial and forbidding aspect , were strangers to its spirit , though they might know its letter by heart . These difficulties were however surmounted , since it depended on her own efforts to subdue them ; but after a time , a storm of popular prejudice was excited against her , which bad almost broken up her institutions , and had such an effect on her health , which was never firm , that it came near bringing her to the grave . It originated , probably , in some feeling of personal illwill . The curate of Blagdon , the parish in which Cowslip-green was situated , requested her to establish one of her schools there , and for several years expressed himself delighted with its effect ; but all at once he turned against her , accused her of being hostile to Church and State , and , as such a panic was then easily spread , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all quarters in a perfect storm . The charges against her show what kinds of transgressions were magnified into atrocious crimes by the feverish state of popular feeling . One charge was , that of Calvinism , - an enormous offence , of which , however , if her own words may be trusted , she was not guilty . As a party matter , ' she says , I never write nor talk about doctrines , thinking that it makes our tempers sour and unprofitable . The doctrines peculiar to Calvinism I do not adopt , though I much reverence many good men who maintain them . ' The other offence alleged , was that of occasionally permitting cxtemporary prayer in her schools ; it appeared that one or two zealous teachers had made a prayer of this description , without any idea of shaking the foundations of Church and State ; but the matter was amended as soon as known , and it was understood , that if they had no book the** should never pray again . // At the time when the English nation was in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French revolution had alarmed its early friends , the spirit of opposition to established institutions was extending itself so rapidly , that even the pilot who weathered the storm , seemed likely to be overborne by a mutinous crew . The friends of Hannah More , knowing her power of adaptation to all to whom she wished to address herself , believed that the same tact which had made her exert a happy influence on persons of rank , would enable her to do much to calm the gitated minds of the poor . It is no easy matter to persuade men to submit to evils , when they think that they have it in their power to redress them ; and yet it is certain , that premature attempts at reform often add years to the duration of the evil which they are intended to remove . It was well for England , that the popular movement , then beginning , was stayed and suspended , since by waiting the time she has gained the benefit of that experience , which France was compelled to buy with a prodigal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermined , that their friends are obliged to hold them up ; in that day , they were so firm that their opposers would have been compelled to struggle hard to pull them down , and had they succeeded , they might themselves have been crushed under their fall . After resisting much urgency from her friends , Baum h More wrote her Village Politics , as a hasty experiment , anrl published it without her name ; it had a most rapid and perfect success ; being adapted in manner and spirit to the poor , it made a dccl ) mm -- pression upon that class ; and the higher orders , who by no means felt safe in the possession of their titles or fortunes , exerted themselves to spread it throughout the kin4dom . Finding that this new field of enterprise was opened , she wrote the tracts which compose her Cheap Repository ; every one has beard of the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain ; and such publications took a hold upon the minds of the l ) eoI ) le , which no doubt had great effect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could only be inarle worse by hasty attempts to alter . The arguments which they contained in favor of contentment did something ; hut we doubt not that these tracts did much more , by turning the minds of the poor into new directions . Reading was not common among them as it is now ; and tracts , especially tracts adapted to their // habits of thought , were almost unknown before ; probably the strong religious feeling which these publications inspired , was the most efficient agent in calming that deep excitement , which threatened to make all things level , by raising the valley and bringing to mountain low . We do not intend to follow her through the history of her life , which was prolonged for many years , in which she suf. fered much from sickness and loss of friends ; but they were nevertheless as happ the res ect and aflbction of others , the consciousness of doing good and a firm religious trust could make them . Her later works were of a religious cast ; not addressed to particular classes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in this adaptation to those whom she wished to influence that her strength lay . But they do great honor both to her mind and heart . In sentiment , still more in style , they are not always judicious , but generally they display the marks of a strong , ready , and discriminating hand ; no fault can be found with their spirit , for though men of the world charged her with excessive ngor , it would not be easy to show in what particular she transcended the great rule which all profess to follow , nor did she ever prescribe a rule for others which she did not herself observe . Her charity was most exemplary ; throughout her writings we find a strong attachment to her own opinions indeed , such as belongs to an independent mind ; but notwithstanding this strength of conviction , or possibly in consequence of this strength of conviction , she gave others IWl credit for equal sincerity , and never suflbred her good feeling to other sects or individuals to be influenced by diflbrence of opinion . Every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufibred her regret tbr their errors to blind her to their fervent spirit ; in one instance she was attacked by a Catholic priest , for an unguarded expression in one of her books which seemed to him uncharitable ; but the correspondence between them on the occasion , shows at once that she was not the party to whom that word would most fitly apply . She kept up a familiar intercourse with the Unitarian Mrs. Barbauld ; nor did either feel the less admiration for the talents and virtues of the other , because they were separated by the lines of religious party . In short , though we are far from agreeing *iith her in all her views , we know not where there is to be found a more exemplary , consistent and engaging manifestation of the religious spirit , than her // 169 life and writin*s display . it required rnoral courage in one who was caressed and flattered by the great , to hazard her popularity by telling unwelcome truths ; it required something still better than courage to enable her to face the opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relations of life , she seems to have been governed by a cheerful sense of duty , and the same strong principle was the animating spirit of her writings . It was this singleness of heart , - this xvarm and generous sympathy with her race , which constituted the great attraction of her works . Her mind , though active and powerful , was not of the first order : she often took miniature views of great subjects , - correct enough as far as they went , but not sufficiently enlarged . There is often more regard to the point of the sentence than to the scope of the argument , and an epigrammatical way of setting down her reflections , which was unflivorable to logical deductions . The very circumstance that her works were so successful , every one of them passing through many editions , would create a suspicion that they were of a fashion which passes away . And this is true of them ; they are now not generally read , - and they will excite less and less interest future years . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not of the kind which are suited to all dines ; they may be forgotten , hut she will always retain a high traditional fame as one who exerted a considerable influence upon her own age , and that the age of Goldsmith , Burke and Johnson . Of all her efforts Ccelebs was the least successful ; not because it wants merit , but because it was founded in the mistake of supposing that she could exert herself to more advantage by assuming a popular disguise . She should have considered that the religious teacher , while he gains nothin g by assuming the dress and bearing of a man of the world , will lose the respect which he had power to command when in his proper station ; we believe that she was sensible that the attempt was not happy , though the sale of the work was rapid and extensive ; some of her friends begged her to repeat the experiment , but she would not be persuaded . But the abatements to be made in her reputation are but few and small , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enviable fame . Hannah More died in September of the last year , at the age of eighty-eight . Several years before her death she was // obliged to quit Barey Woods , the place which sbe bad formed after her own taste , and in which she hoped to die , in consequence of the bad con ( inct of her servants , who had taken advantage of her great indulgence . But her sisters were dead she herself was xvaitinr to follow , and it was of little importance to her where she passed the remaining hours of her closing day . Her powers of body and mind failed after that time , but not so rapidly as might have been expected from a constitution which had never been strong , and was then undermined by sickness added to the infirmity of age . Her disposition was cheerful and even playful to the very last ; we mean the last period of her conscious existence ; for she was brought by successive stages of decline to such a state of helplessness , that her mind almost failed her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle and willing separation from the living ; when she retired to rest her work was done ; boxy well done the world has testified by a verdict , which we may hope will be affirmed on high.
