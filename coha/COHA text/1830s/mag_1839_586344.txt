txt IN this little volume it is the purpose of the author to auginent the good effects , which result from the labors of those who are engaged in the Gospel ministry . Few objects are more important than this in a christian community , where the instructions of the Sabbath are calculated to have so strong an influence on the social condition of men , as well as on their religious character and destiny . It is a necessary consequence of the return of the Sabbath , that a rest should follow to the thoughts and cares of men , a cessation from their secular toils , and a relief from the exercise and conflict of the baser passions . Under such circumstances they meet in the Lord 's Courts ; ' the sacredness of the place helps them to disburden themselves of those interests and prejudices , which too often warp their minds and feelings asunder , and they // listen with attention to the momentous truths , which every conscientious preacher is expected to communicate . The tendency of the annunciation of these truths is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day itself is fitted to excite . The mind is powerfully directed towards those considerations , which relate to the reality and the mode of its existence beyond the grave . The Christian is brought to a firmer reliance on the operations and the excellence of his faith . The beneficial effects of Sabbath instructions are , in truth , more than can be estimated ; and it is hence of great consequence , that the persons , on whom these instructions devolve , should be fitted for a calling on which so much of the well being and happiness of society depend . Any suggestions , which may tend to render their instructions more appropriate and powerful , and more beneficial in their general results , should be favorably received . The art of extemporaneous speaking is both difficult and important . No one can be a correct and efficient speaker in this way , who has not a well disciplined and a well furnished mind . But however great the discipline , to which one must snbject himself , before he can speak correctly and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable as to recompense the greatest toil rind perseverance ; maximus fructus velut praemium quoddam amplissimum . We admit , that a person may be truly eloquent , who preaches , as it is technically termed , with notes . However some may be disposed to differ from Chalmers on certain speculative points ; whatever exceptions scrupulous critics may take to a few peculiarities in his style , yet , when his depth of thought , his power of argument , his occasional touches of true pathos , his frequent richness and splendor of expression are recollected , it will not be denied by any candid judge , that Chalmers is an eloquent man . But , if we are rightly inform ' . ed , this Scottish orator , whose fame has spread itself to more than one continent , usually preaches from manuscript . The instances , indeed , are innumerable , in which powerful effects have been produced by preachers , who have confined themselves to written compositions . In speaking favorably , thexe ' . fore , of this little treatise , and of the art which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood to enter our dis-. // sent against the practice of preaching with notes . A man may be eloquent , who writes his sermons , like Chalmers , or who does not , as was the case with Whitefield . A serious objection may be urged against laying aside altogether the practice of preaching written sermons , but we are convinced that an immense benefit would arise from the cultivation of extemporaneous eloquence in the way , and under the limitations prescribed in the elegant little treatise before us . We have already said , that this art is an important one . The preacher , who possesses it , will find the discharge of his duty more easy , and will be likely to be more useful , than the one who does not . Writing out in full all the sermons , which a settled minister is called to preach , is an endless labor ; it is a slavery of the mind , to which it can not be for a long time stibjected without being greatly wearied , nor without a very sensible diminution of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor of thought , but also from the excessive manual toil , which must be endured by every one who comes often before the people , and yet can not do it without a written preparation . If it is a fact , therefore , that a person can learn to express himself with propriety and effect in unpremeditated language , the individual , who deprives himself of this power , or rather who fails to attain it , voluntarily subjects himself to more wearisome efforts arid a greater burden of toil , than would be required in making this valuable acquisition* The advocates for extemporaneous preaching do not assert , that it should be attempted without a laborious preparation ; they insist on the severest mental discipline . But even after many preparatory efforts , beginners in this exercise must expect sometimes to meet with a discomfiture . A certain sternness of purpose and selfpossession are essential to success , and these are not to be acquired except by repeated exertions in this mode of public speaking . The following remarks by Mr Ware , bearing cm this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is full of testimony to prove how much depends upon industry ; not an eminent orator has lived , but is an example of it . Yet in contradiction to all this , the almost universal feeling appears to be , that industry can effect nothing , that eminence is the result of accident , and that every one must be content to remain just what he may happen to be . Thus multitudes , who // Oct* conw*krward as teachers and guides , suffer themselves to be satisfled with the most indifferent attainments , and a miserable medjo*ity , without so much as inquiring how they might rise higher , 1much less making any attempt to rise . For any other art they would have served an apprenticeship , and would be ashamed to practise it in public before they had learned it . If any one would sing , he attends a master , and is drilled in the very elementary principles ; and only after the most laborious process dares to exercise his voice in public . This he does , though he has scarce anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms before his eye . But the extempore speaker , *ho is to invent as well as to utter , to carry on an operation of the mind , as well as to produce sound , enters upon the work without preparatory discipline , and then wonders that he fails ! If he were learning to play on the flute for public exhibition , what hours and days would he spend in giving facility to his fingers , and attaining the power of the sweetest and most impressive execution . If he were devoting himself to the organ , what months and years would he labor , that he might know its compass and be master of its keys , arid be able to draw out , at will , all its various combinations of harmonious sound , and its full richness and delicacy of expression . And yet he will fancy , that the grandest , the most various , the most exprassive of all its instruments , which the infinite Creator has ft*shioned by the union of an intellectual soul with the powers of speech , may be played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mere uninstructed tyro , and thinks to manage all its stops , and command the whole compass of its varied and comprehensivt* poweW He finds himself a bungler in the attempt , is mortified at his failure , and settles in his mind forever , that the attempt is vain . Success in every art , whatever may be the natural talent , is always the reward of industry and pains . But the instances are many , of men of the finest natural genius , whose beginning has promised much , but who have degenerated wretchedly as they advanced , because they trusted to their gifts , and made no effort to improve . That there have never been other men 6t equal endowments with Cicero and Pemosthenes , none would venture to suppose ; but who have so devoted themselves to their art , or become equal in excellence ? if those great men had been content , like others , to continue as they began , and had never made their persei*esi*g efforts for improvement , what would their countries have benefited from their genius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been lost in the undistinguished crowd , that sunk to oblivion around them . Of how many more will the same remark prove true ! What encouragement is thus given to the industrious ! With such encouragement , how inexcusable is the negligence , which suffers the most interesting and important truths to seem heavy and // dull , and fall ineffectual to the ground , through mere sluggishness in the delivery ! How unworthy of one , who performs the high function of a religious instructer , upon whom depend in a great measure , the religious knowledge , and devotional sentiment , and final *character of many fellow beings , to imagine , that he can wbtthily discharge this great concern by occasionally talking for en hour , he knows not how , and in a manner he has taken no pains to render correct , impressive , or attractive ; and which , simply through that want of command over himself which study would give , is immethodical , verbose , inaccurate , feeble , trifling . It has been said of the good preacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they come ruined and worthless from such a man as this . They lose that holy energy by which they are to convert the soul and purify man for heaven , and sink , in interest and efficacy , below the eve *of those principles , which govern the ordinary affairs of this lower world . ' This extract will give some idea of the sentiments of our author , as they appear in his own chastened and animated style . As no one can probably be found , who will object to the sentiments here advanced , we feel ourselves permitted to say , that as little exception will be taken to the characteristics of this treatise generally . It bears throughout the marks *f thought , of candor , of reflection . The perusal of it by any person can hardly fail to have a good effect , to operate as a confirmation of good purposes , and an excitement to greater diligence . That was an excellent saying of Plato , as transmitted to us by Cicero , Non nobis solum nati sumus , ortusque nostri part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born , we do not live for ourselves alone ; our country , our friends , have a share in us . If this maxim is true in a general sense , how much mQre so when applied to ministers of the Gospel ? If there be any persons , who should forget themselves and their own personal interests in their zeal for the general good , it is doubtless this class . The motives , which should operate on them , are high and sacred ; such also is the end , at which they pr ? fess to aim . It is their great work to correct the wanderings of their fellowmen , to make them wiser , better , holier ; and in such a work how reasonable is it to expect , that they should be fervent , laborious , and untirin* in their endeavors faithfully to execute their charge . // The great essential requisite to effective preaching in this imnhed , or indeed in any method , ' says our author , is a devoted Iwart . A strong religious sentiment , leading to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than all rules of art ; it will give the preacher courage , which no science or practice could impart , and open his lips boldly , when the fear of man would keep them closed . Art may fail him , and all his treasures of knowledge desert him ; but if his heart be warm with love , he will " speak right on , " aiming at the heart and reaching the heart , and satisfied to accomplish the great purpose , whether he be thought to do it tastefully or not . ' In preaching , as in almost everything else , labor and perseverance are necessary to success , and furthermore , the best models are to be studied . We may venture to say , that genius in a public speaker never has , and probably never will , supply the place of intellectual toil ; and what greater impulse can be given to genius , what greater excitement to submit to this toil , than the contemplation of the excellencies of the illustrious dead ? In corinexion with Mr Ware 's valuable treatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the public ministry , Fenelon 's Dialogues on Eloquence . It is remarked in a preface to this work , by the Chevalier Ramsay , that the ancients had treated the subject of eloquence in various ways , as logicians , as grammarians , and as critics ; but the Archbishop of Cambray had gone farther , and treated it as a philosopher and a Christian . ' Probably no man understood the principles of eloy*uence better than Fenelon . His taste was formed on the purest models , the study of the Greeks and Romans , and of that book , which affords more instances of genuine simplicity and the true sublime than any other , the Holy Scriptures . No mistake is more common among young preachers , than an unworthy affectation of a sparkling brilliancy . They seem to think the genuine spirit of eloquence consists in decorating common and ordinary thoughts in a rich and imaginative dress , no matter how fr*rttastic , and how little in harmony with the conception . Uncommon expressions , ' says Hume , strong flashes , of wit , pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too frequently , often disfigure rather than embellish a discourse . It commonly happens , in such cases , that twenty insipid conceits are found for one thought , which is really // beautiful . ' We know of no production better fitted to cor-. rect this mistake , than the Dialogues , which we have men-* tioned . The author is an advocate for simplicity , though he shows no hostility to subdued ornament , and those occasional metaphors , which , in the excitement of description and argument , are thrown out burning from the heart . If simplicity and a natural manner of expression are requisite to eloquence in general , how necessary is it to that species termed the eloquence of the pulpit . The truths of religion can not be said to come mended ' from the preacher 's tongue , unless they are pronounced with plainness of speech , and are attended with an earnestness , resulting from a conviction of their importance . The subjects introduced in pulpit discussions are of too high and holy a nature to admit of the tawdry decorations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart unmoved , would be inclined to communicate to them . This point deserves the more con-. consideration , when it is felt , that without a chastened imagination and a correct taste , all attempts at extemporaneous eloquence will be likely to prove utterly unsuccessful . But a cultivated taste is not all , nor will freedom from puerilities and improprieties of expression alone make one eloquent ; there are also required the earnestness of conviction , the genuine , pathos of nature and truth , the flame of a heavenly animation kindling in the soul . It is the best policy for a public speaker to dispense with all tricks of rhetoric , which are fitted merely to amuse , and that profusion of ornament , which is the mark of a weak , and always of an undisciplined mind , and , whether his language be premeditated or extemporaneous , to have his own heart full of the subject , and to aim directly at the hearts of his hearers by the shortest avenues , and with the greatest possible power.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
