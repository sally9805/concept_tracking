txt THE time was , when the opponents of the democracy , exultingly asserted that within their ranks were to be found " all the religion , all the wealth , and all the learning of the country . " The assertion had some color of truth to support it . When the two great antagonist principles began to develope themselves , the religion , the wealth , and the learning of the country , sought the alliance of that political party whose professed principles went far to acknowledge them , if not legally , at least potentially , as " estates " of the republic . The desire for political power is one of the strongest passions of man , civilized , or savage , and it may be called the natural enemy of a practical administration of a republican form of government . To this passion may be traced all the distinctions that have been made or attempted in society . Who has not observed the mysterious influence of caste over the minds of men , and its astonishing moral force in controlling their actions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeks immunities and privileges for his class , and if successful , he establishes caste , the power and influence of which he himself shares , and is of course interested to perpetuate . The clergy , as a class , had , in all countries , at the time our experiment of government commenced , showed themselves not exempt from the desire of power ; indeed , it may he said , that a love of temporal authority as an adjunct of ecclesiastical prerogative , was their besetting sin , if not their ruling passion . The success of the voluntary system in religion , which was involved in our grand experiment in self-government , and to be tried with it , was considered douhtful ,  --  perhaps , the most doubtful part of the whole . Men were so accustomed to consider the Church as an establishment constituting a part of the State , and they had so little confidence in men 's moral qualities , they did not conceive it possible to sustain religion without the patronage , protection , and coercion of the civil power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were then considered the representatives of the religious feelings of the country , with such passions and prejudices , attached themselves politically to those who were of congenial sentiments with them , who had the same deep distrust of man 's moral fitness , in * Oration delivered at the Democratic Republican Celebration of the sixty-second anniversary of the Independence of the United States , in the city of New York , fourth July , 1838 , by Edwin Forrest , Esq. - New York . J. W. Bell . // a free and unshackled state of mental existence , to establish and maintain that order which constitutes good civil government . The case is far different at this day . The success of the voluntary system for the support of religion and religious institutions , is complete . The political connexion of religion with government , by those who wish to see it flourish " pure and undefiled , " is no longer desired ,  --  nay more , they would consider it pollution . rrhe same mind that adopts religion for its truth , its purity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons , to adopt the principles of democracy . The same mind that discovers the necessity of the penal sanctions of the law , to give adequate moral force to religion , is inclined to discover the necessity of some external , physical , independent power , to control man 's moral conduct . The spirit of true religion , is nearly allied to the spirit of democracy , and is therefore , likely to have a kindred habitance with us . It is indeed true , that the ostentatious professors of religion ,  - -  those who are influenced more by phylacterian display , than humble zcal-tbose who can discover no elevation for themselves but through the depression of their fellows , are not found within the pale of the democracy . Neither , perhaps , may the majority of the clergy be found there , for with many of them the ruling passion , the love of power , is far from being subdued , and with some of them , a with emancipated Israel , there is a secret hankering after the delicious flesh-pots of idolatrous Egypt , the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy is now confined to the appropriate sphere of their vocation , and they are no longer the representatives of the religions feelings of others . With the reform that we established , came also truer motives of man 's individual accountability , and religion is now viewed as an individual concern , and each man thinks and acts for himself . The claim of the anti-democratic party to the wealth of the country , will not be disputed , notwithstanding many remarkable exceptions , embracing the largest private fortunes that have ever been accumulated in this country , the evidence of its truth is every day exhibited . The money power is the militant power which is now waging war upon the democracy , with a fierceness of attack almost unprecedented in the annals of party strife . It is making a desperate effort to become the ruling power in the state-  --  to place the destinies of this young and still vigorous republic in the enervating bonds of those whose essential creed , is , that man was created to accumulate wealth , and that government was designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who support that party have that object distinctly , and separately , as an object in view . We admit , that many of them sincerely believe , that democratic principles in general tend to the destruction of civil order , and they desire a change // in the administration , for the preservation and e*tablishment of the policy which they hold indispensable to good civil government . It was ever so with them . They just as seriously believed that the success of the democratic party , when identified with JEFFERSON 's election , would cause the overthrow of religion , law and order ; the fearful apprehension of an agrarian partition of their property disturbed the quiet of their slumbers , then , as now . No one will doubt the sincerity of the political faith of the New England lady , who , when she heard of Jefferson 's election , hid her bible to preserve it from doomed destruction ; and in all charity we believe , that the panic-stricken disciples of that faith are just as sincere now ; for the lesson of experience taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no effect upon them , and if we may judge of the future by the past , will continue for ever to them , to be a lost lesson . The ruling spirit of that party , however , as now exhibited , is wealth , and never was its power more tyrannically exercised . The degrading submission it exacts , in our commercial cities , from those who follow in its train ; its iron proscription of the independent , who will not bend the suppliant knee in acknowledgement of its supremacy ; and the actual vassalage it has established in the needy and aspiring , are at once the cause and the effect of its power . The influence it exercises is truly astonishing . rVhe proposition , that the government is under no obligation to place its money in the hands of wealthy individuals , whether masked by a charter or not , that they may enjoy its benefits in private speculation , is so clear , so selfevident , that the time will come when it will be matter of surprise that it was ever disputed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercising such an influence through all the ramifications of society , as to create quite an extended belief , that to deprive the wealthy of the use of the government funds , would be a public calamity ! That government can not be securely administered , unless banks participate in its administration ! The power of wealth , all-powerful as it is , has not had sufficient strength , to'draw the literature of the country wholly into its sordid grasp . Mind , immortal mind , disdaining the association , has clung to those holy democratic principles , which allo*v it the exercise of its highest , noblest qualities . The success of democracy is the greatest conquest that mind ever achieved over matter , through the agency of man , and has opened a new page in moral history , for the profoundest and most exciting study of the philosopher . For such a student , a l ) olitical association can not be expected with him who places the chief good in life in the distinctions conferred by the glitter and pomp of wealth , and the enjoyments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one , in all his views and aspirations , is only " a little lower than the angels "  --  the other is // but " little " higher than " the least erected spirit that fell from heaven , " and their thoughts and their purposes can not tend to the same end . There is no affinity between the intellectuality of the democratic principles of the one , and the sensuality of the pride of the other . True to the general principle above stated , it is one of the crowning glories of literature , in all the various modifications to which genius has given it , that it has ever been the advocate of those broad principles of human liberty and of that independence of thought which have been the aim and object of the democratic movement in all ages of the world , arid which , however minutely it may have been manifested , can still be traced in the history of every people working their destiny upward ; disclosing and confirming the national character by infusing into it its own principles of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , from the earliest hour it can be traced to the present time , is the record of a mean and selfish despotism warring from age to age against the best interests , and with the habits and genius of a noble people ; and debasing , depressing , and corrupting them in the precise proportion that its malign influence was able to extend itself over the land . The literature of England , on the other hand , reflects the character of the people , and in its best portions is untainted by its monarchy . The personal habits , and the wants of needy and improvident professors , may , from time to time , have licked the footstool of power , and disgusted posterity by the servility of a dedication , a panegyric , or a birth-day or commemoration ode ,  --  - productions that adhere to the more enduring monuments of genius like the fungus to the oak , and which form but the dross , in which mind , not all untrammelled , paid the tribute of subsistence to circumstances and matter . But the sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in every department can be traced , in the loftiest advoc ' *cy of freedom , the soundest maxims of humanity , the most liberal and enlarged advocacy of equal jostice and natural right . The grandest truths of political philosophy* which it has been at once the peculiar glory and the happy destiny of this country to reduce , for the first time , to national practice , will be found throughout , cheering the heart of the seeker in the macic of its immortal eloquence , and in the happiest inspiration of its heaven-drawn song . All poetry , indeed , is essentially democratic . Despite the canons of an envious criticism . which has mistaken the machinery for the product of the mechanism , we hesitate not to make the assertion that the truest inspiration of the muse has been drawn from that pure fount of universal philanthropy which invi*orates with perpetual greenness the eternal principles of freedom . Poetry can never be made the instrument of oppression , and the poetry of England , in particular* has glori // ously contributed to swell the mighty current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which promises results so vast for the future destiny of the human race . We speak of literature in its highest and most restricted sense . How very few of the million venal pens that have stocked the historical and political libraries of England , have contributed to the literature of that country , we need not now pause to enumerate . But we look forward with pleasure to the hope of going over this entire field in extenso with the readers of the Democratic Review . In fact , it is impossible for an elevated literature to exist without a corresponding extension of the cause of Democracy . Our principles strengthen in the light of knowledge , and are nourished and diffused as education developes the length and breadth and depth of the popular mind . Let other systems pervert the faculties of mind , and the facilities of knowledge , to mystify , and disguise with the logic of artful theories , principles at war with the interests of the mass ; be it the glory of Democracy that it courts investigation , that it shuns this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the inquiries of philosophy , and the achievements of learning in every branch of knowledge and of art , constitute the best friends of its principles , and the most efficient allies of a cause , which is identical with the onward progress of humanity , till its utmost destiny of universal peace , happiness , prosperity , and civilization , shall have been effected upon earth . We concede then , to our opponents , the claim , in the sense in which they make it , to all the wealth , but we interpose in behalf of the democracy , a proportionate claim to the learning , as well as to the genius of the country . What name is there , that conspicuously adorns American literature in all its departments , that can not be found on the catalogue of the democracy , even on this , the day of its severest trial ? Mr. FORREST belongs to a profession which is always peculiarly classed among the literary . All will admit , that to be successful in that profession , as he has been , requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellect . He has proved to the world that he possessed this quality of mind , and his devotion to the principles of the democracy is but another illustration of vigorous mental discrimination , illustrating the tenor of our remarks . It is , indeed , in hi case , the strongest proof of that intellectual energy , on which rests invincible moral courage . The allurements of wealth to which he was exposed by his professional and personal associations ,  - -  the strong interest he had to propitiate the rich from whom alone he could expect substantial reward for professional labor ,  --  and his knowledge of their hatred of democratic principles , and their ability , through a venal press and their social organization , to make that hatred felt , would have turned him , had he a mind of less strength and // integrity , from his attachment to the unostentatious simplicity of democracy , into the allurements of a more captivating sensuality of principles . We are induced to notice , in a more particular manner , this oration of Mr. Forrest , because the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiar prominence , as tending , more than any thing else , to show that , in the present envenomed crusade against all that Democracy holds dear , the popular heart is safe ; - when the position that we occupy , and the progress that we make , can hardly be ascertained in the blinding dust and stunning clamor in which an unexampled developement of hostility to our principles , has enveloped us  --  the delivery of this address , by a man whose genius had made him the idol of the populace , in his own pro* fession , rolled back the cloud for a moment , and developed the majestic strength of the popular cause in gigantic vastness and repose* and proved the unshaken sway of the cardinal principles of democracy over the minds and wills of which the simple exertion can place our cause in triumph . We find in it no unusual depth of thought or originality of mind . It has no splendid beauties of composition to charm the critic , or glow of eloquence to place the principles it teaches in a more captivating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worthy of note that the graces of an accomplished elocution , uttering in a nervous and manly style the sublime and simple truths of the creed of democracy , enchained a vast city in admiration , in their delivery , and drew shouts of responsive enthusiasm from the largest assembly that it ever saw . It is something memorable , too , that the art of the orator did not expire with the occasion that called it forth , but that his words , winged by the press , have been diffused in every corner of the land , proving the gratifying fact , that lovers and learners of the great truths he spoke were to be counted by the hundred thousand , and evi ( lencing a strength and popularity in these principles , that form the most significant and cheering sign of their wide diffusion , and their correct appreciation by the public . No one can read Mr. Forrest 's excellent oration , without feeling and believing that he is an American , true to his national vocation , an ( l who fully appreciates the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pure and invigorating waters which flow from the fountain of American Democracy . The fervor of his language attests the strength of his patriotism-patriotism deeply imbued with the philanthropy which contemplates his country as designed , by her example , to shed the light of her moral truth , by gradual progression , into the remotest corners parts of it , hut as the most pertinent to the times . The following , we accept as a faithful interpretation of the duties of government . " Not less auspicious would be the rusultif h0 closely to the avowed purposes and dutis of democratic government , we should preserve an equal distance between politics and trade , confinina the one to the mere protection of men in the uninfrin*ed enjoyment of their equal rights , and leaving the other to be regulated by enterprise and competition , according to those natural principles of economic wisdom which will be ever found more just and efficient than the imperfect and arbitrary restraints of legislation . But above all , let us be careful , by no political interference with the pursuits of industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on which , as on its corner stone , the fabric of democratic freedom rests . That we should frown indignantly on the first motion of an attempt to sunder one portion of the Union from the other , was the parting admonition of Washin*ton ; but with decpcr sohcitude , and more sedulous and constant care , should we guard against a blow being aimed , no matter how l*ht , or by what specious pretext defended , tigainat that great elementary principle of liberty , which once shaken , the whole structure will topple to the *round . Beware , therefore , of connectin* government , as a partner or co-operator , with the affairs of trade , lest its selfish and rapacious spirit should prove stron*er than the spirit of liberty , and the peculiar advantage of the votaries of traffic should be re*arded more than the general and equal good of the votaries of freedom . ' A fearless and concientious adherence to the principles of Amencan Republicanism , is all that we ask , all that we could desire , in carrying out our scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing on every citizen , and , in the proper answer to its interrogatories , all will admit the security of our institutions to be deeply interested , and the greater question of their whole objects and usefulness to be vitally involved . " if ; in any respect , the great experiment which America has been trying before the world has failed to accomplish the true end of government- ' the greatest good of the greatest number - it is only where she herself has proved recreant to the fundamental article of her creed . If we have not prospered to the greatest possible extent compatible with the condition of humanity , it is because we have sometimes devi ted , in practice , from the sublime maxim , that all men are created free and equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights , and that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . ' If in no instance we have transgressed this axiom of democratic liberty , how is it that one man may freely perfonn what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accordant with equal rights , are the penal interdictions of the law thrown across my path , to shut me from a direction , which another may pursue without fear or hindrance ? Why are a few decorated with the insi*nia of chartered privileges , and armed in artificial intan i-a bility , while the many stand undistinguished in the plain exterior of the natural man , with no forged contrivance of the law to shield them from the shocks that flesh is heir to ? ' Are these thin s consistent with the doctrine which teaches that equal protection is the sole true end of government ? that its restraints should hold all with equal obligation ? that its blessings , like the gentle dews of heaven , ' should fall equally on the heads of all ?
