txt THE Marquis de Chastelleux traveled through a considerable part of the territory of the Atlantic states , during the revolutionary war , and published a volume of sketches , which have gained no little notoriety . They had the merit , at least , of showing the First Impressions of a foreigner , well qualified to scrutinize the surface of men and manners , if no more * and the following lively passage is but one among very many , which might be cited , to illustrate the strange aspect a country like ours , situated as it was at the time of these travels , must have worn to the eye of an inhabitant of the elder hemisphere . In the course of a ride between Farminguon and Litchfield , the Marquis had occasion to inquire into the history of what is called , in some sections , to this day , a clearing . It was " the work of a single man , who , in the course of a year , had cut down several arpents of wood ' , and had built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory he had cleared . " Then , after remarking , that , subsequently , he had found these improvements , or new settlements , going on in all the wildest and remotest regions of America he had traversed , the Marquis proceeds to describe the mode in which these things were commonly effected . After the choice of a location in the wilderness , and the purchase of it , he says the settler " there conducts the American translation a cow , some pigs , and two indifferent horses , which do not cost him above four guineas each . " Certain provisions also are laid in , and then commences the attack on the forest . " He begins with felling all the sThaller trees , and some strong branches of the larger ones : these he makes use of as fences for the first field he wishes to clear . He next boldly attacks those immense oaks , or pines , which one would take for the ancient lords of the territory he is usurping ; he strips them of their bark , or lays them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the next spring robbed of their honors ; their leaves no longer spring , their branches fall , and their trunk becomes a hideous skeleton . This trunk seems still to brave the efforts of the new colonist ; but where there are the smallest chinks or crevices , it is surrounded by fire , and the flames consmne what the iron was unable to destroy , " &amp;c. &amp;c . What an air of vitality is there in this description . It sketches a complete Homeric contest , in which the trees have just as vigorous a part to play as the colonist who " attacks " them ; and the circumstance , . subsequently mentioned , that the latter builds himself , after a short time , a shelter , in the shape of a log-hut , and then finds himself truly " a comfortable planter , " infallibly recalls that barbarous custom , which some of the heroes of olden time practised , of not only stripping the bodies of the dead , but converting the very skulls of the poor men into drinking-cups-and , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other utensils not fit to be named . The simile is a fair one , and is as applicable to our day as to that of the pioneers who have made our paths straight before us in the wilderness . Just such would seem to be the feeling between the squatter , or the accredited settler , and the forest into which he migrates , be the same in the state of Maine , or in the territory of Michigan . He looks upon so many trees , for the most part . as so many Indians in war-time . VOL VII . 24 // No mercy is to be shown them . They must be cut down and cast out , root and branch , like the Pequots-so far , that is , as the boundaries and title-deeds of the invader give him the right of massacre . If a few survive the general ruinRan nantes in gurgite vastoit is either because the destroyer is weary of his work , or because he chooses-much in the spirit which a cat shows in the tuition of a mouse  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment of destruction at a more convenient season . With some certainty , however , you may rely on his exterminating the whole tribe , men , women , and children ; and rather than even leave a fe*v of " those immense oaks , " to be the Sachems of fresh generations , he will , some ten years after his task of devastation is completed , labor to supply their places by setting out , with infinite pains , an avenue of beechen bean-poles half trimmed , or sundry beggarly poplars , of foreign stock , nearly corresponding , in both appearance and substance , to the human hordes sometimes introduced among us from the same sections of the world . This hostility to the noblest of our native vegetation has not been confined to those individuals who have had personal occasion to meet that enemy in the " field " Neither , in their case , or more generally , has it ceased with the circumstances which gave it birth . Those , who have gone into the forest , with axe on shoulder , might be excused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soldiers regarded King Philip and his noblest Wampanoags , when " the army raised a great shout " at the fall of the miserable monarch of the woods . The habit of contending and conquering ,  --  as the new settler in this country always has been obliged , more or less , to contend against and conquer , alike , the savage and the greenwood tree ,  --  must be expected to encourage both combativeness and destructiveness , and to leave on the individual 's mind , at the best , some feeling of contcmptuous prejudice . Hence , the disparagement of forest trees , and of arboriculture , is an Americanism-like the lingering dislike which the mass of our population have ever had for the aborigines . Under these circumstances , what progress could be looked for in the art of transplantation among Americans ? For that matter , indeed , it has made no great progress any where ; and this lack of attention to such a subject , in England and the other old countries especially , is really one of the wonders of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , among an inventive , intelligent , industrious people , to whom luxury and enormous wealth every day offer every inducement to carry the arts and sciences to their utmost length , for all conceivable purposes  --  and where no pecuniary consideration is too great to be sacrificed even to mere fashion , without reference to utility , beauty , or propriety-it should have continued universally customary till within fifteen years or less , and very generally so to this moment , for the richest proprietors of the most splendidly situated estates to commence the embellishment of them , so far as trees are concerned , ( a principal feature of course , in every landscape , ) with planting such shoots , sprigs , and poles , as it must require some thirty or forty years to render any thing like a decoration . In a word , men have been content to // plant trees for their posterity , instead of themselves ; and no wonder that such an act , under such circumstances , should be considered , as Washington Irving calls it , a proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large tree may just as well be transplanted , so far as the vitality and prosperity of the tree are concerned , as a small one . In the words of Sir Henry Stuart- " Size , in an art founded on scient*Jlc principles , is a mere matter of choice and expenditure ; for trees of the greatest size are as susceptible of removal , as those of the least . " Let us look a little into the proof of this bold assertion , for it is evident enough , if it be true , that it indicates the establishment of a new art , and one which , sooner or later , in all civilized countries , must be in great demand . The transplantation of large trees , in past ages , has occurred very rarely , and has generally , in those few cases , been accomplished at a vast expense of money , and an equal sacrifice of materials . The instances , however , are quite enough to prove the practicability of the process . Pliny speaks of elms twenty feet high , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vines ; and mentions also the transplantation of a fir , which had a tap-root eight feet long , reckoning from the place where it was broken off in the process . The younger Seneca , writing from the villa of Scipio Africanus , says he had there learned the art of removing a whole orchard of old trees ; and that , after the third or fourth year , they produced an abundant crop of fruit . Virgil , also , refers to the occasional skill of the Roman husbandmen in the same art . In modern times , the principal case is that of Count Maurice , of Nassau , who was *overnor of Brazil , in 1636 , when that settlement was in the hands of the Dutch . lie resided on a dreary island , at the confluence of two rivers . There was neither tree* nor bush upon it when he erected a palace , and laid out his grounds . He then covered them with the finest trees , of various species- " the choicest fruits of a tropical climate , the orange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , the smell , and the taste ; " and , to crown all , seven hundred cocoa trees were planted over the estate , large numbers of them having a stature of from thirty to fifty feet , up to the lowermost branches , and an age of seventy or eighty years . The result appears to have been successful in the highest degree . Other instances are recorded of Evelyn , in his famous Sylva , and of a French Mareschal , who removed huge oaks at the Chateau de Fiat , not many years after the count 's experiment , and perhaps in consequence of his success . The Elector Palatine transplanted a number of large lime-trees , and they " prospered rarely well , " as Evelyn states , notwithstanding they were taken up in midsummer , and their heads cut off ( according to the barbarous old custom ) in the outset . Louis XIV . of France , however , bore the palm away in this art , from all his contemporaries . About the year 1670 , having ascertained the extent to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decorate the royal residences , at Versailles and Trianon , in the same manner . Thus , it is said , was removed nearly the whole of what is still called the Bois de Boulogne , a distance of about two leagues and a half to its present site . The traces of the operation // are yet visible in the rectilinear disposition of the tress , , and the machine used on the occasion was preserved as a curiosity for a long time afterwards . The English took the hint from some of these experiments , and we accordingly find Evelyn stating that he had himself seen trees transplanted " almost as big as his waist . " Rich noblemen occasionally tried the process , though at a great expense , and doubtless with a frequent want of success . A Devonshire proprietor is said to have removed oaks as large as twelve oxen could draw . Lord Fitzharding , who lived in Evelyn 's day , was in the habit of transplanting oaks of about the size of his thigh , and he deserves mention as the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and otherwise mangling the tree . During the eighteenth century some improvements were introduced in the art , but not much use was made of them . Since the commencement of the present more has been done . Dr. Graham , Professor of Botany in Edinburgh University , distinguished himself by an experiment of the kind some twelve years ago . Among his trees were ashes , alders , limes , and white-beams , of the height of thirty and forty feet , and with a girth of from two and a half to Ihur feet at the height of one . Sir Henry Stuart , who is a competent judge , entitles this " the most splendid achievement in horticultural transplanting ever known in Britain . " Oj* the continent the experiment has been tried with a success somewhat like that of Louis XIV . by other potentates in much the same way . Such examples , however , have served to discourage imitation rather than induce it . But the leading case , and that which may be called the first application of the true science of transplantation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all respects , is that of the author of the Planter 's Guide-Sir Henry Stuart , of Allanton , in Scotland . In his park there was originally no water , and scarcely a tree or bush in the vicinity of the present water , which was made in 1820 ; and in that year and 1821 , the adjoining grounds were abundantly covered with wood of such size as to give the estate , according to the engravings in the proprietor 's book , the appearance of a forest of considerable antiquity . When the Committee of the Highland *Society for promoting arboriculture , visited the place , in the fall of 1823 , both trees and underwood had obtained a full and deep-colored leaf , and health and vigor were restored to them . " In a word , " says Sir Henry  --  and the Committee sufficiently justify the force of his remark- " the whole appeared li/ce a spot at least forty years planted . " The Quarterly Review *tlso , in 18 ' 28 , seemed to consider the experiment a conclusive triumph , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Park of Allanton , its history being duly considered , is as well worthy of a pilgrimage as any of the established lions of the North Countrie . ' The Edinburgh , after giving the baronet credit for " conjuring up the noble and magnificent trees which now - surround him , " speaks of his publication as the first application of the science to the art of planting , they might h*tve termed his plantation , with equal justice , the first applicatien of the art to the science . The Committee above mentioned , comprised , we see , Sir Walter Scott , and several*other gentlemen distinguished for practical knowl // edge of the subject-matter . These persons reported , unanimously , that the art of transplantation , as practised by Sir Henry , " is calculated to accelerate , in an extraordinary degree , the power of raising wood , whether for beauty or shelter . " It appears that the park encloses about one hundred and twenty acres . The soil is clay , loam , and gravel ,  --  parts of it far from fertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea ,  --  the climate and country , ( as the Edinburgh drily observes , ) Scotland ,  --  in which Dr. Johnson said , half a century since , there was hardly timber enough for a walking-stick . The trees , either in single , or in open or close groups , consisted of birch , Scotch elm , sycamore , lime , horse-chestnut , oak , holly , beech , and others , somewhere from thirty to forty feet high , or more , and the girth of the largest was from five feet three to jive feet eight inches , at a foot and a half from the ground . These trees were putting forth shoots of eighteen inches , though they stood in the most exposed situations . The leaves of those planted most recently , were smaller than those of the older , but this difference was imperceptible after the third year from the removal . One of the copses , composed of trees from twenty to thirty feet high , interspersed with underwood , had been planted but five years , and yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which such a screen could be formed by ordinary means . They stated , moreover , that of all the trees they examined , one alone seemed to have failed , and that they found no traces of any dead tree having been removed . The Baronet , in his book , states that his average loss has been one in from forty to forty-five . Since this experiment of Sir Henry has proved thus successful , quite a number of proprietors of large estates , chiefly friends and neighbors of his , have availed themselves of his example and instruction to decorate their grounds in like manner ; and , indeed , the system of which he may be called the founder , has acquired an established reputation throughout Great-Britain . Sir Walter Scott was among the number just named . That distinguished writer was no less a lover of nature in fact , than in fancy and poetry ; and he was so enthusiastically attached to the cultivation of wood in particular , that , in the course of the sixteen years , during which he owned Abbotsford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . In 1824 and 1825 , he transplanted about forty trees of considerable size , on Stuart 's principles , and the success of the process was complete . A large part of the underwood , which adds very much to the picturesque beauty of Abbotsford , was the result of the same system . Mr. Lockhart , of Cleghorn , member of Parliament , tried it successfully , also , in 1827 , on a number of oaks , beeches , larches , sycamores , and horse-chestnuts , ranging from twenty-five to thirty-five feet in height , and from ten to fourteen inches in diameter . In the same year , another gentleman , in Lanark county , removed eleven oaks and ashes , with a girth of two and a half feet . A rich Glasgow banker decorated his country estate , on the Clyde , in the same manner . Mr. Smith , in the same neighborhood , removed some fine subjects of even fifty years of age ; and another Clyde proprietor is mentioned as having " completely changed the appearance of his place , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . // This expense , by the way , averaged , in the latter case , less than nine shillings to each tree ; nor do we find that it excelled fifteen in any of the cases last mentioned . Sir Henry Stuart estimates it at from six to eighteen , according to the size and age of the subject ; and he goes into particular calculations , founded on his own experience , to show that the difference of cost , in the transplantation of twenty-two large trees , between the common method and his own , would be as thirteen to one in his favor ,  --  exclusively of the advantage of obtaining the use of the wood at once , instead of waiting for it thirty years . In regard to this matter of expense , however , it is observable that the same estimates can not be relied on in our country as in Scotland or England . The cost of the machine is not included in the calculations cited ; but , setting this aside , and waiving , also , the waste of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system than the founder of it and his friends are , must incur , the difference in the price of labor itself , there and here , is quite sufficient to put a formidable barrier upon the introduction of the argument , if not of the system itself . This labor is , perhaps , seven-eighths of the whole cost of the process in a majority of cases , and the difference above alluded to , is , in the aggregate , as much as three to one against us . An English day 's labor , for example , is rated by Stuart , at one shilling and sixpence , and that of a horse and his driver at five shillings , the former of which prices would probably he quadrupled , and the latter doubled at least , in this vicinity . Still , we entertain no doubts that the new system will he introduced among us ,  --  to such an extent , certainly , as may enable those proprietors who have the means of indulging in what may , perhaps , be considered a luxury , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in that case , it can hardly admit of a controversy , what will be the result of their judgement . In some parts of the country , where the rage of destructiveness , heretofore alluded to , has most prevailed , full-grown trees are likely to be as much a desideratum in the decoration of grounds as they can be in England ; and we trust that , in such circumstances , the same liberal taste which disposes men elsewhere to this most delightful department of the study and be-auty of nature , will not be found wanting among our own countrymen . Thus far , it can not be said to have displayed itself , excepting in a few instances , to any considerable extent , although the want of it , it must be allowed , can not easily be overlooked by the least observing foreign tourist , who traverses the length and breadth of New-England . How many beautifully located estates are there in this Commonwealth , of which the owners , while they would not value one or two hundred dollars a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless , ignorantly or indolently contented themselves with either neglecting the decoration of their grounds with trees for the most partunder the disheartening impression that they can not live to see the result of their labors , or can not expect any result at all , worth striving for , from a process which they understand so imperfectly ,  --  or , perhaps , have had the magnanimity , ( as Mr. Irving considers it , ) in spite of this impression , to cover their land over with " dismal looking rows of long , leafless poles , standing in solemn uprightness , like // Aaron 's rod waiting for the miracle. *** After all , the expense is not much less than it would he in case of well-grown trees , which would be at once a splendid embellishment ; and the difference ,  --  waiving the advantage the Scotch system possesses in the infrequency of its failure ,  --  would be , as we said above , equal , so far as the object in question is concerned , to that of some thirty to forty years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive commons , squares , streets , and other grounds , are there in our cities and large towns ,  --  not to say our villages generally ,  --  where the destructive mania has hut too frequently swept away every thing before it ,  --  which might be ornamented and shaded , not as the Boston common has been , and is likely to be , by the toil and taste of long-succeeding generations of Mayors , but , as it were , with the magic energy which erected the Palace of Aladdin in a night . Grave-yards , especially , and church-grounds , would be essentially improved throughout this country , by such a process . The Turks themselves have gone before us , in the dutiful and beautiful regard rendered , in this respect , alike to the sympathies of the living , and the memory of the dead . We have known a few instances in this vicinity , of the transplantation of large trees ,  --  of a sugar-maple , for example , a foot in diameter ,  --  which proved entirely successful ; we hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be matter of boastful comment on the one hand , , or of distrustful inquiry on the other . In such hope , we shall conclude this article with a brief synopsis of the leading principles of the Scotch system . The first of the four chiefly insisted on , regards the adaptation of the subject to the soil . This applies to every individual tree , in respect to the exposure in which it has been reared . Young woods , for example , are apt to be crowded with tall , thrifty-looking plants , which appear , to the unpractised eye , the fittest subjects for removal but whose situation , or education ( so to speak , ) has been precisely such as to make them least capable of sustaining the changes they commonly undergo in the process . Even the adaptation of certain species of trees , however , to certain soils and aspects , is almost wholly overlooked in this country . The London Quarterly , for 1S528 ,  --  in an article attributed to Sir Walter Scott ,  --  admits that nine out of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Stuart , who considers their ignorance " portentous and incredible , if it were not proved by daily experience , " supports that charge by the following anecdote : - He says , that a friend of his , some years since , having broached this subject in a large company , who disagreed with him , offered a bet of five to one that no gentleman present could , within three months , name three persons , land-holders in the county , who had made large plantations , and had an income yearly of from five hundred to five thousand pounds , or more , that were able to *C state precisely what were the different soils to which twelve of the principal forest-trees planted in Britain were best adapted . " The bet was laughed at , but was taken up at once , and the taker began his search the next day ,  --  not doubting , though ignorant of the subject himself that every planter would know the soils best suited to his // trees , as much as the farmer those suited to his crops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county could fulfil the prescribed conditions ! Sir Henry 's second rule is , to avoid that old-fashioned dismemberment and mutilation , which generally has deprived the tree of a third part or more of its size and strength , as well as the whole of its beauty , at the very time when it needs them most . The old planter , Miller , well remarks , in his Botanist 's Dictionary , that if the same course were taken with the same trees unremoved , it would require several years ' growth in them to recover from the shock , and that they never would attain the size under these circumstances , which they otherwise might . One writer aptly compares the " disgusting and miserable spectres , " which handsome trees are commonly reduced to before removal , to the " unhealthy and maimed tenants of a military hospital after a great battle . " Another improvement in the Scotch system upon the old one , is in the management of the roots of the tree , and of the soil attached to them , both before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , particularly in the stability of the tree removed , and its consequent power of dispensing with every external species of support , even in the most inclement exposures . The fourth principle of Sir Henry relates to the subsequent treatment of the subject , down to the complete re-establishment of its thrift ; and for this discussion we must be content to refer to his volume . It will be found full of instruction upon the whole subject of arboriculture , from the beginning of its history to its end.
