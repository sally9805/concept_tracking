txt THE infinite variety of nature furnishes an unfailing source of admiration to all who contemplate her works . The boundless affluence of creative wisdom , is signally and beautifully illustrated in this interminable diversity . From the tiniest forms of being , which people in myriads every speck of matter visible to the naked eye , to those huge monsters which shake the sounding desert with their tread ; from the blade of grass which we crush beneath our feet , to the towering forests wThich spread continuous shade over half a continent ; from the smallest grain of sand which sparkles on the sea-shore , to those magnificent worlds which lie sprinkled through the fields of space , at so immense a distance , that they seem themselves as small ; the character which nature stamps on her productions , through all these vast gradations , is that of ceaseless , universal variety . Her excelling hand fashions no two objects alike . Not only does kind differ from kind , and species from species , but one individual differs from another . The flowers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same bough ; the beasts which herd together from the impulse of congenial sympathy ; birds warmed into life in the same nest ; and men , twin offsprings of the same womb , all bear distinctive marks of nature 's inexhaustible fertility of design . From the lowest to the highest link in her stupenduous chain , as far as human ken can reach , this endless difference is seen . Each mote that dances in the sunbeams has its own peculiar shape and substance , and " one star differeth from another star in glory . " But the infinite resources of nature are not alone displayed in diversifying the forms and qualities of matter in the physical creation . Not less wonderful is the variety which the immaterial world presents . The subtle principle of life is as diverse and manifold in its operations , as the innumerable forms of being on which it acts ; and in man , the glorious attribute which ( listinguishes him from all other organized existences , is modified by perpetual variations in every individual of his race . Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In tastes , habits , modes of thinking , and degrees of intelligence ; in memory , imagination , and the power of comparison an ( l inference ; and in every separate faculty of intellect , each human being is marked by qualities exclusively his own . Boundless as is the field of knowledge and speculation , there is perhaps scarcely a subject that employs the thoughts of men , on which the opinions of any two wholly coincide . They worship at the // same altar from similarity , not identity of creed : they support the same system of government , not because it fully accords with the political theory of either , but approaches more nearly than the counter systems which the others maintain ; and they draw their swords in the same cause , influenced by general correspondence of motive , not by precisely coincident views of national honor and rib ht . A consideration of this inevitable and all pervading difference in the constitution of intellect would seem sufficient , in itself , to teach mankind the duty of the widest tolerance of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been regarded as an occasion for the most vehement persecution . For this , martyrs innumerable have been immolated at the stake , and the whole earth has been incarnadined with the blood of human victims . The history of past ages is a continued narrative of the perverse strife of bigotry against the exercise of reason ; and the history of our own times , unhappily , contains abundant evidence that this bad warfare has not wholly ceased . If civilization , in its progress , has extinnd trampled guished the faroot a to atoms the instruments of physical torture , by means of which mind sought to establish its terrible despotism over mind , there are still left , in the hands of intolerance , other weapons of coercion , by the free use of which she strives , though with efforts of comparative impotence , to retard the march of truth . Ahuse is now substituted in place of force . Opprobrious terms and epithets of derision are the racks and pincers of the modern question . On the gravest subjects which affect the happiness of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with arguments , hut with invective . They address themselves not to reason and justice , but to passion and prejudice . They impugn the motives of their antagonists , instead of combatting their opinions ; and exercise all the arts of a perverted logic to heap ridicule and contempt on their persons and characters , instead of temperately demonstrating , by the irrefragable methods of dialectic proof , the unsoundness of their positions , and the inherent badness of their cause . This modified form in which the spirit of the dark ages still lingers among men displays itself nowhere so grossly as in the field of political discussion . The controversialists here-forgetful , it would seem , that politics are a branch of morals , which , having for their object the happiness of mankind , should not be pursued by means destructive of that end-assail each other with the rancor of mortal hostility , rather than the generous rivalry of champions alike zealous in the cause of truth . They contend as if their aim were to exterminate , not to convince ; as if obloquy were a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prouder achievement , than to refute the errors of his creed . In this respect , political controversy is behind the improved temper of the age . In religion , the angry scoffs and denunciations of polemical // warfare have given place to a more kindly and assuasive style of discussion , better suited to the genius of that faith which preaches " peace on earth , and good will toward men . " In science , the splenetic strife of presumptuous dogmatists , eager to bend the immutable and harmonious laws of nature to the support of chimerical and contradictory theories , has been succeeded by the friendly emulation of calm and modest searchers after truth , content to climb their way to the loftiest pinnacles of knowledge by the slow , but only certain paths of observation , induction , and experiment . No longer do arrogant synods proclaim arbitrary standards of faith , to which men must eonform their worship on pain of anathemas and persecution . No longer need the astronomer fear , while directing his tube to the stars , that the discoveries he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galileo is now summoned before an inquisitorial tribunal to recant his sublime theory of the mechanism of the heavens ; and no Bacon is maligned with the imputation of a league with the powers of darkness for the fruits he derives from a patlent investigation of the mysteries of nature . Happily for mankind , in religion and science , a wide and con* tinually extending spirit of tolerance prevails . Their votaries seem at last to have discovered that the utmost liberty of inquiry furnishes the surest means for the ascertainment of truth , the only object worthy of pursuit ; that all truth is single , and conslstent with itself ; and that it is its grand and peculiar characteristic ever to come forth from the alembic of discussion unchanged , an dpurifled from the adulterations of error , with which passion and ignorance may have blended it . Benign would be the effect on the condition of our race , if sentiments like these governed men in political investigations . There is nothing in the intrinsic nature of politics that renders the subject incapable of the calmest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand extraneous topics , in order to bewilder the understandings and excite the prejudices of those whom we address . But could questions of government be submitted to the mind in the naked dignity of abstract propositions , not immediately affecting selfish interests , men would reason upon them soberly , and be swayed in their opinions by the preponderance of truth . Politics are a branch of morals . All the duties of life are embraced under the three heads of religion , politics , and private ethics . The object of religion is the regulation of human conduct with reference to happiness in a future state of being . The object of politics is to regulate conduct with reference to happiness in communities . The object of private ethics is to regulate conduct with reference to individual happiness . Happiness , then , is the single aim of these three great and comprehensive branches of duty ; and it may be questioned whether the obligations imposed // by either can be fully performed by him who neglects those which the others enjoin . If we believe in the divinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our ourselves , in what mode can we more effectually show its authority over our minds , than by taking a firm and temperate part in political affairs ? The right ordering of a State directly promotes the welfare of multitudes of human beings ; and it is therefore not only the private interest , hut the christian duty , of every individual of those multitudes , strenuously to exert his just influence in accomplishing so important a result . Each one should act as if governed by the beautiful sentiment of Terence , " homo sum ; humani nihil a me alienum puto . " It would be a study not unworthy of the political moralist to inquire into the causes of that opposite spirit of contentious bitterness which so extensively prevails . If the sole legitimate end of politics is the happiness of men in their relations to each other as members of a community , they who call themselves politicians , not having this as their cardinal object , are not politicians , but dema gogues ; and , on the contrary , they only deserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their several creeds , who are truly governed by this high and generous purpose . That mind should differ from mind , in its estimate of the relative adequacy of opposite systems of politics to accomplish the same result , is a necessary consequence of the infinite variety which is displayed in the constitution of intellect . But that they should differ from each other in the end proposed , can only be accounted for , not by inherent diversity of understanding , but by depravity of heart . To which of these causes must be ascribed the wild intemperance and asperity which distinguish our political controversies ? Can mere theoretic difference of opinion wholly account for the rancorous vehemence of contending partisans , if really moved by the same benevolence of ultimate aim ? Is it in the nature of things , that a sincere and single desire to advance such a scheme of government as would most effectually secure the greatest amount of general happiness , can draw into action those violent passions which we constantly see exhibited around us ? Can it prompt such angry declamation , instigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst motives of the grovelling and base , as constitute a staple commodity of warfare in every contest of the antagonist parties of our country ? That we do not use language beyond the warrant of sober truth , every candid reader , however limited his observation in the field of political controversy , must admit . There are none so ignorant as not to know , that our party strifes are conducted with intemperance wholly unsuited to the conflicts of reason , and decided , in a great measure , not by the preponderance of honest opinion , but by the // influence of the worst motives , operating on the worst class of people . Let it not be supposed that we apply this phrase exclusively to any degree of society , as marked by the divisions of that aristocratic scale which is graduated according to the amount of men 's wealth , and the nature of their occupations . By the worst class of people , in our sense of the expression , all those are included-whether sons of idleness or of toil , whether rolling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gowns or in tatters - who enter into the strife of party without paramount regard to the inherent dignity and true end of politics ; without due reference to the interests of their country and of mankind ; without singly and solely aiming to advance the greatest happiness of society ; but actuated by private and unworthy motives ; by personal preferences and dislikes ; by lust of office , or the hope of achieving , directly or indirectly , some sinister object through the means of party predominance . These are , indeed , the lower orders , if we measure things by the sound standard of the moral scale . rfhese are the dregs of society , often , it is true , cast to the surface by the agitation of the political elements , but infallibly doomed to sink to the bottom when the fierce ebullition of passion , ignorance , and selfishness shall subside . It is from the undue influences of causes such as these , that elections come to be regarded by many as a mere game of mingled hazard and calculation , on the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division of party spoils , the distribution of chartered privileges , and the allotment , in various forms , of distinctions and pecuniary rewards . The antagonist principles of government , which should constitute the sole ground of controversy , are lost sight of in the eagerness of sordid motives , or only viewed as supplying an opportunity for inflammatory invective ; and the struggle , which should be one of reason and opinion , with no aim less noble than the achievement of political truth , and the promotion thereby of the greatest good of the greatest number , sinks into a wretched brawl , in which passion , avarice , and profligacy , act the chief parts on the desecrated scene . To remedy this evil wholly is perhaps not within the scope of practical reformation ; since it results , in part , from that diversity and imperfection of reason , which is displayed , to some extent , on every subject that engages the mind of man . Mathematicians sometimes kindle into wrath in the discussion of a problem , and call on their hearers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative merits of opposite modes of demonstration . If we may not look for invariable moderation in the investigation of abstract truth in the exact sciences , which depend for their proof on elementary propositions universally acknowledged , we need scarcely hope to see it always observed in disquisitions on politics , a // 63 science , the very axioms and definitions of which are themselves subjects of dispute , while the objects proposed by it necessarily embrace incidental matters calculated to mingle prejudice with judgment . But though we may not accomplish a degree of reformation incompatible with human imperfection , much within that limit is in our power to achieve . Whence , let us inquire , chiefly arises the harsh and vindictive tone of our party disputations ? Do we place ourselves in the opposition of mortal foes , and assail each other with unmeasured obloquy and reproach , because our theoretic views of the best means of promoting national welfare do not entirely coincide ? Or is this rancor aggravated by causes not necessarily connected with politics ; by elements foreign and adscititious , which improperly complicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pure reason an ( l patriotism , to one where cupidity , avarice , and all selfish passions take part in the decision ? Is not the fierce and intolerant temper of our political controversy largely owing to the fact , that government , instead of being conducted exclusively for the protection of the equal rights , and promotion of the general happiness of the community , has been cxtended to embrace the control of a thousand objects , which mi*ht safely , and with far greater advantage , be left to the regulation of social morals , and to the unrestrained efforts of individual enterprise and competition . Are our elections , in truth , the means of deciding mere questions of government , or does not upon them depend , to a much greater extent than the cardinal principles of politics , the decision of numerous questions affecting private and peculiar interests , schemes of selfishness , rapacity , an ( l fraud , and artful projects of men who , under illusory pretexts of seeking to advance the public good , aim only to make the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , with a clearness that can scarcely be increased by illustration , that much of the asperity of party strife must be ascribed . The true end of government is the equal protection of its citizens in " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , " leaving them to think , speak , and act , in whatever way their ideas of happiness may suggest , with no limit to unbounded freedom , save that which restrains them from mutual injury . But widely have we departed , in practice , from this principle of our political faith . We have fallen into the besetting sin of mankind of governing too much . We have undertaken to regulate , by political interference , the pursuits of industry and improvement ; we have connected government with the speculations of trade ; we have imposed burdens on the whole people in order to afford peculiar advantages to certain branches of traffic ; and worse than all , we have endowed with exclusive privilege 's , and hedged and guarded round with all the cunning7 devices of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate power is so tremendous , that it is yet an unsolved problem of fearful interest , whether , in the great struggle now waging , that or the democratic principle will finally prevail . This is the mode in which we have complicated the functions of government ; and hence the maddening elements which give such violence and acrimony to party strife . We have perverted legislation from its high and holy office of equal protection , and debased it into an almoner of special advantages and immunities to a few . We have made our elections a contest for these favors  --  a vile scramble for crumbs cast from the tables of those whom we have lifted on our own shoulders into place .. Can any truth in morals be more self-evident than the pernicious influence of special legislation ? It degrades politics from its digriity as the most important branch of morals , to a system of trickery , artifice , and corruption . It changes the generous and ennobling rivalry of men for such improvements in government as should most effectually promote the happiness of their kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained by trampling on the equal rights of the people . It quenches the sentiment of patriotism ; excites a feverish thirst for sudden wealth ; provokes a spirit of wild and dishonest speculation ; allures industry from its accustomed field of useful occupation ; pampers the harmful appetites of luxury , and introduces intemperance and profligacy in a thousand hateful forms . The remedy for these vast and continually increasing evils can not be doubted , if the cause has been correctly assigned . It is to simplify government . It is to reduce it to its proper sphere . If it were restricted to the few plain and necessary purposes contemplated in the democratic theory , the mere protection of person , life , and property ; if the guardianship of the equal rights of men were made its sole duty , and its action were directed , in all cases , not by the capricious suggestions of temporary expediency , but the eternal and unalterable principles of justice ; if it should seek to preserve the harmony and equilibrium of society by general , not by partial laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal equity , not by a complex contrivance of artificial checks and balances , in which interest should be set against interest , and fraud made to countervail fraud ; who can doubt that the salutary influence of such a change would soon manifest itself in an improved tone of public morals , and a wide diffusion of individual happiness and prosperity ? Confine government within the narrowest circle of necessary duties ; annul the fatal union between Bank and State ; and give unbounded freedom to trade , leaving enterprise , competition , and commercial usage and morality , to impose its only restraints ; and you at once place this people on a height of glory which would far out-top " old Pelion , and the skyish head of blue Olympus. " // The history of the world , through all the ages of the past , demonstrates what hideous evils inevitably result from blending the affairs of Religion and State ; and the history of our own country beautifully illustrates the beneficent consequences which flow from their separation . In no other nation of the earth are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so large a portion of the people bend in worship before the altars of the Chistian Church . Twenty thousand churches are scattered over our land , and the number of their communicants probably exceeds two millions . Here then we see the happy fruits of applying to religion the principles of freedom ; and what ground is there to doubt that equally happy would be the result of applying the same principles to trade ? Why should trade , any more than religion , have its hierarchs , holding their powers from a political source ? And why should tithes be imposed on the people , for the support of commercial , any more than ecclesiastical high priests and pontiffs ? It is no answer to these questions to call those who propose them agrarians , levellers , and visionaries . Abuse is not argument ; and though it may retard , it can not arrest , the progress of sound opinion . Well for mankind that this is so ; since it has ever been the doom of reason to be assailed with scoff and clamor by ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoicing , and onward , onward , will still pass , in her unfaltering course , to the accomplishment , at last , of a grander reformation than they who draw their augury from the present clouded phases of society would venture to vredict . In the meanwhile , let intolerance storm and folly jeer . XV profess ourselves followers of truth , not to be turned aside froii the career by terms of ridicule , nor irritated to retaliate with sue paltry weapons of intellectual warfare . They who , in this age of the world , when mind has made , and is continually making , such prodigious advances in every department of knowledge , would attempt to obstruct the course of free , calm , fearless discussion by derisive epithets and paltry catch-words for folly to play upon , if they had lived three centuries ago , would have been incited by the same temper , under the circumstances which then prevailed , to break their opponents on the wheel or burn them at the stake . Intolerance shows itself in many guises ; but all impatience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost liberty of inquiry , whether consisting in physical resistance , or in the terrors of denunciation , and the arts of ridicule , are but various forms in which that bad spirit manifests itself . Discussion is the great means of eliciting truth . Truth is an etherial light kindled by the attrition of opposite opinions . They who would quench it , if through fear of its effects , are despicable , if through any other motive , they are base.
