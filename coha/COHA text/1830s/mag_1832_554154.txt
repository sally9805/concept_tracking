txt There is no sin which more easily besets the biographer of public men , than a reluctance to admit the fact , that they ever had any private life ; yet we know not that the dignity of a statesman would be impaired by such an admission , or that the parlor and the fire-side are much less interesting , than the cabinet or the legislative hall . Sir James Mackintosh assures us , that the biographer should introduce historical detail no farther , than the clearness and accuracy of his narrative require ; and that the historian , on the other hand , should be careful to avoid all private particulars , which can not be regarded as essential . The rule is certainly a judicious one ; and it has been faithfully applied in his own biography of one of the greatest and best men in England 's annals . But it is hard to bring the conviction of its justice home to others ; the // brilliant ornaments of the green-house attract us more , than the unobtrusive garden flowers ; and the consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sometimes more properly styled a dissertation on the rise and fall of nations , between the period of his birth and the close of his career . Mr. Sparks has done much to avoid this error , in the work before us . We are glad that he has thus avoided it ; for much was naturally expected from his talent and research , and it would have been a subject of regret , if those expectations had not been realized ; more especially , as he has now adventured in a department of literature , in which , though much has been already done , far more remains to be performed . The tombs of several of the prophets have been builded by the pious hands of their surviving relatives ; but there are many of the buried warlike and the wise , ' over whom no such memorial has been erected , and whose actions live only in the perishing record of tradition , or the memory of those who are fast going down to the grave . They are men , who sat by the cradle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress to maturity ; in the high enthusiasm of their self-devotion , counted toil and sacrifice as nothing , so long as their country had any thing for them to do or suffer ; and when their course was finished , and their warfare accomplished , fell asleep amidst the triumph of the greatest of all moral victories . Such characters belong to the number of the great and fortunate ; the historical painter should rejoice to fix their likeness in his most enduring colors on the canvass ; the philosopher and the moralist should point to*their example , and hold them up to the admiration of posterity . There is nothing strange or affected about them ; but they are nevertheless original and peculiar . They came forth , not from the halls of philosophy , nor the saloons of luxury ; not illuminated by the light of recorded experience , nor provided with those means and appliances , which invigorate the spirit , and fortify the arm , in seasons of extremity and peril ; but they came from the plough , the work-shop , and the bar ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where it is , and supplies the place of knowledge , where knowledge may not be ; going forth , in the strength of a high and manly purpose , to the protection of high and momentous interests . It was this lofty disdain of low and sordid things , this appeal to all that is elevated and generous in human feeling , which enabled them to // meet the shock of disciplined hosts ; and sustained them in the more perilous trial of organizing a Government , which is now the guide and model of the nations , when the file afforded them no precedent , and their sole reliance was upon their own strong sense and virtue . The soul of Ames would have poured itself out in tones of still more burning eloquence over the ashes of his friend , could it have been revealed to him , that a generation should pass away , and the beautiful memorial which his own affection reared , should still be almost the only one , which bears the name of Hamilton . These are suggestions , which have doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history ; and we have alluded to them here , only that we might the more fully express our obligations to Mr. Sparks , forhis efforts to remove what we can not but regard as a national reproach . The nai ' -* rative which he has given , relates to the life and character of one , who , if not foremost among the glorious company of which we have spoken , was certainly not undistinguished among the eminent men of our country . He has brought to his task so much of intelligent research , so much historical anecdote and rich and various illustration , that his work is of real , as it will be of lasting value . The general considerations connected with the subject of our revolutionary and constitutional history , have been so often dwelt upon , that we are under no temptation to enlarge upon them here ; and we think that our readers will be grateful to us , for confining our observations to a sketch of the life of the eminent person , whom he has selected as his subject . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative , combining it , as we proceed , with such extracts as our limits will allow . Gouverneur Morris was born at Morrisania in New York , * a manor , which had been for more than a century in the possession of his family ,  --  on the 31st of January , 1752 . He was the youngest son of Lewis Morris , a man of some distinction in his day , by a second marriage . His father died before he had reached the age of twelve years ; and as this second marriage had given serious offence to the rest of the family , who naturally conceived him bound to follow their inclinations in preference to his own , his widow was left , in a state of estrangement from his connexions , to devote herself to the management of the considerable estate which he bequeathed to her , and to the education of her son . It is impossible now to ascertain , // what the promise of his infancy may have been ; for the only fact relating to it , which the industry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was early instructed in the French language , which he afterwards wrote and spoke with as much facility as his native tongue . At the college in the city of New York , which he entered so young , that he graduated at the age of sixteen , he was more distinguished by his application to the severer studies , than by an inclination for general literature ; though he was not wholly free from the ordinary youthful indiscretion , of laboring to excel in poetry . The oration which he delivered when he left the college , on the subject of Wit and Beauty , is still preserved , and exhibits rather more than the usual merit of these productions , accompanied with some extravagance of sentiment and style . On the occasion of taking his master 's degree , three years afterwards , he again displayed his talent in an address on Love ; a very good theme , ' as his biographer somewhat drily remarks , for an ode , or a sonnet , or a few stanzas , from a despairing swain , but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , assembled to witness a literary exhibition in a university . ' We are strongly inclined to doubt , whether it were his purpose to address himself exclusively to the grave and learned portion of his auditory ; the subject , at any rate , formed no unapt conclusion to that of his former exhibition ; and both are said to have given a very favorable impression of his eloquence . As soon as his college studies were completed , Mr. Morris applied himself to the study of the law in the office of William Smith , afterwards chief-justice of the Province of New York , and better known as the writer of its history . This was undoubtedly the profession , in which the qualities of his mind and temperament rendered him most likely to excel . His intellect was vigorous and penetrating ; and his elocution , if not always strictly regulated by the most refined taste , was animated and persuasive . He was accustomed to remark , that he never knew the sensations of embarrassment , or fear , or inferiority , in his intercourse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , though it would be rid icubus in a feeble mind , undoubtedly gives additional strength and efficiency to the influence of a commanding one . At the time when Mr. Morris began his career , it was not only a valuable quality , but , when united with an understanding like // his , one of the most essential . No man could at that period devote himself to civil pursuits , without entering largely into the political controversies of the day . At the age of seventeen , before his legal studies were finished , Mr. Morris presented himself to the public in the capacity of a writer upon the subject of finance , to which very much of his attention was subsequently given . A project had been agitated in the Assembly of New York , for raising money by issuing bills of credit ; the amount arising from which was to be loaned , and the interest applied to the payment of the 1 ) rovincial debt , and various other public exigencies . This was one of the absurd schemes , of which our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those , who are fond of applying maxims to public affairs , which would be obviously fatal in the case of an individual . Mr. Morris wrote in opposition to this plan with much intelligence and comprehension of the subject , but whether successfully or not , does not appear . About the same time , he was licensed to practise as an attorney ; and by some of his earliest forensic efforts , added much to the reputation which he had previously acquired . The relations of the colonies with the mother country were now assuming a critical aspect ; and the attractions of political advancement soon drew him from his professional labors , to act in a more important and extended sphere . His early prepossessions were in favor of conciliation with the mother country ; but when the crisis came , he was found in the foremost rank of the patriots . The old Colonial Assembly of New York sat for the last time , in the winter of 1774 ; but the attempt to induce this body to send delegates to the Continental Congiess proving vain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electing members of a Provincial Convention , which assembled in New York in the spring of 1775 , and was dissolved after accomplishing the purpose of the meeting , which was nothing more than the appointment of the delegation of the Province in Congress . Mr. Morris was not a member of this body ; but he was immediately afterwards elected a delegate to the new Provincial Congress , called together on the following month , in consequence of the actual commencement of hostilities . One of the most important subjects which occupied the attention of this assembly , was that of raising money to defray the expense of military preparations for separate government and defence . A committee , of which Mr. Morris // was one , was instructed to prepare a plan for this purpose . Their report , which was understood to be suggested by him , and which he supported in the Congress with uncommon eloquence and power , was adopted without alteration , and afterwards made the basis of the arrangement agreed upon by the Continental Congress . It is impossible for us to enter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the powers of Government were exercised in New York , before a permanent system was established . Mr. Sparks has given us much new and interesting information upon this subject ; hut we have room only for a cursory account of those proceedings , in which Mr. Morris took a prominent share . In 1776 , he was elected a member of another Provincial Congress , upon which devolved a task of a very delicate nature ; it having become necessary to assume the independence of the Province , and , in conformity with the recommendation of the Continental Congress , to organize a new system of government . There were several circumstances , which rendered these operations more difficult in New York , than they had proved to be elsewhere . In many parts of the Province , the people were almost unanimous in their hostility to the patriotic cause ; the hope of reconciliation was still cherished by many ; and in the city of New York , a strong apprehension for the safety of their lives and property , rendered a large portion of the citizens extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the situation of affairs grew more critical , the general sentiment underwent a rapid change ; Gouverneur Morris , Jay , and other leading patriots , urged it on by their just and eloquent appeals ; and five days after the declaration of our national Independence , the Congress of New York unanimously declared their resolution to support that Independence , at the hazard of their lives and fortunes ; a determination , the full merit of which can only he estimated , when we remember that it must have been taken with a full consciousness that their own soil must be , as it shortly after was , the principal theatre of the war . Before this was done , however , the members of this Congress , being in some degree doubtful of their powers to act decisively on the great questions submitted to them , had applied for new instructions to the people , who not only complied with the request , but made such changes in the composition of the body , as the public exigency required ; so that the alteration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the // very day on which the declaration just alluded to was made , assumed the style of the Convention of the Representatives of the State of New York . Owing to the distracted state of affairs , the Convention were able to do nothing towards establishing a system of government , until August , when Mr. Jay , Mr. Morris , and Mr. Livingston , were appointed a Committee , to prepare a plan for this purpose . In order to give the people time for deliberate reflection upon the subject , the constitution they had framed was not reported to the Convention until March of the following year , when it was adopted with little alteration . It should be mentioned to the honor of Mr. Morris , that he labored in co-operation with his friend Mr. Jay , though unfortunately without success , to introduce into it an article for the prohibition of domestic slavery , similar to that which was adopted a few years since , when the present constitution of that great and enlightened State was formed . It was necessary , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to appoint a committee to exercise its powers , until the Constitutional Legislature could be convened ; and Mr. Morris was one of the individuals selected by the Convention for both these purposes . Their opinion of his merit was also manifested , by appointing him one of the delegates to represent the State in the Continental Congress ; but he was prevented from attending , by the critical situation of the affairs of his own State . The evacuation of Ticonderoga , by St. Clair , had removed the great barrier to the descent of the enemy upon New York ; and his labors , as a leading member oC the Council of Safety ,  --  the title of the Committee , to whom the temporary exercise of the powers of Government had been confided ,  --  occupied his whole time and attention . In October , 1777 , he was again elected a member of the Continental Congress , in the mode provided by the new Constitution ; and in the following January , for the flr5t time took his seat . He had now been more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this period a reputation for general ability , activity , and maturity of judgment , which has seldom been established at an age so early as his . But he was now to be exposed to a severer trial ; to take his place by the side of men of tried experience , and of unsurpassed energy and power , in accomplishing a task , from which ordinary talent and patriotism would have shrunk in despair . The // army , undisciplined , broken , and almost disbanded , were about retiring into their wretched quarters at Valley-Forge . In the language of Washington , the sick were naked , the well were naked , and their brethren in captivity were naked also . Hardly by the most violent measures , could the urgent wants of each successive day be supplied . Dark conspiracies were incessantly maturing against the commander-in-chief ; and the officers , for whom no permanent provision bad yet been made , were rapidly deserting a service , in which they found nothing but privation and unrewarded toil . The time was evidently come , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all preceding labors would be wholly lost . The spirit of that Assembly rose with the exigency . Under circumstances which might almost have appalled a Roman Senate , they set themselves to the work without hesitation or dismay . A deputation was instantly sent to investigate the condition of the army , and to devise proper measures for its relief . It is no light proof of the estimation in which Mr. Morris was thus early held , that though hardly personally known , he was made a member of this delegation , on whose fidelity and judgment the destinies of the nation hung . In concert with Washington , with whom he here contracted an intimacy which was never afterwards interrupted , Mr. Morris and his associates prepared a plan , extending to the whole economy and organization of the army , which Congress approved and adopted , and the beneficial results of which were immediately visible . On his return from the camp , where he had been detained three months , many other important commissions were entrusted to him , which were discharged with his usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this eventful period , that not even the most assiduous and devoted fidelity was able to protect him from injurious suspicions . In the year 1775 , a letter addressed to him by a friend in London , a loyalist in principle , but containing nothing which indicated any sympathy of sentiment on his part with the writer , was detained on its arrival in New York , as bearing the superscription of a rebel . It was sent thence to Halifax , from which place it was again returned to New York , in a vessel which was thrown on the coast of New Jersey . The mail drifted to the shore , and the unfortunate letter was carried to Trenton , where it appears to have given rise to some unfavorable surmises ; but it was not until three years after its date , that it was forwarded // to Mr. Morris by the President of Pennsylvania , who had also become prejudiced against him by its perusal . During the whole period of the war , his mother resided within the lines of the enemy . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest and most valued friends , were in favor of the royal cause ; and these circumstances only , which certainly are but a slender basis , produced the impression to which we have alluded . Mr. Jay , in a friendly letter , observed to him , that his enemies talked much of his tory connexions ; entreating him at the same time , not to expose himself to unnecessary calumny , and perhaps indignity . The reply of Mr. Morris was characteristic . I will have , ' said he , my revenge . By laboring in the public service , so as to gain the applause of those whose applause is worth gaining , I will punish them severely ; ' and he kept his word . At one time , when the illness of his only surviving parent rendered him extremely anxious to visit her , he felt himself compelled not only to lay aside a plan which he had formed for that purpose , hut to publish a statement of these facts , and a refutation of the calumnies , which the disinterestedness of his patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session of Congress of which we have already spoken , Mr. Morris prepared , for the use of that body , a statement of the situation of public affairs ; in which the condition of the military department and the more intricate subject of the finances , were treated with uncommon ability . He also opened a correspondence with Washington and Greene , and seconded with all his power , their efforts to place the various departments of public business on a more eligible footing . The British Commissioners arrived this year , with the conciliatory bills and propositions of the British ministry ; the conclusion of treaties with France was not yet known in this country ,  --  and some apprehensions were entertained , that the English plan of conciliation might win its way to the favor of the people . The task of giving a proper direction to the popular sentiment upon this subject , was confided to Mr. Morris ; and he had hardly done this , in an able report , which was unanimously accepted by the Congress , before he was again called upon to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion of the ratification of the long expected treaty with France . The effect of this address , which was very great , is the best evidence of its merit . To these labors , was added that of drawing up a statement of the unsuccessful attempt of the British to // effect a reconciliation . This was published , under the title of Observations on the American Revolution , and attracted much attention in this country and abroad . He was again called upon to prepare the first instructions given by the United States to any diplomatic agent ,  --  . - those which were sent to Dr. Franklin , as Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles ; and in connexion with them , he wrote Observations on the Finances of America , which Dr. Franklin was directed , by the President of Congress , to lay before the French ministry . Early in the next year , he was placed at the head of a committee , who were directed to consider certain important des-. patches from the American Commissioners abroad , and communications from the French minister in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his biographer , both as respected its character and consequences , as the most important that was brought forward during the war . It became the basis of the peace which was ultimately concluded , and comprehended all the points , at that time deemed essential to an accommodation of our differences with England . In the protracted debates to which this report gave rise , Mr. Morris took an active and leading share ; and the results of the discussions were embodied by him into instructions to the ministers appointed to negotiate a peace , which were accepted by Congress without any alteration . Mr. Morris had been twice elected a member of Congress by the Legislature of New York ; and the rapid sketch which we have just given , is sufficient to convey a tolerably correct impression of the extent and variety of his labors in that office . At the expiration of his second term , another person was elected in his place . The reasons which induced the Legislature to adopt this course , can not now he ascertained ; but if tradition is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accused , was a disposition to attend too exclusively to the affairs of the nation , and too little to those of his own State ; a charge which , fairly interpreted , undoubtedly implies any thing rather than a just reproach . It serves to show , that he understood the nature of his official duty , and pursued it with untiring industry and zeal ; giving his hand and heart to those great interests , on which the welfare of the nation was suspended ; not loving his own State less ,  --  for there is no reason to believe that he neglected any portion of his duty ,  --  but his whole country more . However this may have been , he immediately returned // to his old profession after his retirement from office , and established himself in 1780 , in Philadelphia , in the practice of the law . BuL it was impossible for a mind like his , to divest itself at once of its accustomed interest in public concerns . The credit of the country was at this time completely prostrated ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tried , and found wanting ; every eye was now open to the full extent of the evil , but the boldest shrunk from the attempt to suggest any practicable remedy ; in one wordr the fountains of public credit were broken up , and the waters out , and no man dared to arrest their course , hardly even to measure the extent of the devastation . The voice of Mr. Morris was again heard with its usual energy and power . The tone of his writings , which were widely circulated and eagerly read , was open , bold , and manly ; but the remedy which he proposed , the funding of the debt , and a resort to direct taxation for its payment , though the only one , perhaps , that could be considered commensurate with the evil , was beyond the limited power of the Congress , and the exhausted means and spirit of the people ; though his exertions undoubtedly did much to produce the fortunate change , which was shortly after made . But his labors were interrupted by an accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . His horses took fright , as he was driving in the streets of Philadelphia , and he was thrown from his carriage on the pavement with such violence , as to fracture the bones of his leg , and to render amputation necessary . He sustained this operation with great composure , and supplied the loss by what his biographer says was scarcely more than a rough stick ' fitted to the limb . This he was never afterwards induced to relinquish for any of the more ornamental substitutes , by which modern ingenuity has nearly removed the inconveniences of the privation . In 1781 , Congress became sensible of the necessity of erecting several departments , similar to those which now exist , in order to give greater vigor and efficiency to their executive authority . Robert Morris , a man who has hardly yet received his just deserts of praise , was placed at the head of that of finance . The wisdom of the choice was amply justified by the result ; for it is very doubtful , whether any other individual in the country combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmness and decision , which at // once attract the public confidence . In accepting the office , he made it a condition , that he should be invested with the power of appointing and removing at his pleasure , all officers , who were in any way connected with his department ; and it is a striking evidence of the respect in which his personal qualities were held , that these terms were readily complied with . Provision had been made for the appointment of an assistant financier ; this office he immediately offered to Gouverneur Morris , with whom he had long been connected by private intimacy , though not , as has been frequently supposed , by any nearer tie . No one requires to be informed of the effect of their united efforts , in restoring the public credit and universal confidence . We are warranted in saying , that no persons could have accomplished more than they did ; the only real cause of wonder is , that with means so limited , we had almost said , without any means at all , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to the province of history . Mr. Morris continued to perform the duties of this office for the space of three years , but resigned it at the restoration of peace , and resumed the practice of the law in Philadelphia . Certain charges , relating to his conduct at this period , have been recently* brought against him on the high authority of Mr. Justice Johnson , in his Biography of General Greene . Some of these accusations are of a very serious nature . That gentleman has thought proper to infer , from his correspondence with General Greene , that Mr. Morris was the writer of the celebrated Newburgh Letters ; but this inference is satisfactorily refuted by General Armstrong 's avowal of the authorship , since the publication of Mr. Johnson 's work . It is next asserted , that Mr. Morris was desirous of employing the army , for the purpose of establishing an absolute monarchy in this country . No other refutation of this is necessary , as Mr. Sparks very justly observes , than the evidence afforded by his writings and his actions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our knowledge of either extends , they are far from giving the slightest color to such an accusation . These charges , serious enough in themselves , and of a kind which ought certainly never to be hazarded when unsupported by the strongest testimony , are accompanied with an insinuation , which will admit of no other construction , than that Mr. Morris was deeply engaged in speculations with the public creditors ; and // this insinuation is presented , as if it bore reference to a well authenticated fact . In the absence of all positive evidence on this subject , Mi ' . Sparks has resorted to that of a negative character , furnished by the circumstance , that he has found nothing in any records of Mr. Morris 's public or private transactions , which gives the least probability to such a suspicion . He was , however , under no necessity of doing this ; the want of positive testimony is sufficient to destroy the imputation . At the death of his mother , in 1786 , the paternal estate of Morrisania descended to the brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the British service . His own portion of his father 's property was very small ; but with the aid of his friends , he purchased the estate of his brother , and retained the possession of it during the remainder of his life . Before this time , he had entered into extensive commercial speculations in connexion with Robert Morris , and had begun to realize a considerable accession to his fortune . Having now been a resident of Pennsylvania for several years , he was elected a delegate of that State in the Convention which met in 1787 , for the purpose of forming the Constitution of the United States . The nature of his engagements was such , that he kept no memoranda of the proceedings of that body ; so that the l ) at which he took in its deliberations can be determined only by tradition , and the recollection of those members who survive , it has been generally believed , that he was entitled to the credit of drafting the Constitution , aided only by the mass of materials , which the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . A story had been long in circulation , that he was absent for several days during its session , and on returning , found his friends desponding and disheartened , in consequence of the differences and animosities , which threatened to produce an entire dissolution of the assembly ; and that , on the following day , he urged the necessity of harmony and partial sacrifices of local interest and feeling , in order to restore it , with so much eloquence , that he attained his object , and the work went prosperously on . With the view of ascertaining the credit due to these stories , Mr. Sparks addressed a letter to Mr. Madison upon the subject . That* gentleman stated in his reply , that the last anecdote , though correct in some of its particulars , had no substantial foundation . Mr. Morris did , in fact , return to the Convention at a critical period , // after a short absence ; it was while the constitution of the Senate was the subject of debate ; the principle of equal representation being warmly supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the larger ; but Mr. Morris was not an advocate of the compromise which was finally effected ; and though he urged the necessity of union with his wonted ability , yet the topic had been already so much exhausted , and some of his ideas were so little relished , that his exertions could not have had much influence in producing the final result . In relation to the other subject of inquiry , Mr. Madison remarks , that the finish given to the style and arrangement of the Constitution fairly belongs to the pen of Mr. Morris ; the task having probably been handed over to him by the chairman of the committee , himself a highly respectable member , and with the ready concurrence of the others . A better choice could not have been made , as the performance of the task proved . It is true , that the state of the materials , consisting of a reported draft in detail , and subsequent resolutions accurately penned , was a good preparation for the symmetry and phraseology of the instrument ; but there was sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author on the face of it . The alterations made by the committee are not recollected . They were not such , as to impair the merit of the composition . ' It thus appears , by the liberal testimony of the venerable individual , to whom , perhaps , more than to any other man , we owe the blessings which the adoption of this great instrument has brought upon us , that the honor due to Gouverneur Morris , as the writer of our Constitution , is hardly inferior to that which belongs to Mr. Jefferson , as the author of the Declaration of our independence . The task of both was rendered lighter , by the previous discussion of the subject , and the principles which others had defended and laid down ; but after making all allowances , no ordinary share of honor still remains ; and if it be the glory of the one , that he embodied in the most splendid and imposing form the principles which led our country on in the course of prosperity and triumph , it is equally the praise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure reared by the united labors of many illustrious minds , which stands , like some majestic monument of ancient art , the example and wonder of the nations . There is another circumstance , most honorable to the fra // meis of our Constitution , which ought never to pass from the remembrance of Americans . It is well known , that the plan of government projected and proposed by Hamilton , differed essentially from that which was adopted . Every other member of the Convention had probably some favorite views of his own , which he found it necessary to surrender ; in fact , the whole system was eventually established on the basis of conipromise , and a liberal sacrifice of personal feelings and local interests to the universal good . Mr. Morris , for example , was desirous that the Senate should be composed of men of large property , who should hold their seats for life ; and in order the more effectually to secure the object of rendering them in a measure independent on the popular will , that all vacancies in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been ,  --  to use an expression which he afterwards applied to the case of France ,  --  to make Government , not a weathercock to show the direction of the hurricane , but a tower to resist its force . The expression is too strong to form a precise illustration of his views ; but such in general was his theory ; and it is not surprising , that where there was no experience to direct or modify their speculations , many patriots should have entertained sentiments at variance with those prevailing at the present day . But their love of country was stronger than their love of theory . No sooner was the Constitution framed , than they devoted all the resources of their ability and influence , to procure its adoption by the people . All former differences of sentiment were at once forgotten ; the costliest of sacrifices , that of the pride of long cherished and deliberate opinion , was laid at once upon the altar . For some unexplained reason , which is supposed by his biographer to have been the multiplicity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton , to become one of the writers of the Federalist ; but his exertions in support of the Constitution were very vigorous and effective . There is something manly in the way in which he speaks of it , in a letter addressed to a gentleman in France . I have many reasons to believe , ' says he , that it was the work of plain honest men and such , 1 think , it will appear . Faulty it must be , for what is perfect ? ' Should it take effect , the affairs of this country will put on a much better aspect than they have yet worn , and America will soon be as much respected abroad , as she has for *ome time past been disregarded . ' // In 1788 , Mr. Morris gratified his early inclination to visit Europe , and sailed for France . After a tedious passage , he reached his destination , and arrived in Paris at the time , when the series of events which terminated in the Revolution was in hreatenin g and rapid progress . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was hi5 custom to keep a full and minute diary of occurrences , from which his biographer has given so many interesting extracts , as to induce us to regret , that he could not favor us with more . Nothing could be more interesting , than the remarks of so keen and intelligent an observer , on the thousand objects of curiosity that met his eye ; at a period , when , though all as yet was sunshine , the whole constitution of society in France was undergoing a most thorough and perplexing change . Mr. Morris was inclined , either from a l ) rophetic anticipation of consequences , or from the associations which he formed immediately after his arrival , to look upon the gloomy side of the picture . His feelings were early enlisted in opposition to the revolutionary principle , and he regarded the plans of the moderate reformers as too revolutionary in their tendency ; so that in the political and literary circles , into which his talent and reputation gave hint immediate admission , he entered with the most ardent interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counteract them . Owing to this , there was little cordiality between hirri and Lafayette , though they regarded each other with mutual respect , and there was no interruption of their intercourse . He appears to have interfered with as little scruple in the affair of France at that time , as the European powers have since ; and it is curious to remark , to what extent he was not unfrequently involved in them . The followiub extracts from his diary require no comment , and are interesting , as exhibiting his observation and judgment in regard to individuals , as well as political affairs . March 27th , 1789 . At three , the Mar6chal de Castries calls , and takes me to dine with Monsieur and Madame Necker. hi the salon we found Madame . She seems to he a woman of sense , and somewhat of the masculine in her character . A little before dinner , Monsieur enters .

He is now much harassed , and Madame receives continually memoires from different people ; so that she seems as much occupied as he is . If he is really a very great man , I am deceived and yet this is a rash judgment . If he is not a laborious man , I am also deceived . April 20th . If the Court should attempt now to recede , it is impossible to conjecture the event . The chiefs of the patriotic party have gone so far , that they can not retreat with safety . If there be any real vigor in the nation , the prevailing party in the States-General may , if they please , overturn the monarchy itself , should the king commit his authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble , and the manners are so extremely corrupt , that they can not succeed , if there be any consistent opl ) osition , unless the whole nation be equally depraved . The probability , I think , is , that an attempt to retreat , at this late period of the business , would bring the Court into absolute contempt . June 6th . Dine with Mr. Jefferson . He has just received some news from America , where all is going on well . Sit pretty long at table and stay to tea . At ten go to sup with Madame de Flahaut , who is ill , but eats supper , and is of course much worse after having eaten . The States-General seem to approach a little more towards accommodation . The Bishop of Autun ( ralleyrand ) who is one of our company , and an intimate friend of Madame Flahaut , appears to me a sly , cool , cunning , ambitious , and malicious man . I know not why conclusions se disadvantageous to him are formed in my mind ; but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 23d . Go to Versailles and call on Monsieur de la Luzerne , but both he and his lady are out of town . Thence to Madame de Tess&amp;s , who gives me a cordial reception , complaining , however , of my politics . r1*he King has this day , in his &amp;ance royale , pleased the nobility , and very much displeased the Tiers . I find it difficult to learn exactly what has passed , but it seems to me , that the nobility have less cause for exultation than they imagine . At dinner I sit next to Monsieur de Lafayette , who tells me that I injure the cause , for that my sentiments are continually quoted against the good party . I seize the opportunity to tell him , that I am opposed to the democracy from regard to liberty . That I see they are going headlong to destruction , and would fain stop them if I could . That their views respecting this nation are totally inconsistent with the materials of which it is composed ; and that the worst thing which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tells me , that // he is sensible his party are mad , and tells them so , but is not the less determined to die with them . I tell him that it would be quite as well to bring them to their senses , and live with them . Sept. 26th . After dinner , Madame de Tess* having told her , Madame de Stael that I am un homme d'esprit , she singles me out and makes a talk . Asks if I have not written a book on the American Constitution ,  --  " Non , Madame , j'aifait mon devoir en assistant d ( a formation de cette Constitution . " - " JF/Ijais , Monsieur , votre conversation doit &amp;re tr*s int*ressante , car vous entends cit6 de toute part . " - " Ak , Jladame , je ne suis pas digne de cet doge. " - How I lost my leg ? It was unfortunately not in the military service of my country . " Monsieur , vous avez ( air tr*s imposant , " and this is accompanied with that look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " leer of invitation , " amounts to the same thing . November 3d . This morning , at half past eight , the Bishop of Autun calls on me , and we breakfast . He tells me , that M. de Poix is to visit NI . de Lafayette this morning , in order to make terms for Mirabeau . We talk a little about M. de Lafayette , his worth , and what he is worth . At nine , go to visit him . Lafayette asks the Bishop , what he thinks of a new ministry . He says , that nobody but M. Necker can sustain the famine and bankruptcy , which appear unavoidable . Lafayette asks , if he does not think it would be right to prepare a ministry for some months hence . The Bishop thinks it would . They discuss characters a little , and , as if par hazard , Lafayette asks , whether Mirabeau 's influence in the assembly is great , to which the Bishop replies , that it is not enormous . The Bishop says , that he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire . Lafayette agrees to this , and says , that in this moment the friends of liberty ought to unite , and to understand each other . At coming away , the Bishop observes , that Lafayette has no fixed plan , which is true . ' in January , 1790 , Mr. Morris received credentials from General Washington as a private agent , for the transaction of important business with the British ministry . The situation of affairs in France was at this time , by no means favorable to the monarchy . The torrent of the Revolution was rolling so impetuously on , that no man might venture to arrest its progress . It was with almost expiring hope , that he addressed a note to the Queen before his departure , advising that the King should by no means l ) lace himself at the head of the Revolution , but stiffer things to take their course ; or in other words , should lash the helm , and trust to the mercy of the winds and current . Hc arrived at London in the following month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not yet been executed by England ; particularly those , in which she engaged to make compensation for the negroes taken from the Southern States , and to surrender the fortified posts on tile Western frontier . Mr. Morris was instructed to ascertain the intentions of the British Government on these points ; and to inquire , whether they were disposed to enter into a commercial treaty with the United States , or intended to send a minister to America . No sooner had he arrived in London , than he communicated the objects of his mission in confidence , to tile French minister at that court , M. de la Luzerne , in order that Congress might appear to take no steps relating to the treaty of peace , without the knowledge of their old ally ; apparently overlooking the fact , that he had no authority to take any decisive measures , but merely to ascertain whether any could be taken . At all events , the communication did more credit to his frankness than his prudence ; for M. de Ia Luzerne , thinking the secret far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ersuade the British ministry , that the whole business originated with the court of France ; and in this way it was made public in the United States , where , as will be seen presently , this openness of Mr. Morris operated greatly to his disadvantage . It is apparent , from various circumstances , that his ready penetration and knowledge of human nature , were not combined with that spirit of finesse , which distinguished the diplomacy of Europe at the time . As it happened , the mission was altogether fruitless . The British cabinet were yet uncertain whether they should be involved in war , and were willing to postpone any demonstrations of friendship towards this country , until our friendship should be of greater value to them . Shortly afterwards , when war with France came on , they entered on a course of amicable relations with the utmost alacrity . After an absence of several months , Mr. Morris abandoned his ineffectual mission and returned to Paris . He there found the King seated upon a tottering throne , nearly at the mercy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and zeal into the political divisions of the hour , as if he had had no other business to do . It is a curious indication of the activity of his mind , that he found time and inclination to attend to them , amidst the pressure of private occupations , growing out of a series of most extensive and perplexing commercial speculations , which were of themselves sufficient to engross all // the leisure and faculties of an ordinary man . A few extracts from his diary will exhibit the manner , in which he made the affairs of France his own . Jan. 25th , 1790 . At three o'clock , go to dine with Madame de Stael , who is not yet come in . The Abb*i Sy*yes is here , and descants with much self-sufficiency on Government , despising all that has been said or sung on that subject before him ; and Madame says , that his writings and opinions will form in politics a new era , as those of Newton in physics . May 1st . After dinner , I have a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I show him a note I have made on their situation . He begs me to let him have it , and I give it , but with the injunction , that none but their majesties shall know from whence it comes . I inform him of what has been done with the chiefs of the Jacobins . He tells me how the ministers stand in that respect . He assures me , that they can do nothing with the King , but through him . May 20th . Montmorin tells me , that he considers the assembly as finished , and this gives me a poor opinion of his sagacity . A few days ago , he was in trepidation , but now in a kind of security , both unfounded . He fears , however , yet , for the person of the King . lie says that different people are urging him to do different things , but that he sees nothing to be done . I tell him to remain quiet , for the assembly are now doing every thing they can for the King , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Oct. 1st . Ask M. de Montmorin for my discourse , prepared for the King to deliver on taking the oath to support the Constitution . He promises on his honor to give it me . I desire him to give the King my letter about subsistence . That I care nothing for the event , but it is his duty to lay the matter before his majesty . I ask him , who made the King 's speech , which is excellent . He assures me , that the ground-work is by the King himself . I desire him to make the King observe the difference of effect between this and the long stories , which they made him tell heretofore . He says that he has already done so . Dec. 14th . Inform the Minister of Marine ,  --  M. de MoIleville ,  --  that I have prepared some notes on a Constitution to show him . He says he has sounded the King on the subject , who has commanded him to attend to it . Dec. 21st . The Bishop of Autun observes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise a riot about their address . I tell him , that since the frolic at the Champ de Mars , there is little danger of riots , because the people are not very fond of them , when they find that death is a game which two can play at . He // says that the King is in wondrous high spirits , since his vetos have gone off easily , and that he will apply them every now and then . Poor King ! Jan. 22d , 1791 . This morning prepare for my departure . Vic d'Azyr , the Queen 's physician , comes in , and tells me that he has been to my lodgings at the request of her majesty , to desire , if I learn any thing in England interesting to them , that I would communicate it . ' The journey here alluded to , was on the occasion of a visit to London ; where he had been but a few days , before he received intelligence of his appointment as Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at the court of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes had long been fixed ; but it was not obtained without serious opposition . His communication with the French Minister in London , which has been already mentioned ; the ill-success attending his attempt at negotiation there ; and , more than all , his hostility to the revolutionary principle , were urged against him with so much zeal , that his nomination was confirmed by the Senate only by a majority of five . General Washington thought it necessary , in a private letter , to intimate to him the propriety of greater circumspection ; and his advice was not lost upon Mr. Morris . It is needless to say , that the charges brought against him , so far as they were well founded , involved no imputation upon his character ; they only proved , that he occasionally overstepped the limits of prudence , while following the suggestions of his warm and independent feelings . From this time , he seems to have resolved to interfere no farther in French affairs , than his official duty might require ; but he considered it asa part of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was now divested even of the shadow of authority . A scheme was concerted between him and several others , for the removal of the royal family from Paris , and arrangements were made , which promised to ensure the success of the enterprise ; but , on the morning fixed for their departure , the unfortunate monarch , no less irresolute in adversity than he had been feeble in his prosperous fortunes , renounced the project , and it was of necessity abandoned . He afterwards sent , however , his thanks to Mr. Morris for his counsels , expressing at the same time his deep regret that he had not followed them . But the fatal 10th of August came , when all farther aid was unavailino* indeed the personal sittiation of Mr. Morris was such , as completely to engross his // 48* April , time and thoughts . The Girondists were sinking beneath the furious attacks of the Jacobins , though not yet wholly subject to their influence ; but it can not be supposed , that even the Girondists regarded the American Minister with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been instructed to negotiate loans to discharge a portion of our debt to France , and large sums were lying in the hands of the bankers of the United States in Holland , which might he devoted to that purpose . When Mr. Morris was accredited as Minister , the former gentleman considered his agency in this business at an end ; but no instructions relating to the subject had been communicated to Mr. Morris . It was , however , agreed between them , that a payment should he made . Before this could be done , the King was suspended , and the old government destroyed . By the advice of Mr. Morris , Mr. Short , notwithstanding his doubts of the propriety of such a measure , was induced to complete the payment of the amount in question , to the French Executive Council ; but the transaction was so far from meeting with the approbation of our Government , that they ordered all further payments to be at once suspended . The Executive Council were anxious to induce our Government to pay an additional portion of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing provisions for the inhabitants of St. Domingo ; a part of it having been already paid in this manner . This was objected to by Mr. Morris , on the ground of his want of authority , an objection , which was treated by the Council as idle and evasive ; and their tone at length became so violent and insulting , that he was induced to demand his passports , with the view of leaving the country . Finding their menaces ineffectual , they at length wrote him a letter , which was designed as an apology , and his intention was relinquished . But violence and insult were reduced to system , by the French Government of that eventful period . Depredations were continually made upon our commerce , of which the Minister was compelled to complain and demand reparation , without success . In addition to this neglect of the Government of France , he was harassed with the murmurs of our own citizens , to whom he was unable to afford any effectual aid . The Republic at length solicited his recall , by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that original diploinatist had compelled our own Government to demand . The request was , from motives of policy , complied with by Washington . // Mr. Sparks is of opinion , that Mr. Morris was not particularly gratified with this proceeding , as no complaint of any description had been previously urged against him , and he had certainly conducted himself with great firmness and dignity under very difficult circumstances ; but the portions of his diary and correspondence , which are given in these volumes , express no other feeling than that of satisfaction , at being relieved from a harassing and thankless office . It was his first intention to return to the United States ; but he altered this determination , and passed the seven following years in Europe , fixing his residence for the most part at Altona , but travelling often to visit the most interesting courts and countries . We are not at liberty to follow him in all his various journeys , and must confine ourselves to a few brief extracts from his diary , to give some impression of the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are one or two circumstances , however , which present his character in a light so favorable , that we can not suffer them to pass unnoticed . Lafayette , as every one knows , when the Constitutional party in France had been borne down hy the violence of the Jacobins ) attempted to find refuge in flight , and was thrown into the prison of 01 .. mutz . This happened before Mr. Morris was recalled ; and it need hardly he said , that he forgot all former differences of sentiment , in his anxiety for the welfare of his old and valued friend , and used all the exertions in his power to procure his release . He prepared a letter to be addressed by Madame de Lafayette to the King of Prussia , in which he vainly appealed to those sentiments of magnanimity and honor , which this monarch might , by courtesy , be supposed to possess ; directed the banker of the United States to forward to the distinguished prisoner the sum of ten thousand forms , for the payment of which he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thousand livres , from his private fortune . When this lady was brought to Paris and imprisoned , he interested himself warmly in her behalf . He was , however , just retiring from his office , and his efforts were ineffectual to procure her release , though they seem to have partially relieved the horrors of her captivity , and were rewarded by her warm and lasting gratitude . Afterwards , during his visit to Vienna , he endeavored , through Lord Grenville , to interest the British Government in favor of the liberation of Lafayette himself , but in vain . He shad received satisfactory assurances , that their intercession would not prove unavailing . // Early in the Revolution , Mr. Morris had been intimately acquainted with the family of Orleans , who were afterwards involved in poverty and distress . He was in Hamburg , when the intelligence of the destitute situation of the Duke , the present King of the French , was communicated to him by a mutual friend . He immediately sent him money to defray the expenses of his journey to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , offered him every assistance his resources would allow . The Duke , however , altered his intention , and wandered for some time in Europe , until his funds were completely exhausted . Mr. Morris then relieved him , by placing to his credit the sum of fifteen hundred pounds in London ; and , on learning that he had resolved to visit this country , gave him an unlimited credit on his bankers , during the whole period of his residence here . This liberal and active friendship was deeply felt and acknowledged . In a letter addressed to him in 1795 , Louis Philippe says , It is impossible to feel more than I do , the lively concern which you are so kind as to take in my fate ; and I pray you to receive my assurances of the very ardent and sincere affection , with which you inspire me . ' On the occasion of a visit to London , he says in his diary : July 15 , 1795 . This morning at ten , I visit Mr. Pitt . I tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purport of our conversation , it will be best that he should ask me questions . He does so , and I reply to them . Our interview is long , and he is much satisfied with it . I recommend earnestly sending some man with the Count D'Artois , to prevent him from doing foolish things . Ask the parole of Piquet 's sons , which he promises , and to pay them ? 50 a-piece . He asks me my ideas respecting a future Constitution of France , which I avoid giving as much as possible . Some points , however , are examined . ' November 25 . Dress and go to Lord Grenville 's office ; thence to Court . Lord Grenville arrives late . Am presented to the King , who takes me at first for an Englishman ; and not recollecting me , says , " You have been a good while in the country . " We set him right , and Lord Grenville tells his Majesty , that I was not liked by the ruling powers of France . " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , Sir ; and if your Majesty would send thither your discontented subjects , it would do them much good . " " Well , if you 11 contrive it for me , I give my hearty consent . " Lord Grenville adds , " There are enough of them , Sir . " " Oh , aye , quite enough . " " I can give your Majesty good new // from the Continent , " says Lord Grenville , " General Clairfait is still following the French . " " And I , Sir , can give you a piece of intelligence , which I am sure will be agreeable . I am informed from unquestionable authority , that all the lower orders of people in Holland are strongly attached to the Stadtholder . " " AhI that 's good " ( with surprise ) . " Sir , they have always been so . " " Then it is only the aristocratic party which is against him ? " " Just so , Sir . " " Pray , Mr. Morris , what part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near New York , Sir ; I have a brother , who has the honor to be a Lieutenant-General in your Majesty 's service . " " Ah ! what , you re a brother of General Morris ' ? Yes , I think I see a likeness . But you re much younger ? " " Yes , Sir . " " Well , and how does your brother do ? He s at Plymouth , is n't he ? " I afterwards see a petition presented to the King upon his throne , from the University at Oxford . ' Mr. Morris thus relates his interview with the King of Prussia , at Berlin . February 17 , 1797 . I go to Court . The Queen points out to me a young Mademoiselle Reidesel , who was born in America , and christened America . She is a fine girl , and when she comes down the dance , I tell her in presence of her Majesty , that I reclaim my countrywoman . After some time , the King speaks to me , and , when on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the French persist in their present conduct , and drive us to extremities , Spain will not retain an inch of ground in the new world . That his Majesty has a direct interest in such events , and a considerable one . But a ball-room is not a fitting place to discuss such subjects . On the finances of Great Britain , I repeated ( as having already mentioned it to his ministers , ) that the resources of that country are immense . Upon which he observes , that they were so much the more to blame for having attempted to tax us ; and this it was , which led to what I have already noted . After some trifling things , I tell him that I have just seen his best friend . He asks who ? and , to his great surprise , I reply , the Emperor . He speaks of him well , personally ; and I observe that he is a very honest young man ; to which his Majesty replies by asking , Miais , que pensez vous de Thugut ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sire . " I had stated the interest , which makes him and the Emperor good friends , to be their mutual apprehensions from Russia . " But suppose we all three unite ? " " Ce sera un diable de fricase*e , Sire , Si VOUS vous mettez tous les trois a ' casser les wufs . " On the subject of Austria , I tell him they would do very well , if he would lend them a few of his generals . Mais nous en avons besoin pour nous memes . " " Pas a ' present , Sire , vous *tcs en pair . " He finds that , if this conversation continues , he may commit himself , and so pauses . ' // We must pass more rapidly over the events of Mr. Morris 's later years . He returned to his native country in the winter of 1798 , and fixed his residence at his beautiful domain of Morrisania ; having formed the resolution , which has been formed and broken by thousands before him , never again to embark on the tempestuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grounds , and erecting a new and elegant mansion , until he was elected by the Legislature of New York to fill a vacancy in the Senate of the United States , when his previous determination was at once abandoned . Before he took his seat , he exhibited his forensic skill in a cele- - hinted cause in Albany , in opposition to Hamilton , and came off with credit from the encounter ; though the ardor of the conflict occasioned a temporary suspension of their friendly intercourse . He arrived in Washington , while the contest for the Presidency between Mr. Jefferson and Burr was going on . His political prepossessions were in unison with those of the federal party ; but in this instance he differed from them , on the ground , that the public sentiment was evidently favorable to the election of Mr. Jefferson . On the subject of the Louisiana treaty , also , his views were opposed to those of his political friends ; but in general , he took an active and very decided part against the measures of the administration ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful speeches against the repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1799 . His term of office expired in 1803 . From this time , it may be said of his political opinions , that they did not differ very essentially from those of Mr. Ames . He looked upon the course of our national affairs as full of peril ; but his temperament was not , like that of our eminent fellow-citizen , inclined to gloom ; and amidst all his anticipations of evil , there prevailed a tone of encouragement and hope . He was manned in 1816 , to Miss Randolph , of Virginia . It was impossible , however , for a mind like his to remain inactive , though withdrawn from any share in the management of political affairs . For the last six years of his life , he devoted himself almost exclusively to the task of establishing the communication between the river Hudson and lake Erie , the execution of which he was not fortunate enough to see . Many have believed , that he was the first suggester of this great enterprise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify the assertion . They certainly prove , that he is // entitled to share the honors of that distinguished man , to whom the completion of this magnificent work is commonly attributed* He was thus engaged in the most useful public labors , enjoying at the same time the exercise of liberal hospitality , and the means of comfort which an ample fortune could afford him , until a sudden illness , on the 6th of November , 1816 , put a period to his long and valuable life . The person of Mr. Morris is described by his biographer as well-proportioned and commanding . His features were regular and expressive ; and his manners dignified and easy . The traits of his intellectual character may perhaps be most properly inferred , from a contemplation of the sphere in which he acted . It would obviously have been allowed to no inferior mind , at a period when the powers are hardly ripened into maturity , to stand in the foremost rank of that remarkable assemblage of powerful understandings and manly hearts , who guided our country 's destinies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intimate and familiar friend of Washington , and Hamilton , and Jay , and Jefferson , throughout that long period of difficulty and danger , in whose ability as well as moral qualities , their fullest confidence could not be properly reposed . But this is not the only basis , on which his reputation for talent is to rest . Our imperfect delineation of his public labors has sufficiently shown , and the narrative of Mr. Sparks shows still more clearly , that his mind was of a superior order . Its grasp was vigorous , keen , and comprehensive ; its decisions were rapid and unhesitating . If there were any infirmity about it , it was that of too much quickness in forming its conclusions , and of too confident reliance upon its own real power . But this confidence was generally justified by the result ; and the only wonder is , that with his vivid imagination , and almost enthusiastic feeling , it did not betray him more frequently into error . He plunged at once into the mysterious labyrinth of our disordered finances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricacies of the way , and when the subject was not familiar , as it is now . It required talent to trace its perplexities , and independence to bring them to the light . The complicated relations of our country with other nations were comprehended by none more clearly , than by him ; his speculations upon the motives and policy of the cabinets of Europe were always intelligent , and generally just ; and he possessed that knowledge of human character , and that sagacity // to penetrate the secret thought through the disguised countenance , which , had they been unaccompanied by abruptness of manner , and indifference to others , would have left him without many rivals as a diplomatist and statesman . It was not so with his literary taste . His writings on political subjects were full of sententiousness and vigor ; but that portion of them which i-nay be regarded as purely literary ,  --  among which , his oration on the Restoration of the Bourbons is most generally known ,  - -  were not unfrequently disfigured by false ornament , and an ambitious brilliancy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French writers . It was the senate and the bar , to which his eloquence was best adapted ; there , he forgot the propensity to be elegant in the importance of his subject . There were not many orators of his time , who surpassed him in the proper qualities of legislative argument and forensic controversy . We are indebted to Nir . Sparks , for the following apparently impartial delineation df his moral qualities . His acute powers of mind , a thorough consciousness of his own strength , and his quick sense of the ridiculous , joined to a lofty independence of thought , often betrayed him into a forwardness of manner , a license of expression , and an indulgence of his humor , little suited to soothe the pride , or flatter the vanity , or foster the self-love , or win the esteem of those about him . He might dazzle by his genius , surprise by his novel flights of fancy , amuse by his wit , and confound by his arguments , and thus extort the tribute of admiration , but fail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better acquainted with the forms and etiquette of society , none had Ti-loved more widely in the circles of fashion and rank , or examined with a keener scrutiny the deep fountains of the human passions , or knew better how to touch the springs of men 's motives , yet this rare intuition , this more rare experience , and this great knowledge , did little towards modifying the tendencies of his nature , or diverting the first bent of his mind . He was sometimes overbearing in conversation . At any rate , when he spoke , he expected to be heard . There is an anecdote illustrative of this point . At a breakfast table , he was in close conversation with a gentleman , to whose harangue he had listened patiently , till it was his turn to reply . He began accordingly , but the gentleman was inattentive , and a bad listener . " Sir , " said Mr. Morris , " if you will not attend to my argument , I will address myself to the tea-pot , " and went on with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his replication . // But this defect , after all , was only a spot on the surface . It did not penetrate the substance , nor taint any interior feeling . It was in fact no more than the excess of some of the higher qualities , not duly balanced by others , which are little valued or esteemed . It was independence , frankness , self-respect , without the usual mixture of cautious reserve , forbearance , and timidity . It was boldness without hypocrisy , confidence without fear , and dignity without dissimulation . It did not touch the heart . The noble and generous virtues bloomed luxuriantly , and bore rich and abundant fruit . It marred no principle . Justice , truth , charity , integrity , honor , held an uncontrolled empire in his soul , and never lost their influence or authority . We have already expressed our opinion of the manner , in which Mr. Sparks has executed his task ; but we are bound in justice to go farther , and to say , ihat our limits have prevented us from giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative . Some very interesting topics of inquiry , which he has illustrated with much fulness of curious detail , are wholly unnoticed here . In fact , our observations have been confined exclusively to the first volume , which contains the biography of Mr. Morris . The two others are devoted to selections from his correspondence , together with some of his other writings ; among which are three of his speeches in the Senate of the United States , an address to the Assembly of Pennsylvania on the abolition of the Bank of North America , and his Notes on the form of a Constitution for France . We could wish to set before our readers some specimens of the correspondence , because , though almost wholly of a political character , it is full of interest , and displays very clearly some of the most striking characteristics of the author 's mind . But we must refer our readers to the work itself : assuring them , that they will derive both profit and pleasure from the perusal . Our object has only been , without adverting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give them some particulars of the life of a distinguished man , who has never before received the measure of attention , which may justly be considered as his due.
