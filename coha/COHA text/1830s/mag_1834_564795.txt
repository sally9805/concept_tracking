txt THE Lover of Wisdom would not have men fools , when they might be wise . It is true  --  and a truth deeply to be lamented-that , the more sound and sublime his speculations are , the more they are ridiculed as idle fancies by your matter-of-fact men , whose practical notions are wholly at war with all that is speculative , and whose thoughts seldom rise above the solid earth to which they seem chained . Yet even this large class-were they conscious how much of truly practical , worldly wisdom was taught by some speculations of the philosopher-would no longer yield to the popular indifference and popular prejudices . Philosophy searches into the hidden motives , the original principles of the human heart , and must , therefore , be based upon truth ; and yet-strange to say-her most rational deductions are almost uniformly set at nought by men , who profess to act only upon com rnowsense principles . There is , perhaps , no passion of our natures , that has excited so much the laughter and contempt of philosophers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised so controling an influence upon human conduct , as the love of glory . With philosophers , it is a professed ob // ject to discover and lay open the true sources of solid happiness . No wonder , then , that they feel a disgust at seeing men , endowed with the godlike faculty of reason , neglect the exercise of it , and , regardless of their own good , run all their life-time after something which they can never reach , because it exists only in the imagination . But practice has always been opposed to philosophy . Though the sages of antiquity , convinced as they were of the emptiness of human glory , by a careful analysis of it , and by their deep insight into the nature of man , confidently declared , that " All the glory of the world was not worth an understanding man 's holding out his finger to obtain it ; " yet , with the greater part of those , whom history calls the powerful ones of the earth , the love of glory has been , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . This passion throws a false lustre about great characters . The historian , in recounting the distinguished services of some warrior , who fell on the battle-field in defence of his country , deems it a sufficient apology for his worst vices and criminal conduct even , to add , that they were prompted by an unquenchable thirst for glory . Even with regard to the public men of our own day and generation , the statesmen and the men of letters , it may truly be said of more than nine-tenths of them , that they speak , and write , and act from no higher motive , than to have their names repeated with applause throughout the villages and cities of their native land . An inward craving for distinction is , doubtless , a most effective stimulus to intellectual effort . It keeps the mind constantly in a state of active exercise . It arouses and animates the drooping spirit . It excites the ingenuity of the mechanic to his inventions and delicate workmanship , no less than the military ardor of the warrior to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , in the character of the enthusiast . It disposes to that energy of soul , which creates for itself those capabilities that nature may have denied , and insures success to all benevolent efforts for the improvement of our social condition . But then the danger lies in its tendency of being carried to excess . And yet the love of approbation ,  --  though it may lead to evil consequences , when under no wholesome restraint ,  --  is founded upon a principle of our natures given to us for the best of purposes . As we are destined to live in society , we are created with a disposition to love society ; we delight to have friends , with whom we may converse , in whom we may confide , who may sympathize with us in our joys and sorrows . It is natural that we should strive , by uprightness of conduct and high-souled exertions , to preserve their esteem , strengthen their confidence , and enliven their sympathies . The same principle impels us to enlarge the circle of such friends , till our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we regard all those about us as friends , and endeavor to act uniformly with a view to gain their applause . To expect that man will not be influenced at all by the opinion of his fellow-men , is unreasonable . There are those , it is true , who pretend to despise it , by making a ridiculous boast of their independence ; yet , for all this foolish pretence , they are living , however unconsciously , under its all-powerful influence . It is impossible that we should not feel any desire for the good opinions and good wishes of a // society that we esteem , as upon such friendship we are obliged to depend much in our social intercourse ; it is , therefore , acting contrary to nature to profess an utter heedlessness of the world 's opinion . Such a profession is at variance with the best affections of the human heart . A confirmed misanthrope ,  --  one who hates and despises his fellow-beings ,  --  may , perhaps , with some show of consistency , pride himself upon a disregard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , who is a lover of his race , and has a proper , an exalted idea of the dignity of human nature ? One moment 's serious reflection upon our social relations and consequent dependence upon one another , should be sufficient to humble the pride of the haughtiest . Make the man friendless , who boasts of his independence , and he will soon feel the want of an approving smile from some friendly face ; or , let him cast his thoughts back to the time when he came into the world a helpless infant , and reflect how much his present strength of arm and vigor of muscle are owing to the fond and anxious attentions of his parents in the period of infan'cy ,  --  what would then become of his fancied independence ? And it implies , moreover , the veriest inconsistency for the self-styled independent man , to long for " space in the world 's thought ; " since what is called glory , is but an expression of the world 's opinion . " Even those , who write against glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having written well ; and they , who read those writings , wish for the glory of having read them ; perhaps I myself , while writing this sentence , and perhaps he , who shall read it , may have the same desire . " But , as this thirst for approbation increases , and is never satisfied , it becomes an unhealthy appetite ; till at length it fastens upon the mind a consuming disease , from which it can not rid itself . Under its withering influence , are moral purity ? The love of glory , however useful as a stimulus to exertion , is abused , when it is made the end or guiding principle of conduct . It is a passion of too selfish a nature to exist in a pare moral character . And , as the happiness of society is promoted in proportion as individuals are swayed by feelings of natural love and philanthropy , for the same reason social inequalities and evils must increase , in proportion as they act from selfish motives . Is it not , indeed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deed on account of its intrinsic goodness or greatness , and because it will confer happiness upon our species ,  --  than because it will be applauded and bring honor upon ourselves ? We are , at all times , ready to add our voice to the united acclamations of a happy people in praise of one , who has raised himself to an exalted station in public life , and conferred some signal benefits upon his country ; and we should consider it the height of presumption to question the purity of his motives . We see the beneficial tendency of his successful labors for the common weal ; and , perhaps , we are so absorbed with admiration of his talents , or gratitude for his efforts , that we willingly shut our eyes to whatever evils may have flowed in the current of his ambitious spirit . But , however praiseworthy might be his exertions , what respect could we have for his character , if we knew the great directing principle of his soul to // be the love of popular applause ? We condemn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives out of his plentiful store , merely to attract the gaze of the starving and talking world . And how forcibly is the heart impressed with the benevolence of him , who watches , while other eyes are asleep , to relieve the necessities of the poor ! Indeed , as the world is convinced that a man is virtuous , only to gain the tribute of respect universally paid to integrity ; or , that he aspires after greatness for the sake merely of its fleeting honors-they will no longer confide their interests to him , as to an honest citizen and faithful friend . The very essence of virtue is its modesty . And the solid merit , which shuns observation , is no more to be compared with the ostentatious , that seeks to please itself with fair appearances , than the majestic balloon striving to hide its beauty in the clouds , with the empty soap-bubble which hardly rises above our heads , before it vanishes into air . It is often urged by way of apology for the desire of glory as a ruling passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , prompted , and necessarily leads , in fact , to a vigorous exercise of the mind for the good of society . Yet , opposed to this assertion is the speaking fact , that the purest actions , the noblest deeds , which have graced human nature , no less than the sublimest productions of genius , which have shed lustre upon the world , have been the work of men impelled by no such stimulus , as a thirst for glory . Was it not out of a purely disinterested love of his fellow-men , and with an enthusiastic zeal for their well-being , that Howard traveled from place to place , to visit the filthy hovels of the ignorant poor , to comfort their hearts and enlighten their minds , to relieve their miseries , to lighten their burdens , and raise them from a state of degradation ? His name is known throughout the earth , as that of an almost divine philanthropist ; and he merits the distinction ; for his was a heaven-born philanthropy . But who could feel so exalted a respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his good works to be seen and honored of men ? The world will not be satisfied with good works alone , without a corresponding motive ; and the voice of the world harmonizes with that of truth and justice , when it declares  --  the purest principles must always give birth to the most glorious deeds . In the world of Jetters might be cited many illustrious names , which gained an immortality , that was never anticipated ; while thousands , who have written for golden opinions alone , never attained the object of all their hopes and wishes . It is not at all probable , that Shakspeare even dreamed of ever rising to the proud eminence among dramatic writers , which he now holds by the common consent of mankind . While he was a sort of hanger-on at the theatre , he was led to write in part to supply his own pressing wants , and in part the wants of the stage . In his intervals of leisure and poetic inspiration , it was natural for him , indeed , to pour forth the overflowings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes appears to have been , to win the approbation of Queen Elizabeth , or , at most , to hear the ever-changing plaudits of the play-house . He seems to have written for almost any purpose , rather than for fame ,  --  and why may not this be one cause of the superior excellence of his writings , and the homage , every where paid to his character as a poet ? To hear that the spade of an honest , // hard-working laborer unexpectedly struck upon a rich mass of gold , impresses the heart with much more vivid delight , than to hear the same of a miner , whose daily occupation is to dig for it . Certain it is , the writer , who is more in love with prospects of future glory , than with the theme before him , will not bring to light original ideas or new truths , or effect any thing , in short , worthy of glory . For nothing is more opposed to concentration of thought  --  the parent of inventionthan an habitual proneness of the mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . An author may , in the act of writing , be thinking of the manner , in which his works will probably be received by the public ; but the very thought , followed by distraction of mind , by suspense , by agitation , will go far to destroy his energy and intellectual might ; just as the man , who , in his intercourse with the world , is influenced too much by the wavering and warring opinions of his fellow-men , will be wanting in a proper stability of character . But , after all , what is glory-that it should excite the ambition of a wise man ? Is it any thing more than a day-dream  --  a vision of the diseased brain-whose delusive enchantments , serving only to lull and bewilder the senses , are dissolved by the falling shadows of every night ; or , an unreal phantom , pleasing the soul with its spectral mockeries , and then vanishing into air ? Its emptiness is well defined by Pope , when he calls it " a fancied life in others ' breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " a circle in the water . " If all were wise enough to analyze it with the same philosophic spirit , with which Wollaston has done in the following passage , they would regard it in its true light-as a mere word  --  a name  --  a something , That , like a thin chameleon , boards Itself on air . ' A man , " he says , " is not known ever the more to posterity , because his name is transmitted to them ; he doth not live , because his name does . When it is said , Julius Ciesar subdued Gaul , beat Pompey , changed the Roman commonwealth into a monarchy , &amp;c. it is the same thing as to say , the conqueror of Pompey was Cmsar ; that is , Cmsar and the conqueror of Pompey are the same thing ; and Cmsar is as much known by the one distinction as the other . The amount then is only this ; that the conqueror of Pompey conquered Pompey ; or somebody conquered Pompey ; or rather , since Pompey is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a poor business is this boasted immortality ; and such , as has been here described , is the thing called glory among us ! " Even the successful attainment of glory must be unsatisfying to its most devoted lover ; it is not a reality ; it has no substance ; and , though he grasp at it forever , he will grasp at a shadow-lie can never assure himself of its solidity . To have his name pass from mouth to mouth and sounded in the sweet accents of approval , by whom he knows not ; this he imagines to be a sort of extension to his intellectual being , as it is , in the highest degree , exciting to his vain ambition . But the name is no part of himself ; it serves merely as a kind of nucleus , to attract and bring together whatever in him is deserving of remembrance . The name is nothing in itself , that it should command respect ; the existence // of good or noble qualities in the soul  --  the true ornaments of man-may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet these will always remain the same , whatever be the name . Were all mankind actuated by the purest of motives , and free from the control of the baser passions ; that is to say , were this earth the dwelling-place of the virtuous alone ; did they all know and love each other , as if they comprised but a small society of chosen friends ; then , indeed , would there exist some show of reason for being a lover of glory . In one of a noble mind it could awaken none but the holiest affections , and the most pleasing anticipations , to know , when he had devoted the most precious hours of a life to his own improvement and the benefit of his race , that such exertions and benefits would be remembered by all the world-that his motives would not be capable of a double interpretation , because all breasts would be ready to sympathize with whatever was pure and high-minded  --  and that , ages after he had gone to a final resting-place among the dead , his memory would endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while living . But the beings , which the Deity has seen fit to people this our planet with , are of a mixed nature ; they are swayed by evil motives as well as by good affections ; the best , therefore , that can reasonably be anticipated , even by the most sanguine aspirant after fame , is  --  to gain the approbation of a mnajorit* of his fellow-men . Under the influence of different circumstances and different modes of education , they imbibe different humors , tastes , and prejudices ; these lead to diversity of moral character , as well as of ser*itiment ; thus , society becomes little else than a perpetual conflict of opinions . How common a thing is it , in these days of liberalism , to meet with two individuals , equally deserving of confidence , whose views are in direct opposition to each other , and that , too , perhaps , upon a subject of vast importance , and one , which they have both deeply investigated . Whoever , then , would enjoy the good opinion of the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is nearly as great a contradiction in nature , that he should please the fancies of both , as that he should be able to keep his eyes open and *hut at the same moment . It is matter of history , that many authors , who held a foremost rank in the world of literature among their contemporaries , have been little read or hardly remembered after the lapse of a few generations . It is even hazardous-for any but a critic , I mean  --  to venture an opinion upon the merits and future fame of a popular writer of the present day. * The biographerthough of all men he should be the most candid-is seldom without his private partialities and prejudices ; in general , he is either the enthusiastic friend or inveterate enemy of him , , whose life he writes-so that , when we have to depend upon biography for information concerning an individual , who flourished some two or three centuries ago , and was distinguished in his own day and generation , we meet only with opposing statements and contradictory opinions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess our inability to form a correct judgement of his character . As soon as the character of a public man becomes the subject of daily controversy , his reputation is at least doubtful for the time being ; and , when the multitudes about him shall have passed away , what will his glory amount to but a difference of // opinion ; for-judging by the fate of those who have gone before him-he - " will have as oft a slanderous epitaph , As record of fair act ; nay , many times , Doth ill deserve by doing well . ' Would it not be a blessing to him , in such circumstances , to divest himself of all character , or , as that is impossible , to appear in the humble capacity of a private individual , who has this consoling hope , at least-that , though his good qualities be confined to himself , his faults and foibles will be overlooked , and not become a by-word among his fellow-men , when he is no more . To instance  --  the statesman of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public life , whose brain , indeed , is almost distracted by an unnatural , an unhealthy passion for popular applausewhat will be the end of his glory ? Though he possesses the imposing Mualities of a great genius , his principles can not but be infected with the spirit of party ; and , therefore , he will enjoy the confidence of a few only . While his friends laud him to the skies , as a benefactor of his race , worthy of immortal honor , his enemies may despise his boastful pretensions , condemn his principles , and even pronounce him a curse to his country . Now , if we suppose his life to be written both by friend and enemy , what will he be to posterity , but a mass of contradictions ? In the course of two or three generations , his character will be as difficult of interpretation , as a chapter of Egyptian hieroglyphics , or as the pages of some time-worn manuscript of antiquity , which can not suffer the lightest touch of the fingers without crumbling to pieces . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon throw them aside , in despair of converting such worthless stuff to any use , so will posterity be disgusted at the hieroglyphical or fragile character of the statesman of our own times , who may then become the subject of histery . Perhaps all will allow him to have possessed an intellect of very superior order ; and this may be thought no trifling commendation ; but , then , what is it worth , when in the same breath it is said that his principles were of a dangerous tendency-his reputatiGn was doubtful  --  and his splendid talents even were worse than useless , because perverted to bad purposes . In spite of the forced and false respect paid to him while living , what will his unblushing claims to immortality all be worth , compared with the unassuming virtue of the private citizen , whose soul never felt the desire of glory ? It is a singular inconsistency , too , for one who prides himself upon his wisdom and superior genius , who would be ashamed to have any but his best thoughts appear before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those , who are ignorant , prejudiced , or capricious , and therefore incapable of forming a correct judgement . As a private individual , he would openly avow his contempt of their approbation ; and yet he desires the collective approval of those , whose judgement is not founded upon reflection , whose individual favor is confessedly not worth the having ; for such men make up a greater part of the community , whose good opinion he strives to gain . Perhaps a very small fractional part of his fellow-men-qualified by education for // judges in literature-may pronounce a favorable judgement upon his writings ; and their voice , echoed throughout the rest of society , becomes the voice of the public . How can he , upon serious reflection , satisfy himself that his fame is a reality or has any durable foundation , when he knows it to depend upon the approval of thousands , whose approval should be a reproach ? " Is it reasonable , " says Montaigne , " that the life of a wise man should depend upon the judgement of fools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin author " Can any thing be more foolish than to think , that those you despise single , can be any other when joined together ? " And we have the authority of Cicero-himself of all others the most ambitious of gloryfor the opinion , that , " though a thing be not foul in itself , it can not but become so when commended by the multitude . " None but a fool or madman would deck himself in a foul garment , merely because it looked beautiful at a distance . The great folly of being an enthusiastic lover of glory lies in the vain hope of expecting to survive ourselves , and in letting the present moment fly from us , while the mind is intensely fixed upon the uncertain future , or , in the concise language of Pascal , " in never living , but always hoping to live . " The great evil lies in its tendency to make us over-anxious about the opinions of our fellow.men , to weaken our judgement , to destroy our firmness and intellectual vigor . The truly high.minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be , as what they are . A proud consciousness of inward strength never fails to inspire a love for the loftiest exertions . The man who is stimulated to action only by a passion for glory , is no better than a fop , whose thoughts are wholly bent upon dress and outward appearances , that may attract the stare of the multitude . Montaigne showed the true spirit of a philosopher , when he said- " I care not so much what I am in the opinion of others , as what I am in my own . I would be rich of myself , and not by borrowing . " Indeed , it is the business of a life for one to learn , by observation and reflection , to form an opinion for himself , amid when to distrust his own opinion . To be able to do this aright , should be the highest glory of him , who would feel conscious of a mighty power within . T. II.               @ @ @ @ @ @
