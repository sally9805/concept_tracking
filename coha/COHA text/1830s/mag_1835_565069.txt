txt WE come suddenly upon the lake , without having any previous view of it . It is beautifully situated among the mountains , which retire gently from its shores , and leave room for numerous villages and towns , along the margin and on the hill-side . At Bareno , we hired a boat , to make an excursion on the lake , and visit some of the islands . The first we went to , war the Isola Madre . It is a beautiful garden , with a small country-house upon it - rich with various plants and fruits , and commanding a fine view of the lake . From this , we went to the Isola Bella , which is occupied by the palace and gardens of the count Borromeo . The palace is a vast edifice , where we wandered through a labyrinth of magnificent saloons , lofty and spacious , opening into each other , adorned with paintings , statues , and rich furniture ; the floors of mosaic , and the ceiling and waIls painted in fresco . On one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the balconies , projecting from the windows , overhang its waters . A delightful freshness prevailed there ; and , as I roamed through the halls , I drew happy omens of what I was yet to see in Italy , when so superb a monument of taste and art met me on the very threshold . The garden is rich with various plants , of every clime and country ; hut I was most interested by two laurel trees , of immense size , said to he the largest in Europe . In the shade of these trees , Napoleon dined , the day before the battle of Marengo . While at dinner , the plan of the battle was brought him ; and , having examined it , he got up and cut the word battaglia on one of the trees . I saw the place where he had cut the letters , but they have been effaced by British travelers . I gathered a leaf from the tree , as a memorial of the place . Resuming our way , we traveled all the day along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sesto Calende , on the frontiers of Lombardy . The next morning , having parted from my companion , I continued my journey , alone , toward Milan . Crossing th' river Ticino , by a magnificent bridge , of white stone , I entered // the fertile province of Lombardy . Everything appeared verdant and flourishing ; for , although months had passed without rain , still the fields had been preserved green and fresh by turning aside numerous streams , and thus overflowing them - a thing easily done , in so level a country . This added much to the beauty of the country : little rivulets were flowing in every direction over the meadows , and leaped along the road-side ; and the sound was refreshing in this hot weather . Towards night , J arrived at the gate of the city ; and winding through a labyrinth of streets - which would have puzzled Dedalus himself- and passing many a palace , church , and square , at length rested at the door of my hotel . The first thing was , to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one having a subterranean passage for the water . The houses also , in general , are very handsome - having a large court in the centre , and their floors of stone ; the rooms , also , are lofty and well aired . My attention , however , was soon attracted to the magnificent cathedral , called the eighth wonder of the world , ' and said to be the finest church in Italy , after St. Peter 's . It is an immense gothic pile of white marble , in the form of a cross , covered with sculpture and rich ornaments . Imagination can hardly conceive the work , which has been lavished upon this glorious building every part is rich with ornament ; beautiful statues rest on every projection ; its hundred of spires are crowned with them - and the idea of the labor and cost of this work of centuries , is truly astounding . The interior is not less magnificent . The eye seems hardly to reach the lofty , fretted ceiling ; the rich marble of the shrines , the colossal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime and solemn windows , of stained glass , are all befitting the house of God . Beneath the floor of the cathedral , is the chapel of San Carlo Borromeo , the patron Saint of the city - the most magnificent structure of the kind in the world . It is a chamber , whose ceiling and walls are composed chiefly of silver and gold . The roof is a richly embossed plate of pure silver , studded with gold . Large pannels , composed of silver and gold , in basso-relievo , of exquisite workmanship - representing the various events in the life of the Saint - adorn the sides of the chamber . These pannels are supported by beautiful pilasters , of pure silver - between which , is the richest stuff of cloth of gold . On a marble altar , at one end of this glittering chamber , reposes the body of the Saint , in a sarcophagus of crystal , enclosed within another , of massive silver , richly ornamented with gold . The weight of silver thus used is immense ; but the workmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most interesting places Ii have visited in this beautiful city , are the palace of Brera , and the Ambrosian library - each of which contains some very valuable paintings , by the first masters . I was gratified by finding in the gallery of Brera the original of that beautiful piece , by Raffacile , the marriage of the Virgin , of which I had seen many engravings and copies . But the piece which afforded me most pleasure , in this gallery , was one by Guercino da Cento , representing the dismissal of Hagar and her child by Abraham . The eye turns from the figure of Sarah , scornful as it is , and from the venerable countenance of the patriarch , to contemplate the surpassing beauty of Hagar . There is something superb and almost superhuman in her face . No trace of voluptuousness , or passion - unless it be pride - is there discoverable ; all is spiritual . She bows to the will of the old man , as to the decree of fate ; deep sorrow rests on her countenance , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received ; perhaps there may be traced the intensity of rage , repressed alone by the majestic presence of the patriarch : but , withal , the beauty of the woman is so perfect , so intellectual , so glorious , that I never can forget it . I saw many other very superb paintings here ; but , were I to attempt describing them , my labor would be too great , and the details tedious . In the Ambrosian library , I saw the famous Cartoon , ' by Raffaelle ; the School of Athens , ' and several beautiful paintings of Titian 's . Among other curiosities , the librarian showed me the copy of Virgil , owned by Petrarch - and on the cover of which , he has written , with his own hand , the story of his love . Another manuscript was showed me , of very early date . It was more than a thousand years old . I spent nearly a week in this magnificent city , during which time I visited many temples and palaces , which mock at description . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is so much wealth and splendor in the world . I can not attempt to give an account of all I have seen or am seeing . I visited one painting , however , in Milan , so famous that it would be an unpardonable omission not to speak of it . I refer to the painting , by Leonardo da Vinci , of the Last Supper . ' Engravings of this , are seen in almost every house in America ; and I was well pleased to behold the original . In a long room , belonging to an ancient convent , now used as a barrack for Austrian troops , I found this famed piece . It is painted in fresco , and extends entirely across one side of the room . Time and the rude hand of man have done much to dim and deface this superb work ; yet its beauty is still great . The faces are umajured , except that the colors are not so bright as at a former period . From Milan I took a carriage for Venice - the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the view of the mountains , to the north , gave variety and additional beauty to the scenery . The first town of any size , which I passed on the route , was Brescia - originally built by the Gauls , in the early ages of Rome , but since , many times destroyed . The most interesting object in the city , was the ruins of an ancient temple , built by the Romans , in the seventy-second year of our era , and consecrated to Vespasian . I was pre-determined not to like it ; for a foolish xvhim came into my head , at the moment , that this admiration for Roman relics was all a piece of affectation , or an antiquary 's dream . With a feeling of proud superiority , I went to the spot ; the gate was opened - and , for the first time in my life , I gazed on a classic ruin . The lofty and spacious platform , of white marble , with the noble flight of steps , all of which belonged to the portico of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose the columns which had anciently supported the roof . These were of white marble , of immense size , and elegantly sculptured : one alone remained entire . Th* ground around , and the floor of this portico , were thickly strexved with the fallen remnants of this superb edifice . Beautiful Corinthian capitals and entablatures , of white marble , exquisitely carved , lay in wild confusion on every side . I entered the building which has been erected on the floor of the ancient temple , to preserve the more precious relics discovered here . The pavement is of rich mosaic ; the walls covered with inscriptions ; altars and tombs stood around me ; and in the centre of the apartment was a statue of Victory , in bronze , found on the spot , and in fine preservation . As I gazed on these relics of the magnificence of the Romans , and read the inscriptions in their noble language , as I contemplated , above all , the exquisite form and the superb face of the goddess , the spirit of the place penetrated my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship this glorious emblem of a nation that had conquered the world . The very dust under my feet seemed sacred - and I retired , with a feeling even of remorse , for the absurd idea under which I had entered these precincts . From Brescia , I rode to Desanzano - a small village on the borders of the lake , which the ancients called Bernacus , now Lago di garda . This is one of the most beautiful lakes in Italy : the mountains , which surround it , in some places rise boldly from the water , and again receding , leave room for numerous pretty villages , along the shore . The lake is easily troubled by a slight breeze ; and if we may believe Virgil , it was the same in his day . He saysFluctibus et fremitu assurgens Benace marino , ' // I bad a little specimen of this uncommon irritability , the night I spent on its shores . The hotel , in which I lodged , arose partly from the water which flowed under my window . The day had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , clouds came up , with thunder and lightning , and sudden gusts of wind . The little lake was soon chafed into fury ; and the noise of its waves , dashing against the shore , awakened me . I arose and looked out ; the night was intensely dark , but the flashes of lightning , in quick succession , shed a brilliant glare upon the lake , and showed its waters , crested with foam , glittering and sparkling under the intense light . The next morning , when II arose , all was bright and calm . The lake was slumbering , as if wearied with its efforts ; and , as I rode along the shore , the sun was reflected , in dazzling rays , from its glassy surface . A few hours ' traveling brought me to the city of Verona , which would have been interesting , had it no other claims , as being the scene of that beautiful tragedy , Romeo and Juliet - my favorite , among Shakspeare 's master-pieces . The city is large , and , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall and moat . One of the most interesting buildings in the city ,  --  is a Roman amphitheatre , supposed to have been constructed in the time of IDomitian or Trajan . What most surprised me , in looking at this work , was its enormous size . lit is in very perfect preservation , with the exception of an outer arcade , which originally surrounded the whole , but which has been nearly destroyed by an earthquake . The interior of the building , the voinitories , the passages and stairways , and the cells , in which the wild beasts were confined , remain precisely as they were when first erected . The very vastness of the place gives it an air of solitude and desolation : the crevices , between the stones , are overgrown with weeds and rank grass ; and lizards and other reptiles are seen creeping about the walls . A small portion has been applied to the purpose of a modern theatre , of which the stage , built in the arena , fronts upon a small section of the seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken up , for stables , shops , and even dwelling-houses ; and thus a whole colony has gathered around these walls , and found a resting place in their nitches . The whole edifice seems , indeed , as if it had been intended for a larger race of beings than those who now inhabit it . I mu* , t not forget to speak of a beautiful painting , by Titian , which I saw in the cathedral , and which is regarded as one of the finest works of that great master . That I remember it among the many I have seen , is a proof , at least , of the impression it made upon me . Wearied , with gazing on paintings which represent , but too well , the sufferings of our Saviour and of the martyrs , my eyes reposed upon this exquisite piece , with delight . // It is the Assumption of the Virgin . ' A marvelous light bursts forth from Heaven , and beams upon the forms of those surround*. ing the sepulchre , and irradiates their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgin reposes in the clouds above them , looking down upon her friends ; and thus it is managed that the light , from the sky , rests upon her form , but not upon her face . Her countenance is surpassingly beautiful - beaming with an expression of peace , mildness , and immortal happiness ; it is not pleasure which is expressed ; it is serenity - a consciousness of meriting and a certainty of possessing Heaven . One pilgrimage remained for me , before leaving Verona ; and I determined to accomplish it . This was to visit the tomb of Juliet . My conductor assured me it was not worth seeing - that it was a long distance , outside the walls ; and , after all , was nothing but a paltry stone . Feeling more capable , however , of judging of these matters myself , I insisted upon going . Accordingly , we sallied forth . On the way , the guide showed me the house of the Capulets - an ancient and lofty structure , with gothic windows , but much decayed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered a long and solitary lane , which conducted to an ancient building , once a Franciscan convent . We entered the part which was once a church , but now , alas ! reduced to a barn : nothing indicated its ecclesiastic character but a few paintings , in fresco , which still rest on the wall . On one side was a large empty sarcophagus , raised on a platform of stone , just as it had been placed in the church ; the lid had been carried away or broken to pieces , and the body removed , or had entirely perished . But the pen of Shakspeare has immortalized the spot ; and I felt , as I stood there , how true it is , that The beings of the mind are not of clay : Essentially immortal , they create And multiply in us a brighter ray , And more beloved existence . ' I must not forget to mention the mausoleum of the Scaliger family , which is raised in the very centre of the city . There are several monuments , the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborately sculptured . I have seen engravings of it in some of our annuals . This family , which numbers in its ranks the great philosopher of that name , was one of the most noble in Verona : on the coat-of-arms is seen the ladder , from which the family name is derived . Vespasian , Titus Domitian , Catullus , Cornelius Nepos , were also natives of Verona . I went next to Vicenza  --  a magnificent city , filled with palaces and public edifices , erected after the designs of the great architect , Palladio , who was born there . Among the most remarkable , was the Olympic theatre , belonging to the Academy of // Vicenza . It was erected by Palladjo , whose intention was , to give an idea of an ancient theatre . The part intended for the spectators is arranged in rows , rising like steps above each other , like the Roman theatres , with the exception of not being divided into cunel : a small gallery , similar to those of the ancient theatres , rises above the two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , * which occupies about one half of the building , is the proscenium ; then the stage , which is nothing but a continuation of the proscenium , divided from it , however , by a wall , which rises to the whole height , and is only opened by three large arches , displaying the stage , arranged , like the streets of a city , with immovable scenery . The theatre is rich in statuary , and the architecture is very fine . As a model of those of Greece and Rome , it was highly interesting . There are many beautiful situations in the vicinity of Viceaza , as the city is surrounded by hills , which command extensive prospects over the rich plains of Lombardy . I ascended a hill , which is surmounted by the convent of the Madonna del Monte . An arched gallery , or piazza , opening on one side , and said to be a mile in extent , conducts from the foot of the hill up to the convent ; but the view from the summit is so fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascent . Under your feet lies the fair city , with its walls and gates and streets of palaces . Every hilltop is crested with some beautiful mansion - the country villa of the Vicentian nobility ; and the fertile garden of Lombardy encompasses the whole . At a short distance from the convent , I remarked that master-piece of Paladio 's , the famous Casa di Capra . I can conceive of nothing more perfect than the proportions of this exquisite building . It is rectangular , surmounted with a dome , somewhat in the style of the middle portion of the new market , in Boston . On each side is a portico , with a pediment resting on fine Corinthian columns ; and the roof is adorned with statues . The beauty of the situation - which is a slight elevation , commanding a view on all sides - adds to the charm of the edifice , upon which the eye seems to repose , and gather strength as it looks . From Vicenza , I proceeded to Padua , where I arrived after a short ride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forlorn appearance ; grass is growing in many of the streets , and everything indicates decayed grandeur . There are many magnificent palaces and churches , however , which I did not fail to visit . I went first to the palace of Justice , to see the great saloon where justice was administered , in the days of the independence and power of the city . It is one of the largest rooms , unsupported by columns in the world . I think it is exceeded only by the one at Westminster , through which I passed , to enter the House of Commons . The walls are painted in fresco , by Giotto ; but the // work is much faded and indistinct - splendor , perishing and on the wane , is the chief characteristic of the whole apartment . The most interesting object there , was a monument to the meinory of Livy , which is surmounted by an antique bust , said to he a likeness of the great historian . In the year 1413 , some laborers were digging in the garden belonging to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lead , enclosing another , of cypress wood , which was declared , by antiquarians , to be that of Livy . Among other reasons assigned for this belief , was , that Livy bad been a priest of the goddess of Concord ; and it is known that the Abbey was built on the spot where the temple once stood . The coffin was finally deposited in the town-hall , and the monument , I have made mention of , raised above it . I did not for , et the University , so famous in its day . The building which now remains , was commenced in the year 1493 , and finished in 1552- a strange-looking edifice , containing a rectangular court , with a portico and gallery extending the whole length of each side , profusely , though somewhat quaintly ornamented . The sciences seem to have been cultivated here , rather than literature ; and there are excellent collections of scientific books and apparatus . The most splendid churches I visited were those of St. Antomo and Santa Justina . The former is very spacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The painting , in fresco , by Giotto , is very interesting , as exhibiting the commencement of the revival of the art . It would be impossible for me to describe all the riches of sculpture and painting I saw in these churches it seems as if the world had not been in existence long enough to produce so many : yet , every church has its sepulchral monuments , exquisitely carved , and wrought in marble - its bassreliefs , in marble or bronze , or its master-piece of painting , by some great artist . I had now arrived at the last of a most interesting succession of cities , which extend the whole length of the plain of Lombardy - all rich in edifices , in works of art , and historical legend . The general characteristics of these cities are the same . Each is surrounded by a wall and fosse , and strongly fortified : the walls are bastioned at each angle , and the ditches wide and deep , with scarps and counterscarps of masonry ; the gateways generally defended by demilunes : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently toward the plains . These cities are fortified after the old system of the celebrated Vauban , and some of them - Capua , Verona , and others - places of great strength . Being situated on level plains , and the streets narrow and irregular , it is extremely difficult for a stranger to find his way to any object of interest in them - more especially if he is ignorant of the language . An air of desolation and // decay reigns throughout them all ; and , though many of them appear husy and crowded - having actually a considerahie cornmerce - there is this appearance of the former glory and splendor of better days , and of present decay and ahandonment , in them all the splendid palaces , that brace the principal streets , seems to he tenantless and falling to ruin ; everything speaks a silent , but melancholy language - that the prosperity and happiness of these beautiful cities has passed axvay ; and that a foreign tyrant controls their destinies , with an iron grasp . The same appearance of decay is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially hetween Padua and Venice.
