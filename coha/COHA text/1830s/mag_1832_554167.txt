txt We never have had the honor of an intimacy with our fellowcreatures of the insect race ; and have occasionally found their personal attentions so troublesome , that we should have been willing to drop their acquaintance altogether . Since this may not be , and we must tolerate them , whether we like their company or not , we feel grateful to those , who by their patient and searching investigations , discover the habits and characters of these creatures , which , though they have much to reward attention , have but few attractions to invite it . We can understand the passion which leads such men as Audubon and Nuttall to encounter the evils of solitude , hardship , and privation , and to feel well rewarded by the discovery of a new bird or flower , better than the self-devotion of such men as R*aumur to the study of the insect race , the greater proportion of which seem like an unlovely rabble , having few claims upon the gratitude or affection of man . But our hasty impressions on this subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these philosophers have opened golden mines of discovery in this unpromising soil , and unfolded some of the most striking evidences of divine wisdom ever presented to man , in this part of the creation , on which many will not dare or deign to look . They have not labored , however , wholly without reward ; for the curious facts , made known by Huber and many others , have awakened a general interest in the subject ; it is now embraced within the demands of education ; it is used also by friends to human improvement , to inspire a general thirst for knowledge , which , once inspired , easily directs itself to the channels in which it can move to most advantage . It is important to take care , that the popular demand for information shall be well supplied . There is some cause to apprehend , that popular works shall be manufactured for the booksellers , which , like the broth sometimes provided for the poor in cities in seasons of famine , shall answer the double purpose of satisfying their hunger for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to apply again . These works , however , are not of adescription to strengthen these fears . They appear to have been prepared for the Library of Entertaining Knowledge , by the English naturalist , Mr. Rennie , whose reputation is generally known . His favorite maxim is , that Natural History must be studied , not in human abridgements and compilations , but in the great book of Nature . This plan of field-study requires , to be sure , more earnestness and diligence than every one possesses ; it is not every one , either , who has leisure or advantages of situation for pursuing it ; still he is doubtless right in saying , that the study of books is apt to be a study of words and not of things , and that a few facts , learned from personal observation , will inspire more interest and enthusiasm , than the study of books for years . His remarks probably are meant to point out the proper education for a naturalist ,  --  for one who is to enter deeply into the subject ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to be wholly uninformed , must , from the necessity of the case , take the observations of others upon trust . They will easily persuade themselves to submit to this necessity , if all the authorities upon which they are compelled to rely , are as entertaining and instructive as the author of the works before us . We observe that Mr. Rennie , like other entomologists , Linna*us among the rest , has thought it necessary to maintain the dignity of the study . There is no great necessity for filing this protest against the common feeling , which arises from ignorance , and disappears as fast as the means of making themselves acquainted with this subject have been offered to the world . There is something sufficiently comic in seeing a roan holding forth , with the eloquence of Cicero , upon the wonders and beauties of an insect 's xving ; we are struck with the physical disproportion between the investigator and his subject ; but we do not doubt , all the while , that he has found something fully worthy the attention of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect , and playful satire with which no one needs feel insulted . There is no great malice in such ridicule as this , and it is rather forbearing than otherwise , when it is considered what language the enthusiasts in the science have sometimes used . One of the most distinguished among them was so lost in // rapture at contemplating the evolutions of a party of insects upon the wing , that they reminded him of nothing less than seraphs and sons of light , shining in the glories of their heavenly state ; a comparison quite too lofty for the occasion , and one which the most ambitious insect would confess was quite beyond his pretensions . Apart from the disposition which men have to exalt their favorite pursuit , it is well known that the spirit of philosophical investigation , whether it directs itself to beast , bird , or flower , or , as is generally the case , includes them all , is one which is seldom found , except in enlightened and active minds . It affords to such minds a pursuit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its higher efforts requiring intellectual exertion sufficient to recommend it to great men , as a field in which their powers may be worthily and religiously employed . The advantage of supplying means of happiness to men is not generally understood ; and yet , in ordinary circumstance* , whatever makes men happier makes them better ; a fact which has hitherto been strangely overlooked by moralists , but now begins to be regarded as one of the most important principles of moral reform by those who would root out prevailing vices , and supply men with those inducements and encouragements , without which they will do nothing even for their own welfare . Most men are driven to lawless pleasure by vacancy of mind ,  - -  hy the torture of a mind , preying upon itself for want of foreign nwerials to act upon ; and as learning has been regarded as quite beyond the common reach , none but minds highly cultivated , or very energetic by nature , have been able to find a sufficient number of worthy objects to engage them . Action is as important to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great master of the art ; actioI ) the mind must have , right or wrong ; it is well if it can find ways in which its activity may be exerted without running to waste or bringing injury to itself or others , and whoever points out such ways , not to the enlightened few only , hut makes them so plain , that all the world can see them , deserves to be regarded as the greatest reformer of popular vices , because he destroys the root of the evil , while others have been laboring without success upon the branches , which spring again with new vigor , as fast as they are hewn away . Even when the mind is most inactive , an action , though not voluntary , is going on in it , which tends fast to its injury and corruption ; its calm , like // that of the waters , if it endure for any length of time , becomes stagnation ; and this is a danger to which men are the more exposed , because the mind never seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is thinking of nothing at all . Cowper has well described the solemn aspect of the dreamer , gazing upon the evening fire , looking as if he were deliberating upon the fate of nations , while nothing that deserves to be honored with the name of a thought , passes through his mind for hours together . So , too , in a solitary walk , which is generally supposed to be so favorable to thought , the mind gives itself up to reverie , without exerting itself to any good purpose . Now , if the naturalist can make men attentive and observant ,  --  if he can make them note the construction and contrivances of insects , in which instinct seems sometimes to surpass intelligence in the skill and success of its operations ,  --  if he can make them regard the beauty of the delicate flower , which they used to crush beneath their feet , or induce them to listen to the song and observe the plumage of the bird , which formerly , if not a good shot , ' was nothing to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enjoyment , and secure to his favorite sciences the benefit of many useful facts and observations . Insects are now a formidable body , and were much more so in former times , when their habits and persons were less familiarly known . Men had not begun to ask whence they came , nor whither they were going ; but they found them when they least desired their company , and there was a sort of mystery in their movements , which , more than any thing else , tends to inspire the feeling of dread . It was on this account that they were first distinguished by the name of bug , which , however it may have degenerated into a watchword of contempt at the present day , was formerly synonymous with ghost or spectre , and equally alarming . The passage of scripture from the Psalms , Thou shalt not nede to be afraide of any bug by night , ' as it stood in Matthews 's old English Bible , is probably known to our readers . Later translators have judiciously substituted a more general word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to destroy our peace , there is some reason to fear them , and were there nothing else formidable about them , their numbers are sufficiently alarming . When we hear their concert on a summer evening , it sounds as if every leaf and every blade of grass had found a voice ; though , in fact , there is no voice in the matter . They deal // wholly in instrumental music ; some have heard a voice-like sound proceeding from a moth occasionally , but their concert ,  - -  great nature 's hum ,  --  is produced by rubbing the hard shells of the wings against the trunk or together , which makes a sharp and shrill sound , that can be heard at a considerable distance . The hum of insects on the wing can be heard when the performer is invisible . We remember , that once standing in a summer day on the top of a high hill , we heard a sound as of a million bees directly over our head , when not an insect , which could be held responsible for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not uncommon , and the only explanation is , that the authors of the sound are distant , and its loudness deceives us into the impression that it is nigh . We will suggest some advantages of an acquaintance with this subject ; we mean a general acquaintance , such as popular works are calculated to give . For example , the insect called the death-watch was formerly thought to sound an alarm of death to some inmate of the mansion where it was heard , though it would have required a perpetual cholera to have fulfilled half the number of his predictions . Now , it is known to proceed from a little wood-boring insect , whose skull is somewhat hard , and who uses it for the purpose of a signal to others . Standing on its hind legs , it beats regularly on the board a number of times ,  --  a process , which , comparing its force with the size of the insect , one would think more likely to be fatal to itself than to those who hear it . The bug , so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' when it was first imported into England , occasioned equal dismay ,  --  an alarm not wholly superstitious and unreasonable , when we remember how often it has murdered the sleep ' of the innocent as well as the guilty . If we may believe David Deans , the Scotch bewail its introduction among them as one of the evils of the Union , and for that reason distinguish it by the name of the English bug . The history of the Hessian fly , which made its appearance at the close of the American war , and which certain aged people , believing it to be a consequence of our separation from the British Govemment , named the Revolution fly , shows how much alarm and trouble ignorance of the character of a little insect may occasion . They first appeared in Staten Island , and spread rapidly , destroying the wheat upon their way . They passed the Delaware in clouds , and swarmed like the flies of Egypt , in every place where // their presence was unwelcome . The British , naturally disliking every thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should reach their island , and resolved to prevent it , if necessary , with all the power of their fleet . The privy council sat day after day ; despatches were sent to all the foreign ministers ; expresses were sent to the custom-houses to close the ports ; Sir Joseph Banks , who held such matters in special charge ,  --  as Swift said Mr. Flamstead was once appointed by Government to look after the stars ,  --  was called upon to exert himself , with such importunity , that if such a thing were possible , he grew almost profane upon the occasion . He shouted across the ocean to Dr. Mitchell , while the Doctor stood wringing his hands upon the western shore . When he had collected all the information which could be furnished by scientific and practical men concerning the hug in question , amounting to more than two hundred octavo pages , he enlightened the Government with the information , that he did not know what the creature was ; a report satisfactory as far as it went , no doubt , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to somewhat smaller dimensions . If any one could have furnished a scientific description of the insect , it might have been probably arrested in its depredations , and if not , there would have been some consolation to men , could they have pointed it out to the indignation and scorn of the world . Our cultivators can furnish illustrations enough of the evils of ignorance on this subject . The common locust , robinia pseudacacia , whose velvet leaf exceeds other foliage in beauty , as much as its wood exceeds that of other trees in value , is almost ruined in New-England by the larva of a moth , which is known to naturalists , but which no means have yet been able to destroy . We know that in plantations lately made , the ravages of the insect have been confined to their sunny borders ; but we greatly fear , that in a year or two , they will carry their inroads into the heart of the groves . Certainly , the fine trees of this description which fringe the highways and surround the cottages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as we know at present , will only cease from its labors on condition of being cut in two . The cankerworm , too , is waging a war of extermination upon our fruit trees . After passing the winter in the ground ,  --  would that it were its grave ,  --  the insect makes over the tree to its heirs , which can only , with our present knowledge he checked by means , that like curinu // the head-ache by amputation , are too effectual for the end proposed . Pear orchards resemble the gardens of the French nobleman , mentioned by Madame de Sta*il , which were planted with dead trees in order to inspire contemplation ; not knowing enough of the borer to be able to bring him to justice , the cultivator can only sigh over his more than lost labors . But for Dr. Franklin , it would have been more common than it is now , and the practice is by no means obsolete , for every family to supply itself with moschettoes by keeping large open vessels of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this insect , whose bark and bite are equally undesirable . The moschetto lays its eggs upon the water , where they are hatched into grubs , which float with their heads downward ; when the time for their change is come , they break through their outer covering and draw themselves out standing upright , so that they appear like a vessel , the corslet being the boat , and the body officiating as mast and sail . Their former sea-change is now reversed ; for , should their naval establishment overset , they are inevitably lost mosehettoes . As soon as their wings are dried , they fly away to their work of blood . As six or seven generations are born in a summer , and each mother can furnish two hundred and fifty eggs , it is evident that a vessel of water , properly neglected , will people the air of a whole neighborhood . But there is no end to the list of evils , arising from ignorance on this subject . One of the choicest specimens of it we have ever heard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bury grubs in order to destroy them , a mode of destruction quite as fatal , as that of throwingfish into the water to drown them . It would be easy to give some striking illustrations of the advantages of knowledge on this subject . The manner in which peach trees are secured from the depredations of the insect which every year destroys many , is familiarly known . The insect deposits its eggs in the bark of the tree , as nearly as possible to the surface of the ground . When it is obliged to resort to the branches , besides that it is more easily discovered by the gum which flows from the wound , the grub would generally be arrested by the cold before it could make its way to the root , where it retreats in winter . By ascertaining the time when these eggs are laid , and tying straw or matting round the trunk of the tree , its injuries are easily prevented . We are persuaded that the ravages of the clothes-moth , the creature to whom food and raiment are one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of oviposition . When the timber was found to be perishing in the dock-yards of Sweden , the king applied to Linna*us to discover a remedy , thus acknowledging the dependence of commerce , national defence , and royal power , upon humble scientific researches . He ascertained the time when the insect deposited its eggs , and by sinking the timber in water at that period , the evil was effectually prevented . We certainly receive many serious injuries at the hands of the insect race . But they are not wholly unprovoked ; nor can it be denied , that if they torment us , we also torment them . It is to be hoped that the time will come , when we shall be able to deal with them as with larger animals , exterminating those which can not be employed in the service of man . At present , however , their ingenuity , their perseverance , and their numbers , render it hopeless for man to make any general crusade against them . But we have little to complain of , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in the Crimea he found the mosehettoes so venomous , that in spite of gloves , and every other defence , he was one entire wound . In a sultry night , he sought shelter in his carriage ; they followed him there , and when he attempted to light a candle , they extinguished it by their numbers . In South America , there are countless varieties ; some pursue their labors by day , and others by night ; they form different strata in the air , and new detachments relieve guard as fast as the former are exhausted . Humboldt tells us , that near Rio Unare , the wretched inhabitants bury themselves in the sand , all excepting the head , in order to sleep ; we should think that , in such a condition , they would be sorely tempted to make no exception . Even this is not so great an evil as the destruction made by the white ants among papers of all descriptions . The same authority mentions , that there are no documents of any antiquity spared by this destroyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literature , the record of history , and all the means of existence and improvement , by which civil society is held together . It is melancholy enough to see gardens , fields , and forests sinking into dust ; but we must confess that - this last calamity quite exceeds all others . Millions of insects infest our gardens . The plant-lice cover the leaves and draw out their juices , so that they wither and fall . The ants compel these aphides to give up to them what // *Ju they have plundered from the tree . These insects , the aphides , are so small , that they would seem to have no great power to do harm ; still , as there are twenty generations in a year , the son can finish what his short-lived sire begun . ' Our ornamental plants thus lose all theirbeauty ; tortrices roll up their leaves ; leafcutter bees shear out their patterns ; and the mysterious rosebugs pour in numbers faster than man can destroy them , in the proportion of ten to one . The honey-dew , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say positively , whether it was the sweat of heaven or the saliva of the stars , is now known to be the secretion of an insect , instead of falling from the skies . If man had sense enough to prevent the destruction of birds , there might be less reason to complain that the labors of the garden are so often rewarded with no more substantial result than vanity and vexation . The animals in our service suffer even more from insects than ourselves , and nothing effectual can he done to prevent it . After the horse has been irritated almost to madness by the fly , the tabanus ( horse-fly ) comes to bleed him , as if to *prevent the effects of his passion . This service is rendered the horse sorely against his will ; but he fears nothing so much as the horse-bee ; the animal is violently agitated , when one of these is near him ; if he be in the pasture , he gallops away to the water , where his persecutor dares not follow him . Every rider knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creature difficult to kill , though it holds life in so light esteem , that it prefers death to quitting its hold . An insect similar to the horse-bee takes the ox under his special keeping , piercing him with an auger of very curious construction . But it is needless to mention particulars of this kind ; it is enough to say , that there is no domestic beast or fowl which is not tormented by some kind of insect , and generally , more than one . The abodes of pigeons are always haunted by that ominous hug , which is such an enemy to the rest of man . But among these various injuries offered to man , and the animals under his protection ,  --  to whom his protection in this instance does but little good ,  --  there are some examples of forbearance on the part of insects which deserve to be mentioned , as equally gratifying and unexpected . The insect which lays its eggs in peas , deposits them , so that the grub may feed upon the pea after it ripens ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its operations as not to injure the germ , even when it eat3 // the pea to a shell . The caterpillars , also , which eat the leaves of the tree , spare the bud , so that its growth is not seriously injured . It may be well to mention with respect to the former insect , that its presence is not always seen in the peas which it inhabits , so that those who eat dried peas , which are not split , may be gratified to learn , that they secure a large proportion of animal , where they paid only for vegetable food . It is not necessary to go out of the house to learn the injuries which insects inflict on man , who , if he be the lord of creation , has some refractory subjects , and some which utterly defy his power . A great proportion of these domestic inmates have no Christian names ; whoever speaks of them , is obliged to resort to the learned nomenclature . Flour and meal are eaten by the grub of tenebrio molitor ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread for him , though it is very acceptable to him after it has passed through the process of baking . The acarus farina* , more moderate in his demands , is content to feed on old or damaged flour . The dermestes yanzceus leads a seafaring life , solely for the luxury of feeding upon sea-biscuit ; the more hearty grubs of dermestes and tenebrio lardarius can live upon no lighter food than dried meats and bacon . Fresh meat , however , is always in demand , not only by the flesh-fly , but the wasp and hornet ; and all these have a sweet tooth , and make a practice of eating large quantities of sugar . Butter and lard are eaten by crarnbus pinguinalis ; the cheese-maggot , so renowned for his unexampled powers of still-vaulting , lives upon new cheese ; but the more epicurean acarus siro will not touch it till it is mouldy . The musca ceilaris drinks our vinegar , while the oi*opota cellaris , strong in the cause of temperance , rejects ardent spirits , and drinks nothing but wine . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs and medicines , though , so far as we can learn , their custom is little in request by the apothecaries . The sinodendrurn pusillum takes rhubarb ; there is a kind of beetle which eats musk , and the white ants are well known to be in the bad habit of chewing opium . Some are fond of dress . The clothes-moth is so retired in its habits , that we know little concerning it , except that it eats our clothes in summer . The tap etzeila feeds on the lining of carriages ; the pellionella chooses furs , and shaves them clean ; the melonella eats wax , and in seasons of scarcity submits to eat leather or paper . There are hundreds which live on wood ; one of which , a // cerambyx , after eating through the wooden roof , forces his way through the lead . Some have a literary turn . The crambus pinguinalis , like some literary gentlemen , regards books only with an eye to the binding . Another , called the learned mite , acarus eruditus , eats the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding . Another , whose name we have never learned , gets between the leaves and devours them ; while the anobium , an industrious little beetle , determined to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the contents of the work , goes quietly from the beginning to the end . We are told that one of them , in a public library in France , went through twenty-seven volumes in a straight line , so that on passing a cord through , the whole were lifted at once . The beetle deserved credit for this remarkable exploit , being probably the only living creature who had ever gone through the book . To those who resent these injuries , it may be consoling to know , that the means of ample vengeance are within their reach , and if they choose to follow the example of those who kill and eat insects , the insects will certainly have the worst of the war . The Arabs , as is well known , eat locusts with great relish , though for reasons not certainly founded upon the disparity of outward favor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hottentots also delight to have locusts make their appearance , though they eat every green thing , calculating with some foresight , that as they shall eat the locusts , they shall not be losers in the long run . This people , who are far from fastidious in any of their habits , also eat ants boiled , raw , or roasted after the manner of coffee ; and those who can overcome the force of prejudice , so far as to try the experiment , confess that they are extremely good eating . Kirby , the English naturalist , hears testimony to this effect . Smeathmaii says , I have eaten them dressed in this way , and think them delicate , nourishing , and wholesome ; they are something sweeter , though not so cloying , as the maggot of the palm-tree snout heetle , which is served up at the tables of the West Indian epicures , particularly the French , as one of the greatest luxuries of the country . ' * In parts of Europe , the * A learned foreigner , with whom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of his method of treating these insects . Whenever in his walks he meets with an ant-hill , he immediately approaches it with the end of his walking-stick . The ants come out in great numbers , some to reconnoitre , and some for the mere // grubs of some of the beetles are highly esteemed ; the cerambyx is the delight of the blacks in the Islands ; the inhabitants of New Caledonia are partial to spiders . Equidem non invideo , miror magis . It is highly probable , that a large proportion of insects were intended by Providence for food ; and if we will not eat them , it is unreasonable to complain of their numbers . Having said so much of the injuries occasioned by insects , lest we should excite too strong a prejudice against them , a prejudice which they have no personal attractions to balance or remove , it becomes a duty to mention some benefits , for which we are indebted to them . The list of these benefits is large already , and scientific research , aided by popular curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present bounds . It will be a happy day for the insects , when their good qualities are known . The bee that sails with so much airy independence through our gardens , perfectly satisfied that they were planted for its benefit alone , would find little protection in its familiar manners and brilliant dress , were it not able to lay man under obligations . The silk-worm , which is now cherished with so much care , would be rejected with disgust , like other caterpillars of the garden , were it not able to pay for protection by its labor . Those that depend upon the charity of man , find but little quarter ; it is in vain that Shakspeare assures us , that the rain of the trampled insect equals that of the suffering giant ; in vain that Cowper implores us not needlessly to crush a worm : unless they can make it for man 's interest to protect them , they have little forbearance to hope for ; the man of science , therefore , who discovers and points out their uses , is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the duty of scavengers . In our climate , they are usefhl in this capacity ; but their labors here are nothing , compared with their exploits in warmer countries , which , if they are uncomfortable with them , would be uninhabitable without them . Whenever a carcass falls in our climate , the insects move to it in air lines ; beetles of all descriptions , wasps , hornets , and flies , lay aside all minor differences , and engage in the work of removing it . The fleshfly deposits in it its grub , already hatched , that it may lose no time ; and as this last named insect has a promising family ,  - -  pleasure of the excursion . When the stick is pretty well covered with them , he draws it through his lips and secures them all . He describes the taste as cool and sourish , not unlike that of the plant sorrel . // a single parent producing more than twenty thousand young , which eat so plentifully as to add two hundred fold to their weight in twenty-four hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this operation is carried on with miraculous expedition ; before the air can be tainted by the savor of cor* ruption , the flesh is removed , and nothing remains but the bones whitening in the sun . They do a still greater service to men in removing dead vegetable matter . They generally prefer animal food ; but as they are not able to procure it oftener than an Irish peasant , they all , moschettoes among the rest , con** tent themselves with vegetable substances . Great numbers of the flesh-fly are imposed upon by plants similar to the skunk cabbage ; supposing , from their peculiar fragrance , that they are flesh in that particular state of decay , which epicures de* light in , the insects deposit their eggs upon them , and when the young are hatched they discover the mistake , quite too late to repair it . R6aumur thinks that we are indebted to this fly , for making it a point of conscience not to eat the flesh of living animals ; - he tried the experiment , and found that they unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a pity , that naturalists should not learn humanity from so excellent an example . It is not necessary to explain to our readers , that we are indebted to insects for silk and honey ; the latter having been used from the earliest ages , and the former promising to be used as extensively in our country before many years . It is fully ascertained that our climate is favorable to the silk-worm , and to the plant on which it lives ; and it is not the habit of our countrymen to neglect any opportunity of securing comfort or gain ; on the contrary , they are more in need of learning from the insects their judicious habit of dividing labor ; for the moment a channel of adventure is opened , they rush into it with a force which sometimes carries them far beyond the end proposed . Here is a constant disposition to bite the chains of nature ; and as he who ascends a staircase in the dark , if when he has reached the top he attempts to go higher , meets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our countrymen injure themselves by attempting to draw from their chosen pursuit , more than nature ever intended it to give . There is no question , that the manufacture of silk will be greatly and rapidly extended ; and the result will be not to increase luxury , but to change what is now a luxury into a necessary // of life . Time was , when stockings were a luxury ; now they are worn by the beggars of our country . It is upon record , that a king borrowed a pair of silk stockings for a public occasion ; here , they may be found in the possession of those , who , unlike the lilies of the field , both toil and spin . We are indebted to insects for the ink-powder , an article important in all professions , but indispensable in ours . It is formed by a cynijps on the quercus infectoria , a sort of shruboak which grows in Asia and Africa , whence the galls are constantly exported . The insect bores the bark and deposits an egg . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , as the sap flows out from the wound , gives its color and properties to the gall , that grows and swells round the egg for the young insect 's future home . There is some difference of opinion as to this process . Mr. Rennie suggests , that the egg may be protected or coated with gluten , which prevents the escape of the sap ; the sap , thus confined , pushes out the pellicle of gluten that covers it , till the opening is closed by being hardened in the air . This will account for the uniform size of these productions . The galls of the rose and willow are well known ; the gall of commerce is as large as a marble . This furnishes a comfortable dwelling for the young insect , and a dye for those streams of ink which are perpetually flowing in the civilized world , for libel or literature , for evil or good . They are also used in dying ; those which contain the insect being called blue gall-nuts , those which it has abandoned , white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was formerly used in dying red . In modern times , cochineal , coccus cacti , is generally used . The Spaniards found it employed by the Americans , when they came over to this country . It was supposed to be a vegetable production , and it was not till a period comparatively late , discovered to be a living thing . It feeds on the nopal , a kind of fig-tree common in New Spain and some parts of India . The inhabitants preserve them in their houses through the rainy season , and when it is over place them upon the tree , which they soon cover . They are after a time brushed from the tree with the tail of a squirrel , and being killed either by artificial heat or exposure to the sun , the inside is found filled with the red dust , which forms this splendid color . So important is this article in commerce , that the East India Company offered a reward of six thousand pounds to any one who should succeed in naturalizing it in their territories . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexampled extent and variety , being actually employed in supplying the demands of the world for shellac , heads , sealing-wax , lake , lacquer , and grindstones . The insect covers trees of the fig kind in Hindostan , in such a manner that their upper branches look as if they had been dipped in blood . The substance in its natural state , before it is separated from the twig , is called sticklac , from which all the others are made . After being separated , pounded , and having the color extracted by water , *t is called seedlac ; when melted into cakes , it is called lumplac ; when purified and transparent , it is the shellac , which is so extensively used . It is used by the natives to make rings , necklaces , and bracelets ; mixed with cinnabar , it is formed into sealing-wax ; heated and mingled with a black powder , it forms a lacquer , or japan ; and the coloring substance extracted from the sticklac is the lake of our painters . Last , but not least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river sand and moulded into grindstones . Truly , it is no easy matter to name the creature , which answers such a variety of purposes as this . R*aumur undertook the benevolent enterprise of civilizing spiders , by way of turning them into operatives , and thereby bringing them into better odor with man ; but his good purpose was disappointed ; for though they fully proved that they were able to work , they had an unfortunate propensity for eating each other , which proved to he inconsistent with the virtues and charities of industrious and social life . Their powers as artisans were very respectable , but no inducement could be brought to bear upon them ; as for working for a living , it was the last thing they thought of ; for some of them lived a year without tasting food , or seeming in the least exhausted by fasting . This indifference to common wants , is one of the most remarkable things in the character of the race ; they never seem to repine under any degree of pain or privation . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill them . Bees will live many hours under water ; caterpillars are frozen up through the winter , and bear it with the utmost composure . Dr. Dwight tells us of a beetle which was planed out of a table where he had resided , if we remember rightly , eighty years without a dinner . Dr. Arnold once had an insect , which , after the tender-hearted manner of collectors , was pinned down to a table ; some other insects happening to be within reach , it proceeded to eat them with as good an apvoL. xxxv. - No. 76. 27 // petite as ever it had in its life . Some beetles have been soaked in boiling water , without being oppressed by the heat . Many insects have a way of pretending to be dead , as a sort of hint to man , that if , as usual , he is disposed to kill them , he may spare himself the trouble . If any one is disposed to ascertain whether their death is counterfeited or not , they will not flinch , even when torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when cut in two , retain the easy indifference which they manifest on most other occasions . Many of our readers have probably seen ants cut from a hollow tree in spring , and though they must have passed many months without food , regain their cheerfulness in the sun . The ant , however , is torpid through the colder parts of the winter . Our ants , though , like those of Scripture , they are models of industry , have not the forethougtit to provide for the winter . But it may be that in warmer climates they have this prudent habit , for which they have been so long held out as an example . It is fair to say , that in cases where insects are troublesome , they are sometimes less injurious than is supposed , and the blame does not invariably fall on the one that deserves it . It is thought that the irritating insects , particularly those that draw blood from domestic animals in summer , are necessary to their health ,  --  to save them from the diseases which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household , too , it is no misfortune that they enforce the duty of perpetual cleanliness , and it is well known that , as in the case of moschettoes , a little attention may reduce the number and inconvenience of their visitations . We are told ,  --  and it may be well to mention it in this connexion ,  --  that the house-fly does not , as is commonly supposed , abuse the familiarity which man allows him . He is harmless and friendly in his disposition , and moreover can not bite if he would . His proboscis is soft and sponge-like ,  --  altogether unable to inflict a wound . This is the musca domestica ; hut there is another kind which exactly resembles him in person , except in having a sharp proboscis , with which he bites pretty seriously ; he is known by the name of stomoxys calcitrans . This is not the only case , in which public resentment confounds the innocent with the guilty . Our respect , if not our regard for insects , will be materially increased , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have not often a common interest 5tifficiently strong to organize them into parties or coalitions , // and , therefore , do not generally combine their forces to much effect ; but there have been cases in which they have made man tremble . We are told , that in ancient times , when Sapor , king of Persia , was besieging Nisibis , the light artillery of an army of moschettoes fell upon him with so much fury , that he raised the siege , and retreated with all possible expedition : but anciently they had so much faith in these things , that now we have very little ; still we have seen a man fly from the wrath of a bee , and we can conceive , that in this case , it is possible that the larger size of man may have been overborne by the numbers and valor of the moschettoes , and thus the battle have gone against the strong . But there are facts , modern and undoubted , which show how formidable insects can be . A small beetle has appeared regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a million and a half of trees destroyed by them , and more than eighty thousand were counted in a single tree . We are told , by aged men , that many years ago , an insect made such ravages in the oaks of New England , that their case seemed as hopeless as that of the locusts is now . On the third year of their appearance , a heavy frost in May , which was very destructive to vegetation , put a period to the ravages of the insect , and it has not made its appearance in any force again . Wilson , the ornithologist , as quoted by Mr. Rennie , gives an account of the devastation made at the South by a small insect , which had hardly spared ten trees in a hundred on a tract of two thousand acres . Would it be believed , ' he says , that the larvae of an insect no bigger than a grain of rice , should silently , and in one season , destroy some thousand acres of pine trees , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and fifty feet high ? In some places the whole woods , as far as you can see around you , are dead , stripped of the bark , their wintry looking arms and bare trunks bleaching in the sun , and tumbling in ruins before every blast . ' In the last century , an insect , formica saccharivora , attacked the sugar-cane plantations in the island of Granada , so fatally as to put an entire stop to cultivation . They covered the roads and fields ; they killed rats and mice by thousands ; when large fires were made to consume them , they crowded on till they extinguished them by their numbers . The whole crop was burnt and the ground dug up , but all to no purpose ; human power could do nothing . A reward of twenty thousand pounds was offered to any one // *21:2 Habits o.t* Insects who would discover a remedy , but they were not even checked , till in 1780 , they were destroyed by torrents of rain . Dobrizhoffer gives a curious account of the ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the earth with infinite labor , under houses and larger buildings , forming large winding galleries in the ground . On the approach of rain , as if knowing what to expect , the ants take wing and fly away . The water rushes into their caverns , and undermining the building , it falls in total ruin . He mentions , that the ground , on which his church and house were built , was full of those caverns . For many days in rainy weather , the altar was rendered useless , for the ants flew out and fell upon the priests and every thing around . Ten outlets by which they escaped from the ground were closed , but the next day it was found that they had opened twice as many more . One evening there came a severe thunder-storm , in the midst of which the Indian , who had the care of the church , came to warn them that its walls were beginning to crack and lean ; he snatched a lamp and ran to the place , but sunk up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as he was drawn out of it , he found was the house of the ants . As fast as the Indians shovelled earth into it , they dug it out . These are their greater exploits . Their ordinary employment is , to go in an endless procession to the place where grain is deposited , and to carry off bushels in a day or a moonlight night . They strip trees of their leaves , and reap fields as clean as the sickle . They will even attack men when sleeping , and unless they escape at once , cover them with their painful stings , and the only way of expelling them is by throwing lighted sheets of paper upon the swarm . This Jesuit was no naturalist ; he once , as he tells us , pursued a skunk and succeeded in getting more explicit information from the animal itself concerning its own value and properties , than he could have xvished , Itorrendo odore . ' He does not enlighten us as to the kind of ant , but says that they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been able to subdue them . The account of the white ants , or termites , was niven to the world by Smeathman fifty years ago , and subsequent writers have added little to his information ; the account , however , is sufficiently curious to bear repetition , since it affords the most remarkable example that can any where be found of admirable instinct , perseverance and power . Between the // tropics , they are the most formidable enemy man has to encounter , destroying papers , provisions , furniture , and every thing , even to house and home . Metal , glass and stone they do not eat ; why , does not appear , except it be from a principle of forbearance , equally touching and unexpected . They have been known to go up through one leg of a table and return down the other , in the course of a single night . An engineer , in the same space of time , had his clothes , papers , and the lead of pencils , which were all , as he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they attack a house , they eat away the heart of the timber , leaving only the outer shell ; but , being well aware that this process would soon bring the house about their ears , they fill the cavities as they advance with clay , which soon becomes hard as stone . Mr. Forbes remarks , that in his house at Tobago , he observed one day , that the glasses of some pictures were dull and the frames dusty . On attempting to wipe them , he found that the frames were plastered firmly to the wall by this sort of mortar ; the ants having eaten the frames , back boards , and most of the paper , leaving nothing but the prints and the gilding ; thinking , perhaps , that as the latter might be of some use to him , and could be of none to them , it was but just to spare them . They are as adroit in constructing their own habitations , as in destroying those of man . They raise hills ten or twelve feet high , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of an inch long . The royal chamber is in the centre , and other cells and galleries are gradually multiplied around it . The whole fabric is so well constructed , that the wild bulls sometimes make use of them for the purpose of observatories , and find them strong enough to bear their weight . if anyone attack their habitation , they are at once ready to do battle . Smith gives us his opinion of their xvarlike power . He says , that he one day attempted to knock off the top of one of the hills . The insects within , hearing the noise , came out to see what was the matter , upon which he took to his heels and ran away as fast as he could . They have been known to attack an English ship of the line , and capture it by boarding ; it is said , that the palace of the English Governor-General in Calcutta is perishing under their operations . The insects , perhaps , like some other people , have never been able to see distinctly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstitious times , this would be thought prophetic of the fate which awaits the British empire in India in some future day . // The locusts have been dreaded from the earliest time , as appears from the Hebrew prophecies and the profane historical writings . We have authentic and particular accounts of these visitations in modern times . One of the most alarming was in Russia , in 1650 . They entered it at three different points , and thence spread over the neighboring countries in such numbers , that the trees bent with their weight ; they destroyed every thing , and when they died , they were found lying in many places to the depth of several feet upon the ground . Dr. Shaxv , in his travels in the Levant , was a witness to one of their invasions . In April , their numbers darkened the sun . In June , after their breeding time was over , they re-appeared , recruited by their young , in compact bodies of several hundred yards square , and marched forward , taking possession of gardens , trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trenches , which they filled with water , and kindled large fires ; but the fires were extinguished , and the trenches filled with carcasses . A day or two after these had passed , another division passed over the same ground , and finding no other food , ate the young branches and the bark of the trees . Nothing comes amiss to them ; if they can not supply themselves with the fruits of the garden , they will feed on the thorn-apple and the deadly night-shade . The lord of the creation finds his sovereignty a very empty distinction , when his title is disputed by such things as this . The ingenuity displayed by insects in various operations is truly wonderful , and certainly puts the large beasts to shame . The most momentous of these with them , as with man , is the construction of a habitation . Every one knows the skill of the common bee and xvasp , in geometry and architecture ; but however it may have been with naturalists , it was not generally known that the solitary species , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to produce such results in the form of masonry , caverns and arbors . Mr. Rennie gives most interesting information on this subject , for which we are indebted to his own observations . He has seen a mason-wasp scooping out a gallery in a brick , by gradually removing particles with her jaws , which serve her both as trowel and chisel ; lest the chips should betray her retreat , she carefully removed them where the ichneumon fly , which minds every insect 's business except its own , should find no clue to her eggs . When the excavation was completed , the // eggs deposited , and some caterpillars placed in it to serve as food for the young when hatched , the wasp departed , well satisfied with the results of its labors . He gives an account equally pleasing , of the work of the mason-bee . In May , 1829 , he discovered the hank which supplied all the masonbees in the neighborhood with their mortar* It was a brown clay , in which was a hole which the bees were constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of clay . On arresting one of the bees , he found that the clay had been moistened and kneaded ; it did not take more than half a minute to prepare its hod , and the dryness of the air was such , that in order to make their work hold together , they were obliged to work as if it were a matter of life and death , at the rate of fourteen or fifteen hours a day . He traced one of them to her nest on the inner wall of a coalhouse of roughly finished brick , where she was building upon an upright crevice from which the mortar had fallen . While working at the bank , she was perfectly unconcerned ; but here she had an air of great mystery and reserve , as if afraid of betraying her retreat to marauders . When she thought herself observed , she pretended to be busy about something else , . prying most intently into some other crevices of the building . This bee did not use lime in her mortar , according to the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eggs ' deposited , with a quantity of pollen for food , the bee left the young to take care of themselves Another curious race bear the name of carpenters , and deserve it from the magnitude and excellence of their works , made with no better tool than their jaws , which answer the purpose of chisel , plane , and key-hole saw . The male seems , like many human animals , to go to places of public resort , while the female pursues her manifold and solitary labors . This bee also carries away its chips , and varies its flight so as to mislead any insect spy . She first makes a tunnel in the wood , beginning in an oblique , which is soon changed to a perpendicular direction ; at the bottom of the excavation she deposits an egg , with provision for its future support , and then covers it with a ceiling of cemented sawdust , which serves as floor to the chamber above . This floor is made by concentric circles gradually closing toward the centre , and after having completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer door . It occurs to the // bee , that the egg first laid xviii be first hatched , and the young have no means of escape , except through all the rest of the chambers . In order to obviate this difficulty , she is at the trouble of making lateral openings to the bottom of each chamber , through which each young one may retire without disturbing the order of the family . Can such things be ? Equal skill and even more taste are displayed by a kind of bee , to which has been given the name of upholsterer . Its young , if , like grubs in general , they are blind , can not be very particular as to the decorations of their lodging ; still the parent gratifies her own affection , by lining it with the richest materials which the season affords . She digs an excavation two or three inches deep , and polishes the wall to prepare it for the tapestry . The poppy-bee makes use of the scarlet petals of the flower from which she is named ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards cuts them , if necessary , to suit the place they are intended to fill . It is no easy matter for human hands to cut a poppy-leaf without its shrivelling ; but this presents no difficulty to the more delicate instruments of the bee . It is a question with naturalists , whether the bee is induced to select this floxver by a regard for the beauty of its color , or some perception of its properties which we are not acquainted with ; so long , however , as the bees themselves are silent on the subject , there is little hope that the question can be satisfactorily decided . The leaf-cutter bee belongs to the same craft , and though it works entirely by rule of thumb , shears its circular pattern from the leaf of the rose and other plants with marvellous precision ; in fitting it to the wall of her nest , she employs no paste , but trusts to the spring of the leaf to retain it in its position . It would seem as if , on comparing notes , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than man from the bee . Many of these creatures are as remarkable for fierceness as for industry . Mr. Rennie mentions that he once attempted to examine a nest of lapidary bees , but was prevented by the xvarlike owners , who , not satisfied with repelling the invasion , chased him a quarter of a mile . We said that man might learn from insects ; but we are not sure that human skill would be adequate , even to an imitation of many of their inventions . Still it seems very probable , as Mr. Rennie suggested , that if men had studied under insects , many improvements , which have been brought to their present perfection by the efforts of successive ages , would have been // completed long ago . The wasp has always made the paper from which it constructs its nest , by uniting vegetable fibres with glue , while man was vexing himself with attempts to write on the bark of trees or a waxen or metallic table . But the ancient naturalists were not sufficiently close observers ; they doubtless saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was doing , they supposed it to be carrying the bits of stone and clay as ballast , to steady itself against the wind . They were acquainted with the musical powers of the cicad*e , but not with their mechanical furniture . The instrument , with which the female ,  --  the male being the musician ,  - -  pierces the vegetable to insert its eggs , is composed of three pieces , the two outer ones being saws with teeth , the inner pointed like a lancet . The denticulated pieces are capable of being drawn forward and backward like a saw , while the inner one is stationary , and at the same time they are united together in one . The saws , or files , as R*aumur calls them , have grooves in them , which receive a projecting part of the central piece or lancet , on which they slide up and down . The saw-fly has an instrument still more curious , for sawing a hole into the wood ; it consists of two equal and similar saws , sliding upon each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being drawn back , while the other is pushed forward ; these are inserted in one back , which also contains a passage through which the eggs are passed into the hole cut to receive them . The teeth of these saws are themselves denticulated with fine teeth , so as to combine the properties of a saw and a file . If we could imagine a *arpenter , with a saw composed of two plates sliding upon each other cutting at the same time in the same course , and moved , the one forward , the other back , by the same motion of his hand , we can easily conceive that he would bless his stars for such an invention . Some insects enjoy a perpetual feast of tabernacles , after the manner of the Jews . They roll a leaf in such a manner as to protect them from other insects and the elements , and to furnish them with board and lodging at the same time ; and though the appearance of our trees and shrubberies is not improved by their proceedings , we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructions . Some insects , disgusted with the insecurity of life and property on earth , deposit their eggs , so that their young may first see the light under water ; the grubs provide a lodging with leaves , straws , or bits // of stone . Some disguise their cocoons by an outer covering , so much resembling the soil or leaves , that no animal sagacity can detect them . The moths which make havoc among clothes , finding their way to them through cracks and keyholes , provide for their young , at our expense , a lodging of a most comfortable description , from which they can not be easily removed ; camphor and similar articles being regarded by them with the utmost unconcern . Mr. Rennie took one from the carcass of that moth , which bears the respectable name of old lady , ' and placed it on the green cloth of a desk , where its proceedings were under his eye . It cut a hair near the cloth , and after placing it in a line with its body , cut another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them together with silk , and so on , till it had made a covering large enough for its body ; this was made large enough also to admit of its turning round in it , and when finished , was lined with silk , an article in which insects are large dealers . As the caterpillar increases , it adds to its covering at either end ; but it increases in thickness also , and in order to make room , it slits the case half way down on each side , and fills up the space with a patch ; then proceeds to enlarge the whole length in the same systematic and deliberate way . R6aumur says , that they never will leave their dwelling for another ; but Mr. Rennie says , that in case they are molested , they fling away in a passion . The very individual whose history has been alluded to , took up its habitation in a ghost moth , ' but either from resentment at being disturbed , or from fear of ghosts , it adjourned to the old lady . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which there are several kinds . One of them bores a hole in the ground two feet long and half an inch broad , a work , which , considering that it is executed by a single spider , without pickaxe or shovel , is very far beyond the rail-road tunnels of England . This tube is delicately lined with silk , and is closed with a trap-door , suspended by a silk hinge , and fitting close in a sort of case or groove , like the doors of our houses , the inner side being perfectly smooth , and the outside rough like the rest of the bank , in the side of which this horizontal gallery is made , in order that no external appearance may betray it . This door is a perfect circle , though the insect is as ill provided with mathematical instruments as certain bucket-makers of our country , concerning whom tradition says , that they had no means of describing a circle , except by // holding up their board before the moon when at the full . The spider makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silk , which give notice when any stranger is at the door . When this is the case , the spider runs to the door , not however to invite the stranger in , but to fasten the door against him , which he does by bracing himself against the wall , and holding the door with both hands . Mr. Rennie had the nest of a mason-spider , not of the same kind , sent him from the West Indies . It had a door of the size of a crown-piece , slightly concave on the outside and curved within , formed by several layers of the same kind of tapestry which lines the interior , the inner layers being the broadest and the outer less in diameter , except toward the hinge , which is about an inch long . The elasticity of the materials gives the door the property of acting like a spring , and shutting of its own accord . The door fits in an aperture of the same material , and so accurately , that when shut , it is difficult to discover by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , closing in this way by a spring , is a contrivance which must make the best mechanic that ever lived acknowledge , that in this respect the spider is his master . The same ingenuity which governs insects in the construction of *their dwellings , is also manifested in their provision for the wants and happiness of their young . Their instinct acts here with almost unerring precision ; there are cases in which an insect occasionally casts a figure incorrectly , but such cases are few . The butterfly draws its support from flowers ; but knowing that such provision would never do for its young , it deposits the egg on such plants as will afford support to the grub , and before doing so , generally takes pains to ascertain that no other has forestalled it . The moschetto and dragon-fly , though it would be as much as their lives are worth to go in the water themselves , deposit their eggs in it for the benefit of their young . The gad-fly , whose young are first to see the light , figuratively speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address in effecting its purpose ; it flies round the horse , and balancing on its wings , glues its eggs to his hair , amounting to some hundreds in all . They are hatched by the least warm moisture . When the horse licks the place , he conveys many of the grubs to his mouth and swallows them , already hatched by contact with his tongue . It may be ohserved , that the fly chooses the knee and shoulder , as places // where the horse is most likely to reach them . The ichneumon fly lays its egg in the body of a caterpillar ; and the young , when hatched , feed upon it ; but with prudence exceeding its humanity , the grub avoids the vital parts , and carefully keeps the caterpillar alive till it has no further use for it . An insect which deserves to be better known , was seen by Ray , dragging a green caterpillar to a hole it had dug in the sand . After removing a pellet which closed the mouth of the hole , the insect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . When it came up again , it rolled in bits of earth , scratched in the earth with its fore-feet , then went to a pine tree for resin to seal it , and having arranged every thing so as to conceal the entrance , it took two pine-leaves and laid them in a particular manner , so that it might know the spot again . Every one knows the perseverance with which a common beetle rolls little balls to the distance of several feet , that they may fall into holes which they have prepared for the residence of their young . They work in a way , which , however it might be with man , is the most effectual that they can employ , by supporting themselves against the ground and trundling it onward with their hind-feet ; the ancients observed this proceeding , and believed that the insects did it by way of exercise and recreation ; though it would evidently have been easy to find some pleasanter sport . Some insects , not distinguished for ingenuity in providing for their young , supply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earwig , which takes example from the hen , and superintends her young with equal assiduity , marching before them with motherly dignity and affection . The spider carries about its eggs in a silk bag , which it defends with as much fury as if it contained money ; it will not give them up , but with the last drop of its blood . The wasps , though perfect Ishmaelites as to all the rest of the world , are courteous and civil in their intercourse with each other , and so affectionately devoted to their young , that they will not forsake them even when their nest is torn to pieces . Ants , when disturbed , may be seen carrying little white bodies to a place of safety , and so intent are they upon their work , that even when cut in two , they will not give it over . These are the eggs , which , as soon as hatched , are taken care of by the workers , which move them about according as they require to be warm or cold , wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the lower cells , to keep them warmer , and brine // them up again every morning . If the weather-wise think it likely to rain , they do not remove them . As soon as the sun in the morning shines on the nest , the ants at the top go below and strike those in the lower stories to wake them ; being no strangers to the benefit of early rising , they carry the young into the sun for a quarter of an hour , and then place them in the shade . The humble-bee also , a good-natured creature , though not so distinguished for ability as other bees , is even more devoted to its young . Though insects exert great address in favor of their young , they display equal resources when acting for themselves . They are tolerably well secured by nature , which has made it next to an impossibility to kill them ; nature also has provided them with means of escape and resistance . Many insects take the color of the earth or plant on which they happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the privet-moth , though the caterpillar is several inches in length , a person might repeatedly look at the plant without detecting it . Some resemble dried leaves , and in that way elude the sharp eye of the bird . There are some which get their living by their wits , sometimes exerting them in an honest manner , at others , as thieves and robbers . Huber remarks , that a party of hive-bees went to the residence of certain humble-bees , to beg or steal , as the case might be . The humble-bees acted the part of Samaritans , believing that the knaves were poor and helpless , and for three weeks actually supported their lazy guests . This matter came to the ear of some neighboring wasps , who thought this a very pleasant way of supporting life , and therefore went to the nest and joined the party . The humble-bees were willing to do in charity all that bee could do ; but thinking this addition to their poor-rates intolerable , they determined , rather than have any quarrel , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not uncommon for bees which have been badly managed , to fall into bad habits , and at last to take to the highway . Some of them are called corsairs , on account of this practice . Several of them will sometimes stop a bee which is engaged in its honest calling ; one seizes one leg , and another the other , while a third takes it by the throat , and calls upon it to stand and deliver its honey . When they have rifled it they let it go . Sometimes these pirates form an expedition , to take some neighboring hive by storm . The garrison resists valiantly , but should their queen be killed in // the battle , they think it useless to contend any longer , so they lay down their arms , and all unite and plunder the cells in the most harmonious manner . Nothing human exceeds the fierceness of an angry bee . One writer recommends giving brandy mixed with honey to bees , to sustain them under such an invasion ; while others say , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals . What their success in war is , may he learned from the story of a clergyman , as related by Kirby and Spence . His house was attacked by a mob , with which he vainly endeavored to reason . Finding that they were proceeding to acts of violence , he ordcred his bee-hives to be thrown among them ; the bees fought like lions , and soon cleared the field . There are some ants , who have great aversion to labor ; and in order to avoid the necessity of supporting themselves they compel others to support them , This , however , it should be remarked , is not in this country , but in Europe ; here , all know , that ants , as well as men , are born free and equal . The ant that carries on this trade , which is regarded as piracy by all civilized insects , is called the legionary ,  --  a name descriptive of its military habits ; the race which it reduces to bondage , is a sort of negro . The legionaries march against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm , and carry away their prisoners . The old ants they do not touch ; they prefer the ' young , whom they carry to their own home , and then train them to menial services of all descriptions . The natural consequence follows . They become too indolent and proud to work , and would starve were it not for their slaves , thus creating the necessity , by which probably they would justify the practice . They do not lord it over their negroes ; on the contrary , they treat them with great kindness and even respect ; the slaves are on the same footing as our slaves were formerly in New England , where they used to sit at table with the farmers , give their advice like oracles , and henpeck their owners in such a manner , that it was a relief to have them set free . We trust that no one will use these accounts , now so unquestionably proved to be true , to show , that the relation of slavery is not unnatural ; the argument is no stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bees , and employed by those , who overlook the fact , that a state of civil society may do well enough for bees , without being adequate to the wants and improvement of man . There are other // respects , in which these insects may well be quoted as an example . Thus we are told by Huber , that the female ants , when they become mothers of a family , cut off their wings and throw them away , thinking , doubtless , that domestic cares and duties will leave them no time to fly round as in former days . No creature displays greater talent in providing for his own subsistence than the ant-lion , an insect which is particularly fond of ants , but has neither strength to master them in a fair field , nor fleetness to run them down . Indeed its means of progression are very unfavorable to the chase , as it can only move backwards , and that with a halting gait ; its appearance is so uninviting , that other insects think twice before they go near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has slaughtered with its own hands . With this fastidiousness and these disabilities , one would say , that the creature had a reasonable pros* pect of starving to death . This , however , is not his opinion ; he knows that stratagem is sometimes an overmatch for strength ; he therefore selects a place where he may construct a pitfall for a trap , generally choosing a loose soil , which can be excavated with least trouble . The way in which he goes to work is entirely his own . He first describes a circle , to mark the rim of his pit ; then placing himself on the inside of this circular furrow , he pushes himself backward under the sand , making the hind part of his body serve as a plough-share ; then using his fore-leg for a shovel , he heaps a load of earth upon his head , which is flat and square ; then giving his head a jerk , he tosses the earth to the distance of several inches . Thus he goes round the circle ; then he marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on till he reaches the centre of the circle . In order that the whole burden may not come upon one leg , when he has finished one furrow , he proceeds with the next in an opposite direction . Should he come to a bit of gravel , he lays it on his head , and flings it out ; should the stone be too large , he shoulders it and carries it on his hack up the sloping side of the pit ; if this can not be done , he either leaves the pit or works the stone into the wall . The pit , when completed , is conical , sloping down to a point , where the ant-lion takes his station , and in order that other insects may not suspect his object , covers himself with sand . When idle and thoughtless insects see this pit , they must needs look in , to see what it is and what it is for ; but as they indulge their curiosity , the sand gives way under them and down the ) // go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yields beneath their feet , and the ant-lion beneath pelts them with sand in such a manner , as soon to put an end to their endeavors ; having fed upon his prey , the ant-lion , in order to save his reputation , throws the skin to a considerable distance . After having led this life for two years , the ant-lion is promoted to the rank of a fly . The English naturalists have noticed a kind of spider , which , having observed that many insects fall into the water , thinks that his best harvest is there ; but nature has neither formed him for swimming , nor provided him with shipping . He does what man would do in a similar case . He collects materials on the shore to form a raft , ties them together with silken strings , and pushing off from the shore , sails out to relieve any insect that may happen to be drowning , not , as may well be supposed , from motives of pure humanity , but rather of that mixed kind which enters so largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have upon the subject of social rights and claims , we do not know . They are active enough in relieving each other while living ; but let an unfortunate insect be taken sick , and they gather about him and put him out of his pain . Whether they think that if he must die , the sooner the better , or whether this is the means which nature has provided for shortening the agony of death , it is upon the whole a benefit to those which are subjects of the operation . The female bees make a general massacre of the drones ; wasps , on the approach of winter , as they do not make any provision against the evils of cold and hunger , murder their young , on Sancho 's principle , that there is no pain so great which death can not end . Some suppose that insects and other animals do not suffer as we do from such an operation ; the main reason upon which they support the theory is the cheerfulness with which the insects submit to it ; but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the habit of expressing their feelings . It will be better for the sake of humanity , to go on the presumption that they suffer , because the doubts upon the subject are not easily removed . The motions of insects are very curious , and some of them have occasioned much controversy and speculation . Apodous larvme have no occasion to take long journeys , their business confines them at home ; they therefore make their way slowly , by gliding , jumping or swimming , ways sufficiently rapid for // their purpose . The motion of serpents , in old time was accounted very mysterious ; no one could tell how they moved so rapidly , without any visible means of walking , and this was among the reasons which gained for them so much reverence in ancient times . Sir Everard Home at last discovered , that the points of their ribs were curiously constructed for the purpose ; and in the same way it is probable that many things of the kind , which are now incomprehensible , will appear to be very simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , like the larvie of flies , drag themselves by hooks in the head , an operation as inconvenient as if a man should drag himself on the ground by his chin ; cheese-maggots fix their mandibles in places on the table , and let them go with a jerk which sends them to a marvellous distance . Caterpillars climb very readily , but for security carry a ladder of ropes as they go , sticking it to glass or any substance , however hard and smooth , on which they happen to be ascending . They often have occasion to descend from branch to branch ; sometimes they are shaken by the wind or thrown with violence to the ground , in which case they take their rope with them , and by means of it re-ascend the tree . So when they travel round the tree , they need a clue to conduct them back to the nest . When they move , they reach forward their necks as far as possible , fasten the thread , then bring up their body and take another step , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchards . When they descend , they have power to contract the orifice through which they send out their thread , so as to let themselves gradually down . In climbing on the line , the caterpillar catches the thread as high as it can reach , pulls up its body , grasps the thread with its hindmost legs , and thus regains the tree from which it had fallen . When it has thus ascended , it is found to have a little ball of thread . The motion of flies was long a subject of debate and wonder ; some thought that they must have claws , others that they had glutinous sponges , an appendage which would not allow of rapid motion . Hooke was the first to observe , that some curious mechanism must be employed , but what it was he could not discover ; he thought it might be something resembling cardteeth , set opposite to each other , by which they could grapple some projecting places , such as they might find on the smoothest surfaces . Durham thought it not unlikely that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wet leather attached to // the top ; an explanation which amounted to nothing more than a confession of ignorance ; since , though it might show how a fly could stick to a wall , the object was to show how they move on the wall . Sir Everard Home at last discovered , that it was done by producing a vacuum between the surface on which they walk and parts of the foot constructed for that purpose . There are two suckers connected with the last joint of the tarsus , and a narrow neck which moves in all directions , under the root of each claw . These suckers consist of a contractile membrane , which adapts itself to any surface . Had it heen possihie for the fly to communicate with men , the air-pump of Gitericke , and possibly our countryman Dr. Prince 's improvement upon it , might have been known to the world much sooner after it was created . There is a xvater-spider , also , which invented the diving-bell and has used it to more purpose than men . It spins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of half a pigeon 's egg , which forms the diving-bell . This is sometimes under , sometimes partly above the surface of the water , and is lashed by threads to whatever happens to be near . It is closed all round except an opening below . By this contrivance , the spider carries air with it down to its submarine nest . To complete the catalogue of mathematical instruments , it is well known , that the gossamer spider ascends high into the air with it light thread , on the principle of the balloon . The movement of spiders in the air has always been regarded as a difficult matter to explain . Dr. Lister , the celebrated English naturalist , whose researches into the habits of spiders discovered almost all that is now known , believed that they had the power of shooting out threads in the direction in which they wished to go . Kirhy also used the same language , speaking of the spider shooting out his threads , ' not from carelessness of expression , but evidently meaning to be literally understood . White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This certainly is a great weight of authority in favor of this power in the spider ; but it is so unlike every thing with which we are acquainted , that we are naturally suspicious of some mistake , and we are glad to see that Mr. Rennie will not allow , that the spider has a gift so much beyond the usual order of nature . There are those of no small pretensions as naturalists , who believe that the floating of the spider 's thread is electrical , and maintain that it can dart its thread in the wind 's eye . Whoever hastily observes them will be of the same opinion , with // respect to the gossamer spider and some others . Within a few days , standing in a shed , we saw a line of very small spiders coming down perpendicularly from the wall , each being apparently attached to a large thread by a smaller thread of its own . There were perhaps a hundred in the string . After having descended about eight or ten feet , the lowest came opposite to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned off in a direction almost horizontal towards the door . On looking very closely , we could discover no line beyond the leading spider , but on striking the hand between him and the wall , he immediately fell into the perpendicular again . It is difficult to believe that spiders have sufficient projectile force to dart out a thread of such a material to any considerable distance , and the general opinion now is , that they depend wholly upon the lightness of their thread and the agitation of the air . In the Insect Miscellanies , Mr. Rennie discusses some curious subjects connected with insects , which were not embraced in the design of his former works . One is , the manner in which insects are guided in their flight , not so much by their sight , as by the delicate nerves of their wings ; in this power resembling bats , which , as is proved by some humane experiments , can find their way as well without eyes as with them . Another is the sensibility of insects to changes of temperature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their observations of the weather . We had supposed that they equalled th' most nervous invalid in their sensibility ; ants are known to secure their eggs against the rain , and there seems to be no reason , why spiders should not be equally accurate observers . There are flowers which foretell such changes , and if such presages are necessary to the existence of the insect , doubtless their instinct supplies them . They probably are not much acquainted with causes and effects ; but instinct is the direct agency of a power which is not limited in its capacities . It is no acquaintance with the principles which govern the ordnance department , which induces the insect called the bombardier to discharge its artillery upon any insect which pursues it ; it is frequently chased by other insects , and instead of retreating , it waits till they come within point-blank shot , and then discharges its fieldl ) iece with a noise and smoke which to insects are truly alarming . In this way it will fire as many as twenty rounds , and when its ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gunner will retreat to a shelter , retiring , not with alarm , but with * very imposing front* like the Americans at Bunker lull . // Mr. Rennie adds to the curious particulars already known , concerning the manner in which grasshoppers produce and increase their sound . They apply the hind shank to the thigh , rubbing it smartly against the wino** legs . This fiddling , case , and alternately the right and left however , would not be heard at any great distance , were it not for a sort of drum at their side , which is formed with membranes suited to increase and echo the sound . The instrument upon which the male cricket plays ,  --  for , unlike the usual order of nature , the female is silent ,  --  is a pair of rough strings in the wing-cases , which they rub against each other . White of Selborne endeavored to naturalize field crickets near his house , and Mr. Rennie to introduce house crickets to his hearth ; both were unsuccessful , the insects probably haying doubts whether their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interesting works , and do credit to the Library of Entertaining Knowledge , of which they form a part , as well as to the ability of Mr. Rennie , as a naturalist and a writer . We do not expect sudden nor striking effects from thus multiplying works of popular instruction , but when they are sown broad-cast , as they are in the present day , some will take root , and produce harvests which the world does not know . To supply means of happiness ,  --  to inspire a taste and talent for observation ,  --  to teach men to pass through the world , not as strangers , but as interested to know every thing about them , though it may not be so splendid a service as many other scientific exertions , is certainly the one which will give the philos .. opher his most enviable and enduring fame.
