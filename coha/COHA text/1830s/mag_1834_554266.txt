txt THIS is a reprint of a morsel of biography , which time had made scarce , exhibiting a brief memoir of one of the earliest and most honored of the Fathers of New England , written by his successor in the ministry , and in some large measure , the successor , also , to his honors and fame . Dr. Cotton Mather , who never failed in his own way to gather what advantage he could from a name , ranked him as the first of the four celebrated Johns , * to whom was afterwards added a fifth ,  --  who , as // colleagues or successors , shone as lights in the ancient church in Boston , and in whose characters , according to their respective gifts and graces , he finds , or thinks he finds , a resemblance to their great Scriptural prototypes , the Baptist and the Evangelist . Those who are conversant with the writings of Matlier will easily believe , that the resemblance is more fanciful than real , a circumstance , which in no wise diminishes the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help from imagination , no one will deny , that these five Johns were truly good and venerable men ; the two first , the author and the subject of this niemoir , were for their genius , learning , and influence the most eminent . In having Norton for his eulogist , Cotton , therefore , found the felicity coveted by all , to whom an honorable fame is precious , laudan a lauaato viro . ' Yet had we no other evidence of Mr. Norton 's abilities but the little work before us , we should be slow to concede to him the place , which the unanimous testimony of his contemporaries , and the unquestionable merit of some of his theological productions challenge for him. * Of the specimens of biography it has been our fortune to peruse , this must be counted with the most meagre and unsatisfactory . The smallness of its size , scarcely reaching to an hundred diminutive pages , precluded ample details , but can not excuse its extreme defectiveness . It is strangely wanting in dates ,  - -  a want not felt ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , * Mr. Norton , according to Mather , was the author of the first Latin book , that ever appeared in this country ; and this , taking the less questionable testimony of Dr. John Eliot , was written in pure elegant Latin . ' It app*ars that in 1644 , Apollonius , a Dutch clergyman , in behalf of some divines of Zealand , sent to New England a number of questions concerning the forms of church government here . At the unanimous request of his brethren , Mr. Norton , then in his retired situation at Ipswich , undertook the reply , which he accomplished in the course of the following year ; and to judge of its merit we may quote , says Dr. Eliot in his biography , the words of Mr. Fuller in his Ecclesiastical History , Of all the authors I have perused concerning those opinions , none to me was more informative than John Norton , one of no less learning than modesty , in his answer to Apollonius , pastor of the church in Middleburg . ' Mr. Norton , besides several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the Orthodox Evangelist , ' highly recommended by Cotton ; and in the synod , which met at Cambridge in 1647 , lie revealed , ' says Mr. Emerson in his history of the First Church , an unusual acquaintance with school divinity . It was by him that the Cambridge Platform was modelled and recommended . ' // and next to unpardonable with a lover of accuracy , while it abounds with conceits , after the worst fashion of the pedantry of the day . Even within the narmw limits of this little book , the writer is perpetually wandering from his subject in chase of some obscure allusion or quaint resemblance , leaving his reader to find out , as he may , the year of Mr. Cotton 's birth , of his education at the University , of his ordination and ministry in Old England , and of his removal to the New . The dates of these , and other passages of like interest in the lives of any individual worthy of a memoir , are altogether omitted , to be guessed at only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accuracy , the writer does not fail to set down the precise period of the appearance of a comet , which , he instructs us , preceded the furies of the enthusiasts in Germany in 1533 . And having remarked , that we have many instances of dissension in religion , and heresies following upon these meteors , he adds , with a charity altogether in keeping with his philosophy , The genuine offspring of those enthusiastic furies is that generation commonly known by the name of Quakers . ' We do not wonder at his editor 's friendly interposition , by a note upon this passage , to excuse the somewhat doubtful theories of his author . For , as Mr. Pond observes , among the phenomena of the heavens , none have been regarded with more superstitious apprehension than comets ; and it is no discredit to such men as Cotton and Norton , that they partook of the general feeling of their age . ' * As an example of the author 's directness in relating facts , we extract the following sentences , designed to inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth .

Children are called infants of the palms , or educations , not because they are but a span in length , but because the midwife , as soon as they are born , stretcheth out their joints with her hand , that they may be more straight afterwards . This care in the parents was quickly above expectation encouraged in the first-fruits of their young son 's proficiency , more and more increasing great hopes concerning him throughout the whole time of his minority , wherein he was trained up in the grammar-school of Derby .

These , the godlyawise advise such to whom the inspection of youth is committed , to attend unto ; as spring-masters are wont to take a tryal of the vertue latent in waters , by the morning-vapors that ascend from them .

The curious eye might possibly have discovered a copy , where it has sometimes been our fortune to find old books of New England , that we had elsewhere sought in vain , in the worm-eaten trunks or ancient book-cases of octogenarians , descending as heir-looms from one generation to another , in the vicinity of that once court-end of the town , North Square , or Winnisimmet Ferry . So that , though it should not prove quite so rare as Mr. Pond supposes , * as far as scarceness makes precious it might be said to be valuable . Nor do we regret the diminution of this value , by the putting forth of a - new edition .

Whoever wishes to know the history and character of Cotton may find them far more satisfactorily exhibited in Mr. Savage 's edition of the journal of Governor Winthrop , than which few books are better fitted to instruct or delight ; in the copious memoir in the Magnalia , by Cotton Mather , who , with all his conceits , fails not either of fullness or accuracy in dates and facts ; in Emerson 's history of the First Church ; and , lastly , in the biographical dictionaries of Dr. // Eliot and of President Allen . Here , he will find at once , what he will search for in vain in this volume , all that is essential to the history of Cotton 's life . John Cotton was born in Derby , England , in 1584 ; his parents were of high respectability and reputation ; they eady discovered and cherished his gifts , and were happy in living long enough to reap the fruits of their care in witnessing the usefulness and reputation of their son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity College , Cambridge , and afterwards became a fellow of Emanuel . While there , his skill in languages , especially in the Hebrew , ( of which he gave some signal testimony during his examination , in which he translated readily the third chapter of the prophecy of Isaiah , containing the unusual terms of female dress , ) the soundness and comprehensiveness of his learning and his eloquence as a preacher gave him a commanding reputation . He was settled in 1613 , at the age of twenty-eight , in Boston , Lincolnshire , where , amidst various discouragements and persecutions , he exercised an able and acceptable ministry for twenty years . His eminent abilities and character obtained for him the favor of the Earl of Dorchester and of Bishop Williams , then also keeper of the great seal , who recommended him to the king . Even the influence of these powerful friends did not long avail to protect him from the growing hatred against non-conformists . He was compelled to flee from his , persecutors in Lincolnshire , and after concealment for some months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1633 , in company with other eminent divines , of whom were Hooker , afterwards of Newton , and Stone of Hartford . The names of these worthies , in those days of straits and conceits , suggested to their brethren the comfortable assurance , that they had now Cotton for their clothing , Hooker for their fishing , and Stone for their building . Cotton 's reputation had preceded him , and his services were of too much value not to he immediately employed . In little more than a month after his arrival , viz , in October 1633 , he was established as teacher of the First Church in Boston , and as colleague with Wilson , who was already the Pastor . Here also , amidst great reputation and usefulness ,  --  a reputation unobscured but for a short season by the part he was supposed to take in the perplexing controversy occasioned by the vagaries of Mrs. Hutchinson , in whose familistical ' or antinomiara // notions he was suspected of sympathising , and who was fain to shelter herself under the protection of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored ministry of more than nineteen years , until his death , occasioned by a cold caught in crossing the ferry to Cambridge , where he was engaged to preach . This event happened December 23 , 165 ' 2 , in the 57th year of his age , and the 39th of his ministry in both Bostons . Cotton is unquestionably to be numbered with the eminent men of his time , for he maintained , with the single exception we have mentioned , an influence in church and state over such minds as Winthrop and others , civilians as well as ministers , which would hardly have been conceded even in those days to piety only or to clerical character . Some difference , ' however , says the candid and discriminating Eliot , has appeared in the opinions expressed of this celebrated man . It has been suggested , that his character has been blazoned beyond its merits , for his biographers were Norton his friend , and Cotton Mather his grandson . Yet his learning was allowed by all his contemporaries . His piety and zeal none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , and country to enjoy the ordinances of religion . His candid spirit was not always in exercise . In the frenzy of his imagination , he sometimes blamed worthy men , and censured some , who had great claims to his respect and affection . ' In truth , he did not , like his mild and charitable colleague , Wilson , rise above the prevailing bigotry of his day ; but with most of his brother pilgrims , exemplified the observation , That when men begin to taste of Christian liberty themselves , they forget that other men have an equal title to enjoy it . ' It may be mentioned , as an evidence of the reputation in which Cotton was held , that in 1642 he was invited to England to assist in the assembly of divines at Westminster . His own inclination would have led him to accept the call , but Davenport and Hooker , with whom he was associated , were reluctant to go . The fruits of that famous assembly , as is well known , were the Confession of Faith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ascendancy in civil as well as in ecclesiastical affairs was great . He was called , ' says Emerson , * the Patriarch of New-England . ' It might almost be said , that Boston re // ceived from him its name , in honor of the place of his first ministry , and its inhabitants their laws . Governor Winthrop , though more catholic in his opinions and temper than his pastor , held him in high esteem , and on one occasion , when Cotton stood in need of it , interposed for him the powerful protection of his friendship and influence . Ia his journal ,  --  the highest authority we can adduce in the matter ,  --  that devout and accomplished magistrate bears frequent testimony to his abilities and success as a preacher . It pleased the Lord to give special testimony of his presence in the church of Boston , after Mr. Cotton was called to office there . More were converted and added to the church than to all the other churches in the Bay . Divers profane and notorious evil persons came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom of the church . Yea , the Lord gave witness to the exercise of prophecy , * so as thereby some were converted , and others much edified. ' - Winthrop 's Journal , Vo.I . P. 121 . When any question arose of doubtful expediency , or in which there appeared a diversity of opinion , Cotton seems 10 have been the common judge , or to have settled the matter by his preaching . After much deliberation and serious advice , the Lord directed the teacher , Mr. Cotton , to make it clear by the Scripture , that the minister 's maintenance as well as all other charges of the church , should be defrayed out of a stock or treasury , which was to be raised out of the weekly contribution , which accordingly was agreed upon . ' - Journal , Vol . I. And a yet more decisive instance of Cotton 's powers of persuasion , seeing that it produced an immediate change in the costume of the ladies , is recorded by Hubbard , who tells us that Cotton preached a sermon at Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they appeared in the afternoon without their veils . ' This important subject had been previously discussed at the weekly Lectures in Boston . * This exercise of prophecy , ' which seems to denote teaching from the Scriptures , or copious expositions , was practised by persons not ordained as well as by the clergy . Governor Winthrop himself often prophesied ; ' and if we should judge from his voluntary labors of this sort , when he was on his visits to Plymouth , Salem , Ipswich , &amp;c. we may infer that he was not reluctant to lend his aid to a service in which , as in all other parts of his official duty , he excelled . // Cotton there taught that where , by the custom of the place , veils were not a sign of the women 's subjection , they were not commanded by the apostle . This opinion was opposed , and the contrary maintained by Endicott , on the ground of the general arguments of the apostle . The question excited considerable debate , till the Governor , perceiving it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke off . ' it were desirable , that all controversies of similar moment , where the reason of the parties does not avail , might be quelled by a similar interposition . We have spoken of the power of Cotton 's preaching . Besides his weekly ministrations on the Sabbath , the Thursday Lecture , known to our fathers in those days when names of Pagan origin were abhorred , as the Fifth day Lecture , ' was the *rreat theatre of his power . The venerable antiquity of this service , taking precedence in its origin of Harvard University , and almost co*val with the settlement of the town ; its ancient associations ; the place it long held among the spiritual privileges and grateful remembrances of generations , that are gone ; the zeal and perseverance manifested in some memorable instances to attend it ; and the succession of eminent men , who brought thither the various stores of their learning or the fruits of their eloquence , sanctified , we trust , by an hearty zeal for truth ,  --  all unite to give to this service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the celebration of its second century by the ministers , who preach it in their turn ; and as its history throws light upon the manners of the times , we are persuaded we shall gratify at least the antiquarians among our readers , by the following graphic delineation of its origin , taken from the discourse delivered on that occasion by the Rev. Mr. Frothingham , pastor of the church in which the lecture commenced , and one of the successors of its founder . The Thursday Lecture does not only carry us back to the days of the first settlement of the country , but to the native land of our forefathers . It is connected with the old world , as well as with old times . It was preached in the English Boston by the same fervent ministry that brought it to ours . We can follow it from the fens of the Witham to the New England coast . The * A good man of lpswich used frequently , it is said , to walk to Boston , a distance of about thirty miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a journey to unite in one of Mr. Norton 's prayers . // grandson of Mr. Cotton assures us , that his famous ancestor kept " his ordinary Lecture every Thursday , " while he was under the directions of the Bishop of Lincoln , and in friendship with the noble Earl of the same title . One can not but be struck with the thought , that the eloquent voice might have been heard many and many a time rolling among the stately Gothic arches of St. Butolph 's , which came here to fill a poor meeting-house , having nothing better than mud for its walls and straw for its roof ; and that under one of the loftiest cathedral towers in Europe , lifting itself up as the pride of the surrounding country , and a landmark to them that are afar off on the sea , this very institution had its origin , which has long shown not even the vestiges of its ancient renown , but is dying under our eyes and hands a lingering death . I imagine it not only associating the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shores of the Atlantic Ocean . I hear the heavy bell calling John Cotton 's hearers together in prelatical England ; and the knell falls faintly around me of the intervening generations that have gone away one after another into silence . In returning from this digression , which some may think full imaginary enough , to the history of the beginnings of the Lecture among ourselves , the next fact that meets us is one that does not partake at all of the fanciful . It is the substantial reality of a market , set up now for the first time in this place . On the 4th of March , 1634 , as Governor Winthrop informs us , " By order of court a mercate was erected at Boston to be kept upon Thursday the 5th day of the week , being the Lecture day . " ' Again , in adverting to the aspect of the assembly at its first era . It was a meeting of all that claimed or deserved respect in the neighborhood . The magistrates were present , the Governor of the Colony with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is was followed by a convention of the people , at which municipal regulations were adopted , and questions of every kind were discussed that engaged the minds of the men of that day . " Whatever Mr. Cotton delivered , " says an historian , " was soon put into an order of court , if of a civil , or set up as a practice in the church , if of an ecclesiastical concernment . " And afterwards , when , with the progress of half a century , Boston had increased , and its thatched meeting-house had given place to a more commodious structure , On every fifth morning of the week , there is a flowing together of the people from many a mile round . The villages send // their yeomen and pastors . The walls of ilarvard College , that have risen at Newtown , contribute of its few students and fellows to swell the train . All other instruction must cease , while the lips of the benignant old patriarch Wilson , of the eloquent and commanding Cotton , of the zealous Norton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own preaching of this very Lecture to be carried to his death-bed , are dispensing diviner knowledge . The schools dismiss their pupils in the forenoon , and are kept no more that day , in order that no one may be deprived of so great a privilege . The rough weather of a climate yet sterner than it has since been , scarcely thins the assembly that comes to warm itself with fervent words and the glow of a common interest and the breath of its own crowd , in a cold place . ' The General Court , it would appear , were accustomed to adjourn their sessions that they might attend the Thursday Lecture ; and when any thing was going wrong in the Legislature , Cotton interposed with his teachings from the Word to set it right . In repeated instances they received with all docility the law from his lips , and returned to their place and legislated accordingly . There was scarcely a subject , ' says one of his biographers , affecting the civil or ecclesiastical state , which he did not discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , to the exclusion of Governor Winthrop and other influential men , who had served them faithfully in preceding years , Cotton interposed , and proved from Scripture that it was an order of Heaven to have all such business committed to the elders . Such was the weight of his authority , that he caused , on the succeeding Thursday , a new election . And on another occasion , a serious difference having arisen between the Governor , and assistants , and deputies , and ft being found they could proceed no further , the whol* court agreed to appoint a day of humiliation , when Cotton , their faithful chaplain , preached before them . He took his text , ' writes Governor Winthrop , * out of Haggai 11.4 , out of which he laid down the nature or strength of the magistracy , ministry , and people , with answer to all objections , and it pleased the Lord so to assist him , and to bless his own ordinance , that the affairs of the court went on cheerfully ; and though all were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magistrates , yet no man would say aught against it . ' It is to be observed that the great doctrine inculcated was , that the // strength of the magistracy is to be their authority ; of the peopie , their liberty ; and of the ministry their purity ; and that while each of these had a negative voice , the ultimate decision must be with the whole body of the people , whom therefore the preacher , in the true spirit of freedom , exhorted to guard their liberties against any encroachment or violence . This mingling of the politician with the pastor was altogether in accordance with the spirit of the times , and with the exigencies of the people . It would be absurd to ascribe to personal influence alone the sway thus exercised by a minister over the public mind . Much undoubtedly must be conceded to the clerical office , but more to the reverence of the Word of God , which was deeply felt by the people , and to the opinion generally entertained of the resemblance of the government of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which God himself was the ruler , and his Word , which it was the province of his servants to interpret , the law . The learning also of the first ministers of New England gave great weight to their opinions . They had most of them been educated in the Universities . They were familiar with the original langu*ges of the Scriptures . A few of them , like Cotton and Norton , had the reputation of eminent scholars , before they came hither ; and though their literature , like their theology and the books which taught them , were borrowed from schools which have passed away , it accorded with the taste of the times , and the people paid them the reverence , which learning and sanctity in every condition of civilized society will assuredly obtain . Our fathers understood the value of this influence of sound learning in the ministry . They perceived its connexion with all just spiritual power ; and it was for the preservation of it , and in their dread of an illiterate clergy , that amidst all their straits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked , in considering the sources of Cotton 's influence , that in common with some of the most distinguished of his brethren , he spoke with the authority of one , who was conscious in himseff , and was known by those who heard him , to have made signal sacrifices in the cause . In truth , none of the pilgrims , if we except a few of the highest condition , Winthrop , Johnson , and his wife the accomplished daughter of the Earl of Lincoln , had given up more . When Cotton came to New England , he left behind him family connexions of respectability ; friendship with the rich and the // great ; and the prospect of preferment in the church . He exchanged his home in a populous city , where he dw5lt in honor , for a rude settlement in a wilderness ; the stalely Gothic church of St. Butoiph , where crowds hung every sabbath upon his lips , for a poor meeting-house , more like a wigwam than a temple , having mud for its walls and straw for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole population , old men and children , young men and maidens , would hardly make up in numbers a decent assemblage . He resigned , moreover , the friendship of the Earl of Dorchester and the patronage of Archbishop Williams , who held the highest office in the kingdom , to take his lot with fellow-pilgrims and fellow-sufferers , generous and noble though they were , in the neighborhood of savages . It is true , he was driven to America by persecution , but it is equally trite , that conformity would at any moment have recovered all . Yet this he did , and still more , that he might keep peace with his conscience . When , therefore , he spoke from his humble pulpit , the people , who knew the worth of the man , ' and could estimate his sacrifices , because they had each in their measure made the same , suffered none of his words to fall to the ground . His learning they could respect , for some of them were learned themselves ; and in his piety and faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ought to share , they saw the best hopes of the Colony and the sure pledge of the blessing of God . No wonder , therefore , that when Cotton taught , the moving of his lips was with power . And whether he showed to the people the times or the things that accompany salvation , they listened with equal deference , and were ready to say with the ancient Hebrews to their Lawgiver , All that the Lord bath spoken will we do . ' There have been other periods in the history of our country , when the influence of the clergy in civil affairs was , though not so controlling , yet salutary and acceptable . During the struggles of the American Revolution , when there was a general harmony of feeling , the aid of the pulpit in the common cause of freedom was sought , and was not withheld with im* ) unity . But now that knowledge is widely diffused , and the people can judge for themselves , the day has passed when this mingling of things civil with things sacred would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of political excitement , and , as at the present day , amidst the countless divisions of party , any mingling of the Christian // teacher by preaching or by action with the strife , must be of doubtful , and in all probability of injurious tendency . He will obtain no influence from the pulpit as a politician , but at the expense of his better influence as a pastor . Those of his flock , who may differ from his opinions , will hardly yield to him the credit of superior discernment on a subject they have not called him to teach . They will be vexed at finding an influence they did not expect , and may , therefore , deem ungenerous , arrayed against themselves ; and will easily transfer their dislike of his politics to his most serious and affectionate religious exhortations . Our own times have not been without instances in confirmation of these remarks . And , even at a period , as we have seen , most favorable to such efforts , Norton himself , the author of the Memoir before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fullness of his popularity he undertook a political mission to England , and the infelicity of the result may serve as a warning to the clergy in all coming time. * It illustrates the great truth , that learning and piety are the strength of the ministry ; that the pastor , most exclusively devoted to the appropriate objects of his calling , will in general be found the most useful and blameless ; and it illustrates , moreover , the wisdom of the reply , once made by the spiritual Leighton to the complaint , that he did not , like others , preach to the times . if all the brethren preach to the times , may not one poor brother be suffered to preach on eternity ? ' We have spoken of the learning of Cotton , and of others of the clergy in the first days of New England . Next to their piety it was the strength of their ministry . And when we remember the places or prospects they resigned , and the in- * Mather , Hutchinson , and Eliot , all speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Court chose him joint agent with Bradstreet , to present the address to Charles II. , and to obtain from his majesty some privileges for the Colony . As the people had previously justified every circumstance of Cromwell 's usurpation , and commended the justice which had brought the king 's father to the scaffold , it became , ' says Dr. Eliot , a delicate and difficult business to transact . It required so much art and dissimulation* that a minister of the Gospel ought not to have been concerned in it . ' The mission itself was unsuccessful . The people blamed the agents , particularly charging Mr. Norton with unfaithfhlness ; till he began to imagine that his best friends had forsaken him . He grew melancholy , and died suddenly on a sabbath , while preparing for the afternoon exercises . // fluence which their learning might have obtained for them in the parent country , with the obscurity of their condition in this ; when we contrast what they relinquished or might have gotten there with what they encountered here , it is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . This is a sentiment rising up involuntarily from every view of the characters of the Pilgrim Fathers . Their history is one of continually fresh , as it is of exhaustless interest . The same facts , the same personages , must be exhibited , but under what variety of illustration , and forms of excellence ! And if , in the beginning of their strength , rather we should say , in the extremity of their weakness and perplexity , they valued so highly and spared no pains to perpetuate a learned ministry , * it can not be deemed of less importance at the present day , when intelligence is widely diffused , and the means of good education are within the power almost of the humblest . It is true , the people do not flow , as formerly , depend on their ministers for their knowledge . But this only makes the necessity of a thoroughly trained clergy the more urgent . For in proportion to is eminently favorable to a high standard of theological attainment . Whole denominations of Christians , who once looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become converts to more liberal views ; and are already among the foremost in endowing and sustaining their literary institutions . We heartily rejoice in this spirit , and we hope that from no false notions of expediency or economy , or wish to supply a temporary demand *in the new settlements of our country , will this standard be suffered * The following is an extract of a letter written in 1642 , and published in New England 's First Fruits . ' After God had carried us safe to New England , and we had builded our houses , provided necessaries for our livelihood , reared convenient places for God 's worship , and settled the civil government , one of the next things wee longed for and looked after , was to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity , dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches , when our present ministers should lie in the dust . And as wee were thinking arid consulting how to effect this great work , it pleased God to stir up the heart of one Mr. Harvard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among us , to give the one half of his estate , towards the erecting of a colledge , and all his librarv ' // to fall . The danger is more , we think , to be apprehended in our oldest seminaries than in the new . It should not be forgotten under any circumstances , that learning in the clergy is vital not only to the just influence of the profession , but of what is of unspeakably greater importance ,  --  to the cause of truth and charity . The sophistry of infidelity on the one hand , and the extravagancies of fanaticism on the other , can not he successfully encountered but with the help of learning . And , in general , we may he confident , that a thoroughly learned clergy will be a catholic one . We take pleasure in adducing upon this subject the sentiments of a lamented individual , * who in an omcial capacity devoted himself with his characteristic ardor of purpose to the cause of theological education , and whose testimony is the result of intelligent and faithful observation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than lowering the standard of education , in all our seminaries of learning , that without pretending to extraordinary foresight , I will venture to predict the ultimate failure of any academy , college , or theological seminary , in which the plan of a superficial education is adopted . The community will not long support an institution , which is known to pursue such a system . ' It may fairly be doubted , whether in the end any thing is to be gained for the church , by abridging for any young man a term of study , as at present settled by the soundest experience . Public opinion has declared most fully in favor of a thorough and liberal course of education for the ministry . And those institutions , which set out upon a different plan , have been compelled to change , and to conform to the model of the highest and most liberal standards . '
