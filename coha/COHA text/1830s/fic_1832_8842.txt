" On Lough Neagh 's banks as the fisherman strays . When the clear cold eve 's declining , He sees the round towers of other days , In the waves beneath him shining . " Moore . TO MISS ROCK , AN ACCOMPLISHED IRISH LADY , Whose impressive and impassioned performances on the Stage . Are only surpassed by the Feminine Virtues , WITH WHICH SHE ADORNS THE SPHERE OF PRIVATE LIVE ; THIS MELO DRAMA , To whose success her vivid and graceful personation of its heroine in TWO THEATRES , so effectually contributed , IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED ; In testimony of the admiration which her brilliant talents as an Actress , and her elegant accomplishments as a Lady , HAVE EXCITED IN THE MIND OF The Author , GEORGE PEPPER Philadelphia , June 8th , 1832 . PREFACE . In publishing the Drama of Kathleen O'Neil , it is necessary for the author to introduce it to the favour of the public , by a few prefatory observations . The materials of this play were collected partly from history , and the legends of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect which he entertains for the memory of the late Miss Balfour , of Belfast , a gifted , patriotic , and graphic authoress , who has in her spirited poetry , and eloquent prose , enlarged and enriched the manor of Irish literature , to acknowledge on this occasion , that he has borrowed from her some of the scenes and incidents , as well as the outlines of three of the characters of his play . Candour and honour invoke from him this avowal , a he has too much literary pride to deck his reputation as a writer in stolen laurels . His ambition is to soar to " honest fame , " on his own pinions . He never will plume his cap with borrowed feathers . For the flattering marks of applause , with which the audiences of the Walnut Street , and Arch Street Theatres received Kathleen O'Neil , the author must ever cherish the most grateful remembrance . In the editorial columns of the Irish Shield , he has already expressed his obligations of gratitude to the performers who represented the piece , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Walnut Street Theatre . ( the original Black Brian , ) presented a spirited portrait of the hypocrite , that displayed great breadth of drawing , brilliancy of colouring , and impressiveness of effect . Mr. Fisher , as Cormac , was highly characteristic , and in some scenes reached a charm of humour beyond the sphere of the author 's conception . Miss Rock , from the warmth of her patriotic feelings , entered into the very spirit of the character of the Ultonian Princess , and coloured her scenes with such delicate tints of sensibility and pathos , as affected the sympathy , and elicited the applause of the audience . Mrs. Turner , and the Misses Thayer and Riddle , sustained their respective parts with spirit and effect . Mr. Rowbotham , the stage manager , always a characteristic and efficient actor , made much of the little part Turloch . In Arch Street Theatre , the play was admirably performed , by an excellent cast . Miss Rock , ( who kindly volunteered her valuable services for the author 's Benefit , ) represented the heroine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager 's lady , threw a halo of conception and spirit round the character of Morna ; and Mrs. Stickney and Miss Riddle , ( the original Lady Minona , ) contributed materially to the effect of the performance . The gentlemen exerted themselves so meritoriously in sustaining the piece , that it would be invidious in the author to laud a few without awarding praise to the whole cast . In conclusion , the author would give a sketch of the plot and conduct of this drama , which is composed of a tissue of facts and fictions . The historical and legendary materials , out of which the author has wrought the Drama of Kathleen O'Neil , are these . The news of the total defeat of the English army at the battle of Bannockburn , in 1314 , by Robert Bruce , fills the Irish with joy and hope , who were then as they are now , grievously oppressed . The murder of Brain Roe , Prince of Thomond , by the De Clares and Geraldines , and the rapacious exactions of the Lord Deputy , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neils , O'Connors , Mc Mahons , and O'Briens , to madness who finding that arms alone could defend them from the aggression of despotism , they according to this persuasion , raised the standard of revolt in Connaught and Ulster , and unanimously invited Prince Edward Bruce , to assume the sovereignty of Ireland . To crush the insurrection in its infancy , Edward II . despatched Sir John Birmingham , a soldier of fortune , to Ireland , with a formidable army . On the arrival of this gallant officer in Dublin , he learns that the spirit of revolt had diffused its influence over every quarter of the kingdom . He is puzzled how to suppress the kindling insurrection . In this dilemma , he resolves to offer advantageous terms of peace of Phelim O'Neil , then , the most powerful of the Irish Princes , and to solicit the hand of his daughter , in marriage . Big with the hope of accomplishing his purpose , he repairs with a splendid retinue to the palace of O'Neil , where his overtures of peace is peremtorily rejected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his daughter . Chagrined and disappointed by the result of his mission , he is returning to the strong fortress of Ardee , in the county of Louth , when he meets on his way Black Brian , a discontented hypocrite , who assumed the garb of a hermit , to disguise the turpitude of his heart . They concert a plan for carrying off clandestinely , the Princess from her father 's castle . Meanwhile , O'Neil sets out to a distant district , to chastise a refractory vassal chieftain . Black Brian aware of the absence of his patron , conducts Birmingham , by a sub-terraneous passage , into the castle , and thence to the chamber of the Princess , whom they seize and carry off to a secret cavern , in a neighbouring forest ; surprise , grief , and consternation , seize every bosom in the castle when the Princess is missed . Her lover , the young Prince of Thomond , who had been some time in the castle disguised as a minstrel , with all the domestics go in search of the captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her captivity , at the very moment that the followers of Birmingham are preparing to remove her to the castle of Ardee . Black Brian attempts to assassinate the Prince of Thomond , by whom in the struggle , he is overpowered and bound , and then dragged to the castle a prisoner by the domestics . The Princess discovers the rank of her deliverer , in whose favour she was prepossessed , while she thought him only a wandering minstrel . The Prince O'Neil returns victorious , and is enraged and amazed , at the depravity and deception of Black Brian , whom he sentences to imprisonment for life ; and as the guards are leading him off , Birmingham provoked to fury by the hermit 's duplicity , encounters him , and after a violent combat , Brian is killed . Birmingham expresses contrition for his conduct , and O'Neil suffers him to return to the English Pale ;  --  and the play concludes by the marriage of the Prince of Thomond , and the Princess Kathleen .

The Parade ground before the fortified Castle of Ardee , several English soldiers are seen on duty , and the Lord Deputy and General Mapus appear as if in deep conference , the former holding despatches in his hand . Birmingham . Birmingham Alas ! Mapus , this is disastrous news , our whole army almost annihilated at the fatal battle of Bannockburn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I fear that the Irish will now receive succours from Bruce , to enable them to shake off our authority . General Mapus . General Mapus My Lord it behoves us to take every precaution to frustrate the designs of Bruce , and suppress revolt .  --  I think the majority of the population of Leinster is well affected to the King , but in Ulster and Connaught , we have but few holds , and should Edward Bruce effect a landing either in the North or West , we must inevitably evacuate the country . Birmingham . Birmingham I am well aware that we have but few friends in Connaught , and Ulster , and that in case Bruce carries his ambition so far as to invade this country , he will find numerous adherents to join his standard , more especially as he boasts of being descended from the Milesian Kings of Ireland . But , Mapus , though the Irish are fired with their wrongs , and the Scotch flshed with the glories of the accursed field of Bannockburn , we shall oppose them with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects of a gallant but unfortunate King . Let the insolent victors of Bannockburn come on , and they shall have from us the reception which the descendants of the Norman conquerors , are in the habit of giving their enemies . General Mapus . General Mapus My Lord it is true that we are in possession of all the fortresses in Leinster ; but if your Lordship by stratagem or treaty , could obtain some posts in Ulster , our power , in this country , would be immoveable still  --  our dominion placed on a rock of invincibility . Birmingham . Birmingham To effect that measure General , has been long the desired object of my wishes  --  but O'Neil is too vigilant to be caught in the ' toils of stratagem ; it is by treaty , alone , we must proceed .  --  Let me , Mapus , impart a secret to you ; I love to enthusiastic devotion , his beautiful daughter the Lady Catharine , to obtain whom , in marriage , would render me the happiest of men . General Mapus . General Mapus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Ireland , I think that if you make an overture of marriage to O'Neil , he will think himself honoured by the proposed alliance . Birmingham . Birmingham I am determined to hazard the trial ; if I succeed in getting her hand , I will not only reach the summit of my hopes , but render an inestimable service to my King . Let me be but the son-in-law of the Prince of Ulster , then welcome Edward Bruce , and his followers :  --  they will come as the victims of our vengeance , whom we will offer as a sacrifice to the manes of our countrymen , who fell on the fatal field of Bannockburn . General , I shall set out immediately on this embassy of love and policy . General Mapus . General Mapus My Lord shall I order out a strong guard to accompany you ? Birmingham . Birmingham No , no , there is no occasion for a guard , that would show distrust . I shall let O'Neil see that I place confidence in his proverbial honour , and thus render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rely on your caution and vigilance during my absence in Ulster . General Mapus . General Mapus I believe that your Lordship has no fears on that score  --  Go ( taking his hand , ) and may kind fortune accomplish your intentions . Exeunt L. H. SCENE II . A court yard before O'Neil 's antique castle , terminated by a terraced rampart , adjoining Lough Neagh , Footnote : 3Kb  --  Music . Enter O'Connolly , Cormac , and Attendants , as if from the chase . R. H. O'Connolly . O'Connolly O me ! what a long and difficult chase we have had , over moor and mountain ? He seems exhausted . Cormac . Cormac Yes by Jove , father , we have had hot work of it , and the shafts of the Lady Kathleen , seemed directed by the hand of a Diana ;  --  why she has slain more deer to day , than would feed the Augustine monastery of Armagh , at Shrovetide . O'Connolly . O'Connolly Oh fy !  --  peace Cormac ! speak reverently of sacred things . Cormac . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friars sacred things indeed ! Truly , I fear they may with more propriety be called profane , as they are so carnally set . O'Connolly . O'Connolly Cormac , Cormac ! thy tongue runs before thy wits . Say nothing of the men of God . Cormac . Cormac Better my tongue run away from my wits , than my wits run away from my tongue . I can tell you , father , that these same Friars , can empty a flagon of Burgundy , and devour a haunch of venison , as quick as other folks . Let them alone sir , for draining glasses , and dissecting joints , ha ! ha ! O'Connolly . O'Connolly Truce sirrah ! Dare not to speak so irreverently of the sacred clergy , I think you have taken leave of your senses .  --  Forbear this impiety ! Cormac . Cormac I shall say no more , father , but I can assure you that my five senses were near abandoning me this morning  --  when my horse took flight opposite the hermitage of Black Brian .  --  I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man .  --  The cry of the Banshee is not half so awful father as his scowl . Footnote : 2Kb O'Connolly . O'Connolly Black Brian indeed inspires awe ,  --  but the life of this immaculate pilgrim is so virtuous , and sanctified , that his benediction confers happiness . Cormac . Cormac Awe ! it goes deeper than awe with me , for it excites the sensation of dread . I can not at all fathom this stern anchorite , there hangs a dark cloud of mystery on the man ; which with all my ingenuity , ( and thank my stars I have a tolerable stock , ) I never have been able to penetrate . Then his dark scowling brow , peeping from under his ample hood , and his sudden appearance when he is least expected , ( looks round fearfully , ) heaven knows but he may be at my elbow now ; no , safe for once . O'Connolly . O'Connolly Hush ! Cormac he has a fairy ear  --  silence ,  --  let us not meddle with the man as it might subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time remember , when he first appeared among us , though whence he came , or why , no one could ever learn . I do not think even the Prince is acquainted with his history . Cormac . Cormac One thing , however , is certain , that I have often seen him in the castle , when to obtain entrance , he must have crept through the key hole ; he is certainly a necromancer whom I fear . First Attendant . First Attendant Why the holy pilgrim could walk at the bottom of the lake without being wetted ; the doors would themselves unbar at the approach of so sanctified a man  --  Oh he is piety itself ; his penances are edifying , his fasts the theme and delight of the whole country . Cormac . Cormac A newly invented species of delight truly ! and one in which I have no wish to participate , particularly as a principal . Give me fat mutton and Ennishowen whiskey , and I shall never envy the pilgrim his luxury of water cresses , and draughts of limpid springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privation that a young fellow like me could suffer ,  --  flesh and blood can not bear it . First Attendant . First Attendant But see the reward of his pious abstinence , the fairies and spirits of darkness are subject to his power , and he can foresee what will happen a hundred years hence , as plainly as I see your face . Cormac . Cormac I have no ambition to be acquainted with the spirits of darkness , but I shall go to the buttery and taste some of the gay and enlivening spirit of whiskey , and if that does not inspire me with the gift of prophecy , it will at least kindle the sparks of hilarity and good humour . I am fully satisfied to take things as they come , without wishing to dive into the waters of futurity . First Attendant . First Attendant I would not offend that hermit for all the territories of our Prince . All the Attendants . All the Attendants Nor I , nor I , nor I , &c.; O'Connolly . O'Connolly He is certainly an extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and works of charity , so that we should all speak well of him ; but ha ! who have we here ?  --  Enter Prince of Thomond , disguised as a harper , he appears exhausted as if from fatigue . L. H. Cormac . Cormac Why son of song , you seem to have travelled far , but know that the bards are welcome always to the hall of O'Neil , here hospitality is enlivened by the voice of kindness ; but from what part of this fair isle hast thou come , good minstrel ? Thomond . O'Brien My journey has been long and tedious , though cheered by the kind hospitality that distinguishes our country . From where the majestic Shannon mingles with the Western Ocean have I wandered .  --  During my progress I have sometimes fared sumptuously in the castle of the chieftain , and pleasurably in the cot of the peasant : for the rites of hospitality are as religiously observed in the one as in the other . In each the stranger is received with a warm welcome , and dismissed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the misfortune of losing my way , and have been straying amidst your glen and defiles , unable to get forward , until the sound of your hunting horns attracted me hither , to the castle of the chivalric O'Neil . Cormac . Cormac Oh Lord ! Father , if this is not the same harper that diverted us all last Michaelmas , with his tales of Fingal and Ossian , and his beautiful songs of the triumphs of Nial the great :  --  Yes and it was he that saved the Lady Kathleen from being drowned in the boating match to Gartree point . O'Connolly . O'Connolly I was then absent with our heroic Prince . Cormac . Cormac And the greater was your loss ; for his heart moving mirth would chase away the tears from the cheek of a Niobe , he has certainly a charm for turning the weeping into the laughing philosopher ; his jokes stretched my mouth two inches wider , I laughed so much . Thomond . O'Brien Report speaks loudly of the Prince 's virtues . Cormac . Cormac It does him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm . His virtues are I grant noble ; though now and then a dark cloud of choleric passion passes over his aspect . O'Connolly . O'Connolly ' T is his brave and magnanimous spirit , that " ever and anon " breaks forth ; but where will you find his equal ? In war a lion ,  --  in peace a lamb ; his ample board ever spread for the succour of the hungry wanderer , his sword ever drawn but in the defence of the oppressed ; his philanthropic bosom , the shrine of truth , and his word sacred as the inviolable oath that angels have registered in the records of heaven ! Cormac . Cormac Yes father , we have all pretty good reason to be convinced of that , for if he should once , even by accident , happen to say , " Cormac you must remove this castle , " as it would be rather cumbersome for one back load , he would make me carry it stone by stone , till I had lodged it in the bottom of the lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gallant Phelim is firm , but his firmness is not the offspring of capricious obstinacy , it is the result of cureless sorrow ; for the loss of his gallant son , who fell in the glorious battle of Dundalk , were the Saxons of the pale were routed , which has thrown a veil of melancholy over his countenance ; but where is perfection to be found , if not in Phelim ? Cormac . Cormac In my mind , a great deal more likely to be found with the Lady Kathleen , that peerless paragon of beauty and benignity ; her amiable goodness is the softened image of her sire ; she is in alabaster , what he is in marble , possessing his firmness without his inflexibility ,  --  his noble nature without his overbearing pride ;  --  he is the oak of the forest fitted to resist the wintry tempest ; she is the blossom of the peach tree , whose perfume breathes upon the vernal breeze and embalms every passing gale . Her sister the Lady Minona is also a sweet charming creature ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , in the great battle in Scotland , and she sighs so mournfully , and sings so sadly , that she chokes my breath , like the fog from the lake on a misty morning ,  --  oh Kathleen for me . Thomond . O'Brien You speak eloquently and warmly on this subject , young man . ( Down ye feelings of a jealous heart , aside . ) O'Connolly . O'Connolly Minstrel , my son 's language is dictated by truth ,  --  she is like a beautiful temple which the image of the deity inhabits . Thomond . O'Brien She has , then , doubtless , many suitors ? O'Connolly . O'Connolly She has indeed , and among them potent Princes . Thomond . O'Brien And one is favoured by the lady , of course . O'Connolly . O'Connolly It is said , she prefers Prince Edward Bruce , who is daily expected at the castle , but it becomes not me to speak of my chieftain 's daughter . Cormac . Cormac I should be very sorry if it did not become me , for I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he preached last lent , against the abomination of golden bodkins and red petticoats ; but the truth is , though Lady Kathleen 's eyes have set fire to many a warrior 's passion , and that the sweet blandishment of her smile has fascinated more noble captives , than her father took in battle from the English of the Pale , her own heart , like the shield of Achilles , is invulnerable , and no hero has yet been so fortunate as to impress it with the seal of love , ( Flourish of Trumpets . ) O'Connolly . O'Connolly Hark the Prince is coming this way ,  --  peace Cormac ; you chatter like a magpie . Cormac . Cormac But you never father , heard so eloquent a magpie before .

O'Connolly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chase always cheers my spirits , the sound of the horn animates my old heart , and brings back to my mind the remembrance of the happy days of my youth ;  --  ah ! it is pleasant to think of the past ; but here , my lord , is a harper , who has just arrived , and who seeks from your highness , the rites of hospitality . Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil ( Aside . ) Ha ! as I live , its the minstrel that saved my life .  --  Be still my throbbing heart ,  --  what strange , yet pleasing sensations agitate my feelings . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil They are granted , the hall of O'Neil was ever the refuge of genius ; there the voice of song was never silent .

( Harper bows . ) Enter Carryl . ( L. H. ) Carryl . Carryl I seek your highness  --  this moment a messenger from the chief Lord of the English Pale , announces his speedy arrival , his courier says , that he demands audience of you , and of the Lady Kathleen .

Ellen Why to be sure they say love is blind ; but I expect the good old sibyl does not owe the loss of sight to that cause solely ; I question whether she could distinguish even with spectacles , between a peach and a potatoe , unless she tasted them . Cormac . Cormac She has distinguished me however , and that is a convincing proof of her keen discernment . Ellen .

Cormac . Cormac Dear Ellen , a truce , you know that you alone reign in my heart . Ellen . Ellen Yes , and afterwards you may come as a ghost you know , to my bed side , to upbraid the faithless Ellen . Cormac . Cormac Ellen say what you will , nothing but the happiness of possessing you , would make life worth enjoying . Ellen .

Lady Kathleen O'Neil This sacred act of devotion has tranquilized my soul ; I rest in calm serenity , and something tells me that my father will return in triumph ; and that happiness will once more glow in the hearts , and beam on the faces of his children . But this minstrel , why do I so often think of him .  --  Why is his image enshrined in my thoughts ?

Lady Kathleen O'Neil Cormac is a faithful and devoted domestic , but he can not be placed in comparison with the graceful minstrel , Morna . Morna . Morna Why I grant he is not so engaging in conversation , nor so tall in stature , as the young minstrel , but he can make such pretty verses on love , and sing like a black bird in May , and prattle like a magpie in harvest , ( sighs affectedly , ) oh ! since poor Rory died my lady , I never met his equal !

Never can I love any man but this minstrel , but my love must be sacrificed to the pride of birth and prejudice . If the daughter of O'Neil were to wed a nameless and birthless minstrel , she would sully the aristocratic renown of her regal family , and break the heart of a beloved father .

Still , still I 'm thy symbol , prophetic I view it  --  Futurity 's curtain is raised to my eyes ; A flash from the past sheds a brilliancy thro ' it , And visions of wretchedness darkly arise . Chill , gloomy , and drear , frowns the prospect before thee , A cloud fraught with treason and bandage breaks o'er thee , The stranger , the Saxon  --  they pillage  --  they gore thee  --  They blast every flowret of freedom and thee .

Ellen . Ellen If my love were not greater than her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adonis , Cormac occupies my whole thoughts and affections . Oh , may angels guard him in his adventure . Exit . ACT III .  --  SCENE I. The front of Turloch 's castle ,  --  Drawbridge and Portcullis . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil ( Without . ) Now , my brave fellows , that we have passed the ramparts , let justice be our watch word ,  --  on ! on ! up to the walls , strike for victory !  --  sound the war cry of Nial the Grand . ( They all shout , ) Huzza ! for O'Neil ! hurah ! for the red branch . Music , as he and his soldiers rush on to storm is the castle , the gates are suddenly thrown open : and Dermot , a bard , dressed in the habit of his order , enters , bearing in his hand , a green branch , as the symbol of peace , which he presents to the Prince . Dermot . Dermot Hail , puissant Prince of Ulster ,  --  hail , illustrious descendant of the hero of the nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your salutation , Dermot ; but what is the import of your mission ,  --  will Turloch hold out ? Speak ! quickly , venerable bard . Dermot . . He knows thou comest to seek redress for O'Cahan , and yields to thy command . Yet let not your highness imagine , that it 's fear that actuates him , no ! that feeling never throbbed in his bosom ; indeed his valour and courage , at the battle of Dundalk , under your own eye , leave no ground for questioning his courage . But the lofty soul of the chief , is sometimes the prey of passion ; still he is ever prompt to deplore his faults , and to make such an atonement for them , as is consistent with honour . Thy lands , ( to O'Cahan , ) young chief , shall be restored to thee ; and Turloch will prove himself more the object of pity than of blame , in all that concerned the tragic fate of thy brother . Thou , renowned Prince , shalt witness the faithful performance of this promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality , deign to share with him the rosy cup of peace  --  and then the dulcet sounds of the harp , will prove more agreeable to your soul than the discordant blast of the clarion of mars . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil O'Cahan what sayest thou ? Will this offer satisfy you ? O'Cahan . O'Cahan I wait the pleasure of your highness .  --  Your decision is mine . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil Son of tuneful harps , thy voice has dispelled the cloud that portended disaster to thy chief ;  --  thou hast quelled the tempest that was about to burst annihilation upon his head .  --  Go , minstrel , and tell him that I consent ; for I came but to procure the terms he offers . Wherefore , then , should I draw the sanguinary sword , when by accepting his submission , I can spare the effusion of human blood ? Dermot . Dermot These sentiments are such as accord with the feelings of a true Milesian hero , as humanity , is the brightest attribute of the knights of the red branch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emulate your magnanimity , then , never should the falchion be unsheathed , but to defend the land of our sires , to maintain our liberties , or to protect beauty from insult and violence . But let me lead your highness to the chief . Music .  --  Exeunt into the castle , as they approach the door , the soldiers give a shout of triumph . SCENE II . A Gothic hall ,  --  a grand banquet , ladies and minstrels stand in groups to receive the Prince . Turloch discovered seated on a chair of state , behind which his standard bearer elevates his ensign.  --  Music .  --  Phelim , O'Cahan , and soldiers , introduced by the bard . Turloch rises and advances to receive the Prince , while the ladies and the minstrels make obsience . Turloch . Turloch More Welcome my liege Lord , to whom I owe fealty ,  --  welcome to my nephew 's castle . O'Cahan ! I also greet you with a welcome  --  the soldiers of the great O'Neil , are likewise all welcome to my presence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , and I rejoice that such is our cordial meeting ; and that amenity and reparation are about to extinguish the torch of discord , but let us hear , Turloch , how you can exculpate yourself . Turloch . Turloch More First , great chief , ( pointing to the table , ) partake of my homely banquet . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil Not yet :  --  thou didst propose to clear thyself from the charge of murder , which this noble youth preferred . I can not join you at the altar of hospitality , or pledge thee in the friendly goblet , until after thou hast wiped off the sullying stain , by proving thy innocence . Turloch . Turloch More And I will prove it beyond a doubt .  --  O'Cahan 's brother was my early friend  --  And might have still been such but for a villain ; Some trifling cause he had of discontent  --  For many days he came not to the castle . Urged by the vile inventions of a wretch Then in my court , I sent an ample guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( pauses much affected . ) Meanwhile , his murderer besought his lands ; I would not grant them , though I blamed him not , But think what dread conviction flashed on me , When this same miscreant assailed my life ! Too plainly , then , I saw O'Cahan 's fate ! The villain fled  --  nor could I trace him since , Until lately I heard it rumoured that he dwells In the vicinity of your castle , disguised in a hermit 's garb .  --  Phelim . Phelim O'Neil Heavens ! can it be possible ? No , no , Black Brian 's sanctity is not assumed ; he is a man of virtue .  --  Dare he impose himself on my patronage in a fictitious character ? Turloch . Turloch More I was just about setting out , in quest of that diabolical hypocrite . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil And if my lands , or courts , contain such a monster , he shall be yielded up directly to the punishment of justice . From me , an impostor need not expect clemency . O'Cahan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will renew to thee my oath of fealty , in presence of our superior Prince . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil I am truly happy that reconciliation has cancelled your difference , for dissension , has been the ruin of our country , it has been the prolific source of all our evils ; it was this demon that invited the English invaders to our shores , and prostrated us under the galling weight of oppression . O'Cahan . O'Cahan But , Prince , thank Ultonian valour , the English lion never impressed the sacred patrimony of Nial the Grand , in Ulster , with his accursed paws . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil No , chieftain , if Leinster and Munster , had evinced the bravery of Ulster and Connaught , Henry the Second , and all his followers , would have found a grave in Ireland .  --  But the fatal beauties of the Queen of Breffeny , produced as direful disasters in Erin , as those of Helen did in Troy .  --  But O'Cahan come forward and renew your allegiance to Turloch , as your Lord paramount , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phelim walks forward , his soldiers range themselves round . All draw their swords and hold them in an elevated position . O'Cahan kneels , puts his hands between those of Turloch . O'Cahan . O'Cahan ( Bending forward , ) To be true to thee in peace and war ,  --  to fight thy battles , when lawfully summoned , and bear thee true allegiance , saving the rights of the Prince of Ulster ,  --  all this to perform , I swear by the order of knighthood , conferred upon me by the Prince . Music , kisses the hilt of Turloch 's sword . All sheath their swords , and range themselves round the table . Turloch . Turloch More Now , my Lord , I pray you to partake of our cheer . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil Chieftain , I shall and gladly . ( seats himself . ) Turloch . Turloch More O'Cahan , you must pledge me in a cup of reconciliation . O'Cahan . O'Cahan You do me honour chieftain . They all fill their goblets . Turloch . Turloch More Then , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our native shamrocks , let us drink the draught of renewed friendship , and alliance ; and may the bosom of our mother , dear Erin ! the land of song and story ! be never lacerated by the strife of her sons . They drink .  --  Flourish . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil It is a patriotic sentiment , worthy of an Irish heart , and may it be followed by eternal harmony and concord ,  --  for it was disunion heralded Saxon despotism into this dear country ; were it not for that destructive hydra , the standard of Fingal , and Brian Boroihme , instead of the hated ensign of Saxon oppression , would now wave in the breeze , on the round towers of Erin . Dermot . Dermot Oh Prince , how you bring back to memory the days of our glory , the immortal deeds of our heroes , who , under that harp emblazoned banner , which Ossian denominated the " Sun-beam of Battles , " vanquished Roman legions in Caledonia , and wreathed themselves in the laurels of eternal renown , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come Dermot , like Ossian , gladden our ears with the voice of song  --  raise the strains of fame and celebrate the glories of our illustrious guest .

I would my daughter were here ,  --  she would be charmed by thy skill and thank thee . Turloch . Turloch More Her thanks could not fail , Prince , of giving him new inspiration , as the applause of a lovely woman serves to kindle the rays of genius , the enthusiasm of poetry , and the flame of eloquence . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil Chief , thou art gallant . When thou visitest my castle , she shall present thee with a cup of mead , to drink the health of thy favourite Lady . Black Brian . Black Brian ( Rising among the bards . ) Ha ! the gale of inspiration breathes upon me ,  --  the fox has stolen into the den of the lion ! Turloch .

Phelim . Phelim O'Neil Explain thyself in intelligible language .  --  Black Brian . Black Brian Better for thee , Prince , my lips were not yet unsealed  --  she melts  --  she vanishes ! Never more shall the hand of thy Kathleen grace thy banquet , nor gladden thy rising soul with the light of song ! ( gesticulates wildly. ) she struggles in the billows of despair , she implores her father 's help !

Dermot ( aside . ) All the poets subject to mad fits ! by the Lyre of Apollo , that is a fine character to give men of genius ! But the spleen shall find no room in my mind this night , as good wine , is better than all the composing draughts in the apothecary 's shop . My heart is as light as a feather , and my ideas quite in the epic order . ( Rises and struts about . ) Dance . Enter Carryl , hastily . ( R. H. ) Carryl .

Phelim O'Neil Yes , Turloch , come ; but arm quickly : the English must have stormed my castle , and made captives of my daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vengeance !  --  Now if ere you loved me prove it , my friends , by your speed  --  all that I hold most precious is at stake ! and he who first shall reach the castle , gains the richest gift in my possession .

A rocky ravine , with an aparture of a cavern , partially concealed by the branches of wild briar and holly  --  music soft . Enter Thomond , ( advancing towards the cavern , ) Thomond . O'Brien This is the entrance to the abode of hypocrisy . Let me but find the villain and I will make him confess , else by this sword he shall die . Dearest Kathleen ! fair and fond object of my first love ! if thou art dead , or dishonoured , my fate is determined ,  --  in death alone I will seek happiness !

Oh ! no :  --  the night of despair hangs its clouds dismally around me , and every ray of hope has vanished . By all my hopes of joy and love , it is she  --  it is my beloved Kathleen ! Let me seek thee bright goddess of my affections . ( He proceeds through the cavern and in a few moments returns , bearing up the Lady Kathleen . ) Kathleen .

O'Brien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue so much beauty and loveliness , as you possess , from the fangs of treachery , is an honour of which I must be ever proud , as forming the happiest occurrence of my life .  --  Yes , Lady , this event shall be remembered as the brightest vision , among the few which memory may reflect upon , that cheerlessness of sinking existence . Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil ( aside . ) Why was not his birth as noble as his sentiments ?  --  ( aloud , ) poets , sir , are generally too flattering in their compliments .  --  But surely it was providence that sent you hither to my deliverance , and now that I again breathe the balmy breeze of liberty , let us away , for I fear Birmingham will return and intercept our progress . Thomond . O'Brien Birmingham ! was it he Lady ? Gracious God ! could an English Peer , nay , an English soldier act so base ? I thought it was the base man , Black Brian . Kathleen .

Lady Kathleen O'Neil Minstrel , I pray you lead me to the castle , there shall my father 's bounty faintly prove how highly he will rate the obligation which we owe you . Thomond . O'Brien I know his noble nature well ,  --  ( aside , ) if I possessed her , the rewards of Empires , could not add to my felicity . Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil For me I can not use a language sufficiently eloquent to express my sense of gratitude , or make my tongue the interpreter of the feelings that warm my heart . Teach me but how I can reward you best , and life itself is not too rich a ransom !  --  For life and honour I owe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but my tongue refuses to be the herald of my heart  --  In silence it must be buried . Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil Oh , name it sir ,  --  say how I can requite your services ! Thomond . O'Brien Lady I dare not  --  ' t is too bold a suit sighs Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil Be it what it may  --  speak , and thy boon is granted .  --  Thou canst not ask for more than I owe thee ( Aside . ) Oh ! that he were of a noble family , my heart and hand should be his reward . Thomond . O'Brien ( Aside . ) I must now declare my passion though I feel more dread at doing so , than if I were to encounter a batallion of Birmingham 's cross-bow-men. ( aloud . ) Lady I adore , I love thee . ( Kneeling . ) Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil Rise sir !  --  This is too bold a suit indeed ! I do not wonder at thy hesitancy . ( ( With lofty dignity . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound thee with harsh remembrance of our different stations , but since thou hast presumed upon thy services , I must remind thee , I am the daughter of a royal Prince , and one of the heiresses of his fortunes , and his name ,  --  that name so revered by Irishmen , and so emblazoned on Erin 's annals , shall never be tarnished by me , I will still preserve it free from stain , even as the hallowed relic of my sire . Thomond . O'Brien ( Aside . ) She never looked so charming her air so dignified , her cheeks so flushed , exhibit the grace of a Queen , and the ideal attractions of pictured beauty  --  Oh ! first of Erin 's daughters , how each word adds to my love , respect , and awe ! Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil Yet let me still be just  --  were such thy birth , as would not raise the blush upon my cheek ,  --  I care not for possessions ,  --  but would share whatever my father could bestow , with thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . Thomond . O'Brien The recording page of our history , Lady , furnishes examples of bards wooing , and winning Milesian Princesses ,  --  therefore , I will rest my hopes , on your compassion , and indulge the blissful expectation that the sensibility , and goodness of my Lady 's heart , will yet preponderate in my favour , and surmount the barrier that feudal pride would oppose to love . Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil These examples , sir , I shall not follow , though you would gild them with historical authority . No more on this painful subject , unless you wish to cancel my gratitude by offending me . But let us fly from this hated spot . Thomond . O'Brien ( Throwing off his minstrel 's habit . ) Stay one moment Lady  --  view me as I am  --  no wandering minstrel , but Thomond 's chief , the ally and kinsman of your gallant father . Long , in my father 's hall , on the flower enamelled banks of the Shannon , the bards had sung the praises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beautiful , and intellectual . That I might see thee in thy native lustre  --  see thee divested of the mask of court disguise , I took this minstrel garb , sought thy presence , and found the original in grace and loveliness , superior to the picture which the bards presented of thee in their encomiums. ( kneeling . ) Lady I love you with as warm an ardour , as ever glowed in a lover 's heart ; but I will not again urge my suit , until it be sanctioned by your own consent , and thy father 's smile ,  --  Ah ! Lady , let the smiling rays of thy blue eyes brighten my hopes . Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil surprise had struck me dumb ! Rise Prince , when the full heart can not express its feelings , silence assumes the power of eloquence , and speaks unutterable things . Thomond .

Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian ! save me from his ruthless power , I conjure you ! Thomond . O'Brien Fear not my love , this arm will now not only protect thee , but avenge thy wrongs . Black Brian . Black Brian ( aside . ) One glorious effort , and the prize is mine . I have nothing to fear from the struggles which the bard may make to save her , as like all poets , he can compose heroic stanzas , better than he can perform heroic actions . ( Aloud . ) Resign the Lady , minion of the muses ! or else I shall send you harping to Pluto ! Thomond . O'Brien Base wretch ! I shall resign my life first ! Away ! thy blood is not worthy of my sword , low born peasant ! Black Brian . Black Brian then rash boy , to this sword yield it . Music .  --  Black Brian rushes on him , but he parries his thrust , they encounter each other with fury . Kathleen looks on the combat with fear and terror . They close and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Cormac , and followers enter , who immediately seize and manacle him .  --  Cormac seems amazed on viewing the Princely dress of the minstrel . Thomond .

Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil ( Taking his arm . ) Twice brave Prince , hast thou risked thy life for me , and in future , mine shall be devoted to the pleasing task of making you happy ; here is my hand , my heart is already in your possession . Thomond . O'Brien Dearest kathleen ! now the measure of my happiness is full of joy . ( kisses her . ) Cormac .

Phelim . Phelim O'Neil What means this spectacle which I see ?  --  Why is the pious hermit , Brian , guarded ? Speak , and unravel all this mystery ? Kathleen . Lady Kathleen O'Neil That best can I , father :  --  This vile hypocritical wretch , in collusion with Birmingham , forced me from the castle . O'Connolly . O'Connolly For heaven 's sake Lady , through what door , or aperture did they convey you ; for surely the old necromancers that practiced their deceptions on our Milesian ancestors , could not have passed out that night unknown to Patrick O'Connolly .

It was I who slew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid he loved .  --  Foiled in these hopes , I would have slain the chieftain ,  --  part in revenge , because he spurned my suit  --  but more , because I would be chief myself . Start not , Turloch , it was noble to conceive the thought ! That I had talents , I was proudly conscious ; and had I succeeded in seating myself in the castle of O'Cahan , who would have dared to say , " What placed thee there ? " Turloch . Turloch More Oh ! what an expanded mind thou hast destroyed ! Hadst thou been virtuous , thou hadst been immortal ? Minona .

It was I that caused your war horse to plunge  --  ' t was I that , midst the castle 's festive scene , chaunted a Banshee strain , that awed and terrified every mind except your own . Phelim .

Why does our ancient Brehon statutes forbid the shedding of Milesian blood . The wise and equitable laws of the sage Brehons , were the laws of Ireland for ages , and gave liberty and protection to her sons . Violate them not , Prince , your illustrious ancestors held them sacred , and during their existence Erin was , what I hope she will soon be again .  --  great , glorious , free , and independent . Phelim . Phelim O'Neil Hear then our sentence .  --  bear him hence to prison , there let a pious Priest attend him daily , and if his prayers shall lead him to repent , release him , but till then securely guard him .

Birmingham Who art thou , stripling , that so insultingly offers to become the Lady 's champion ? Thomond . O'Brien The son of a Prince , that never lowered the standard of Erin , before the ferocious lion of England . I am the heir of that regal Thomond , whom your countrymen basely murdered , and I have long wished for an opportunity of measuring swords with thee . Come to yonder ramperts , and try what virtue there is my Lord , in Irish steel .  --  Your conduct to this Lady was that of a coward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is me he must encounter in personal combat , ( Kathleen and Minona , evince fright and agitation , ) an O'Neil never gave way even to a lover , in avenging the insults offered to his child .
