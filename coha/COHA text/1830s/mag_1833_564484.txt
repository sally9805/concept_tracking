txt Tun existence of slavery , within the boundaries of this republic , is rapidly becoming more than a curious solecism ; and out of it will soon arise a question , on the solution of which the future fate of the Union must hinge . It is in vain to put far off the evil day ; it is in vain that we try to shut our eyes upon the momentous questions growing out of this subject ; it becomes the patriot to grapple with it ; to study the character of the dark storm which is gathering in our political horizon , and to see if no means can be found to conduct harmless to the earth the bolts with which it is charged . One of the best means of doing this is a candid discussion of the subject by // patriotic and disinterested men of different sections of the country . The following letter on slavery was written in answer to one from a gentleman of influence , of stern patriotism , and enlightened mind , iii North-Carolina * My dear SirYour letter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for in it you have broached a subject , about which every American , every republican , and every philanthropist must be exceedingly anxious . On the solution of the question about the ABOLITION OF SLAVERY depends more than the private interests of the planter , more than the sectional interests of the South ) and more , even , than the general interests of these United States . The great question now in agitation , and soon to be brought  --  to issue in Europe between the oppressed and the oppressor , of the possibility of substituting cheap , simple , and representative governments , for the present ruinous and galling systems , depends , in a great measure , upon the continuance or non-continuance of the prosperity of this UNION ; and this depends mainly upon the permanent continuance , or non-continuance of slavery . You , who know as well as I do , with what anxiety and with what pride the progress of the great experlment , which this country is making , is watched by the Radical in England , the Republican in France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  you , at least , will agree with me , that we have other and higher duties , and should have other and higher aims than as mere Americans ; as men , as members of the great human family , it is our imperative duty to do all we can to lighten the burdens and to break the fetters of those of our brethren who are sitting in intellectual darkness , and bowed under physical oppression . And you , who have witnessed the misery and the degradation , the hopes and the fears , of the people of the old world , will not think me extravagant when I say , that the example of these United States may have more influence upon the future destinies of Europe , Asia , and Africa , than any other moral agency which can be put in operation . Our country will soon attain that commercial importance , and that political influence , which will make her example of the greatest consequence to mankind at large ; as yet , she has been known only to the men of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulity by the people of the western nations ; while those of the eastern parts , the Hungarian , the Bohemian , many of the Germanic , and all of the Sclavonic race , are ignorant of more than her name and her existence . It nlust not be a light , throwing forth few and feeble rays , that will dispel the political darkness brooding over the old world : that of the little republic of San Marino , though fed by the purest patriotism , was suffered to burn unheeded in Italy , because of its insignificant size ; ours has been suffered , because its distance , its former diminutiveness , and the interposition of the waste of waters , made it equally insignificant . But when our twelve millions shall become fifty millions-when our commerce shall surpass that of Great-Britain -- then will our country become the great and shining light on which all those , who , sitting in the darkness of oppression , shall gaze with admiration and with longing ; // and if our institutions are preserved in their purity , our history will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pointing out to them the promised land of republicanism . There will then be no concealing or denying the fact , that the people of these United States , under the simplest and cheapest government in the worldwithout kings or priests-without the bayonet or the police-without the genius of diplomacy , or the gaining of conquest , have attained political independence , and respect from abroad , while they have been preserved fron civil wars or domestic oppressions , and become the most intelligent , the richest , and happiest people on earth . There is no denying that this will be the case , provided we escape from the fangs of the monster , party ; provided the people will understand their true interests , and not sacrifice them and those of their posterity upon the altars of faction , at which minister demons in shape of men-men who , for their own personal aggrandizement , would hazard the destinies of unborn millions . I say. , if this Union can be preserved lifty years , it will do more for Europe than all the tongues of her orators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her patriots ; our country will so rise in importance , that people must see and know her ; they will see her on the pinnacle of national prosperity , in the enjoyment of liberty , and wealth , and knowledge ; and they will say- " In God 's name , let us too try the experiment-let us too go through the fiery ordeal of blood and revolution , if that be necessary ; for we can not be worse off by the change than we are now. ** If such reflections as these are not extravagant , how important is it , that every citizen of this republic should not only throw aside all sectional or party feelings , but even those exclusive feelings , misnamed patriotism , which induce men to look upon the interest and the glory of their own country , as things to be advanced even at the expense of the misery and misfortune of the rest of the world . The influence of these United States , may yet become immense , and it behoves her citizens that all of it be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of the human race , in its course toward the nearest possible attainment of political , moral , and intellectual perfechon . You may think I am wandering strangely from the subject matter of your letter ; perhaps I am , but the digression is perfectly natural , and I have fallen into it unwittingly . You ask me for information about the feeling of New-England , with regard to the means of removing the evils of slavery ; and you particularly inquire about the extent and respectability of the sect called Abolitionists . I meddle with no party matters , but I have endeavored to procure all the information in my power on this subject , and , luckily for the latter part of your question , it is one easily answered . Descended , as you are , from the pilgrims of New-England , it would be supererogatory to explain to you the sentiment of our community , with regard to the question of slavery : my own private feelings , you probably know ,  --  they are those of utter abhorrence of a system which violates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and were the slaves of the South now in general insurrection , and in open war with the whites , and were I forced to choose one side or the other , I would join the insurgents , and strike with them for the rights of man ; and , though father and // brother were in the opposing ranks , still would I strike for the liberty of the human race . But think not , my dear sir , though such are my principles , that I am an Abolitionist , in the ordinary sense of the word ; think not that I view the planters in the light of tyrants and ruthless oppressors ; no I rather feel for and commiserate with them , than condemn them ; I deprecate an insurrection of the slaves , as the most serious misfortune that could happen both for blacks and whites ; and werelan African , I should hold that man an enemy of my race , who would preach insurrection , or advocate immediate and unconditional abolition . In common with almost every intelligent New-Englander of my acquaintance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most embarrassing one ; I condemn them not so much as J sympathize with them ; I look upon slavery as the real cause of the difference between the prosperity of the slave-holding and the non-slave-holding States ; and I believe the time will come , when all the planters will be convinced of it . But so far from any wish to dictate the measures to be pursued with respect to the slaves , I not only feel none such , but I believe we have no sort of right to interfere in the business . Nay , more ; I believe that by any such interference , we should produce much evil , without any corresponding good ; I believe we should injure the cause of the Africans , and retard the epoch of the total abolition of slavery . On this subject , my own feelings and opinions , though little worth of themselves , may be of some interest to you , because I am thought to carry them rather farther than most men here : I can not be considered as a representative of l'extrenre gauche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that there is force enough in truth , and virtue enough in man , to produce not only the final abolition of slavery , but many other great changes in the world . I would do all in. my power to convince my sotithern brethren of the truth , that slavery is a curse to the South ; I would fling wide open the outlets for the exportation of the blacks ; I would most heartily hold up my hand for an appropriation of part of the future surplus of the national revenue to remunerate planters for the manumission of their slaves , and their exportation to Africa ; and I believe that New-England would most heartily concur in this measure . Believe me , my dear sir , there exist here strong feelings of affection for our warm-hearted brethren of the South ; and much as we love our national honor , deeply as we blush that our fair escutcheon should bear the blot of slavery upen its surface ; still , it does not enter into our hearts to accuse the Soeth of having placed it there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wipe it out at once . But I forget that the object of your letter was to inquire into the state of public feeling here , and of the numbers of the abolitionists , Tather than learn my own individual views . Well , then , in the first place , I do not suppose that more than one tenth part of our population think much about the best means of putting an end to slavery ; and of those , not one tenth of the numbers , and not one fiftieth of the intellect and character , countenance the plans of the immediate aboli* tionists . There are some few persons in this city , whose watchword is IMMEDIATE AnOLITION-whose motto is , or seems to be , " Set the chained blacks frea , let what will follow  --  and though they should mur* // der their masters , and then cut each other 's throats-still set them free . " But I need not say that they are little heeded by men of good sense and deliberation . There must and ever will be fanatics , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is not astonishing , that , in a city where a sect like the Mormonites is rapidly acquiring consistency , there should be found advocates even for the absurd doctrine of the thoroughgoing abolitionists . But although the New-England Anti-Slavery Society is struggling alike for proselytes , and for notoriety , it obtains few of the first , and very little of the latter that is desirable . A writer , in one of our periodicals , says , that he has traveled extensively on the business of colonization ; that he has delivered nearly two hundred addresses-conversed with the editors of more than one hundred and fifty newspapers , and over five hundred clergymen , of all denominations , and that he can say sincerely , he is not aware of any combination , or tendency to combination , for improper interference with the affairs of the South . He says , " There is a firm belief that slavery will be abolished at no distant day ; that the spirit of the age , the progress of truth , and the voice of conscience , will necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oppressed will soon burst the barriers that should have yielded to the force of reason and the voice of God . But that there is an extensive feeling prevalent in New-England , to interfere rashly with this system , to violate any of the provisions of the Constitution in relation to sla*ery , or to injure , in any way , those sections of the country where it exists , is not true . The common feeling of New-England is that of kindness and forbearance . It is a feeling of painful anxiety for the safety and happiness of the Southern States , and the harmony and prosperity of the whole country . " * I believe these statements may be depended upon , and I beg you will make them known as the feelings of many a New-Englander , who can duly appreciate the character of the embarrassments of the South ; who loves the Union as he loves his own family ; who regards the Southerner as a high-spirited and noble brother ; and who cherishes with feelings of pride , the memory of the day when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for freedom , to enjoy themselves , and to leave as a legacy and a bond of union to their posterity forever . Do not listen to the hints thrown out by some of the newspapers , t about the desire of the North to interfere with the ques. tion of the disposition of the slaves . If such hints were made through ignorance of the truth , then do their authors merit severe rebuke for sowing the seeds of a whirlwind which can not be controled ; if they were made with the purpose of forwarding any party views , then do they merit the felon 's fate  --  the hisses and scoffs of every patriot , and the curses of every succeeding generation . Oh ! I have no patience to endure this prostration of that noble instrument-the press  --  to every base and selfish feeling which can be brought to bear in a political campaign : its character , in our country , is low enough , in all conscience , for intelligence and refinement ; but it is only of late that we see it becoming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Freedom , No. 2. // sions , the political pimp of those who court high places and power . You recollect , probably , as well as I do , the successful effort of a Frenchman of talent , to obtain a foreign embassy by establishing a paper , which the government were glad to buy , at the price of the situation he desired ; and we shall , and may now , I fear , find papers in our own country , acting with a meaner aim than even this . But I beseech you , take them not for a specimen of the New-England Press in general ; look through our respectable papers , and you will find sentiments like those of the Salem Register , which , in answer to an inquiry from the South , as to whether TemperaI*ce Societies , Lyceums , &amp;c. had in view any interference with the question , uses this language " We say , then , solemnly , and in good faith , that the reports alluded to by the Enquirer , as far as our experience goes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs and spirit of the public bodies , private associations , Temperance Societies , Lyceums , &amp;c. &amp;c. in this quarter , ) are altogether false . There are , however , some few people in this quarter who agitate the subject of slavery , but they are not connected with other societies or associations , neither are their peculiar notions generally diffused in this community . The experiment which has recently been made in this town upon public sentiment , enables us to speak decisively on this point . The result of the recent discussions between an Agent of the Colonization Society , and an Agent of the Anti.Slavery Society , in a public assembly in this town , is a proof that the people in this quarter are averse to any improper interference with the Southern institutions . The public mind here is not at all imbued with any such spirit as is implied in the paragraph quoted by the Enquirer . We could have told our Southern brethren so , long ago ; but , perceiving the jealousy of the South against the North , and the artifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have forborne , because we felt how little we could do to allay the ferment , or say any thing that would be received in a friendly spirit in that quarter of our country . " Such , my dear sir , are our sentiments on the subject of emancipation ; and , although we can not admit of one word of argument in favor of a system which violates the laws of God , and the natural rights of man-which makes him , who was born our equal , live our slave ; still , our abhorrence of the system is qualified by a consideration of the peculiar circumstances of the case : we recognize that first law of nature , which enjoins self-preservation , at any hazard ; and we should as soon think of enjoining upon the keeper of a caravan , to break the bars of his cages , and unchain his tigers , as to bid the planters restore the blacks to liberty at once . We recognize the hardship of the case of him , whose whole course of life and education has fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him for bread , and would look in vain , should he suddenly be called upon to relinquish his only resources . But , upon the other hand , we do beseech our Southern brethren to have some respect for the feelings and the principles of New-England ; and if prejudice and education have stopped their ears to the voice of insulted justice and humanity , which cries aloud against him who enslaves his fellow-man-who , by oppression , and insult , and scorn , crushing every spark of manliness , first degrades him to a level with the brutes , and then makes use of his degradation as an argument for holding him in bondage ; still , let the common interest and the common reputation of the country induce them earnestly and candidly to discuss the question , What shall be done with the blacks ? // In this discussion , let the feelings and principles of New-England go for what they are worth , and no more ; and if she is urging her moral and religious obligations to do all she can in the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her come forward and test the sincerity of her professions by common sacrifice with the South . We do not consider the planters of the present generation any more responsible for the existence of slavery , than we do the farmers of New-England ; and if humanity , and justice , and the honor and the interest of the country , demand that slavery should be abolished , why , then , in common reason and equity , let those who call loudest for it , pay something for it . And , doubt not , my dear sir , she would be willing to hear her part of the sacrifice for the accomplishment of the great end . New-England is not so selfish or so mean as many of your Southern prints would fain make her ; and most deeply do I deplore the spirit which leads them to sneer at . her principles , to ridicule what they call her prejudices , and to judge her whole population by the unfavorable specimens , who , allured by the chance of speculation , wander away to the South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so young , and wandered so long among other climes , and associated so much with those who entertain the opinions of New-England , which are common in the South , that I began to partake them , and grew almost ashamed of the name of Yankee ; but when I returned , and judged , with an impartial eye , of the character of my countrymen , I grew prouder than ever of them ; and I can say , with the sincerity of a cosmopolite , that there is no people in the world superior to those of New-England , in intelligence , in moral worth , in genuine patriotism ; and I do not believe there can be found a population of twice the number , where so much prompt and efficient aid can be raised to any object of philanthropy , or science , or patriotism , as among them . Most deeply do I lament that there is not more community of feeling , more accurate knowledge of each other 's character , between the people of the North and those of the South ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high spirit , the generous and confiding disposition , the frank and open hospitality of the Southerner ; and that yours does not more honor the intelligence , the enterprise , the moral worth , and the public spirit , of the Yankee . Did they know each other better , depend upon it , there would be fewer here to raise a hue and cry about th' cruelty of slave-masters , and fewer among you to talk of Yankee trick , or Yankee interference in Southem affairs . I have been involuntarily led to branch off to other matters than those immediately connected with your queries , but you will be better able , perhaps , to judge of public feeling here . New-England , sir , to a man , deplores the existence of Slavery ; she will ever pray for its final abolition ; nay , she will do more-she will , by word and deed , exert herself to accelerate it : on this subject , we have one feeling , we form one great party . But she will raise no signal of revolt , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no improper interference with the affairs of the South ; those who would agitate the slave population , who would endanger the safety of the whites , and destroy the rational hopes of the blacks , who would preach immediate and absolute emancipation , at all hazards , form but an insignificant minority ; insignifi // 129 cant in number , insignificant in influence , and ( with the exception of a few honest enthusiasts , ) insignificant in character and principle . Thus , my dear friend , I have given you , as fully as the hurried nature of my occupation will allow , , the feelings and intentions of what I sincerely believe to be the overwhelming majority of New-Englanders ; . it is , at least , the sincere opinion of one who loves his country with more than the love of birth-place and home ; who would prefer to a dissolution of this Union , the separation of the dearest ties of blood or affection ; and who , should it happen , would have to blush for those years of his youth , spent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamped as the ( loctrine of the fool and the visionary . But it can not he , that the people of these United States , for the sake of paltry sectional interest , will be so blind to their own welfare , so false to the cause of liberty and humanity , , and so reckless of the situation of their posterity , as to destroy the fairest fabric which ever blessed the vision of the philanthropist and the liberal . I shall be rejoiced to hear from you on all occasions . I should still more delight to come among you , and to assure you , that , in one Yankee , at least , you have a sincere friend , and who will ever he most truly yours . H.@@183068494.txt THE protracted debate in the Massachusetts Society for the Suppression of Intemperance on the expediency of the Pledge , and their final adoption of it , have excited not a little interest in the public mind . We vere not prc*sent at any portion of that debate , nor have we read or heard any detailed account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , our views upon the subject , we may tread unconsciously in the track af some , or seem to be aiming at the arguments of others , who took part in it ; but neither plagiarism , nor personality can fairly be charged upon us . What , then , is the state of the case ? Within a few years past , Intemperance has been found to be a great and growing evil in the land . A stir has , consequently , been made among the people to suppress it . Societies have been formed , and large sums of money subscribed , to further this laudable end . The public authorities have been weary of licensing the sale of spirits . Agents have been sent into every part of the country to alarm men 's minds to their danger . Every fact that could illustrate the evil , , every argument that could influence the reason , and every appeal that could engage the affections , has been arrayed , and . set forth by the ablest hands . And not in vain , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of intoxication throws a gloon over the joy of our holidays now , where , ten years back , at every corner might be met a mob of boys mocking the motions of some reeling vagabond . Capital , that yesterday was yieldIng large returns in thriving distilleries , is to-day forced into a new channel , or sunk in its old one . In short , public opinion , that giant arm fof good or for evil , has raised itself against the fiend , and it has retreated . But among other means that have been lately adopted ' in aid of the Temperance cause , by some associations , is a pledge of total abstinence-a promise , solemnly made and signed , never to use , one 's self , or provide for others , any distilled spirits . We know not whether the VOL . V. // solemn forms of swearing are introduced in administering this promise , but no one can consider it as any thing less than an oath never to taste the proscribed liquors . To such an oath , pledge or promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections . We consider it as unbecoming a rational being .. We consider it as interfering with the free agency and moral responsibility of man . We look upon it as contravening the system of Providence for the moral government of our race . We consider it as tending to narrow the limits of virtue , to diminish the force of principle , and to retard the moral progress of in an . The world we live in is a world of probation . Every part and power of man , and every circumstance in which he is plaeed , is calculated to that end . We have strong passions to fight against , and fierce temptatious to encounter , and burning lusts to keep down . But we have Reason to fight with , and Conscience to spur us on ; and with every temptation there is given us also " a way to escape "  --  and that , by a manly resistance , not by a cowardly flight . Without a contest there can be no victory-without a cross no crown-without trial , no virtue . " Able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motto of man 's moral existence . It is the sad conditjon from which he may fall into final misery . It is the blessed condition from which he may rise into final glory . And to us it seems at war with that condition , and wholly superseding the intended sway of our reason , to put up any such arbitrary , artificial barrier , between us and the temptations ordained for us . So far as Temperance is concerned , from the moment a man has signed this pledge , he is a mere machine . The question is no longer open to him as a moral , rational , accountable being , whether he shall be a sober man or a drunkard . All conflict between passion and principle is shut out from bin . He is restrained , indeed , from vice ; but he is equally restrained from virtue . 1-Je must have no reflection , no mind about the matter , save just enough to distinguish a. d drink cold water  --  and so far , the reason of a brute may be instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nursery , to administer promises to begooci . But for one who has arrived at years of discretion , it seems quite as becoming to pull out his teeth against gluttony , or mutilate his members against any other excess , as to stop up his throat against gluttony by the insertion of this moral plug . It is the worst consequence of Intemperance that it destroys the reason ; but how d6 we mend the matter by taking away all room for its us&amp; But why , it is said , this hue and cry against a form which we meet with at every corner of society ? You can not borrow money , without promising to pay it-you can not enjoy public office , without an oath to discharge its duties-you can not enter into the dearest relation of life , without a pledge to its faithful observance . This last promise , we think , has been rather unfortunately adduced by the friends of the Temperance Pledge . The analogy would better hold if the latter were a pledge to only one kind of spirit , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last sort , have riot been entirely untested in other countries , and we commend them as examples of the expediency of pledges to total abstinence . But , aside from this , the promises alleged relate not to the moral duties of man , but to the arbitrary institutions of society . It is no part of the law within us , to bear office or to borrow // money ; and , though CC the world must be peopled , " a man , it is believed , may " die a bachelor " in innocency . Society may . *el ? put a guard at the gates , and require pledges to the observance , of institutions created for the convenience or necessity of her members . It is essential that she should , for enforcing the performance , or exacting the penalty of a debt or a duty withheld . Some sacitices of moral agency , as well as of natural liberty , her very existence , doubtless , demands . But to argue from these to others would justify an argument from the necessity of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of our nature . A thousand natural ills are attendant on its violation . It is a moral and a Christian duty . For its observance we are responsible to our conscience arid our God . It is no part of the duty never to touch or taste ardent spirits . Conscience has not labeled them as criminal . Judgement may advise us to abstain from them ; but that judgement , in order that we may follow , we are bound to leave free , and not to forestall it by pre-engagemnents and pledges . But , how happens it that bare analogies are the most that can be adduced in aid of the Pledge ? Promises of some sort are as old as civilization , and so is the vice of Intemperance . And yet , in all its annals , we can find no precedent for applying the one to the other . " Use St. Paul 's instruments of sobriety , " says the author of Holy Living ; " Let us who are of the day , be sober , putting on the brea i-plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of salvation . " Faith , hope , and charity are the best weapons in the world to fight against intemperance . The faith of Mahometans forbids them to drink wine , and tli*y abstain religiously as the sons of Rechab ; and the faith of Christ forbids drunkenness in us . Not a syllable is here of pledges  --  but see what he says besides- " Propound to thyself ( if thou beest in a capacity ) a constant rule of living , of eating and drinking ; which , though it may not befit to observe scrupulously , lest it become a snare to thy conscience , or endanger thy health upon every accidental violence ,  --  yet let not thy rule be broken often nor much , but upon great necessity and in small degrees . " Mechanical invention , we know , is the glory of our age and country . But moral machinery had its origin elsewhere . It has come down to us from the armory of heaven , perfect at all poias . It may be dangerous to improve it . Human inventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two handles . A pledge may push a bad cause as well as a good-may promote * vice as well as a virtue-may bind together a conspiracy as well as a moral society . Indeed , we think it the peculiar instrument of a bad cause . It is *expedient that one 's reason should be blinded , where it must denounce what it sees . There is said to be honesty among thieves , and by appealing to that , under the form of a pledge , they may succeed in a cause which might otherwise be desperate . But we object further to the Pledge , that it is a dangerous trap for the conscience . We have all heard the story of the man , who , having signed one of these pledges , never to drink ardent spirits except in case of sickness , was said by his wife never to have had " a well day " afterwards . It is in vain to conceal it ; the passions of man are too cunning to be pledged to any thing . No form of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . They will always be getting over , or under , or round it . Somewhere or other they will find or force a loop-hole. // Nothing but reason can stop their course  --  and she , not hy heing hound hand and foot in one attitude-not by being pledged to one positionhut by being free to face them , to follow them , or to head them in , whichever way they come . Reason , properly instructed , seriously influenced , thoroughly convinced , can raise a barrier which the gates of Hell can not prevail against Let man be governed by her , and he is safe . But we fear she has little to do with this system of signing pledges . If at all , we fear most men , Rhad* manthus-like , will sign first and reason afterwards-will be teazed i to a promise , and then bethink themselves of its nature . And what these after-thoughts will be , conceived beneath the shackles which a hasty stroke of the pen has put upon them , may be readily imagined . It has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more tei* ptation in it , than all the trees of the garden . Young men of twenty and under , boys , perhaps , are here signing promises which may reach through the dark and hidden circumstances of a life . For a few years they may be kept ; but how many of them will be recorded , as broken , in heaven ! And let a man once hear about in his bosom the consciousness , secret to all the world beside , of a violated oath , and then calculate his chances for temperance in this world or ,  --  we had almost said ,  --  salvation in the next ! But , we are told , the Pledge has been tried , and there is no success without it . Undoubtedly , if there be a pledge , it must be signed . Undoubtedly , it will not do for those who are temperate , or even those who know not the taste of spirit , to ( leclme signing on that account . No man will brand himself as a drunkard by signing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign . If the Pledge , then , be continued , all who conscientiously can , must sign it , or there will he no success ; and , if the Pledbe be given up , we are willing to confess that the success of the cause will not be capable of so ready a demonstration . We shall not have a man 's word for it , that he is temperate . We shall not be able to show , under his own hand and seal , that he is no drunkard . Nor is this kind of evidence generally considered the best which the case admits of . The cause , too , may not go on quite so fast without the Pledge . It is much easier to obtain a signature than to teach a duty . But more certainly , more safely , we believe it will go on . Better ha e ten men temperate from principle , than twelve from a pledge . They will be safe from a relapse . They will also be moral and religious men . Temperance will be accompa* nied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath can not bind inclination-cannot fetter passion-cannot quench the corrupt thirsts of the heart . it does not teach or strengthen principle ; at most , it governs practice . It does not check the internal desire , only the external act . He , who has signed this Pledge , and kept it , may still be a drunkard at heart , may still be intemperate in soul , and show it in every other form except the use of ardent spirits . And where shall we stop ? Shall we sign a pledge not to steal , not to cheat , not to murder  --  to love God with all our heart , and our neighbor as ourself ? What would such virtue or such love be worth ? Or rather , how much of it would there really he ? It is , at best , reducing all goodness to honesty , and leaving no guard for that . Quis custodiet custodes ? Must we sign a pledge to keep our pledge ? Such a course // 141 can never advance the true interests of man . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will hut skin and fun the ulcerous place , Whiles rank corruption , mining all within , Infects unseen " It will call off men 's minds from the real evil . It will blind their eyes to the real good . The outward sign will pass for the inward grace . Conscience will be crippled , morality lost in mere action , piety will evaporate in promises , nor principle reach further than a signature . We can not conclude these remarks without one suggestion , which does not , indeed , touch upon the abstract question. , but which strikes us as worthy the consideration of every sober man . Associations for moral or charitable purposes have hitherto confined themselves to at most a few hundred members , and extended themselves further only by their large charities , or wholesome influence . But the introduction of the pledge-system is banding together , in one great mass , all those who , any how , from policy , principle , or persuasion , may happen to sign it . The desire , too , of furthering the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . And in this way is carried on an inquisition into private opinions , which , in any other cause , would be reprobated by every high-minded or honest man . Whether it will ever be made use of at the polls , remains yet to be seen . But that it may be , and that with no very fair or teniperate influence , requires little foresight . It may happen , that those , who conscientiously refuse to sign away their moral liberty , may be shut out from public confidence , at the same time with those who are unworthy of it , when the question at an election shall be , " has he signed the Pledge ? " W.@@183068497.txt There is but one thing more difficult to write than an oration for the Fourth of July . The themes appropriate to the day  --  the topics expected to be discussed-have all been treated so often and so elaborately , that an orator at the present day must be in rare good luck , if he can impart interest enough to his performance , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write than the oration itself . This labor we have no desire to undertake . But we have , on our table , several discourses , delivered on the last anniversary of American Independence , which are entitled to a brief notice . The Address delivered before the Young Men of Boston , by Aniasa Walker , is modest and unpretending , but , nevertheless , a very sensible and well-written performance ; and , if it would not endure the ordeal of rigid and unmitigated criticism , it may claim remembrance for its moral , patriotic , and religious character , and from the historical fact of its having been written at the request of eleven societies of young men , associated for the most honorable of purposes- " moral and intellectual improvement- ' * a fact which may and probably will establish an epoch in this age of moral and intellectual exertion . We extract from the Address a few paragraphs , which will communicate to the reader some of the details of what may be called the moral organization of the city of Boston . The Societies before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society ; Boston Young Men 's Society ; Young Men 's Society for the Promotion of Literature and Science Franklin Debating Society ; Boston Laboring Young Men 's Temperance Society ; Lyceum Elocution and Debating Society ; Mereantile Library Association ; Mechanic Apprentices Library Association ; Boston Lyceum ; Young Men 's Temperance Society ; Mechanics Lyceum. * * S * * * The twelve eleven ? societies assembled on this occasion are separate and inde-. pendent associations , with no bond of union , save that which results from a community of feeling , and similarity of purpose . They are composed of persons of all religious sects , of all political parties , of every grade and profession ; the gentleman of leisure , and the man of business ; the native Bostonian , and the adopted citizen ; all ranks and classes intermingle . We can therefore safely assert that we are not the propagandists of any religious faith , nor the partizans of any political creed . Nor do we profess to be wiser or better than our fellow-citizens . We do not take the attitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frailties , we are associated for the purpose of mutual improvement , to make ourselves happier and better , and to exert what influence we may ; to promote the welfare of others . We pretend not to be the only laborers in the wide field of human improvement ; we merely aspire to the honor of being coadjutors in a noble cause , with our superiors and seniors . Our societies are all open to public inspection , and amenable to public opinion . Our objects may be fully and distinctly known ; if our measures are good , they will receive , we trust , the counte* // nance and support of an enlightened community ; if they are bad , we know they will be visited with that indignant frown of public disapprobation , before which nothing can stand . The societies of which we speak , may be divided into two classes ; those for intellectual improvement , and those for moral influence . These are somewhat necessarily connected , for there is a natural affinity in their objects and purposes . Through the means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst ourselves a relish for rational enjoyments , to bring the social sympathies to the aid of the intellectual faculties , to awaken an interest in those pursuits which are calculated to develop the mental powers , and teach man the energies of his own mind . Through the influence of our moral and benevolent associations , we hope to elevate the standard of character ; awaken in ourselves and others a becoming sense of the proper destiny , and true dignity of man ; and e*ctend the hand of charity to the destitute and suffering . C * * * * * To furnish the means of INTELLECTUAL IMPROVEMENT to the mass of common mind , is one of the principal objects to which we direct our attention . We deem it essential to the well-being of society , that a general desire should be excited for the acquisition of useful knowledge ; we think it more important that the many ahould be well-informed* than that the few should be learned . We do not , in our various associations , propose to prepare men to act distinguished parts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we merely wish xnd intend to promote a spirit of inquiry , to excite an interest in intellectual pursuits , and teach ourselves the truth , that there are sources of enjoyment and pleasure , other than those of gain , political ambition , or sensual indulgence . We do not wish or expect to elevate any of our members to places of influence and power , but we would , do wl'at we can , to qualify each one to act his particular part with propriety , and sustain the various relations of life , in a manner honorable to himself and beneficial to others . * * * * 5 5 We wish to change the MORAL CHARACTER of our metropolis . Let us not be misunderstood . We will not alander our own fair city . We believe she stands on as high an elevation as any other in the lapd . We touch doubt whether there be a community on earth , equally large and dense , where virtuous principle and action are more predominant . Yet is it not true , that even here vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not true , that in boston , dangers stand thick on every side , and temptations are laid in every street , by which multitudes are enticed and destroyed ? We know , indeed , ( thanks to the moral sense of the people , ) that vice wears not her once unblushiBg front ; she stalks not now abroad at noon-dAy ; but the monster is. still here , in many of her thousand shapes , habited indeed in a better garb , more decent and cautious in external appearance , best not the less malignant and dreadful . We hope by the influence of moral associations , to form among ynung men a virtuous public sentiment , to render every departure from rectitude unpopular and disgraceful . We would so far establish the reputation of our various societies , that the fact of membership shall be an ample certificate of good character , and honorable standing , This result we anticipate , not by coercion , not by appeals to civil power , but simply and only by furnishing the means of rational amusement , of intellectual culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of all measures calculated to improve the mind , refine the taste , and purify the heart . We believe all this practicable ; we have seen great good already accomplished , and we are animated with the cheering prospects , which we think are dawning on our city , on our country , on the world . We hope to prove by actual demonstration , that great cities are not necessarily , as the proverb says , " great sores . " We hope to prove the fallacy of the long received opinion , that , in a dense population , there must , of course , be greater moral impurity , than among the same number of inhabitants scattered throughout a large extent of territory . We agree with our , favorite Cowper in his description : Rank abundance breeds in gross and pampered Cities sloth and lust , And wantonness , and gluttonous excess . In cities vice is hidden with most ease , ( Jr seen with , least reproach ; and virtue , taught By frequent iapse , can hope no triumph there , Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we can not join the poet in his alternative ; for , however true to life may be this glowing picture , we can not abandon cities to remediless depravity . We do not believe that " virtue can hope no triumph , but in the achievement of successful flight ; " far otherwise . We believe she may and must make a bold stand . Clad in the panoply of truth , arrayed in the lovely robes of innocence , decked with all the charms of moral beauty , virtue may suffer , but should never fly ; she may be assailed , but can never be vanquished ; her conflict with vice may be long and severe , but her victory is sure . It is alone in fable that Astrea can be banished from human abodes . That moral pestilence and death must and will interminably reign within our cities and large towns , we do not admit . No . We anticipate , and if we do not greatly mistake the indications that gather around us , we perceive the risingof a brighter day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past character may have been , we do confidently predict , that the time is approaching , when our cities will become the great fountains of healthful moral influence , sending forth streams that shall fertilize and bless the land ; shall be not only the favorite abode of literature , science , and the arts , but of virtue in her brightest manifestation . We wish to aid in hastening such a time . We would concentrate our efforts and influence in favor of measures calculated to remove the occasions of mischief the temptations to evil ; we would create a public sentiment , among young men , especially , favorable to the cause of virtue ; we would render it popular and honorable to be exemplary and discreet in all the walks of life . We do trust we have done something effectual for this object ,  --  we hope to do more . - In connexion with the subject of moral influence , we should do great injustice to our own personal feelings and to the societies assembled on this occasion , if we did not allude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a cause with whose success the liberties and happiness of this country are identified ; a cause the most glorious that has ever called forth the energies of man ; a moral enterprise the most magnificent the human intellect has ever conceived ; embracing the grandest objects and requiring the greatest efforts of the human mind ; whose past success affords the highest encouragement to philanthropic exertion the world has ever witnessed , and whose final triumph will be the roost brilliant moral achievement than man has ever attained . In this cause , twelve hundred young men of Boston have enlisted . They have solemnly pledged themselves to God and their country . Shoulder to shoulder , and heart to heart , they have unalterably resolved to form one phalanx of that mighty army , before whose onward march the unnumbered hosts of intemperance are destined to be vanquished and destroyed . They could wish , indeed , that instead of numbers sufficient to form a regiment , they had enough for a brigade ; instead of twelve hundred rank and file , they had twelve thousand ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay than a pledge of total abstinence ; no other wages than health and happiness ; no other bounty lands than the prospective glory and felicity of our common country ; and no greater rations of grog than a plenty of cold water ; yet such is their confident reliance on the virtue and patriotism of their young fellow-citizens , that they entertain no doubt of the success of enlistments , or the popularity of the service . * 5 5. * * 5 To inspire among young men a spirit of mental independence is one of the objects of our ambition . The true foundation of freedom is in the individual mind . Man must he free from the tyranny of vicious habits , of sensual appetites , free from superstition , from a slavish deference to the opinions of others . He should in all matters , whether political , moral or religious , think for himself , and never allow others to think for him . Till this time arrives , man will never enjoy that peaceful freedom , for which his creator designed him . Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is not the number small , who dare to think , who venture to have an opinion , till they know the opinion of the world , till they find out with much certainty , what is popular * Can any thing be more servile and degrading ? Is there aught that better fits men for slaves ? Of all the characteristics of our times , there is none of which we should be more heartily ashamed , than this ; none , for the reformation of which we should strive more earnestly . The habit of acting independently , and from a conviction of truth , like all other good habits , should be acquired early . The natural ingenuousness of youth predisposes them to this . They are ardent , they act from feeling . The sordid les // 163 sons of cold-hearted selfishness they have not learned ; have not acquired those sentiments of prudence , falsely so called , which prompt a man to inquire , not whether what he is about to do is right , but whether it will be popular and safe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is in accordance with this natural characteristic of youth , that we find they have always been foremost in every struggle for liberty . Who were most active in raising the spirit of rebellion and resistance in the American colonies , against the aggressions and encroachments of British power ? Young men . Who first dared to assail the despotism of Charles the Tenth ? The boys , ay , " the rash boys " of the Polytechnic School . Who first raised the standard of liberty in Poland ? The young men attached to the military academy of Warsaw . Now we wish to seize upon this well known trait of youthful character , and wield it in the cause of truth . We would cultivate this feeling , instead of suppressing it ; we would direct it to useful and noble ends ; would preserve it in all its freshness and vigor , and make it a settled principle of the soul . We could select many more paragraphs from this address , to justify our commendation ; but these are sufficient . We can not suppress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a professional man-he has not , we believe , received what is technically called a liberal education ; but his production evinces an educated mind , a deep sense of moral responsibility , and an independence of character , that merit high con* consideration , and are worth more , to himself and his friends , than all the diplomas that could be awarded by all the universities in the Union . Mr. Lunt 's Oration , delivered at Newburyport , may be placed among the most agreeable of this class of productions the present year . It is rich in beautiful thoughts , expressed in eloquent language- " apples of gold in pictures of silver . " We copy a single passage . If we would justly appreciate the objects and tendency of human existence , we must forget the distinctions of periods and people . We must remember that there is a universal bond of brotherhood between man and man . No matter , when or where he may have had his being : whether he stands with us to-day in the light of freedom , or groveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter , whether he toiled and fought and died , in the vain , anticipation of seeing those glorious results , which our eyes have witnessed : no matter , whether he fell with Liberty at Chieronea , or saw it and was glad , when it welcomed our fathers to the battle:plain of Lexington : no matter , whether he perished in the dungeons of the inquisition , or worships God , as he pleases , in his stately temples : no matter , whether his body slumbers under the ghastly ruins of ancient superstition , or the fresh soil of a free land presses lightly on his bosom ; - civilized or savage ,  --  high or low ,  --  livino- or dead ,  --  he is a member of the same human family . Wherever the sun-beams publish God 's glory , or the liberal elements utter his bounty , they have found man the same : always an intellectual and a moral being , aspiring , sometimes feebly and again more earnestly , towards the same high objects : actuated by the same motives , worn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried by the same temptations : now overborne by intolerable wrongs and anon rising and trampling upon cowardly oppression : traveling through earth with a struggling mind and a beating heart , and longing for heaven ! The sage who thought , and the hero who conquered , are all connected with us by innumerable ties . The illustrious achievements of other days belong to us rather than to them , for we enjoy their full influence and harvest their complete fulfilment . All that has ever been executed for the good of man ,  - -  all exalted enterprise , all heroic devotion , all self-sacrificing fortitude ,  --  every generous impulse of the affections and every lofty effort of the mind ,  --  constitute but one unbroken chain of brilliant events , all tending to accomplish the same glorious and eternal end . If then we contemplate man in this interesting aspect ; as one great mass of human existence , pressing constantly forward , under the direction of a benevolent Providence , to secure the ultimate happiness of the race ; - that happiness , which consists in a free intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bodies and the souls of men ; - if we look at him in this relation , hindered and checked , at times , in his career , but // with a mind never totally paralyzed , and a heart never altogether broken ,  --  like some single noble spirit , which misfortune may indeed stagger , but can not subdue ; if we consider all the illustrious actions of our predecessors , but as distinct pulsations of the same mighty heart  - -  every gallant stroke for independence ,  - -  every splendid example of magnanimous endurance and heroic martyrdom ,  --  but as one grand series of connected causes , whose consequences have been accumulating , until they are ready to spread over and refine and liberalize the world ; - with what thrilling interest shall we then regard the history of the past with what profouder emotions shall we dwell upon the character of the present and speculate upon the boundless prospects of the future ! It is thus , that the friend of his country , at whatever ren-lote and obscute period he may have existed , *becomes indeed the friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the great philosopher taught for all coming generations , and the myrtle-bough , that wreathed the sword of the patriot , thus lives and flourishes forever , in thebeauty and the glory of immortal loveliness ! Discourses and Addresses on Subjects of American History , Arts , and Literature . By Gulian C. J7erplanck . Biography seems to be Mr. Verplanck'sforte. the best discourses in this volume , ( best because they are the only ones in which an unity of design is perceived , or an unity of effect produced , ) are an Eulogy upon Lord Baltimore , and one upon Daniel H. Barnes , an eminent schoolmaster . The author seems incapable of discussing systematically any subject , that has not tabernacled in the flesh ; and , where he attempts any other topic , he is vague and unsatisfactory . We have often seen Mr. Verplauck 's name in the public prints ; but we have not traced his literary or political career , and know his character only from the book before us . In that it is faithfully portrayed ; and from that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endowments . He was conversant in childhood or early youth with men of exalted and pure minds . From such intercourse he derived an ardent admiration for excellence , not in the abstract , but as enshrined in the souls and exhibited in the lives of its subjects . Nature had but sparingly endowed him ; yet habits of industry , in a great measure , supplied the deficiency . He improved with avidity the means of education , and acquimed an ardent relish for the models of classical taste both ancient and modern . With these he has always been conversant ; these he has always assayed to imitate . Upon these he has formed a style , remarkable for purity and elegance , though not for brilliancy or force . He has always believed that " the proper-study of mankind is man ; it has therefore been his chief ambition to understand and to sympathize with living and departed worth . He has made the fine arts his study , so far as they relate to the delineation of character ; and is an excellent connoisseur in portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , therefore , though the manifestation of character has been his constant study , his ideas on mental and moral science are probably very vague . He - cannot be a violent partizan ; for he has learned that talents and integrity have never been the eyeclusive property of a party . He would prefer a literary coterie to the halls of Congress ; and had rather be a Boswell than a Burke or a Chatham . Thus has our imagination pictured the man . Let those who know him say whether there be a likeness . Almost half of the volume before us is occupied by an Anniversary Discourse before the New-York Historical Society with copious notes.
