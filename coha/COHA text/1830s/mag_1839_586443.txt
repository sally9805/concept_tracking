txt This is a new periodical , devoted to subjects interesting to the mercantile community . We trust it may become a valuable addition to our literature . The article to which we would more particularly direct attention is a defence of the restrictive , or protective , system in commerce . That such an article should have appeared in a mercantile magazine , may excite surprise , but need occasion no regret , if it be ( as it professes ) the evidence of a desire to stimulate thought upon subjects perhaps too much neglected , and to submit the principles by which commerce is to be regulated to calm and deliberate philosophical investigation . We have no desire to be captious , or uncourteous , but we must beg to complain of the want of logical acumen , and legitimate deduction , in the article before us : it appears to us better fitted for the declamatory arena of a debating society than for the pages of a philosophical journal . It would , at the outset , appear that the object of the article is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising revenue . Upon this view of it , we shall not now dispute : we must , however , take leave to point out the injustice of the operation of our present laws , even regarded in this light . Silks , wines , and very many other commodities , which may be classed as luxuries , and are consequently consumed by the more wealthy portion of the community , are admitted free of duty ; while cottons , which are principally worn by the poorer classes , are subjected to an impost of 25 per cent . Thus , the poverty of the poor is disproportionately taxed , while the abundance of the rich is comparatively untouched . But this article is not , in point of fact , a defence of the tariff as a mode of raising revenue , but as a protective measure . Let us see how far the writer has succeeded in establishing his case . He thus states the question : " Is it expedient that the great producing interests of the country be fostered and stimulated to their highest possible activity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of themselves V ' We wonder whether the author was aware that thus , upon the very threshold of the argument , he was begging the question . If he did not know this , we can give him but little credit for an extensive knowledge of his subject : if he did , what are we to say to his fairness ? The advocates of free trade admit , and indeed affirm , that it is commercially expedient that the great producing interests of the country be // fostered and stimulated to their highest possible degree of activity and force ; but they also contend that this can not be done by artificial means , or legislative enactments , but will be best brought about by leaving them entirely to take care of themselves . The argument , thus baseless , must at once fall to the ground , where we might perhaps safely leave it ; but , having taken up our pen , we shall proceed with our author to the conclusion , and then , as briefly as may be , give our own view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully ith Europeans in the South American and Chinese markets , but that , if they were unprotected at home , they would be unable to do so . The fact in the first part of the sentence we admit : the correctness of the assumption at its conclusion we unequivocally deny . If we successfully compete with European manufacturers in foreign markets , it is because we can produce goods , and carry them to market , as cheaply as our competitors : and , in this case , we must inevitably cut them out of the home market entirely , and can therefore require no pro* tection ; for , having the goods at home which successfully compete with Europeans abroad , with the additional expense of freight , insurance , &amp;c. we must the more successfully compete with them here , where these expenses are saved to them , while they still remain on the imported goods . That the great element of foreign commerce is home production : That ftreign trade consists in the exchange of the surplus products of one country for the surplus products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be as large as possible : That we can only import goods to an amount equivalent to the value of our own surplus produce-are positions which have been invariably urged by the advocates of free trade . The writer of the article before us has somewhat ostentatiously arrayed them on his side of the questiow They serve , however , only to encumber his ranks , and to weaken his case ; for we can not , for our lives , discover that any use is made of them , his whole case resting entirely on the assumption that home production is facilitated and increased by the aid of protecting duties , while we maintain , and shall shortly endeavor to prove , that it is diminished . That the anticipations of a total failure of our foreign commerce , resulting from our restrictive system , ( if indeed , any such were ever entertained , ) should have entirely failed , is no proof that the system does not tend to produce that result . If its tendency is to lessen importation , it must , of necessity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injure foreign commerce . The extent of the injury depends upon the point at which our opponents stop : if they fully carried out their own principles , foreign commerce would be annihilated . The distress of the years 1825 and 1836 is , with the most obvious inconsistency , charged to the operation of free trade principles . Not the shadow of a reason is adduced in favor of this view , but , like the other // notions , ( we can not designate them by the name of arguments , ) it rests upon assumption . That the distress of those years can be clearly traced to the circumstance of our having , and acting upon , a false standard of value , we are , at the proper time , prepared to demonstrate , if need be . We have stated that protecting duties , instead of stimulating production , restrict it-or , in other words , that a country acting upon the principles of free trade , other circumstances being the same , will produce a greater amount of wealth than a country following a restrictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the satisfaction of most men , by saying that individuals understood their own business better than legislatures , and that , consequently , if uninfluenced by legislative interference , they will direct their labor and capital into the most profitable channels . We wish , however , to leave no room for cavil , and shall therefore inquire more minutely into the actual operation of protecting duties . It is admitted that foreign trade consists in the exchange of the surplus products of one country for those of others , and that , whatever amount of goods we import , we must export an equivalent for them in our own produce . On what ground , then , is a protecting duty required for any article ? On the ground that we can import it more cheaply than it is produced at home ? - which means that , with the same outlay of labor and capital which is required to produce the article at home , we can produce a greater amount of other commodities than is required in exchange for it ; consequently , a course of liberal policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure *f capital and labor , leaving the remainder to be employed in adding to our wealth in some other way . Thus , by the operation of the restrictive system , capital and labor are diverted from the production of commodities which were previously exported to pay for our importations , and thereby sustain an injury-commerce is , in a degree , discouraged  --  a sickly interest , unable to sustain itself without extraneous support , is created-  --  and the wealth of the country is diminished . It is pretended that the effect of free trade would be to reduce the wages of labor . The pretext is , as usual , unsupported , and is almost too shallow to require exposure . We have shown that a greater amount of wealth xvould be produced , with a given expenditure of labor and capital , under the free trade system , than under the restrictive ; and it follows that , the laws regulating the distribution of wealth remaining the same , the laborer would receive his proportionate share of the increased production . But what is the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so long enjoyed the blessings of protection ? Our own workmen will not easily suffer themselves to be brought into comparison with these masses of suffering humanity . Let them , then , if they wish to preserve their high standing-if they would advance , instead of retrograding-raise their voices , as one man , against // restriction-against legislation which advances the interests of a class , at the expense of a people-which raises the few , by depressing the many . Where a country has a superabundance of capital and labor , there may be some pretext for endeavoring , by tariff laws , to create a demand for them , futile though it be ; but , in this country , there can be no such pretext : capital is wanted , labor is scarce , and profitable employment awaits both . How absurd is it , then , to enact laws which divert labor from the most productive channels , and check the accumulation of capitaL It has been sometimes urged that it will be impolitic to remove our restrictions , so long as other nations continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not see the policy of suffering " another man 's folly to be master over our wit . " If other countries choose to pursue a course of policy hurtful to themselves , is there any reason why we should follow in their footsteps , for the sake of reciprocating an injury * Nor is it true , as has been insinuated , that the English do not act upon their free trade principles . Since the time of Mr. Huskisson , the free trade party has exerted a perceptible influence on the policy of Great Britain ; and the recent stru g* , le against the corn laws has shown that that party is by no means insignificant . Let these laws be repealed , and the restrictive system in Britain is for ever annihilated ; and whenever the people are fairly represented there , this will happen . The high tariff men are wise in their generation-they have commenced the campaign early ;  --  and they are right . Now is the time for discussion . At the moment of action , the minds of men hre agitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a degree , incapacitated from forming just and well deliberated conclusions . Let the people " think on these things , " before passion and excitement obtain possession of the public mind , and deprive it of any portion of its deliberative power . Let them consider well what course is pointed out by justice , policy , and a spirit of enlarged philanthropy . Then shall they " know the truth , and the truth shall make them free . " The whole machinery of a Tariff-even apart from the economic truths we have just touched upon . which have well nigh exploded the principle on which the system is defended-is insidious , anti-republican , and dangerous to liberty . As a means of raising revenue , it argues a fear of the people unworthy of American and constitutional government . Tariffs were the subtle invention of monarcby and despotism to conceal taxation from the people , but are not requisite in a free , overnment , where every citizen has a direct interest in the State , and should be willing to pay his quota of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without having it trebled in amount by being disguised in every thing he wears , and eats , and drinks . This open and honest course , too , will be found of all otheis the greatest and surest safeguard of liberty and of public virtue . National profusion and direct taxation can not exist together , and our institutions can never be endangered when a severe economy is the maxim of the State.
