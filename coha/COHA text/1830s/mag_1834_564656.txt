txt AN English electioneering declaimer at the Hustings , towards the close of the last century , making frequent allusions to the " Carnatic question , " as he termed it , in the course of his inflammatory harangue , was asked , by one standing by , who probably had sufficient reason to doubt the political , knowledge of the orator- " Pray , sir , what is the Carnatic question i ' " The orator , as may well be supposed , came to a dead stand . With about as much knowledge of the condition of New-England , in 1814 , and of the previous and existing measures of the government of the United States* as the English orator possessed of the doings of the Ministry , of the affairs of the East-India Company , of the Nabob of Arcot , and of the territories of the Carnatic , have our stump orators and shallow politicians bandied about " Hartford Convention , : " as a convenient compound watchward of party . Thousands of persons have denounced the Convention as a nefarious assemblage , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a severance of the Union ; - persons who knew little or nothing of the occasions which led to it , of the men who constituted it , and of the results of their deliberations . Some of the most noisy , probably , cared nothing about these things , or were incapable of understanding them , and were least of all desirous of coming to a knowledge of the truth . There is another class of men , not deficient in talents or intelligence , who are beginning to take an active part in the political movements of the day , to whom the history of the Hartford Convention is very imperfectly known , , and whose prejudices lean in favor of the clamorous denouncers of that body . They are such men as may be reasonably expected to inform themselves concerning a subject which has much to do with the reputation of New-En* , land ; for if she deserves the harsh rebukes and virulent invectives , which have been poured out upon her so profusely , she can not wipe out , by all the penitence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stains of guilt with which she is polluted . We are now furnished with a full history of the " Hartford Conven-. tion , " by Theodore Dwight , who was th' Secretary of that body * and // hereafter , those who shall throw out unfavorable insinuations against it , without repairing to the law and the testimony , will be unworthy the countenance of honest men . The occasions which led to this Convention will now be briefly noticed . The leading men of the party called Federalists , a name which originally indicated nothing more than friends to the Federal Constitution , or Constitution of the United States , were , from the beginning , opposed to the war of 181% or Madison 's war , as it is often called . They were satisfied that both Jefferson and Madison had given strong indications , in the early periods of our governi* ent , of a strong bias towards France , and equally strong prejudices against Great-Britain . Both of them were opposed to Washington 's declaration of neutrality , in 1793 , and regarded it as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be upon intimate and confidential terms with Genet , Fauchet , and Adet , those meddlesome and lawless min*ters of the French republic , who came among us while we were young as a nation , while our gratitude to the French as allies in war was still fresh , and while there was a wild and prevalent enthusiasm in favor of republican France . And it was no less fully believed , that they lost no opportunity of stirring up the prejudices of the American people against Great-Britain , and of opening afresh the wounds that seemed at any time to be partially healed , from that time onward . The treaty made with Great-Britain , in February , 1807 , by Monroe and Pinckney , a treaty which Jefferson himself acknowledged to embrace " all that could be obtained from the British government , " was rejected by him with contempt . Tie did not lay it before the Senate , lest , as some supposed , it should be ratified ; or , it may he , because it did not accomplish all that he demanded ; because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seamen . Every other matter of dispute between the two countries was adjusted , and some approximation was made towards appeasing the loud complaints which had existed on the subject of impressment . Mr. Monroe says , in a letter addressed to Mr. Madison , after the return of the former from EngL nd ,  --  " The idea entertained by the public is , that the rights of the United States were abandoned by the American commissioners in the late negocia .. tion , and that their seamen were left , by tacit acquiescence , if not by formal renunciation , to depend , for their safety , on the mercy of the British cruisers . I have , on the contrary , always believed , and still do believe , that the ground on which that interest was placed by the paper of the British commissioners of November 5 , 1506 , and the explanations which accompanied it , was both honorable and advantageous to the United States ; that it contained a concession in their favor , on the part of Great-Britain , on the great principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligatory act of the government , which was highly favorable to their interest ; and that it also imposed on her the obligation to conform her practice under it , till a more complete arrangement should be concluded , to the just claims of the United States . " - " The British paper states that the king * * had directed his commissioners to give to the commissioners of the United States the most positive assurances that instructions had been given , and should be repeated and enforced , to observe the greatest caution // in the impressing of British seamen , to preserve the citizens of the United States from molestation or injury , and that immediate and prompt redress should be afforded on any representation of injury sustained by them . " But while the British government was thus relaxing somewhat of the rigor of its system upon a point which no man in the United States could seriously believe it would then abandon , Mr. Jefferson did not deign to refer the treaty to the Senate , which was in session , when it was received ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adherence to what he knew to be impracticable ; relying upon popular clamor to exaggerate the evil of impressment ; determining to stop short of nothing but the entire renunciation of the principle and practice of impressment by the British government ; and to accept of no modifications proposed for the remedy of abuses . Thus it was , that , upon his own responsibility , he l ) ut at hazard the peace of his country , by spurning the utmost concessions that could be procured from a proud nation , even when harassed by all the perplexities which she had to encounter in resisting the march of revolution , and the strides of conquest , which were going on under the all-grasping power of her mighty foe , and threatening to leave her single-handed in the great struggle of nations . Mr. Madison succeeded Mr. Jefferson in the Chief Magistracy , incumbered with all the embarrassments in which it was involved by his predeces*or ,  --  himself having shared deeply in the policy which produced those embarrassments . The British orders in council , and the impressment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A mock reconciliation , however , was brought about with Great-Britain , in less than two months after Mr. Madison 's inauguration , attended with remarkable circumstances . Mr. Erskine was the British minister resident here when Mr. Madison came into office , March , 1309 ; and on the seventeenth of April following , that minister , after informing Mr. Smith , the Secretary of State , that he was " instructed to communicate to the American government his majesty 's determination of sending to the United States an envoy extraordinary , invested with full power to conclude a treaty on all the points of the relations between the two governments , " he proceeded to intimate , as if he had received new instructions , or made a discovery in those which were first given him , that " his majesty would be willing to withdraw his orders in council of January nd November , 1807 , 50 far as respects the United States , in the persuasion that the President would issue a proclamation for the renewal of the intercourse with GreatBritain , and that whatever difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such an agreement , will be removed in the proposed negociation . " This unexpected overture , faintly though potentially expressed , ( if we may use the apparent solecism ) was met in the utmost haste , b* a reply from the Secretary of State , on the following day , as if determined to spring his trap in season to secure the prey . " I am authorized to assure you , " says the Secretary to Mr. Erskine , " that in case his Britannic Majesty should , in the mean time , before the arrival of a special envoy withdraw his orders in council of January and Novemher , // poses specified in the statute commonly called the non-intercourse act . " The next day , ( April 19 ) Mr. Erskine wrote to the Secretary of State , as follows : - " I am authorized to declare that his Majesty 's orders in council of January and November* , 1807 , will have been withdrawn , as respects the United States , on the 10th day of June next . " This communication was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very same day , with an assurance that the President would issue his proclamation for the renewal* on the 10th of June , of the trade of the United States with Great-Britain . No sooner was the proclamation promised than it was produced . It hears the same date as the letters of the British Minister and American Secretary which have just been mentioned . This sudden outpouring of light , after a long period of darkness , alike astonished and delighted the people . They did not stop to inquire whether the British minister was endued with the gift of prophecy , or was merely a faithful scribe who recorded only what his masters dictated-whether he wrought by magic or by a straight-forward policy . All this was natural enough in the people . But what it was that made the President of the United States , who had always been so wary and searching in matters of diplomacy , all at once so confiding , we can only divine , and possibly might not divine rightly . It turned out , however , that Mr. Erskine had transgressed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be inquisitive . He had come to an inference from his various instructions , that he was complying with his " Majes : ty 's wishes " in assuring the government of the United States that the orders in council would be repealed-his " Majesty 's wishes " being a phrase equivalent , no doubt , to " his Majesty would be willing , " - the phraseology with which he first shadowed forth faintly the conciliatory purposes of his master . Our diplomacy , in the times of Presidents Jefferson and Madison , was far from being laconic ; and yet , compared with the case before us , for brevity and despatch , we can hardly find a diplomatic race terminated by so Thoit a heat ; a race in which we have scarcely beheld the gymnasts at the starting-place , before we find that they have reached the goal . With whatever motives or des ee of confidence this business was managed , its disastrous issue , ( for the British government disclaimed the arrangement , ) gave opportunity for reviving , with still greater intensity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was renewed , and quibbling and hopeless negotiations were carried on concerning the English blockades and orders in council , brought into comparison with the French decrees , to prove that the English government was the aggressor against our neutral rights , and had done us most harm . Meantime the negotiations with Fiance , with here and there a big phrase and half-angry expostulation , were of the most lenient character , under the constant watch and dictationof the American Executive Department ; and sometimes the tone of them was even apologetical , in regard to the outrages of the French continental system , to a degree which excited the contempt of Napoleon himself . rrhe " restrictive system " of the United States , as it was called , while it injured the trade of Great-Britain , though it had also a color of like hostility to France , was scarcely felt by her , and , in fact , whatever // was its purpose , fell in with the general policy of Napoleon to cripple Great-Britain in her commerce , her most vital part . And so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential changes in our relations with the latter power , since the failure of the arrangement with Erskine , yet , in 1811 , the very period when Bonaparte was in the midst of his mighty preparations for the invasion of Russia , and the whole world was under a spell which scarcely suffered a hope to be uttered that his power could ever wane ,  --  the measures of our government began to savor more strongly of war , which was finally declared June 18th , 1812 . This event , though not unexpected , was ill received by a large majority of the people of New-England , particularly of Massachusetts and Connecticut . The previous policy of the government had brought great distress upon Massachusetts , and the injuries inflicted on her commerce had affected deeply all her other interests and branches of industry . Two months before the declaration of war , the governors of the different states were requested , by the Secretary of War , in conformity with a previous act of Congress , to detach their several portions of one hundred thousand militia , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all the exigencie provided by the constitution . " But , though this herald of war ( if we may so personify it ) thus stalked publicly through the land , yet all the discussions on the subject , by the representatives of the people in Congress , were secret . The minority of the representatives , as appears in their address to the people , well understood the reasons of this . " On this topic , " ( speaking of the war ) they said , " so vital to your interests , the right of public debate , in the face of the world , has been denied to your representatives . They have been called into secret session on this most interesting of all your public relations , although the circumstances of the time and of the nation afforded no one reason for secrecy , unless it be found in the apprehension of the effect of public debate on public opinion ; or of public opinion upon the result of the vote . * * * No one reason for war was intimated but such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention to wage war and invade Canada , had been long since openly avowed . The object of hostile menace had been ostentatio'usiy announced . The inadequacy both of our army and navy for successful invasion , and the insufficiency of the fortifications for the security of our seaboard , were every where well known . Yet the doors of Congress were shut upon the people . They have been carefully kept in ignorance of the progress of measures , until the purposes of the administration were consummated , and the fate of the country sealed . In a situation so extraordinary , the undersigned have deemed it their duty by no act of theirs to sanction a proceeding so novel and arbitrary . On the contrary , they made every attempt , in their power , to attain publicity for their proceedings . All such attempts were vain . When this momentous subject was stated , as for debate , they demanded that the doors should be opened . " This being refused , they declined discussion ; being perfectly convinced , from indications too plain to be misunderstood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hopeless ; and that any act giving implied validity to so flagrant an abuse of power , would be little less than treachery to the essential rights of a free people . " // The grounds , assumed for the declaration of war against Great . Britain , were the continuance of the orders in council and the impressment of seamen . The British orders in council were rescinded within a week after the declaration of war by the American Government , a iid , consequently , the only matter in dispute , to which the authors of the war clung with all possible energy and zeal , was that of the impressment of seamen . Ten months after the commencement of the war , ( April , 1813 , ) this point was maintained in its full extent in the instructions given to our commissioners appointed to negotiate under the proposed mediation of Russia . The sum and substance was , " 0 tir flag shall protect the crew . ' Soon after , the British having declined the Russian mediation , Gottenburg was fixed upon for the negotiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew . " In February , 1814 , after Bonaparte 's disastrous retreat from Moscow became known here , the tone of the instructions was changed , having lost all its imperative character . In June following , the cominissioners were told , that if the British government would not relinquish the " claim to impress from American vessels , or discontinue the practice , even in consideration of the proposed exclusion from them of British seamen , you r ay concur in an article , stipulating that the subject of impress tent be referred to separate negotiation . This was on the 525th of the month . On the 27th of the same month , the following supplement was transmitted to the commissioners " You may omit any stipulation on the subject of impressmcnt , *f found indispensably necessary to the termination of the war . " Such was the state of our secret diplomacy in June , 1814 . But in October , four months later , when efforts were making at head-quarters to raise an overwhelming army by a general conscription , the Secretary of War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealed to the patriotism of the nation : " It may be fairly concluded , that if the United States sacrifice any right , or make any dishonorable concession to the demands of the British government , the spirit of the nation will be broken , and the foundation of their union and independence shaken . The United States must relinquish no right , or perish in the struggle . " This theatrical flourish , be it remembered , was enacted four months after the only right for which we were contending , was submissively surrendered , by the instructions to our commissioners , though unknown to the people . But the people , if they gave any interpretation to this language of the Secretary , could interpret it only according to the canons of the administration . What could be a " dishonorable concession , " if it were not that of abandoning the subject of the impressment of seamen , which was the continual burden of our story of wrongs , inflicted upon us by Britain ? For what right were we " to perish in the struggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right so strongly claimed , that " our flag must protect the crew For this right , partly , the war was waged ; for this , millions and millions of money were wasted , and thousands and thousands of lives sacrificed ; for this the hand of industry was palsied ; and at last peace was procured and proclaimed , without a word of consolation to the frustrated hopes of our rulers . The sacrifices and sufferings of the people were now left behind , for unmingled exultation at the sound of // peace . The transition from gloomy forebodings to smiling congratulations , from despondency to the outbreaking of joy , manifested by ringing of bells , illumination of dwellings , and festive meetings in our towns and villages , was instantaneous and universal . No one asked how the contest closed . Peace was the magic word , which dispelled all inquiries whether any right was relinquished ; and no one now dreamed of the glory of " perishing in the struggle . " What we had gained or lost by our sufferings in the struggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquil moment . The loss of men and money , in carrying on the war , could be counted ; individual suffering and loss , and , above all , the loss of opportunity in the advancement of the common weal , made up of individual prosperity , was incalculable . But we return to the commencement of the war . It was declared much against the wishes of the leading men and the people of Massachusetts and the neighboring states . If fhe alleged reasons for the war were the true reasons , they did not believe that the end aimed at would be accomplished . As a war of invasion , on our part , to wrest the Canadian provinces from the British , it was thought to be rash and romantic . We had neither the military preparations nor the experienced military men for such an onset . The saddest predictions of the opposers of the war were accomplished . But the disasters of this land expedition , for which we were indebted to the government , were alleviated by some brilliant exploits at sea , which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those achievements were passed to their credit , as an offset to the total failure of the only plans of which they were the real authors . In fact , the manner in which the war was conducted , was so far from reconciling those , who thou ht it unwise in the beginning , to the measures of the administration , that they became even more hostile to those measures , and their party waxed stronger every day . In Massachusetts , for example , in 1812 , the Federal candidate for Governor , Caleb Strong , was elected by a majority of one thousand three hundred and seventy votes ; hut in 1813 , he was elected by a majority of thirteen thousand nine hundred and seventy-four votes . So that thousands who , in the former year , would have shuddered at being called Federalists , in the latter enlisted heartily in the measures which the party so denominated were pursuing . As this is now matter of history , we may call things by their right names . Meantime , the gallant naval achievement of Commodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts attached to the Navy , which was so zealously cherished by John Adams , when at the head of the nation , yet the war administration gained none of their favor . They cheered the victor , and extolled him in toasts and songs , and then turned to meditate on the evils which visited them on every side . It has been already mentioned , that two months before the declaration of war , the Governors of the New-England , and , we suppose , of the other states , were required to detach their several portions ( as assigned by the Secretary of War ) of one hundred thousand militia , for the service of the country . On the 22d of June , General Dearborn , to whom the defence of the sea-coast of New-England was confided by the government of the United States , called on the Governor of Massachusetts for detachments of troops , for the defence of different // ports and harbors , along the coast , from Macbias to Newport in Rhode-Island , inclusive . The Governor did not comply with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution of the United States , which declares that " Congress may provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union , suppress insurrections , and repel invasions ; "  --  and to the Act of Congress , April , 1812 , empowering the President to " call into actual service any part , or the whole of said detachment of one hundred thousand militia in all the exigences provided by the Constitution . " The Governor maintained that no suggestion was made that either of the exigences , recognized by the constitutional laws of the United States , existed . " General Dearborn , " he adds , " plainly supposed that , in consequence of the act declaring war , he was authorized , by virtue of the power given him by the President , to require any part or the whole of our detached militia to be called out and marched to such places in this and the other states , as he might think proper . If this construction of the Constitution is correct , the President and Congress will be able , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole militia of the United States into actual service , to march them to such places as they may think fit , and retain them in service as long as the war shall continue . * * If the mere act of declaring war gives a right to the national government to call the militia into service , and detain them for six months , it must give a right to detain them six years , if the war continues so long and the national government has the same authority to call out the whole , or a part , of the militia . " A similar demand was made upon the government of Connecticut , and the militia were withheld for the same reasons which were assigned by the Governor of Massachusetts . The requisition of General Dearborn , it should be kept in mind , was made in four days after the war was declared ; and the order of the Secretary of War , on which the requisition was founded , was issued six days before the declaration of war . There could be no difficulty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops were called for they were needed in order to repel invasion . The fact is , they were wanted to perform garrison duty , and intended to be employed as soldiers of the regular army , under the command of the General of the district , with the proviso that they should not be compelled to remain in actual service more than six months . They were to relieve the United States soldiers , so that the latter might be withdrawn , and employed in a distant service , while their proper business was the defence of the ports and harbors ; to be assisted , indeed , by the militia , whenever there should be imminent danger of invasion . But such was not the course pursued . In a little more than three weeks after his call for detachments of the militia , ( July 15 ) General Dearborn wrote to the Governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut as follows Having received orders to leave the sea-coast , where I was ordered for the purpose of taking the necessary measures for placing the towns and garrisons in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to repair to Albany ,  --  - it becomes my duty again to request your excellency to order out such part of your State 's quota of detached militia as the present state of war requires . The numbers , I had the honor to state to your excellency , in my letter of the // emonious leave-taking , and , of ' course , I must leave some part of the coast with less protection against those depredating parties of the enemy , that may attempt invasion for the mere purpose of plunder , than prudence would have justified , if a suitable number of the militia should not he ordered out in conformity with the views and intenti ns of the President of the United States , as before expressed* ' A more irritating and preposterous system of measures can scarcely be imagined . Four days*TE The war was declared , the commanders in chief of the militia of iassachusetts and Connecticut are called upon , in conformity to the provisions of the government of the Union , to place a portion of their forces in the garrisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hundred miles in extent . The militia are to be there at school , for a few days , in company with United States soldiers  --  the general , appointed by the government of the Union , is to give some wholesome orders . for their governanceand then march off with his regular troops upon a Quixotic expedition . to the North , leaving the points and stations , which it was necessary to protect by disciplined men in time of peace , to be defended . by raw soldiers in time of war-soldiers , too , . who .. should not be compelled to serve for more than six mont/is . All this is sufficiently extraordinary , and if any thing more was intended , if the militia , . when . they came within the grasp of military despotism , were to be used for any service to which they might be lured or driven , the case is so much the more aggravated . After all the clamor which has been . raised against our state government for its conduct in. this . business , , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct argumcntum ad hominem , and toask of any honorable and conscientious man , what he would do in the like case . What security would there be that the governor of the state , and commander in chief of the militia should not be despoiled of his military forces , and consequently of the body of his people , ( for the militia are such ) and thus be left very much in the predicament of the governor installed by the renowned knight of La Manchal Without pursuing this subject farther , it may be essential to state , as an undeniable fact , that , while New-England was almost abandoned by the general government , nothing was omitted or declined , from the beginning to the close of the w.ar , either in the way of prompt co-operation with the government of the Union , or of voluntary services and efforts , to bring the militia into efficient action for preventing and repelling invasion , and this , too , at a sacrifice for which , at the time , ,  --  and ever since , she has experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been already stated. , with as much fulness as an essay for this journal will permit , were some of the causes , more or less remote , that produced the convention of the New-England Atlantic states , which met at . Hartford . The immediate cause was the intolerable pressure which had been long accumulating , and was felt in all its pressure in 1814 . Invasions had then actually occurred on the sea-board ; those s.tates were left wholly to rely on their own means and power of defence ; they were obliged to share in the expensive , and , as they thought , wasteful provisions , for carrying on an offensive war in the North , while they were left with the whole burden of the defence of their extensive coast ;  --  and while they were obliged to pay their own militia , the compensation for whose sezvices was fretfully spurned by the general government , they were reproached because // their capitalists would not lend that money to the government of the Union , which the alarming state of things near their own dwellings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desponding a5counts from the seat of government in regard to the negociations for peace at Ghent , and consequently the little hope of a speedy close of the war , and who can wonder that the New-England states , which had been already abandoned by the government of the Union , and had been obliged to provide for their own defence , should seek to combine their counsels for mutual encouragement , and for making that defence more effectual . Early in the year 1814 , memorials were addressed to the Legislature of Massachusetts , from various parts of the interior , praying that body to interpose for vindicating the constitutional rights of the citizens , and suggesting for that purpose the appointment of delegates , " to meet delegates from such other states as might think proper to appoint them . " The report of the legislature , though it distinctly acknowledged the right of such a convention , decided that it was inexpedient at that time . The date of the report is February 4th , 1814 . In October following , a resolution was adopted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve persons be appointed as delegates from this Commonwealth , to meet and confer with delegates from the other New-England states , or any other , upon the subject of their public grievances and concerns ; and upon the best means of preserving our resources ; and of defence against the enemy ; and to devise and suggest for adoption by those respective states such measures as they may deem expedient ; and also to take measures , if they shall think it proper , for procurin*r a convention of delegates from all the United States , in order to revise the Constitution thereof , and more effectually to secure the support and attachment of all the people , by placing all upon the basis of fair representation . " The twelve delegates were elected by a vote of two hundred and twenty-six to sixty-seven , and the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives , were directed to communicate the proceedings to the governments of other states . Rhode-Island elected four , and Connecticut seven . Two gentlemen from New-Hampshire and one from Vermont , chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being in session , ) were admitted as members . The delegates fronii Rhode-Island and Connecticut , were appointed pursuant to a resolve , in each state , similar to that of Massachusetts . In the doings of all the states concerned , thorough regard was expressed and paid to their obligations as members of the great confederacy . There was nothing in the plan or objects of the convention , which militated against either the letter or spirit of the Constitution of the Union ; and the private journal , which has recently appeared entire , is as innOcent as the report which was published at the close of the session of the Convention . Apart from several proposed amendments to the Constitution , ( a procedure not very uncommon in other states , ) the three following Resolutions at the close of the Report , embody the views of the Convention , so far as immediate results were aimed at , and show the whole extent of their treasonable purposes and measures . " Resolved , That it be and herehy is recommended to the Legislatures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such measures as may // be necessary effectually to protect the citizens of said states from the operation and effects of all acts which have been or may be passed by the Congress of the United States , which shall contain provisions , subjecting the militia or other citizens to forcible drafts , conscriptions , or impressments , not authorized by the Constitution of the United States . Resolved , That it be , and hereby is recommended to the said Legislatures , to authorize an immediate and earnest application to the government of the United States , requesting their consent to some arrangement , whereby the said states may , separately or in concert , be empowered to assume upon themselves the defence of their territory against the enemy ; and a reasonable portion of the taxes , collected within said states , may be paid into the respective treasuries thereof , and appropriated to the payment of the balance due said states , and to the future defence of the same . The amount so paid into said treasuries to be credited , and the disbursements , made as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Resolved , That it be and hereby is recommended to the Legislatures of the aforesaid states , to pass laws , ( where it has not already been done , ) authorizing the Governors or Commanders-in-chief of their militia , to_the make detachments from the same , or to form voluntary corps , as shall be most convenient and conformable to their constitutions , and to cause the same to he well armed , equipped , and disciplined , and held in readiness for service ; and upon the request of the Governor of either of the other states , to employ the whole of such detachments or corps , as well as the regular forces of the state , or such part th reof as may be required and can be spared consistently with the safety of the state , in assisting the state , making such request to repel any invasion thereof which shall be made or attempted by the public enemy . ' The first of these resolutions was dictated under the apprehension of the monstrous system projected by the Secretary of War , for filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to a committee of Congress for consideration . The second and third resulted from a consideration of the defenceless condition of the NewEngland states ; the General Government having put it out of its power , by the manner in which the war was conducted , to afford relief to those states , and having refused , under pretexts which came conveniently to its aid , in its bankruptcy , to pay for the services of the militia . The time then had surely arrived , when it behooved them to provide for their mutual defence ; the government of the Union having failed , and declared its inability , to provide for the common defence , according to its obligations as prescribed in the constitution . It was a very general belieg that , if peace had not been concluded immediately after the doings of the Hartford Convention were published , that the second and third resolutions would have been favorably received by the government of the Union , which would have been exonerated upon such liberal terms , from a duty , which , in cowequence of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men who composed this Convention , if there were , in the circumstances attending it , any occasion for alarm , were such as to quiet all apprehension in such persons as knew , or took any pains to know , their qualities and standing . They were men eminent for their talents and virtues , Their commission was not one to be coveted . It was , indeed , salutary , and not to be declined ; salutary to the community , because it allayed the uneasiness that prevailed , and , in some portions of the country , the violence which would brook no delay in measures for relief . Several of them , it is certain , were above all ambition of appearing conspicuously before the public in any political relation ; perhaps a majority of them were so . Wise men , as they were , and selected not as the violent leaders of a party , but as // counsellors who might exercise a wholesome control , they could not but perceive that they were exposed to the shafts of the malicious and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appreciate their motives . They knew , also , that though the disaffection towards the administration of the General Government was wide-spread , yet there were different temperaments , and that they had little favor to expect from the feverish or the frigid . The former were such as not only set forth the wrongs which were inflicted upon New-England , but threw out phrases of hostility and menace touching the Union , which those who chose to make no allowance for the language of passion , and whose interest it was to give the worst coloring to public feeling in the Eastern states , perversely applied to the whole people , not excepting the leading men . But it is an undeniable fact , that amidst all the virulence of parties , during the evil times which have been briefly sketched in the preceding remarks , no allegations of a disposition to invade the union of the states , and no menaces to withdraw from the Union , have ever been charged upon any public body , or upon any combination of individuals , in New-England , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this matter . She has weathered the storm under political pilots , which she thought cared nothing for her interests , and were otherwise very unskillful at the helm ; but whatever complaints she may have uttered , whatever individuals , in their seasons of irritation or despondency , may have said concerning the value of the Union , or the inequalities of its blessings ,  --  they have never seriously set about the casting up of of its value to determine whether they should annul the bargain or compact . The able report of the members of the Hartford Convention , it is unnecessary , here , to analyze or discuss . Jt is historical and speculative , going into the general subject of past , and especially , existing grievances ; while it proposes and explains such measures as seemed to afford the fairest promise of immediate relief and future security to the New-England states . It recognizes , again and again , the deep attachment of those states to the Union , and scans , with great and far-reaching ability , and in a manner at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the blighting , withering effect of its measures on the people represented by the Convention . The most ingenious politician , disposed to trace most watchfully and with the minutest scrutiny , the propositions , opinions , and reasonings of that report , however hostile to the Convention he may have been , has never been able to place his finger upon agpassage , disorganizing , seditious , unfriendly to the Constitution ; while thousands , who were too stupid , or who would not take pains to understand it , or were perverse enough to misinterpret it by design , have affected to believe that " it meant rebellion ? ' Bu* however free from this charge might be the report itself , yet the state of feeling and talking , and the previous measures in New-England , which led to the convention , particularly the failure to comply with the requisitions of government respecting the militia , added to the " Secret Journal , " from which all monstrous and horrible shades were conjured up , were doubtless rebellion outright , if not overt . Now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary himself , a // gentleman of high standing in the community , and of *irreproach able character . It affords nothing to gratify curiosity , respecting the ability displayed in the discussions of that distinguished assembly ; but whoever has expected to find in these arcana , any projects rebellious or treasonable , must forever despair of accomplishing his generous hopes and wishes . A single remark only can here he made upon the expediency of the Convention , concerning which it is very difficult for the generation that has since come upon the stage , to judge . It is enough that a great body of the people then living , and acting , and suffering , and who could not know when the evils they endured would come to an end , thought it expedient , and that some of our best and purest men , who were selected at their call , did not feel at liberty to disobey it ,  --  men who knew how to weigh , and who generously risked , those chances and changes in affairs , which the most sagacious ruler or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a while since , under the above title , to the readers of the Magazine , we intimated. , that perchance at some future day , we might resume the subject . If any one should be curious enough to inquire why our purpose has been foregone until now , we can say , that it has been in consequence of doing what all philosophers do not do , that is , * ) ractising upon our own maxims . Several times , when sitting quietly iii our evening study , without any urgent call upon our attention or any particular occupation for our thoughts , but merely casting about us to see how we might , with pleasure , and not without prospect of some little usefulness either to ourselves or others , employ the leisure so pleasantly given to us from the cares and fatigues of the world ; - * - -  - several times have we cast a thoughtful glance upon the ready paper , the standish well replenished , and the quill lying beside it , and meditated a renewal of our observations ; nay , more-once or twice have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and almost stretched forth our hand to grasp the pen , when , ere this preliminary and decisive motion was begun , the cui bono ? presented itself to our mind , and the inceptive motion of the muscles became suspended . No favorable or satisfactory answer rose to the demand ; and , after a moment 's fruitless pause of suspense , while the whys and wherefores rose dimly before our mental vision , and , like Shakspeare 's Cardinal , died " and gave no sign , " the pen lay unlifted , and the paper unsoiled ; our min ( l turned to other thoughts , and our leisure was spent in other occupations . Some-for want of charity is abundant in the world-may perchance think , that this failure of our purpose was because we had not wLat to say ; and some , that it was pure indolence , that thus withheld us from the accomplishment of our design ; and some , that it might have been as well were the purpose yet to remain unperformed . We will not argue the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the ancient statues of Harpocrates , lifts its warnin* finger , imposing silence. , and lays the like restraint upon our utterance of reasons explanatory in any particular manner , of our silence , until now . It suffices , that we have indicated , generally , the cause . More to the purpose will it he to explain why , now the spell that restrained us is broken , the hand decisively out // stretched , and the fair sheet afready half covered with the legible evidence of our perfected volition . This we are ready to do . It is to vindicate the fair fame of our motto , and the doctrines which proceed from it as their fountain , from the reproach often cast upon them by those who know them not and value them not aright , and therefore reject them , and in consequence , too often , we are sorry to say , of the misconceptions and narrowness of mind and spirit of others , who profess to adhere to them , without a whit better comprehension of their true and legitimate end and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who reject them . By these unworthy followers , instead of being made to promote the wisdom and happiness of man , by directing his exertions and his powers to objects worthy of the attention and ambition of the most highly endowed of God 's earthly creation , these maxims and doctrines are made , like the mantle of charity , to cover a multitude of sins ; they are used as a cloak , to array in outward seemliness their own sordid and mammon-like views , bent upon the earth in search of its glittering dross , even as their great prototype fixed his " upon the riches of heaven 's pavements . " They are employed to hide the scanty extent of their knowledge , by boldly questioning the utility of all that of which they are ignorant ; beneath them are concealed the consciousness of dulness , the want of taste and expansion of mind to reach and duly estimate the exercise of the higher gifts of intellect , and the workings of genius , upon which such blockheads seek to throw contempt , by asking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruits thereof are not eatable , drinkable , or wherewithal a man may be clothed , nor any of the utensils or fabrics subservient to the production of such bodily commodities , shake their thick noddles with an owl-like stare of negation , and plume themselves upon their wisdom or the successful hiding of the want of it . They dream not , apparently , that , to the eye of true philosophy , their fancied concealment is but that of the ostrich hiding his head in the sand . Thus used , no wonder that ( Jui Bono ? should have been employed as a term of reproach , equivalent to a compound of sordid , narrow , stupid and ignorant , and applied to the classes of men who thus misuse it . Yet is the application ungenerous and unwise , and by no means a proof of the superior discernment or knowledge , or more true philosophy , of those who thus launch the term , as though it were the exterminating ball of a bombard , at the heads of the objects of their wrath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively race of blockheads themselves , with more of enthusiasm and brightness , but equally little depth and grasp of understanding ; in others , such an application of the term is ungenerous , because it throws the same repro ch upon those of enlightened and expanded minds , who use the question well and wisely , and upon a doctrine itself , which may be successfully supported as wise and highly valuable ; it is also unwise , as confounding the limits of good and evil , by this community izf defamation , and debarring the humble , and , perchance , timid aspirant after truly honorable fame and usefulness , from making those inquiries and following out those doubts , the fair solution of which is important towards directing his steps in the right path towards the objects of his pursuit . // Several times , lately , have we met with these sneers at the great corner-stone of our philosophy thus , for instance , a man describing the merits and finish of a statue painting , or engraving , after dilating upon them in the warmth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But what of all this , will say the cui bone men reminding us most forcibly of the picture of Apollyon , in the old editions of the Pilgrim 's Progress , where that worthy is represented with a ridiculously barbed sting at the end of a long switching tail , like that of a monkey . Another , proposing the erection of a handsome building , or the ornamenting of its grounds , will say , " But , perhaps , your cui bone men will censure all this , as extravagant and superfluous . " Even in literature and the higher departments of science and philosophy , critics will , in the course of their praises of one thing or another , often have a like fling at the cui bone , as a thing at variance with all excellence in these matters , and with the pursuit of them . Truly , herein they show not their wisdom ; for they thus seem to grant , that their favorite pursuits are not useful , since they appear to think them so liable to fail under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally men of more zeal than sound judgement , overrating much the real value of what they admire , and unable to render a sufficient reason for their zeal , and therefore have recourse to the gagging operation of a sneer in anticipation , to prevent the inquiry from being made . Having , as was just stated , met with several instances of this , of late , we felt a sufficient cause for the resumption and completion of our purpose before alluded to , since we are able to answer to the cui bone ? that it is for its own glory and power that we write ,  --  to vindicate it from foul and undeserved reproach. , causing it to yield a bad savor in the nostrils of men , and thus to fail in the great end of its being-utility. ; that by our attempts , however humble , to take away this reproach and restore its good name and sweet odor , we hope to increase its usefulness and the benefit of the world ; - for , so sure as to act with reflection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a proper and worthy end , is better than the contrary , so sure are men , and their aggregate , the world , to derive good from the proper valuation and use of the ciii bone ? We have thus rendered , logically , a reason for our present appearance , which , we hope , will be illustrated and enforced by our farther remarks . We think that , as a beginning , we may assume , after the fashion of what mathematicians term an axiom , that is , a first principle , the truth of which is self-evident , or not to be disputed , that every action in life , however trivial , has an end or purpose , or at least , in the most general terms , a consequence or result . In the next place , we presume no one will dispute that this purpose , end , result , or consequence , must be either good , or bad , or indifferent . Again , we think it may be maintained , that an indifferent result or consequence is preferable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferable to an indifferent one . The only authority that we know of , that will gainsay us , even in terms , is the devil , whom Milton makes to exclaim , " Evil ! be thou my good ! " and it is plain , from the form of the expression , that he recognized , even in the midst of his wilful contradiction of it , // the truth of this our third axiom . From these principles we think it necessarily follows , that it is important in every action of life , to ascertain what will be its result or consequence , as well as what is its end or purpose ; - for between the two there is this distinction , that a bad result or consequence may follow from a good purpose ,  --  and the contrary . As , however , the bad result of a good purpose is no better than if the purpose had been bad , and as the good result of a bad purpose is a failure of intention , and in no degree palliates the original offence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all must be scrutinized alike . Now , to ascertain what these are or will be , we know no better rule than the simple one expressed in the words of scripture , " Seek and ye shall find ; " and this seeking is to be done by an inquiry into the nature of the end , purpose , consequence , or result ; and as that which is good is what is desirable to find , since it is the preferable thing , no easier mode of making the important inquiry , can well be devised , than that of inquiring for it at once . This would bring , at once , the question " Is it good ? " as to the consequence or result of every action of life . The simple affirmative would , however , be too unsatisfactory ; the mind could not act upon it with sufficient precision , a specification of the particular goodness would frequently be wanted ; and as a species always pre-supposes a genus , the better way is , to inquire at once for the specification ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that is precisely cui bono ? Here , then , *eems to be a Q* E. D. of the propriety and value of our great doctrinal question . Let every man , therefore , on all occasions , or at least all new ones , or new modifications of old ones , accustom himself to put the question to his own mind , and conscientiously to answer it . He will soon get the facility of answering it readily ,  --  so much so , indeed , that both question and answer will , in many cases , present themselves almost intuitively , upon the presentation of a case ; and he will be able immediately , as we stated formerly , to act understandingly , and often to much more purpose , than one guided by impulse , who may , but too often , be compared to a man taking a leap in the dark . having thus demonstrated the general truth above stated , let us now descend to more particular investigation , and seek to penetrate more into the pith and core , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted , that direct and necessary results or consequences that are bad , are to be shunned at any rate . To suppose the contrary , would , in fact , be an insult to the common sense of our readers . All indifferent results should likewise be shunned in like manner , unless a man can satisfy himself , that the time and exertion spent in producing an indifferent result could not have been employed in producing a good one ; for the failure to do good , where good might be done , is in itself a bad result . Striking out , therefore , these two classes of consequences or results , we have left for our consideration only those having good results ; and it is to these that the adaptation of the specific form of our question " Ciii Bono ? " for what good ? becomes peculiarly and beautifully manifest ; for when all the results of our actions are good , and we have a f:eedom of choice as to the performing of one action or another , it is plain , that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise , within certain // limits , men may act at random . Now , for this state of things to be allowable , it would seem to be necessary , that all good results should be equally good . That they are so , no man in his sober senses will , as we suppose , be willing , seriously , to assert . Taking for granted , then , that the good results of all actions having such , are not equally good , it seems to follow , if we grant a greater good to be preferable to a smaller one , that of two modes of action , having different degrees of goodness in their results , either of which it is in a man 's power to perform , he ought to choose that which , as a result , will produce the greater good . It is , however , impossible to compare the goodness of two things without knowing the specific goodness of each : we must know what good is the result of each action , in order to know which good is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred ; that is , we must apply the ciii bone ' ? to the actions . There is , however , another modification of the result of an action which demands consideration . Let it be supposed that a certain amount of good will be the result of two different actions , but that the result of one will be to produce good only to an individual , while the result of the other will be to produce the same amount of good to each of several individuals ; - which of the two actions ought to be performed by a man having it in his power and choice to do either ? Certainly that which will benefit the greater number . Suppose , however , that in the case of this greater number , the good produced to each is not in amount equal to that produced to the individual in the other case , but that the aggregate or sum of all the good , thus produced to the many , is greater than the amount produced to the individual ; - which of the two is then to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be given . S.uppose again , that the results of the two actions will each produce good to a number , but to a greater number in one case than in the other , and to an amount to each forming an aggregate greater than the aggregate in the other case ; - how , then , is choice to he decided ? Going upon the same principle , it seems plain , that that action should be performed which would produce the greatest am ount of good , distributed among the greatest number of persons . But the greater good of the greater number , as a principle to be held in view in determining the actions or course of action in life , is precisely the great principle of Utilitarianism , the very corner-stone on which the great and worthy , but somewhat prosy and tedious , Jeremy founded the fabric of his philosophy . This great principle , and of course all Utilitarianism , which rests upon it , we have thus , in accordance with the statement in our former article , deduced from the " Cui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we trust , as plain as a pike-staff , and as straight as a loon 's leg ; for the accuracy of this last simile , however , we can not vouch , having never , to the best of our recollection , seen a loon 's leg : it is classical , however , since we learnt it in the venerable University of Harvard , where , in the days of our youth , it was in frequent use . We have , however , yet to vindicate our Ciii Bono ? from the reproaches bestowed upon it in such instances as those we have cited . To do this , requires a still farther investigation of details ; and our present limits are now filled . Should no better way present itself of occupying some future leisure , perchance we may pursue the subject.
