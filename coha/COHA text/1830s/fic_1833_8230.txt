Clark , Willis Gaylord , 1808-1841 : THE CHILD AND DOG . from The child and dog ( 1833 ) Oh ! breathing picture of Childhood bright . With its blossoming visions of pure delight ! A dream of the Past , in this scene I see  --  A landscape which beameth no more for me . How many blessings were gather 'd there  --  How glad was the day-beam  --  how clear the air ! At every step there were roses strown ; Where have their leaves and their fragrance gone ? Beautiful Child ! as I look on thee , With thy parted lips , and thy features free ; With the silken curls on thy cheek that lie ,  --  With the laughing light in that tameless eye  --  As I look on these , I am lost in thought Of what young existence to me hath brought ; And as thus this picture those scenes recall , I look around  --  they are vanished all ! They are vanished all !  --  and alone I stand On the bark that hath borne me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roam o'er the sea , So those earliest raptures return to me . Thrice happy the heart that remembers them long ; They freshen the soul with a fountain of song ; They point to that land of enjoyment above , Where Hope lies at rest on the bosom of Love . Philadelphia , August , 1832.
