txt IT is our purpose , in the course of this article , to offer some cursory remarks upon the subject of the poetry of Great Britain during the latter part of the last century . This period is certainly not the most brilliant one in the history of British literature but it has not been often made the subject of connected comment . Though its claims to attention may not be of the very highest order , it will be found to present some scenes arid figures for the canvas , which are rendered the more striking , by their contrast with the mass around them ; as the noble remains of Egyptian architecture impress the mind of the traveller the more deeply , because they rise amidst the sands and wastes of the desert . In accomplishing what we have undertaken , it seems proper to dwell at some length on a few of those instances of literary imposition , which form a marked characteristic of the period . One of the most remarkable perpetrators of this species of fraud was Thomas Chatterton , a rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us equally with wonder and despair , were not his fame severely balanced by his melancholy fate . The history of this singular individual may he very briefly told . His father , a poor schoolmaster in Bristol , died a few months before his birth , leaving his family in circumstances of great indigence . During his earliest years , he gave no indications of talent , or interest in any of his studies , but was even dismissed from school as a person of incurable dulness . At the age of fourteen , he was bound as an apprentice to a scrivener , and entered with sufficient assiduity upon the duties of his new vocation , but devoted the hours of his leisure to the study of antiquities . In the year 1768 , when he was about sixteen , some public ceremonies were performed on the occasion of opening a new bridge in Bristol . There appeared at the same time in a public journal of that city , a description of the pageant which had accompanied the opening of the old bridge , several centuries before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much minuteness of detail and apparent authenticity , as greatly to // perplex the wise men of that venerable town . It was ascertained on inquiry , that Chatterton was the person , who had offered the manuscript for publication ; and , with equal good sense and liberality , threats were resorted to , in order to induce him to acknowled0e whence it was obtained . He bade defiance to these menaces , but was at length induced by persuasion to declare , that this , together with various other old manuscripts , was found by his father in a church in Bristol , of which one of his relatives had been the sexton . It was true , that certain title-deeds and other papers had been anciently deposited in this church ; the chests in which they were contained had been broken open , by authority , some years before , when those which were considered valuable were removed , and the others suffered to remain ; there they were found by Chatterton 's father , who conveyed them home , and applied them to the purpose of covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chatterton himself ; he wrote upon them poems and other productions , in close imitation of the ancient language and chirography , which he gave to the public as the writings of Mr. Canynge , once an eminent merchant of Bristol and the founder of the church , and of his friend Thomas Rowley , a priest . It is curious to observe to what extent this remarkable deception was carried by one , who was yet far from having reached the age of manhood . He gave specimens of his manuscripts freely to those who asked for them , and offered to supply Horace Walpole with an account of the ancient painters of Bristol , a class of worthies in regard to whom history , for excellent reasons , had been profoundly silent ; sending him at the same time some portions of the Rowley poems . These were submitted by XValpole to his friend Gray , who at once declared them to be forgeries . It is much to be regretted , that both were too indignant at the attempted imposition to perceive , that the fact of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpassing talent of their author . Walpole repelled his advances with cold reserve , and neither appears subsequently to have taken any interest in his fortunes . But the poems themselves had , meantime , given occasion to a very earnest controversy . Their authenticity was warmly vindicated by Milles and Bryant , and denied with equal zeal by Walpole , Malone , Tyrwhitt and Warton , though the sentiments expressed by the two last in their respective // publications were directly opposite to those which they had previously entertained . Dr. Gregory , in his biography of Chatterton , sums up the testimony on both sides of the question with laudable impartiality , but does not intimate his own opinion ; nor was this necessary ; his statement of the case is quite sufficient to convince the reader , if he were not convinced before , that Canynge and Rowley were both quite guiltless of any poetical handiwork , which had been locked up for centuries in company with title-deeds , under the reverend care of successive generations of church-wardens . But there is no longer any controvers ) r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the productions of Chatterton himself ; and , considering the circumstances under which they were written , and the age of their author , they are indeed miracles of early genius . in all the records of sorrow , we know not a more melancholy tale , than that of the close of Chatterton 's career . He went to London ; there he engaged in various literary enterprises , and labored , but without success , to gain distinction as a political writer . His plans one after another failed ; at length , before he had reached the age of eighteen , crushed by disappointment and despair , and , as there is too much reason to believe , tortured by actual hunger , he put an end to his own life by poison . Perhaps this sad result may partly have been owing to the pride , which shrunk from revealing the secret of his necessities ; to the perverted sentiment , which taught hini to regard self-destruction as the just and unobjectionable remedy for his misfortunes ; and , more than all , to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for ability , which was certainly his due . The world could hardly be expected to relieve distresses which it did not know ; but it touches the heart , to see so brilliant a light thus immaturely quenched ; to see powers , that might have left behind them a long train of permanent glory , perishing at the very dawn , for want of a little generous encouragement and aid ; to see the boy , who might have filled one of the highest seats in England 's literary temple , soliciting in vain a wretched post on board a vessel bound to Africa , and finally dying , dying of hunger , in the very heart of the metropolis , unpitied and alone . There is a surprising disparity in point of excellence between the poems of Chatterton , which are written in imitation of the // old English style , and those which he admitted to b ' * his own . rrhe merit of all the forgeries is by no means equal , but they are very far superior to the other ; very many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his writings , which have no merit whatever . rVhere are satires , distinguish edby nothiu* but their venom ; love songs , colder than the polar ice ; and burlettas , of which the absurdity disputes the palm with the grossness . Occasionally the satire comes home directly to the mark ; the amatory verses kindle into warmth and beauty ; the foul ravings of political vindictiveness and impiety are exchanged for tones that seem to issue from an angel 's lyre ; but certain it is that , but for the forgeries , the fame of Chatterton would not outshine the many stars , that twinkle dimly through the mists of mediocrity . The superiority of the imitations is probably to be ascribed to the fact , that they were his favorites , and called forth all his power ; from their very nature , they must have been prepared with great care and circumspection ; while the others were either not published by himself , or were thrust into mngazines under a fictitious name . To many of them , he would certainly have been reluctant to advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that his writings were collected and preserved , not by himself , but by others , and thus the misfortune which pursued him through life has also clung to his memory . But after making these deductions , there remains in both classes so much evidence of mature ability and knowledge of the world , that the reader perpetually forgets that they are the writings of a boy , and is tempted to apply to them too harsh a rule of criticism . As a whole , they irresistibly impress us with the idea , that England has produced few poets , superior or even equal in genius to this child of sorrow . We would not become the apologists of any species of deception ; but may it not be said in extenuation of that of Chatterton , that it was committed at an age when such things are apt to be regarded rather in the light of sport than knavery ; that it was designed to injure no one 's fame , and in fact injured no other person than himself ; and that , however criminal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ? Perhaps the most remarkable attempt at imposition on record , certainly the most remarkable as respects the interest which it excited , was displayed in the publication of certain poems , purporting to be translations from Ossian , a Gaelic bard // of the third century . James Macpherson , who modestly contented himself with the name of a translator , was a native of ther Scottish Highlands . In an interview with Home , the author of the tragedy of Douglas , he produced some specimens of Gaelic poetry , stating at the same time , that much more of it might be obtained from aged persons in the mountains . Home , together with Dr. Blair and others , who were greatly delighted with the specimens , prevailed upon Macpherson to publish those in his possession , which he accordingly did , in fl60 , in a small volume . The work was received with general acclamation in Scotland , and with mingled wonder and delight by the larger class of readers in England . Such men as Robertson , Ferguson , Lord Elibank and Gray were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not wanting unbelievers in either country , by whom it was denounced as a bold and worthless fabrication . IVlacpherson had , in the meantime , been despatched into the Highlands for a fresh supply of the precious fragments , and came back heavily laden with epics , which he shortly after published . The old mine of poetry , which had been thus suddenly sprung , produced a commotion in the learned world like that which follows the explosion of a bomb-shell . Macpherson , who soon after came to this country as secretary of the Governor of Florida , steadfastly refused to satisfy the sceptical , pretending to consider it quite intolerable that his word should be doubted ; and when David Hume benevolently intimated to him that the world would like some more solid security , bore himself so loftily , that the philosopher in a heat expressed a hope , that he would take advantage of his travels to improve his manners , by imitating those of the Chickasaws and Choctaws . The host of unbelievers was led on by no less a persona*e , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of a new Parnassus in the Scottish Highlands , and began , as was remarked by Cowper on another occasion , to trample with his great foot upon every feather of Ossian 's muse . In reply to an irritating letter of Macpherson , he threatened to make him feel the weight of something more substantial than a logical deduction . Aided by a host of others , he dealt his blows about him like one of the sturdiest of the Celtic heroes . The vindicators of Macpherson , on the other hand , were numerous and able , and the most prominent among them was Dr. Blair . Ossian himself might // have likened the encounter of the combatants to the dark storms of autumn , pouring from two echoing hills . It happened , asi* usual in such cases , that the eyes of the martialists were completely blinded by the smoke of their own artillery ; the contest outlasted three or four sieges of Troy , and it was not until the opening of the present century , that it began to subside into something like repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely set at rest . The Highland Society of Scotland appointed a commission to recover , if they could , the original text of Ossian . Their report , drawn up by the excellent author of the Man of Feeling , while it betrays an inclination on the part of those who framed it , to believe as much as the case will admit , does by no means sustain the pretensions of Macpherson . The truth appears to be , that certain fragments of poetry , of what antiquity does not precisely appear , but in which the names of Fingal and Ossian held a prominent place , had been handed down by tradition in the Highlands , and that these were the basis , on which the gorgeous fabric of Macpherson was reared ; but that the form and coloring , and some portion of the substance , were the work of his own hands . Some of these fragments are certainly beautiful ; but there are others , which might make the lover of Ossian close the book in despair . In one of them , Gaul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head one of the most illustrious of the bards , for defrauding him of a beef-steak , dressed with onion sauce . Another specimen may be found in the Antiquary , where Hector M'Jntyre , in , order to convince Mr. Oldbuck that the poetry of Ossian was well remembered in the Highlands , recites a portion of a fragment , describing a conversation between the Celtic bard and the tutelar saint of Ireland . Ossian , piqued at the indifference of St. Patrick towards his poetry , assures him that he looks upon him as little better than a certain animal , not much renowned for wisdom ; the saint remarks with great composure , that the clamor of Ossian 's old women 's tales , ( meaning his minstrelsy , ) disturbs his devotional exercises . It is probable , however , that this is nothing more than a liberal paraphrase of the fragment , called the Prayer of Ossian , which is rude and barbarous enough , but not particularly ludicrous . The whole passage , however , shews plainly the opinion of Scott , no mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // It is not surprising , that the interest excited by these poems , at the time of their publication , was very general and intense . They came forth , like a voice from the depths of ages , uttering the lofty inspirations of chivalry , breathing the softest notes of love , and pealing like a trumpet-call above the roar of hattie ; the standard of Fingal streamed again to the winds , " like a burst of the sun when the tempest was nigh ; " the soul was saddened and elevated by their simple and melancholy images , as when one wanders in the dark paths of the forest , or gazes on the yellow line of the desert , or walks by the solitary shore of the sea . But , when doubts were spread abroad of the authenticity of the poems , all these impressions vanished , like the wreaths of morning mist ; the sound was full of sublimity so long as it was mistaken for the distant thunder , but became almost ludicrous , when it was believed to proceed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these poems on the English reader , which was very powerful for a time , was then entirely lost ; but on the continent , where their genuineness was less questioned , they continued to exert a surprising power over the prevailing taste in literature . No more acceptable homage could be offered to Napoleon Bonaparte , than to compare him with the Celtic heroes ; in France , the names of Ossian 's warriors and heroines bade fair for a season to supplant the good old Christian names ; Goethe was a lover of Ossian , and represents his Werther , on the eve of suicide , as enraptured with his lofty melancholy ; Cesarotti translated him into Italian , and regarded him as standing at the head of all the epic bards ; and Madame de Stacl divides literature into two classes , those of the east and north , placing Homer at the head of one , and representing Ossian as the father of the other . The recent death of William Henry Ireland has drawn the attention of the public anew to the subject of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many for a time , but were at last exploded by his own confession . Ireland , however , wanted the ability of Chatterton , and even of Macpherson . Indeed , his attempt to palm off a drama of his own as Shakspeare 's was no sign of remarkable discretion ; he might as well have undertaken to manage the chariot of the sun . We do not enter into a detail of the circumstances of his imposition , because they have been generally circulated in an interesting form in other journals , and because they have little // importance as connected with the literature of the day . The last forty years of the life of Ireland were spent in obscurity , and , we believe , of poverty . His offence was severely visited upon him ; the talent , which he certainly possessed , was not afterwards acknowledged ; but , if his punishment was hard , the moral it conveys is not without its value , that honesty is quite as good policy in literary matters , as in all other concerns of life . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ossian , because they are to he considered as in a great degree responsible for the false taste , which constituted quite a leading characteristic of the time , immediately succeeding that of their publication . The attraction of the better part of them probably arose from its resemblance to the simple beauty of the Hebrew Scriptures ; mingled with this , however , there was a vein of lofty emptiness , a sort of prose upon stilts , which took strong hold of the fancy of youthful writers ; nearly all of whom began to try their wings in imitations of the poetical prose of Macpherson , and thus produced a strange menagerie of Gorgons , Hydras , and Chimeras , to the special wonder and consternation of plain English readers . Perhaps the frequency of literary imposition is itself an indication of a previous decline of taste ; when honest commodities are in good demand , and the supply tolerably abundant , there is little temptation to resort to knavery . The Della Cruscan school naturally came next , with Madame Piozzi and Mrs. Robinson at its head ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anna Matildas and the Lauras . This ephemeral race was swept away by the blast of Gifford 's satire ; but not before they had prepared the way for the reception of the sentimental novels , which came in like an inundation at the beginning of the present century , and whose spells were with difficulty broken by the combined forces of Miss Edgeworth and Sir Walter Scott . No one did more to encourage this false taste , than Dr. Darwin ; and no man was ever more signally its victim . He was a person of eccentric turn of mind , but of great ability , and of acknowledged eminence in his medical profession . Some idea of his character , if the old proverb can be trusted , may be gathered from that of his intimate associates . One of these was Thomas Day , the ingenious author of Sandford and Merton . He was an enthusiast on the subject of education ; and in order to give a practical illustration of his theory , as well as to secure a wife of quite superior order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital , and undertook to educate them in entire seclusion . But nature got the better of , Mr. Day ; his interesting pupils were always biting and scratching each other , and in the course of a few months , as we are informed by Miss Seward , " lie was heartily glad to separate the little squabblers . " Next he determined to try the experiment upon one , but , after persevering for some time , gave up in despair , because he found his little phmnix so destitute of self-command , notwithstanding his excellent lessons , as to scream when he poured melted sealing-wax upon her arm , and to exhibit some symptoms of fear , when he discharged a loaded pistol at her . This remarkable experiment in education forms the basis of a portion of the story of Miss Edgeworth 's novel of Belinda . Dr. Darwin 's pursuits lay in a different line , though he seems to have been possessed by a similar spirit ; the schemes of both remind us of those of Swift 's philosophers , who labored to extract sunbeams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a late period of life , that Darwin resolved to become a poet ; he having judiciously avoided the muses for many years , lest they should entice him from his professional pursuits . His general plan appears to have been , to exhibit the processes of nature , the results of philosophical discovery , and the nature and operations of all things in the vegetable , animal and mineral kingdoms , in poetry ; - refractory subjects these , and hard to be brought under the discipline of rhyme . The Doctor was aware of this , and in order to avoid the difficulty , invested his material substances with active qualities , and resorted , like Pope , to the Rosicrusian machinery of nymphs , and gnomes , and sylphs ; forgetting that Pope had only used it for the purpose of burlesque . But no one can feel much sympathy with steel , however malleable it may be , or with stone , even though it be made to move and talk ; nor is it much easier to enter into the loves and feelings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Darwin 's most celebrated productions . This production was ingeniously ridiculed in a poem , entitled the Loves of the * in which cones , and cylinders , and cubes are animated with the tender passion ; and , if we may judge from the remarks of Miss Seward , it would be rather difficult to determine which of the two poems is the better satire on the other . The versification of Darwin is harmony itself ; it delights the ear , even when it makes no impression on // the mind . Sometimes his extravagances are so startling , as to seem like the interpolation of some crafty satirist ; as , for example , the passage in which he compares good old Dr. Franklin , the very last man who would he likely to indulge in such vagaries , to the god of love , laughing , stamping , snapping his fingers , and breaking thunderbolts upon his knee . The real difficulty with his poetry is , that it gives the reader the idea of an ingenious piece of workmanship , wrought without the slightest trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the spirit of the frozen ocean . So it is with his philosophy ; it exhibits much sagacity and learning , disfigured by a spirit of wild and visionary theory . He considers all animals , in the language of Falstaff , as the sons of their own works ; as originally springing from mere filaments of matter , which are improved into various degrees of perfection by the effort to obtain the means of subsistence ; the advances of each generation being regularly transmitted to succeeding ones . These filaments first attain to the dignity of oysters , which acquire legs and arms by their efforts to reach the water , when they are left dry by the ebbing of the tide . They labor to rise above the rock , and the effort produces wings ; they go on in the way of improvement , until by much study and hard labor , they become transformed into birds ; and so on . It is represented as rather a striking instance of this march of matter , that the legs of certain aquatic birds were gradually lengthened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing expeditions ; and a French naturalist has literally carried out this theory , by insisting that the long neck of the giraffe was acquired by its practice of browsing upon the branches of trees . Darwin was not the only believer in this odd theory ; nor would we intimate , that his theories in general partake of quite so wild a character ; but his judgment appears in most instances to have been subordinate to his fancy . He was much admired for a season , and was regarded with great respect by critics ; but we doubt whether his works were ever re*td with much enthusiasm ; if it were so , their day has long since past , and they now enjoy a quiet sleep , very secure from interruption , in the venerable dust of libraries . There is an incident in his personal history , which furnishes a tolerably apt illustration of his poetical system , and its fate . In order to improve upon the old fashioned mode of riding , he built a platform on his horse 's back , on which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements by a system of machinery , something like that of the wheel of a rudder . One day , while circurnnavigating after this singular fashion , the animal made an unexpected tack , which brought the doctor to the earth with great expedition , and lamed him for life . But his fall from his poetical Pegasus was even more signal ; what was believed to be sublime was at last pronounced turgid , and Dr. Darwin was forgotten . There was the more room for the ( lisplay of this perverted taste , because , during the whole period in question , comparatively little poetry appeared of a very exalted order . Great genius , manifested in commanding effort , is the only effectual purifier of declining taste ; never is the atmosphere of pestilence more surely generated , than when the elements have long been sleeping . The fastidious muse of Gray belongs but partly to this period , a portion of his few poems being of an earlier date ; Goldsmith wandered only for a moment in the fields of fancy ; and Beattie sang but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the hamlet was still . " Southey has collected specimens of the poetry of the day , and it is surprising to perceive how small a portion of its authors is remembered . With a very few exceptions , to which we shall have occasion more particularly to allude , there is not one , who can be said to have exercised any considerable influence over the intellect of his time . The power of Gifford 's satire has been already mentioned ; he brought up a park of heavy artillery to disperse a knot of butterflies , and succeeded to admiration but the game was hardly worth the ammunition , and the labor , as well as the remembrance of it , was soon lost . Dr. Wolcott , better known by the name of Peter Pindar , is but one of the many instances , in which contempt and oblivion follow the prostitution of superior powers . Hayley is an example of better taste , united with inferior ability ; his private virtues were so bright , and his kindness of heart so rare , that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has passed upon the wire-drawn debility of his writings . But we have no space to continue this enumeration . An experiment , which may be worth mentioning in this connexion , was made to test the power of poetry , at the time , when the English stood in dread of an invasion of their coast from revolutionary France . Mr. Pye , who was poet laurent at this critical season , mindful of the influence of the verses of Tyrtmus over the Spartan // soldiery , translated some of them , in order to infuse a double portion of patriotic spirit into the British train-bands . Sotne of the commanders of the encamped militia were highly delighted with them , and caused them to he read aloud at the head of several regiments , anticipating the happiest effects from their brilliancy and patriotism . Unfortunately , before they were half finished , it was found that the greater portion of the soldiers within ear-shot , were fast asleep . In general , and as compared with other periods of English literature , there was a solemn pause among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all its worshippers , while , as in old time at the Christmas revels , the boisterous masquers frisked in its venerable aisles , and made its arches echo to fantastic songs . One might for a season have supposed that the burden of the mighty city , " the beauty of the Chaldee 's excellency , " was to fall upon it ; that the owl and satyr were to inhabit its halls , and dragons to make their abode in its pleasant pavilions . A striking exception to the truth of these general remarks , is to be found in the case of Crabbe . Perhaps he might with more propriety be regarded as belonging to the present century ; as the greater portion of his writings has been published within the last thirty years , after a very long interval , during which he was entirely silent . But his Village made its appearance about fifty years ago , and produced a strong impression upon discerning readers , although , owing to causes not very difficult of explanation , it did not become a general favorite with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood were spent in his native village , a miserable spot upon the borders of the German ocean , where neither man nor nature appeared under very favorable aspects ; both reflected the gloom and misery of his own condition . These circumstances affected his poetry , very much as the east winds of the season , which we by courtesy call spring , affect the invalid 's debilitated frame . He seems to he animated , at times , by a spirit of revenge against man and nature ; the gloom and desolation of the one , and the faults and infirmities of the other , are portrayed with the most revolting accuracy ; he lays hare the heart before us , as with the knife of an anatomist . This effect is produced chiefly by his selection of his subject and his coloring ; the outline is too severely true , and the heart of the reader bears witness to its truth . In his later years , when his own circumstances had become more prosperous , his views of life // were rather more cheerful ; but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic as they certainly are , is there much of the ornamental drapery , which a cheerful spirit can throw over the lowliest condition . Men are not very apt to welcome with delight the clouds and chill of a November day . If a writer choose to enforce the gloomy views of Johnson in his Rasselas , it will he well for him , at least , to provide his readers with a happy valley . Crabhe held up before his a mirror , which reflected every wrinkle and defective lineament with the most unsatisfactory precision ; and the consequence was , that , though his excellence was every where admitted , he was neither loved nor imitated . While the poetical world was thus hushed in scarcely broken repose , there flashed a brilliant meteor from a quarter of the firmament , whence such a phenomenon was little looked for . Whatever might have been the glories of the ancient Scottish minstrelsy , the English ear could listen only to the music of the Lowland tongue ; and we are indehted , for our knowledge of the elder Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been set before us hy the curiosity and patriotism of modern writers . Few , we imagine , were very familiar with James of Scotland , the captive monarch-minstrel , before Mr. Irving made him the subject of one of his brilliant sketches ; nor was the name of Sir David Linde.say any where as common as a household word , before Scott pronounced on the " Lord lion King at Arms , " a sounding eulogy in Marmion . After the union , it became a favorite object with the literary men of Scotland , to identify their language and literature , as far as possible , with that of England . Now and then some sturdy patriot might be found , like the Baron of Bradwardine in Waverley , who " read the Epithalamium of Georgius Buchanan , and Arthur Johnstone 's Psalms of a Sunday , and the Delici* Poetarum , and Sir David Lindesay 's works , and Barhour 's Bruce , and the Gentle Shepherd , and the Cherry and the Slae ; " but the instances were probably quite rare ; and even the Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prose . We are indebted to the same personage for some information respecting the national poetry of his own time , which was about a century ago ; when he remarks , that the only person who had excelled of late in the vain and unprofitable art of poem-making , was Allan Ramsay , the periwig-maker . The use of the Scottish idiom began to be considered as a species // 65 of vulgarity , into which no writer of taste or genius ought to fall ; and so lasting was this prejudice , that the enterprising bookseller , to whom the manuscript of Waverley was offered by Sir Walter Scott , was at first afraid to print it , because it contained so much broad Scotch . This feeling reminds us of that expressed by Louis Bonaparte , when , as king of Holland , the favorite dish of pickled herring was first set before him ; he is said to have observed with considerable emphasis , that patriotism might possibly induce one to eat the ireatures , but nothing else could . We may well conceive , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish farmer , striking a note of inspiration , to which saloons and palaces bad long been stran ers ; breathing , in this neglected and unfashionable dialect , the sweetest wood-notes wild ; casting aside all conventional restraints , and pouring the full tide of song from the depths of a chivalrous and burning heart . No wonder , that the philosophers of Edinburgh gazed upon the stranger with perplexity , if not with awe , while he rekindled the patriotic fires , which they had labored to extinguish ; no wonder , that the peasant in his cottage , the lady in her bower , the baron in his hall , welcomed with gratitude and pride the new defender of their country 's fame , who stood before them in the manly dignity of genius , with the seal of inspiration on his brow . And what a history was that of Robert Burns ! From childhood to maturity , he is condemned by hopeless want to labor , till he exhausts a constitution of unusual vigor ; his verses are composed and repeated to those around him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes hard with him , and he resolves to seek in another land the prosperous fortune , which his own denies . In order to defray the expenses of his voyage , he publishes a collection of his poems ; and then , for the first time , bursts upon the world the knowledge of his power . He goes to Edinburgh ; there he is courted by the wise , the brilliant , and the gay ; the nianly form and flashing eye of the young farmer are the attraction of the glittering saloon , while his conversation is the wonder of the philosophic circle ; but these are unprofitable honors ; and his country has no higher permanent reward for him , than the post of an exciseman . The principle , once superior to adverse fortune , melts beneath the morning sunbeams of prosperity ; his prospects are now shrouded in deeper gloom ; lie retains virtue enough to lament his errors and infirmities , and too much strength of passion to // correct them ; instead of submitting to the evils incident to his condition , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , as the imprisoned eagle dashes himself against the iron hars of his cage ; till at length he sinks , in the prime of manhood , into an obscure and almost unhonored grave . Dugald Stewart expressed the opinion , that the intellect of Burns , bold , vigorous and commanding as it was , must have rendered him conspicuous , to whatever subject it might be applied . Others have believed that it was even better adapted to other departments of thought , than that to which it was devoted ; but it is on his poetry alone , that his fame will permanently rest . Much of this can be remembered only with regret , as the effusion of a reckless and ungoverned spirit , repelling by its coarseness , more than it attracts hy its power . He was formed for higher purposes than to grovel in rude invective , or to amuse a bacchanalian rabble with licentious songs . His heart was naturally a fountain of generous and manly feeling , whose waters gushed out in a sparkling tide , spreading around them a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his fidelity to nature . it is by this that he touches the most delicate chords of sympathy ; and where shall we look for a finer example of this power , than in his Cotter 's Saturday Night , so familiar , yet how beautiful ! The peasantry of Scotland loved him ; for he invested their feelings and sentiments , their joys and sorrows , with dignity and beauty ; he redeemed their language from contempt ; he made the heart of every true Scot burn within him , as he thought of the hills and valleys of his native land ; he guided the footsteps of the pilgrim to the scenes of her traditional glories ; he sung those glories in such lofty strains , that the world stood still to listen . " When the first shovel-full of earth sounded on his coffin lid , " says his biographer , who was present at his funeral , I looked up , and saw tears on many cheeks , where tears were not usual . " A just and touching tribute to the bard , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; who had shewn , by testimony not soon to be forgotten , that wherever human nature is , the reare the elements of poetry . " Did you never observe , " said Gray , ( when rocking winds are piping loud ' ) " that pause , when the gust is re-collecting itself and rising on the ear in a shrill and plaintive note , like the swell of an Eolian harp ? I do assure you , there is nothing in the world , so likp the voice of a spirit . " in his better mo // ments , in the pauses of the storm , the melody of Burns was like the spirit 's voice ; nothing could be more touching or more unaffected than his strain ; but the dark hour , the season of the conflict of his fiery passions , was his most familiar one ; then he ran through every mode of the lyre , from the deepest tones of sorrow to the grandest strain of prophecy . With him , poetry was indeed the language of passion . Nature 's sternest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevailing habit of his soul . " There is scarcely any earthly object , " says he , " gives me more , -1 do not know that I should call it pleasure , - but something which exalts me , something which enraptures me , - than to walk in the sheltered side of a wood or a high plantation , in a cloudy winter day , and hear the stormy wind howling among the trees , and raving over the plain . It is my best season for devotion ; my mind is rapt up in a kind of enthusiasm to Him who , in the language of the Hebrew bard , walks on the wings of the wind . " He composed the noble address of Bruce to his army at Bannockburn , while riding in a terrific storm of wind and rain . Would that he had never been unfaithful to nature , whether bright with sunshine or dark with storm ! Would that he had never suffered the ashes to gather over his celestial fire ; had never failed to remember , that the noblest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief and melancholy career of Burns terminated at the age of thirty-seven ; but there is little probability that , with his fierce spirit and consuming passions , added to the misery of blighted hope , length of days would have much enhanced his renown , or that his later years would have fulfilled the rich promise of the spring . In beautiful contrast with him , stands his contemporary , Cowper , - truly a man of God , - held in reverence by all , who love to see high talent in delightful union with the amiable virtues ; by all , who can sympathize with a meek and lowly spirit , crushed by the heaviest calamity under which humanity is ever called to suffer , yet always breathing out from the depth of his affliction the accents of love to God , and good will to man . His multiplied biographies have made his personal history familiar to all readers . Year after year was his fine intellect shrouded by insanity , and when the close of life drew nigh , his condition realized the idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitiveness , combined with the infirmities of a very delicate frame , compelled him early to retire from the agitation of the world , into deep // seclusion ; - there , like a river in the wilderness , unseen of man , but reflecting the bright blue sky of Heaven from its bosom , his days passed tranquilly away . But his solitude was not the cold and selfish seclusion of the anchorite ; it did not chill the current of his generous affections ; and his sorrows , which were many , melted without hardening his heart . No man had ever a stronger hold on the hearts of those around him ; his unobtrusive charities , his tenderness for others , made his whole life an emblem of the influences of the faith , on which his soul was anchored . Nothing can he more touching than the love with which he clung to the remembrance of the mother , whom he lost in infancy ; his allusions to her in his writings remind us of those addressed by Pope to the venerable parent , who was spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of Mrs. Unwin , - the excellent friend who watched him through that painful suffering , when the burden of affection ceases to be light and easy , and the love of many waxes cold , - is indissolubly bound with his . Under every aspect , and in all its relations , the character of Cowper may be studied with profit and delight . His genius was as bold and original , as his character was pure and humble . There is not one of the poets of his coun*. try , who owed less to these who went before bin ) ; the path in which he adventured was his own , and he trod it with a just and manly confidence in his own powers . His poetry is a faithful transcript of his own thoughts and feelings , as his descriptions are living copies of the scenery and objects around him . Sometimes he ventures into the domain of satire ; perhaps too frequently ; though his ridicule is never personal , it is not always in perfect harmony with the prevailing gravity of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect which he does produce arises not from highly wrought passa* ges , but from the general strain and tenor of his writings ; in .. deed , he is so natural and unpretending , that the very absence of apparent effort sometimes causes the reader to lose sight of the extent and versatility of his genius . Yet his powers were vast and varied . Now he utters the grand and melancholy warnings of the Hebrew prophets ; now his inimitable humor flashes out with sinoular attraction ; presently , familiar scenes are brought most vividly before us in his graphic descriptions . Under all circumstances , he awakens a deep interest in the welfare of his race , and the loftiest aspirations for their intellectual and social freedom . Other poets had looked upon re // ligion as the rock of the desert ; Cowper struck that rock as with the prophet 's rod , and made it flow with healing waters . He transplanted new subjects into the dom&amp;n of poery , and wade them flourish with unwonted beauty . Who , bef re him , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the recollections oC the happy fireside ? Who , before him , ever spread over outward nature the chastened light of religious feeling , which makes it lovely as our own autumnal landscape , under the sweet influences of the Indian summer ? We are aware , that we have given but a faint and imperfect sketch of the poetry of the latter part of the last century ; one , which will perhaps only remind the reader of the remark of Johnson on the work of an English traveller ; that it contained unimportant details of his passage from one place where he saw little , to another , where he saw no more . " There are several names , of some distinction too , to which we have not even alluded . Our purpose was rather to dwell upon those individuals , who exercised considerable influence , for good or evil , over writers who came after them . We can enumerate but three , who had ability enough to leave the beaten track , and to present themselves in the attitude , and with the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Burns and Cowper . Each of these poets , with different degrees of power and success , labored to turn back the current of false sentiment , and to set his seal , visibly and deeply , upon his age . The influence of Crabbe , for reasons already intimated , was very limited ; the cloud did not attract the eye , because it rarely turned out its silver lining on the night . With the single exception of the Corn-law rhymer , we know of no succeeding poet , who can be said to have been inspired by his example . That of Burns and Cowper was more direct and obvious . As the shades were closing around the eighteenth century , several stars , of more than ordinary brilliancy , were successively appearing above the horizon . Campbell had already published his Pleasures of Hope , the very best of all his poems ; suggested perhaps by the Pleasures of Memory of Rogers , which appeared not long before ; and Coleridge , Southey , Wordsworth , and Scott had already exhibited their rich and various powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the influence of Burns and Cowper was chiefly manifested . Burns laid open the new world of Scottish scenery , manners , language , and cl'rnracter , to other and more fortunate adventurers , and thus enabled Scott // to gather an unfading laurel harvest from the heaths and mountains of his country . It is a circumstance worth remembering , that Burns himself appears to have foreseen the future glory of the mighty minstrel . When Scott was quite a lad , he caught the notice of the poet , by naming the author of some verses , describing a soldier lying dead on the sno*v . Burns regarded the future minstrel with sparkling eyes , and said , Young man , you have begun to consider these things early . ' He paused on seeing Scott 's flushing face , and shook him by the hand , saying , in a deep tone , This boy will be heard of yet . ' Nor was the effect of his lyrical success less striking ; there can be little doubt that the melodies of Moore , which are worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those , by which Burns did so much for the fame of Scottish ininstrelsy . Still less can it be questioned , that the diversified and brilliant character of all the later poets we have mentioned , may in great part be traced to the force and originality of Cowper 's example . Of all the poets of his time , he is certainly to be regarded with the greatest veneration ; his memory will be the very last to fail . It is well that it should be so ; for his aim was to raise poetry to its proper elevation , by making it the handmaid of high and holy purposes , the nurse of lofty aspirations for virtue and religious purity and of ardent sympathy with what is free and noble , the enlarger of the intellect , and the purifier of the heart . We do not deem it a vain and idle persuasion , that the day will come , when her celestial vestments and starry diadem will no more adorn the painted forms of vice and sensuality ; when mankind will no longer do homage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living generation shall not taste of death , before the eastern sky kindle with the day-spring , that shall herald the coming of an age , when poetry , instead of turning the waters into blood , like the burning mountain of the apocalypse , shall bear some faint resemblance to the descending city of the same mysterious vision , over the light of whose towers and palaces darkness shall have no dominion , and into whose gates shall enter nothing but the pure and blameless . Mr. Allan Cunningham , the author of the biography before us , is not unknown to the lovers of our contemporary literature . His father , a respectable Scottish farmer , was steward of the proprietor of the farm of Ellisland in Nithsdale , on which Burns dwelt for a few years prior to his removal to // Dumfries , where he resided in the capacity of an exciseman , until his death ; and appears to have been a man of sense and capacity . He endeavored to dissuade the poet from selecting this farm , on which his fortune was wrecked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but far more fertile , which he offered him ; but finding his remonstrances unavailing , remarked to him , " Mr. Burns , you have made a poet 's , not a farmer 's choice . " The life of Burns had been previously written by men abundantly inclined to do the subject justice , but who had all , with the exception of Mr. Lockhart , done his memory much wrong . The narrative of Mr. Heron was written at the time when a subscription was raising for the benefit of the poet 's family , and is mentioned by Cunningham in terms of much severity , as equally unfeeling and unjust . Currie and Walker , men of talent and liberal feeling , both of ' whom were warm in their admiration of Burns , appear to have been misled by the accounts of others in their view of some portions of his history ; Jeffrey did perhaps still more to strengthen these erroneous impressions , by a harsh and unfeeling notice in the Edinburgh Review ; and the honorable task of vindicating the memory of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reserved for Mr. Lockhart , who accomplished it in a manner alike creditable to his feelings and his ability . He has shewn , by testimony not open to exception , that Burns , however he may have yielded to temptation , when allured by the attractions of society , never did so without self-reproach ; that he was not habitually degraded ; and that the light of manly feeling and principle within him , though it often wavered , was never extinguished . The example of Lockhart in this particular has been followed by Mr. Cunningham . His narrative derives much interest from the fact , that he writes with the feeling of one , whose early circumstances naturally bound him by strong sympathy with Burns . The other biographers had contemplated the poet from a high point of social elevation ; Mr. Cunningham observes him from a different level , and writes with deeper interest and feeling . Without finding it in his power to collect many new facts , he has yet been able to prepare a very interesting narrative , and one which will be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is remernbered of the history of a man of extraordinary genius . The following extract will be read with deep interest . It describes Burns 's death and funeral . // " Sea-bathing relieved for a while the pains in the poet 's limbs ; but his appetite failed ; he was oppressed with melancholy ; he looked ruefully forward , and saw misery and ruin ready to swallow his helpless household up . Burns grew feverish on the 14th of July , ( 1796 ; ) felt himself sinking , and longed to he at home . He returned on the 18th , in a small spring cart ; the ascent to his own house was steep , and the cart stopped at the foot of the Mill-hole-brae ; when he alighted , he shook much and stood with difficulty ; he seemed unable to stand upright . He stooped , as if in pain , and walked tottering towards his own door ; his looks were hollow and ghastly , and those who saw him then never expected to see him in life again . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brow much worse than when he went away ; and it was added that he was dying . The anxiety of the people , high and low , was very great . I was present and saw it . Whenever two or three were together , their talk was of Burns , and of him alone . They spoke of his history , of his person , and of his works , of his witty sayings and his sarcastic replies , and of his too early fate , with much enthusiasm , and sometimes with deep feeling . All that he had done , and all that they had hoped he wolild ac* complish , were talked of ; half a dozen of them stopped Dr. Maxwell in the street , and said , How is Burns , Sir ? ' He shook his head , saying , he can not be worse , ' and passed on to be sub-* jected to similar inquiries farther up the way . I heard one of a group inquire with much simplicity , Who do you think will be our poet now " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor was unruffled , and his wit never forsook him . When he looked up and saw Dr. Maxwell at his bed-side ,  --  ' Alas , ' he said , What has brought you here ? I am but a poor crow , and not worth plucking . ' He pointed to his pistols , took them in his hand , and gave them to Maxwell , saying they could not be in worthier keening , and he should never more have need of them . This relieved his proud heart from a sense of obligation . Soon afterwards h&amp;saw Gibson , one of his brother volunteers , by the bed-side , with tears in his eyes . He smiled and said , John , do n't let the awkward squad fire over me. * " His little household presented a melancholy spectacle ; the poet dying ; his wife in hourly expectation of being confined ; four helpless children wandering from room to room , gazing on their miserable parents , and little of food or cordial kind to pacify the whole or soothe the sick . To Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works are much indebted ; she acted with the prudence of a sister and the tenderness of a daughter , // and kept desolation away , though she could not keep disease . A tremor , ' says Maxwell , pervaded his frame ; his tongue , though often refreshed , became parched ; and his mind , when not roused by conversation , sunk into delirium . On the second and third day after his return from the Brow , the fever increased , and his strength diminished . On the fourth day , when his attendant held a cordial to his lips , lie swallowed it eagerly , rose almost wholly up , spread out his hands , sprang forward nigh the whole length of the bed , fell on his face and expired . He was thirtyseven years and seven months old , and of a form and strength which promised long life ; but the great and inspired are often cut down in youth , while Villains ripen gray with time . " " His interment took place on the twenty-fifth of July ; nor should it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , while his body was borne along the street , his widow was taken in labor and delivered of a son , who survived his birth but a short while . The leading men of the town and neighborhood appeared as mourners ; the streets were lined by the Angus-shire Fencibles and the Cinque Ports Cavalry , and his body was borne by the volunteers to the old Kirk-yard , with military honors . The multitude who followed amounted to many thousands . It was an impressive and a mournful sight ; all was orderly and decorous . The measured steps , the military array , the colors displayed , and the muffled drum , I thought then , and think now , had no connexion with a pastoral bard . I mingled with the mourners . On reaching the grave into which the poet 's body was about to descend , there was a pause among them , as if loth to part with his remains ; and when the first shovel-full of earth sounded on the coffin-lid , I looked up , and saw tears on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surmise of Burns by three ragged and straggling vollies ; the earth was heaped up , and the vast multitude melted silently away . " In connexion with the biography , Mr. Cunningham has favored the public with a new edition of the works of Burns , doubtless the most complete and valuable that has yet appeared . He has endeavored to arrange the several productions , as far as might be , in the order in which they were composed , and has illustrated them with a variety of copious annotations , containing much curious and entertaining information . He has procured a large number of poetical pieces , which were not included in the edition of Currie , together with many letters , not previously published . In filling up the blanks which had been // left by other editors with the names of persons and places originally intended , he has received much aid from the early friends and correspondents of Burns . Whether he may not have been more free in his revelations than was consistent with the regard due to individuals or to surviving friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inclined to fear that in some instances the public curiosity will he gratified at the expense of private feeling . There can be no doubt , however , that he is eminently qualified for the execution of his task by his familiarity with the domestic habits and manners , and the other peculiarities of the peasantry of Scotland , as well as by his early acquaintance with the scenes , where a portion of the life of Burns was spent , after he had become the object of general curiosity and admiration . By all , who desire to be most intiinately acquainted with the character and writings of the poet , the result of his labors will probably be regarded as superseding the necessity of any future investigation . In order to enable us to form an entirely accurate judgment of the character and powers of a man of genius , it may perhaps be desirable that we should be in possession of those minute particulars , which indicate the general current , as well as the changes of his thoughts and feelings , and which bring the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the daily intercourse of life ; hut it can not be denied , that the person who is thus revealed to the world , is unfortunate beyond the ordinary lot ; that he is exposed to a trial , from which few could escape unharmed . Many are happy enough to present to the public their own portraits of their own character , and to obliterate , or at least to soften the harTher features of extravagance and folly . Far different has been the fate of Burns . Every burst of passion , every violent and sometimes intolerably coarse outbreak of satire , every infidel exclamation , every howl of debauchery , every thing , in short , which fell from the lips or pen of one so conspicuous , and the very extravagance or rudeness of which caused it to be remembered , has been faithfully treasured up , and we see him as he was ; - his character stripped of the veil , with which tenderness is apt to cover frailty . He appears to have anticipated that such would he his fate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in his history may yet derive from it the monitory lesson , so beautifully conveyed by Wordsworth in his address to the sons of Burns , on visiting the grave of their father . // " Let no mean hope your souls enslave ; Be independent , generous , brave ; Your father such example gave , And such revere : But be admonished by his grave , And think and fear 1 "
