txt IN  --  a preceding lecture , Gentlemen , I took a rapid survey of the principal events and characters of the French Revolution from its commencement until the period of the fall of Napoleon . I shall now invite your attention to a few observations of the same cursory description upon the subsequent progress of t up to the present day . his great action , The real cause of the French Revolution , as I had the honor of reminding you on the occasion just alluded to , was the inconsistency between the condition of the people and the existing forms of government . The forms of government , which had been established centuries before , and by which the whole political power of the state was committed to a few hereditary rulers , remained unaltered ; while the *people , on the other hand , having in the interval gradually risen in the scale of civilization , felt their importance , and deemed it proper , that , as they possessed the wealth and knowledge which constitute the substantial elements of power , they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . This pretension was obviously just ; but it was nevertheless quite natural , that it should be strenuously resisted by the privileged classes , who owed their personal importance to the existing system ; and this conflict of interest , and , consequently , of opinion and feeling between the established authorities on the one hand , and the body of the people on the other ; although it might , under more auspicious circumstances , have been quietly adjusted by mutual concession , terminated ,  --  as the case actually turned ,  --  in violent convulsions and open war . The same state of things which I have now described as existing in France , prevailed substantially , though under great varieties in form , in other parts of Europe ; and hence the French Revolution had no sooner obtained its full development at home , than it lost its exclusive character , and became a European concern . The war that commenced in France became at once general . The *established governments on the one hand , and the body of the people on the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves throughout all Europe , without regard to territorial or national divisions . Their respective forces were , however , exceedingly various in different countries . In all the western nations , where the body of the people had long been comparatively well informed , civilized , and wealthy , they possessed of course a vast superiority of real power . In the Eastern nations , particularly Russia and Austria , the body of the people were still for the most part in the same condition in which they had been in the West five or six hundred years before ; I mean , that of actual slavery ; and the political power was almost wholly , both in form and reality , in the hands of the government . The strength of the aristocratic , or , as it has sometimes been called , legitimate party , lay therefore in the East of Europe , and particularly in Russia , while that of the liberal , or democratic party , was to be found in the West . The British government , however , which , like all the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was able , from its immense pecuniary resources , to become a most important member of the alliance . The war that grew up between these great European parties , and of which Lome of the principal movements were detailed in my preceding lecture , was carried on nearly twenty years in various quarters and with various success . For a loi*g time , the advantage was entirely in favor of the people . It was found on trial , that the enthusiasm for independence and liberty , which inspired their armies , was more than sufficient*-as a principle of strength ,  --  to counterbalance the superiority of discipline , and generally numbers , on the other side . In France-in Portugal and Spain ,  --  in Italy and a great part of Germany ,  --  in short , throughout the whole West of Europe , where , as I have just remarked , the people possessed the real power , they succeeded in abolishing the ancient governments , and establishing others on their ruins . Great-Britain alone forms an exception to this remark . The reason was , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , at the Revolution of 1688 , been in a good degree accommodated to the condition and wants of the community ; so that there was less pretext for complaint , and consequently less enthusiasm and power on the popular side . // For a long time , however , the people prevailed throughout the whole West . At length the scene changed . The legitimate armies obtained a complete ascendancy , - carried back the war into the enemy 's country , and displayed their victorious standards at the head-quarters of the whole revolution in Paris . This triumph was , however , rather apparent than real , and the means . by which it was effected are worth considering , as they serve to explain the events that followed , and that gradually brought on the second Revolution . The change of fortune , to which I allude , was effected by a change of opinion and feeling in the body of the people respecting the proceedings and character of their own champion . Napoleon ,  --  essentially a mere soldier , but rendered by cir -- cumstances the leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional passion for war ,  --  the duties that belonged to his political station . Instead of relieving the people from the burdens that formerly oppressed them , and allowing them a share in the administration of the government , he monopolized the whole power in his own person , and practised on the people an extent of oppression which they had never experienced , even from their old rulers . At the close of a struggle for liberty , equality and a just and upright system of government , in which they had obtained an apparent triumph , they found themselves crushed to the earth with intolerable taxes ,  --  decimated by conscriptions ,  --  totally deprived* of the liberty of speech and of the press ,  --  hampered in all their private movements by the intermeddling of a lawless and unprincipled police ,  --  debarred from the ocean ,  --  subjected , in a word , to all the terrors of a most ruthless military despotism . For a time , they cherished the delusive hope , that all this was a merely temporary arrangement ,  --  that Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of aiming his blows with more , effect at the common enemy ; but that when the triumph of the people should a*ppear to be complete and final , he would resign his titles ,  --  throw away his staff o office , and , like the old Roman heroes , sink the dictator in the private citizen . Considering him as their leader and virtual representative , they consoled themselves for a time under all their privations and inflictions , with the pride they felt in his splendid military achievements , and the humiliation he inflicted on their old oppressors , from all which they fondly anticipated n speedy arrival of better times .. But when they found matters , instead of mending , growing worse from year to ' year ,  --  when the yoke under which they were laboring , instead of being taken off , was constantly rendered heavier and heavier , they at last lost patience , and opened their eyes to the true state of things . They then saw , that they had been duped by their own champion ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid talents and the advantages of his position , was the aggran -- dizement of himself and his family ,  --  that he had confiscated to his own personal profit the prize which he had bought with their blood , and that instead of securing to them the enjoyment of their liberty , which was the object of all their efforts , he intended to found another despotism , more brilliant , perhaps , but also more relentless and rigorous , upon the ruins of the one which they had overthrown . When they saw these things , they lost of course , their attachment to his person and their interest in his success . The tide of popular favor turned against him .. For many years before his fall , he had no friends in France excepting his army ; and even his own Marshals at length grew weary , and complained with bitterness that he would never be easy until he had slaughtered them all to the last man . In the foreign countries under his influence , the feeling of disgust was still more intense . Throughout Germany , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of encouraging each other , in the name of Honor and ' Virtue , to assist in shaking off the yoke . The position and character of the two parties to the great struggle were now precisely the reverse of what they had been at its commencement . The party claiming to be liberal had nothing to depend upon but a superior military organization , while the power of the established governments consisted , in a good degree , in the enthusiasm for independence that prevailed among their subjects . Experience proved a second time ,  --  as it ever will ,  --  that the effect of moral motives will always outweigh that of merely physical ones . The same flood of popular feeling which had carried the French in triumph to every part of Europe , no sooner flowed in the opposite direction , . than it brought the allies with equal rapidity and facility to the capital of France . Victory in both cases followed the standard of the people , and the only difference was , that , in the first instance , the popular standard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , it had been transferred to that of the established goveruments. // Such were the means by which the change of fortune in the war between the body of the people and the established governments , was at last effected . The nature of these had ,  --  as I remarked before , * good deal of influence upon the results of the victory . If the allied monarchs had succeeded in any preceding period , or in any other way , they would doubtless have crushed the Revolution at every point where it had obtained the ascendancy , and in France , particularly , its he quarters and principal seat , would have restored the ancient system in all its purity . But as they had finally effected their object in a great degree by the aid of the popular feeling and in the name of independence , justice , and the rights of man , they could not , with consistency , nor did they , under the impressions of the moment , desire to keep them entirely out of view in making their arrangements for a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their leading parts , upon the principle of a compromise between the two great parties . In France , the banished royal family were restored , but the most important alterations in the form of government , which had been demanded by the d7eputies of the people , in the first National Assembly , and which were the ostensible objects of the popular party , were embodied in a written Constitution , denominated the Charter . This document provided for a participation by the people , through their representatives , in the exercise of the legislative power , for the liberty of speech , writing and action within the limits prescribed by fixed laws , and for the equalit o individuals for every political and legal purpose . It was well fitted ,  --  if faithfully executed ,  --  to satisfy the desires of the rational friends of liberty . A similar arrangement took place in the Netherlands , and the sovereigns composing the German confederacy bound themselves by the act of union to esta*lishirepresentative constitutions in their respective States . Even in Poland , where the condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Emperor of Russia ,  --  as a pledge of his disposition to do even more than might appear strictly necessary or politic in favor of liberty ,  --  freely conceded the form of a representative government . Such , Gentlemen , were the origin and character of the celebrated French charter . It has formed , ever sinc*e its adoption , the rallying point of the friends of liberty in France.t- By the effect of it , the people became , if not everything , at least something , in the State ; and , when executed in the spirit in which it was conceived , it afforded all the necessary securities for the personal and political rights of the citizen . It was , however , in the nature of a compromise or contract , between the people on the one hand , and their sovereign on the other ; and considered as a compromise , was not particularly favorable to the people , a vast majority of whom would probably have preferred a representative republic to any other form of government , and were only induced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from abroad . Under these circumstances , it was quite natural , that they should watch over the manner in which this instrument was executed , with extraordinary jealousy , and that an undisguised attempt by the king to set it aside , should have produced the violent convulsions and the disastrous reaction against himself which we have lately witnessed . A rapid review of the intervening period will shew you the steps which led to this great catastrophe , and the persons who were chiefly instrumental in bringing it about . It was said by a celebrated French statesman of the exiled race of French kings , that , on their return to France , they proved by their conduct , that they had learned nothing and forgotten nothing . They had brought back all the antiquated notions and personal animosities which they carried away with them , and had derived no lessons for their future conduct from their long tuition in the school of adversity . The remark was in general but too true in its application both to them and the principal persons of their court ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prince who first occupied the throne under the name of Louis XVIII . formed in some degree an exception to it . At the outset of the revolution , he had declared himself in favor of the popular party , and though compelled , soon after , to emigrate , he had remained through life a known adherent of the liberal political opinions . He was also much superior in talent , taste , and literary accomplishments , to most persons of his rank . In his youth , his propensity for study had been so markable , that he was commonly called , by the other members of the Royal Family , the Pedant ; and he occasionally published , under feigned names , literary works , which evinced a cultivated and accomplished mind . In the long and dreary period of his exile , he had had ample leisure to mature his judgement by reading and reflection ; and on his accession to the crown , was , on the whole , very able , and // 193 very well disposed to estimate correctly the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was his policy to pursue . His personal opinions , disposition and character , have always been considered as among the principal causes which contributed to give a liberal aspect to the new government , and he has ever since been commonly spoken of as the author of the Charter . Hence it was , that when , during the progress of the late revolution , the people invaded the Tuileries , and tore from their pedestals the busts of several of the French sovereigns , they spared that of Louis XVIII . and threw a black veil over it , as if to intimate that the author of the Charter was mourning for the violation of his favorite work . It may be added that the person of Louis formed a strange contrast with the rich and gorgeous exterior which we are apt to connect in our imaginations with the notion of a sovereign . He was originally not well constituted , and in the later years of his life was the victim of a complication of diseases , which reduced his body to a living mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was moved about on a rolling chair , incapable , even when he spoke , of lifting up his head , which rested like a dead weight upon his breast . When the people beheld this repulsive object , they could not help contrasting it with the brilliant image of his predecessor at the head of his army ; and sometimes significantly remarked , in allusion to the name of both upon the coin of the country , that eighteen Louis were not worth one Napoleon . At the time of his return , he was , however , still in tolerable health , and was disposed ,  --  as I have remarked ,  --  by character and principle , to pursue the true line of policy . During his first short reign of less than a year , he was diverted from this course by the importunity of his courtiers ; but the fatal consequences of his errors ,  --  the return of Bonaparte  --  the hundred days  --  and another general convulsion throughout Europe , were sufficient to prevent a repetition of them . We find him accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inviting some of the principal adherents of the popular party to his councils , and giving , on the whole , a liberal aspect to the adrninistratiois . The adoption of this policy excited , of course , a very strong disgust among the violent partisans of arbitrary principles , at the head of whom stood the Count DArtois , the heir apparent of the crown , who has since held and lost it under the name of Charles the Tenth . This prince was in almost every particular , intellectual , personal and moral the reverse of his brother . He was tall and xveil-formed , with a prepossessing countenance , elegant manners , and a sprightly wit . In earlier life , he had figured at the court of Louis XVI . as one of the most graceful and accomplished gentlemen of the day , and had won all hearts by his affable demeanor and polished manners . He was then a man of pleasure and gallantry , and gave but little attention to political affairs ; but he was regarded even then as a most decided opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror came on in France , he was one of the first to adopt the very doubtful policy of emigration , and during the earlier part of the war , he served against his country in the army of the emigrant nobles . In later life , when the age of gallantry was over , he became religious , and wanting the strength of mind to direct and govern his devotional feelings , he fell much under the influence of designing men , who abused the name and office of the Priesthood for selfish purposes , and whose evil counsel contributed greatly to his downfall . Had his political character been different , his personal advantages would have rendered him a very popular king . These he retained to a remarkable degree up to the close of his public career . On my return from Spain last year , I had the honor of seeing and conversing with him an hour in his cabinet , and have rarely witnessed so fine a specimen of hearty , cheerful , and vigorous old age . He was then nearly seventy-five years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercise of all his faculties , and evidently in the full enjoyment of life . At this time he regularly hunted twice a week on horseback , in the royal forests , and this practice , which he had pursued through life , had probably contributed very much to the preservation of his health and vigor . He still exhibited the affability and gracefulness of manner which distinguished him in youth , nor did he appear by any means to want intelligence and information . He conversed with freedom and ability on political subjects , and the opinions which he expressed were judicious , and even liberal . He blamed the king of Spain for his refusal to acknowledge the independence of the colonies , and spoke with interest and approbation of the institutions of our country . I was satisfied from his conversation , that he had more talent than his ministers , and that if he had felt s*ifflcient confidence in himself to trust his own judgement , he would have // avoided the fatal course upon which he had entered , and which ,  --  as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must end in his ruin . It was truly painful to see a Prince possessed of so many advantages and accomplishments , after having been almost miraculously restored , from a hopeless exile of twenty years , to the height of earthly prosperity ,  --  now under the influence of evil counsels , plunging headlong again into the same gulf from which he had just escaped , and from which there would evidently be no second return . In this way , Gentlemen , was the royal family divided , as it were , against itself ; the king on one side , and the heir apparent of the crown , with his two sons , the Dukes of Angoul*me and Bern on the other . With such dissensions among these Princes , you will readily conclude , that there was no great harmony among the people . There grew up immediately a war of parties , which was carried on , however , in a much milder form than that which raged during the former revolution . The pen was now the principal weapon , and it was managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the respective champions . Among them were to be found , in fact , some of the very best writers of this or any only known as a man of letters , but who has since become illustrious as a powerful orator ,  --  the Abbt* de Pradt , the most prolific and elegant of mere pamphleteers , and a host of others of less notoriety , ficrured in defence of the p*opular party . On the other side were found the names ofvHaller , de Bonald , de Maistre , de la Mennais , and especially the Viscount de Ch*teaubriand . This distinguished person , who has since acquired new glory by his great exertions in favor of liberty , was then a conscientious and ardent advocate of the opposite opinions . He had already rendered himself dear to the young and feeling , by his beautiful romances , to the wise by his Genius of Christianity , and to all by his splendid and classical style . With such leaders , it is easy to conceive , that the quarrel was pursued with ample spirit , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a controversy which has called forth a more brilliant exhibition of taste and talent , or of which the monuments will be read with more interest in future times , when the party feelings of the present day shall have passed away forever . While this war of words and ink was going on in France , there broke out very suddenly , in several other parts of Europe , a war of a different and far more serious character , which ultimately had much influence in bringing about the late events in France . I allude to the military revolutions of 1820 , which took place almost simultaneously in Spain , Portugal , Naples , and Sardinia . All these countries had been , through the whole period of the first French revolution , directly under the influence of France , and the active part of the population had become thoroughly imbued with the feelings and principles that naturally resulted from this state of things . When the restoration took place , the benefit of the compromise which had formed the basis of the new government in France was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even required the introduction of great reforms in the administration of the government , no change whatever had been made ,  --  no charter ,  --  no representation of the people ,  --  no freedom of speech ,  - -  no security for personal liberty . In some cases , the sovereigns had given the most direct and positive assurances , that they would reform the government in a manner agreeab.le to the people ; but at the first moment of ease , had recanted their en agements as violent and void . The king of Spain , for example , formally promise , immediately after his return , to establish a representative constitution ; but , instead of keeping his royal word , restored in every particular the ancient s y stem , and persecuted , with unrelenting vigor , all persons who had rendered themselves prominent among the friends of liberty . The divine Arguelles was sent to the galleys like a common malefactor . In Germany , also , although some of the members of the confederacy very honorably fulfilled the promises they had made to the same effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly Austria and Prussia , either neglected this duty altogether , or performed it in an illusory manner . At a period when insurrections and revolutions had become so frequent as to be almost habitual , the consequences of all this might have been easily foreseen , and were not slow in manifesting themselves . Troubles in Germany ,  --  attempts at military insurrection in France ,  --  secret associations for political purposes in all parts of Europe ,  --  these were the first indications of the hidden mischief . Finally , on the 1st of January , 1820 , the expedition of 10,000 men , which had been assembled at the Isle of Leon in Spain , for the purpose of proceeding to Anerica , to the conquest of the revolted colonies , openly declared // against the government , and proclaimed the constitution that had been adopted by the Cortes in 1812 . So entirely was this proclamation in accordance with the public sentiment , that it was echoed instantaneously from every part of the Peninsula . The government hardly retained a single adherent , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his safety to take the oath . Nor did the expression of sympathy stop here . The example of Spain was imitated in the course of the year in Portugal , Naples , and Sardinia : and so eager were the people to enjoy the benefit of the proposed changes in the forms of their governments , that , without giving themselves time to frame constitutions , they adopted everywhere the identical Spanish constitution of 1812 . At Naples , it is said , that they had not even a copy of this instrument before them at the time when they proclaimed it the supreme law of the land . Such was the manner in which the reign of liberal institutions was established , as it were , by acclamation through the whole Southwest of Europe . These mushroom liberal Constitutions , as you are well aware , Gentlemen , were suppressed by the armed intervention of the Allied Powers , almost as promptly as they were formed . In the mean time , however , they excited great alarm in all the courts of Europe , and particularly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevailing current of feeling , and to occasion the adoption of a policy unfavorable to the charter . But another occurrence , in itself of much less importance , probably did more than these revolutions to produce this effect ,  --  I mean , the assassination of the Duke de Bern , the son of the Count D'Artois , and one of the presumptive heirs to the crown . It so happened , that , about this time , a journeyman saddler , named Louvel , in a fit of political fanaticism , or more properly insanity , attacked this prince one night at the door of the theatre , and inflicted upon him a mortal wound . You would hardly suppose , Gentlemen , that any one could have suspected the king 's confidential servants of being privy to an outrage of this description ; but such is the force of party feeling , that the next day a member of the House of Deputies moved an impeachment of the Prime Minister for high treason , as an accomplice in the assassination of the Duke de Bern . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court appear to have acted on the supposition that it was conformable to fact . The ministers , though not impeached , were immediately removed , and a new line of policy adopted , unfavorable to the charter and to the progress of political improvement . Thus , Gentlemen , did a single act of an obscure and isolated individual contribute more , perhaps , than any other circumstance , to determine the course of events in one of the greatest monarchies in Europe . This happened during the life of Louis XVIII . but after the total decay of his health had in a great measure incapacitated him from exercising any influence upon the conduct of the public affairs . His death , which happened soon after , in the year 1823 , transferred the crown from the head of the author of the charter to that of a known enemy of liberal principles , and of course confirmed the new direction that had been given to the national policy . The first result of the change of ministry had been the despatch of an army of 100,000 men into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This measure was followed at home by others of a similar character . The influence of the government was now regularly exerted at all the elections against the liberal party , and with such effect , that , for a time , the number of opposition deputies was reduced to fourteen out of more than four hundred . Had the court at this juncture silenced the press , they would prubably have succeeded in their purpose , and rid themselves after a while without much difficulty of the obnoxious charter . But whether from mere neglect , or undue confidence in their own strength , the court , while they were constantly engaged in making new attempts on the chartered rights of the people , permitted the opposition journals to comment on their proceedings with perfect freedom , and it must be owned that they performed the office with signal ability . Ch*teaubriand ,  --  the ablest writer of the time ,  --  had joined the popular party , and with a host of other powerful men , kept up in all the papers a constant battery upon the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of the elections . The friends of liberty began to reappear in the House of Deputies . Lafayette and his son were again elected . The Abbe de Pradt and Benjamin Constant took their seats . At every accidental vacancy , some new member was added to the opposition , until finally , at the next general election in 1827 , the minister was left in a minority . At this decided indication of thefeeling of the people , the king at first recoiled . He removed the obnoxious ministers , and for the next two years pursued a vacillating course , which gave satisfaction to neither party . Compellid // at length to come to some decision , he reverted in an evil hour to his former policy ,  --  made up his mind to brave the people , and on the 8th of August , 1829 , placed the Prince de Polignac ,  --  a personal favorite vf his own , and whose name was the known symbol of arbitrary principles ,  --  at the head of the government . The news of this appointment was received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time to be travelling in France , and heard the first intelligence of the change of ministry at Bordeaux ,  --  a city renowned for its loyalty , but which looked with no eye of favor upon this measure . Proceeding thence to Paris , I found the public mind inflamed everywhere with a kind of fury . The gravest and most judicious persons spoke of the conduct of the king in terms which are rarely used , excepting by the young and ardent in their feverish transports of passion . It was apparent to all , excepting the misguided monarch and his immediate counsellors , that the ground he had taken was not tenable , and that if he did not immediately withdraw from it , he would expose himself to be blown up by some tremendous explosion . How fortunate would it not have been for Charles the tenth , if some of his counsellors or friends in whom he reposed confidence had at this critical moment opened before him the book of the history of the Stuart kings of England , and pointed out to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those of his own family He would there have seen in the first Charles the prototype of the unfortunate Louis XVI . the victim alike of his virtues and his faults ,  --  in Cromwell another Napoleon , the admiration , terror and scourge of his country ,  --  in the exiled Stuart Princes , himself and his relations wandering from city to city , and eating the bitter bread of beggary successively in every corner of Europe ,  --  in the second Charles , an easy prudent Prince , like the author of the Charter , content to follow where the current of circumstances led , and too well pleased with the throne he had miraculously recovered , to risk it by any dangerous experiment on the public feeling . When he had traced the parallel to this point , could he have failed to see in the second James , attacking with a fool-hardy rashness the established institutions of the kingdom , himself and the mad project in which he was engaged ? And when he looked farther and beheld the royal bigot dethroned by a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile , and dragging out a wretched old age at St. Germain 's , amid the scoffs and sneers of the young French courtiers ,  --  would he have failed to anticipate the fate that awaited him if he persisted , and take warning ? Yes , Gentlemen , this book of instruction would have been , and was , opened to him in vain . M. de ChAteaubriand. whom I have repeatedly mentioned as the most eloquent French writer of the day , while these affairs were in progress , wrote and published , in the hope of exciting his attention , a most powerful and striking statement of this remarkable parallel , under the title of the History of the Four Stuarts . Every eye but the King 's could see the application from first to last ; he could see it himself , in every porticular , excepting that which forewarned him of his own destiny . Alas ! Gentlemen how many of us are there , that are willing , that are able , under any circumstances , to gather wisdom from the experience of others ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this eventful history . All the counsels of wisdom ,  --  all the lessons of experience ,  --  all the pregnant indications of public feeling were lost upon Charles the Tenth and his ministers . They had made their calculations and were resolved to stake every thing on the issue . But even for the purpose of attaining the end they had in view , their proceedings seem to have been arranged with very little judgement . It was impossible to govern under the forms of the Charter without the concurrence of the chambers ; it was also well known that the majority was decidedly against them , and that the measures , in which they were engaged , would render this majority still more powerful at any new election . It was then impossible that any , good could result from assembling the chambers , and the proper course would have been to revoke the charter , and appeal at once to the army , which was to be , at all events , the last and only dependence . Instead of this , however , the King , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The majority , as was expected , declared against him , and presented an address requesting the removal of the ministers . At this period , it was not too late for Charles the Tenth to retrace his steps . Had he complied with this request ,  --  he could have kept his throne . Instead of this , he dissolved the house of deputies , and ordered a new election . The result proved that the strength of the opposition party would be greater* in the next chamber // than it was in the last . There was still time for reconsideration , and it is really wonderful that this new and decisive demonstration of the public sentiment did not at last unseal the King 's eyes . But it seems to have been written in the book of fate , that the fortunes of the Bourbons should correspond in every point , from first to last , with those of the Stuarts . The opposition he met with , instead of enlightening him in regard to his policy , only provoked him to precipitate his course ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , by publishing the famous ordonnxsnces which dissolved the new house of deputies before it had even been assembled ,  --  abolished the freedom of the press , and deprived a great part of the voters of the right of suffrage which was given by the Charter . It was admitted by the ministers , in the report which accompanied these decrees , that they were all illegal , and the only excuse they could allege , was that of state necessity ,  --  the ready apology , which has regularly served as the pretence for every attempt at usurpation , in every age and country . It was plain , in fact , that the Charter was violated in its two most essential provisions ,  --  those which secured to the people the liberty of the press , and a representation in the government . If they acquiesced in this proceeding , the securities they had obtained for their personal rights were lost forever . Consider , Gentlemen , for a moment , what would be the effect in this country , if the President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the King of France had ) were to publish , of his own mere motion and authority , an act to disfranchise a great part of the voters throughout the country , and to prevent the publication of the newspapers . You will then have some idea of the effect produced by these ordinances upon the minds of the French people . It was necessary , however , to act as well as feel . The publication of these ordinances imposed upon the population of the the city of Paris a high and trying duty . The great Charter of the liberties of France was trampled underfoot ; and if the violation was not resisted , the dearest rights of the people were sacrificed forever . But who was to set the example of resistance ? France , Gentlemen , is not , like this cGuntry , a cluster of contiguous sovereignties , each of which is represented by its own capi'tal ,  --  acts to a certain extent on its own views of policy , and would make a separate stand against any attempt at usurpation on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing more than thirty million inhabitants ; and of this vast body , Paris , with its population of from seven to eight hundred thousand souls , is , for all political purposes , the virtual representative and head . The political movements of the city of Paris have always , for centuries past , regulated and governed those of the whole kingdom . If effectual resistance were made , the example must be set by the ca ita , and on the conduct of the citizens of Paris , at this conjuncture , depends d the success or failure of the cause of French liberty . There was even more than this at issue . The French Charter is ,  --  - as I remarked at the outset ,  --  not merely the formal security of the rights of the French people , but an act of compromise between the two great parties of the established governments , and the friends of liberty which pervade the whole European Commonwealth . After the late suppression of all the representative constitutions in the two Peninsulas , the people throughout Europe looked up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it depended on the conduct of the citizens of Paris at this crisis , whether this security should be retained or whether the last vestige of a liberal constitution of government should be swept from the continent . Such , Gentlemen , was the high and arduous duty which devolved , at this juncture , on the citizens of Paris , and it must be owned , that they have discharged it with signal fidelity . Their preparations for resistance were incomplete ,  - -  their enemies were numerous and well disciplined , but they entered on the struggle without flinching for a moment , and carried it on with heroic firmness at every hazard , and under the most painful sacrifices , until it was crowned with complete success . All the highest qualities that can adorn our nature , were exhibited on this occasion by the whole population of that great city , to an extent , * I am bold to say , unparalleled in the annals of the world ; - courage ,  --  constancy , heroic self-devotion ,  --  a genuine enthusiasm for justice and liberty ,  --  contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last and most difficult of all the virtues , self-government amid the flush and triumph of victory . What , Gentlemen , was the highest encomium which the most eloquent orator of antiquity could bestow upon the most accomplished and illustrious of her military chieftains ? That of moderation in success . " No power of genius ,  --  no pomp or flow of Ian*uage , ' - says Cicero , in his flattering address to C*sar in return for the pardon // granted to one of his dear friends- " no power of genius ,  --  no pomp or flow of language , can do justice to the greatness of your military achievements . I have often said , and shall ever repeat , that they far transcend those of any other General of this or any other age or country . You have conqnered innumerable nations of the most ferocious and warlike character ,  --  but in sparing and restoring to his fortunes and family a fallen enemy , you have this day achieved a more glorious conquest than any of these . It is much , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to govern the passions ,  --  to quell the rage of combat ,  --  to moderate the insolence of victory ,  --  to forgive , comfort , and even crown with gifts and honors a prostrate foe ; - these are actions that elevate a man above the sphere of vulgar greatness ; that raise him , as it were , to a sort of similitude with God himself . " Gentlemen , these sublime virtues , the display of which in a single instance , by one of the most accomplished characters of antiquity , was looked upon by Cicero as something almost miraculous , were exhibited on this occasion in thousands of instances by the whole body of the mechanics of Paris . During these three days of carnage and confusion , not only was there no abuse of power , for any unworthy purpose ,  --  no intemperance ,  --  no excess ,  --  no coldblooded massacre or plunder ,  --  but the people displayed a disinterestedness and a delicate sense of honor , which would not have discredited the age of chivalry . Whenever they found any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deposite . In numberless instances , individuals refused the gratuities that were offered them . The young heroes of the Polytechnic School , who contributed so much to the success of the struggle , declined the honorary badges which the gov*rnment proposed to confer upon them . They fought for principle ; and when the battle was over , they returned to their workshops , their parlors , or their studies , and left it to the deputies to settle the details of the Constitution . This , Gentlemen , was something really admirable ; and whatever may be the result of the present convulsions , as long as there is a friend of liberty or virtue alive in any corner of the world , he can never look back without the strongest sentiments of delight and wonder , upon the conduct observed upon this occasion by the truly heroic inhabitants of Paris . It is impossible , Gentlemen , to enter at present into a minute detail of the transactions of this memorable week , and they are so fresh in your minds that it would probably be unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obnoxious ordinances were published in the official paper on Monday the 26th of July ; but as this paper circulates but little among the body of the people , they were not generally known till the day after . The editors of the newspapers , who were prohibited from publishing them without a license , were the first to feel the effect of the measure , and they published on the same day a vigorous protest , in which they declared that they should not yield obedience to them , and exhorted the deputies and other citizens to follow their example . A similar protest was published the next day by the deputies then at Paris . In the mean time , most of the liberal papers appeared on the morning of the 27th , notwithstanding the prohibition , and the agents of the police were immediately despatched to seize their presses . The publishers refused to submit , and fastened their doors upon the police officers . This was the beginning of open resistance , or as Talleyrand said of the invasion of Spain by Napoleon , the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the printing offices , and sent for some locksmiths to give them assistance . These in general declined the service . At last , they found a single man who was willing to undertake it ,  --  and who was he , Gentlemen ? Ha was the workman habitually employed by the superintendants of the state prison to rivet the irons on the galley slaves . What a commentary on the nature of the work in which they were now engaged ! Monday and Tuesday were days of preparation . The streets were barricaded ,  --  the pavements torn up ,  --  the lamps broken ,  --  the citizens supplied with arms and ammunition , and every practicable arrangement made for a desperate resistance . Wednesday and Thursday were the great days of battle . The whole population of Paris was in arms , and acting in general under the command of the students of the Polytechnic School . It was a strange thing , Gentlemen , to see these young men leaving their books to take the direction of a movement , which was to decide the political character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some cases , in which the warm and bold impulses of youth are more natural and perhaps more useful guides of action than all the calculation and experience of riper age . In the mean time , the ministry had put their army into motion , .  --  but they seem to have acted with very little spirit . The troops of // the line generally refused to act on the offensive , and left the brunt of the battle to the Swiss and the armed agents of the Police . On Wednesday , the fighting was mostly in the neighborhood of the City Hall ,  --  which was taken and retaken several times by the adverse parties , but finally remained in possession of the people . On Thursday , the scene of action was transferred to the Palace , which was vigorously attacked by the people , and both the two principal divisions ,  --  denominat* ed respectively the Louvre and the Tuileries-were , after much loss on both sides , successively carried . This result seems to have been regarded as decisive ; and the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city was tranquil , and the tan-colored flag waved in triumph over all the public buildings . In the mean time , steps had been taken for effecting a new political organization of the city and kingdom . During the night of Wednesday , the municipal authorities were named , and the National Guard , which had been suppressed by the King three years before , invited to appear in arias , according to the old divisions . These arrangements took place on Thursday . On Friday , the deputies ) then at Paris , appointed General Lafayette Commander in Chief of the National Guard . He was thus brought back by the force of circumstances to the same station which he had occupied forty years before , on the first organization of that body at the opening of the Revolution . On the same day , the deputies formed a provisional Government for France , and placed at its head the Duke of Orleans , with the title of Lieutenant General of the kingdom . Finally , on Saturday the King abdicated , and his son the Duke of Angouh*me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by both of the rights of the Duke of Bordeaux , a child of ten years old , who was the next in succession in the same line . Such , Gentlemen , is the outline of the military and political transactions of this busy week . The deputies refused to acknowledge the rights of the Duke of Bordeaux , and completed their civil arrangements by declaring the Duke of Orleans King , and reforming , in some important parts , the constitutional charter ? which was now accepted and acknowledged as the irrevocable fundamental law of the kingdom . Charles the Tenth , finding that the claim of his grandson wa* not acknowledged , attempted at first to with d raw his abdication ; but the march of ten thousand troops from Paris towards the place of his retreat at Rambouillet7 again changed his purpose . After much hesitation and reluctance , he consented to an unconditional surrender ; and at length , with " many a longing , lingering look behind , " withdrew slowly and sadly from the abode and dominions of his royal ancestors . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he has finally taken up his residence for the second time at Holyrood House , in Edinburgh ,  --  the ancient palace of the Kings of Scotland , and the scene of some of the most tragical incidents in the early history of the unhappy Stuart family , to whose fortunes those of his own bear so striking a resemblance . Misfortune , Gentlemen , is sacred , and I should do injustice to your feelings and my own , if I added a word that should appear disrespectful to a fallen man , however directly his fall may be traced to his own errors . Let us rather turn our eyes from this mournful example of the frailty of our nature , and the instability of fortune , to contemplate for a moment the character of his successor , which seems to offer all the securities that are wanted of a firm , prudent and liberal administration of the government , as far as this may depend upon the wishes and conduct of the King . Louis Philip the First , unlike most of the hereditary sovereigns of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He was placed : very early in life under the care of the celebrated Madame de Genhis , and he is probably one of the best educated persons in Europe . The adherence of his father to the popular party at the commencement of the revolution naturally placed him on the same side , and he served with great distinction in the armies of the Republic for two or three years . At the celebrated battle of Jemappes , in 1792 , he and one of his brothers acted as aids to General Dumouriez . When the reign of terror came on , he was compelled to emigrate , and at this time he exhibited in a very striking manner the independence and manliness of his character , by resorting at once for his support to his own talents and resources , instead of depending , like most of his fellow-emigrants , upon charity . He offered himself under another name as a teacher of matl*ematics , in a small college at Coire , in Switzerland ; and having regularly passed examination and been received , attended to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great success . During this period , Gentlemen , though residinr in a very severe climate , he rose every morning at all seasons at four o'clock , and repaired to his post , without the intermission of a single day . At one of the subsequent changes in the political // TILe French Revolution . situation of France , the fortune of his family was in part restored , and he was enabled to retire from his respectable and arduous office . The moral lessons , which he received himself while he exercised it , were probably slot less valuable to him than were to them the scientific ones which he gave to his pupils . He now traveled extensively in foreign countries , and afterwards fixed his residence in the island of Sicily , where he had formed a matrimonial connexion with the royal family ; until finally , on the restoration of the Bourbons to the throne , he resumed his rank at the Court of France . But though re-instated in his fortune and social position , his known political opinions have always rendered him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the Princes of the blood royal were entitled by the Charter to seats in the House of Peers , they were all prohibited by a special decree from taking them ; for the purpose of excluding the Duke of Orleans , who ,  --  it was anticipated ,  --  would give his countenance to the liberal party . He has consequently passed his life unconnected in a great degree with public affairs ,  --  occupied in the exercise of a liberal and unceremonious hospitality , and in the manly studies in which he has ever taken pleasure . He has always been looked up to by the friends of liberty as the person under whom they should rally , if any not wholly unforeseen emergency should make it necessary to set aside the reigning family ; and we find accordingly , that on the occurrence of the late Revolution , they called upon him with remarkable promptitude and unanimity to occupy the throne . A representative republic would probably have suited better with the principles and feelings of the majority of the people , than a monarchy under any form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a system would place them at once in open collision with all the great powers of the continent , and they prudently acquiesced in the nearest approach to their favorite theory which circumstances would admit . Lafayette himself  --  a decided republican in principle ,  --  felt no scruple about recommending this course . This excellent Prince , ' sald he to his friends on some public occasion , as he stood with them by the side of the Duke of Orleans , this excellent and liberal Prince is , for us , the best of Republics . ' The mention of the name of our illustrious and beloved fellow-citizen reminds me , Gentlemen , that I ought not to close without adverting particularly to his character , and to the influence which he has exercised at this momentous crisis . No one cause has , perhaps , contributed so much to the moderation which has been so signally displayed by the people , as the confidence they felt in the purity and patriotism of this venerable friend of liberty . No political character of this busy and active period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the singular success of Lafayette serves ,  --  like that of Washington , to which I adverted in my preceding lecture ,  --  to reconcile us with the world , and to brighten our views of the future progress of society . At a time when a loose and temporizing course of conduct had become almost universal among political men , and seemed to be in some degree excused by the difficulties of every kind by which they were surrounded , Lafayette has pursued , from first to last , a perfectly consistent career ; and now , in reward for his honesty , we find him at the age of more than three-score and ten , by far the most powerful and eminent citizen of his country ,  --  virtuahly placed , in fact , by general acclamation , at the head of the Government . Contemplate for a moment the successive epochs of his long and active life . Behold him figuring in the pride of rank , youth and fortune , in the splendid circles of the Court of Versailles . Suddenly the flag of independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless appeared to him , half-civilized region . Will this unattractive and almost desperate enterprize seduce a young and gallant French Marquis from the palaces of Princes and the blandishments of beauty ? One would think not ; but he flies without hesitation to the ends of the earth to encounter danger and perhaps disgrace , by the side of Washington . Success crowns his efforts , and we next behold him figuring again at the same brilliant court in the pride of well-earned glory . The body of the people in his own country are endeavoring to obtain a redress of grievances ; but of what consequence is this to a young nobleman of the first rank ? Will be risk his name , his fortune , the reputation he has already won , in such a struggle ? One would think not ,  --  but again we find him quitting his elevated social sphere , and appearing among the first and foremost of the champions of the people . He has been true to his principles through good report ; will he stand the trial of adversity ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafayette in the fervor of inexperienced youth will perhaps give way to them . Not he ; - the youngest and most ardent of the friends of liberty is also the most prudent . He // wishes to be free , but he knows how to be just . Again he sacrifices rank and fortune , quits his country , and endures the horrors of an Austrian dungeon rather than disgrace , by any act of inhumanity , the cause to which his life is devoted . A young conqueror opens the door of his dungeon , and proposes to him and all the other prominent friends of the people to place them on the pinnacle of earthly greatness if they will but fall down and worship him . Most of them accept the proposal ; - perhaps the weakness of human nature , combined in his case , with the nobler motive of gratitude , might induce Lafayette to join the number . Oh no ! The friend and pupil of Washington can never be the tenant of the anti-chambers of Napoleon . Lafayette almost alone rejects the offer ; reads the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then retires to the country ,  --  like another Abdiel ,  --  to pass twenty years of the most active part of his life in repose , seclusion and poverty , rather than compromise his principles . This , Gentlemen , was a hard trial , but our noble fellow-citizen endured it to the end . At length the usurper falls , and the standard of freedom is once more erected in France ; but Lafayette is now old ; he has survived the illusions of early life ; he has long ago awakened from the young dream of improvement and liberty ; he is doubtless far too wise to sacrifice the ease and comfort of his old age in the idle pursuit of these unsubstantial phantoms . Gentlemen , the earliest and most ardent of the friends of liberty is not only the most prudent and consistent , but also the most persevering . At the age of sixty , he quits his retreat , and repairs to the post of honor , and danger , with the same promptitude as he had done at one and twenty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last labors crowned with the same success that attended the first . We have been told , Gentlemen , that Lafayette wants talent ,  --  that he is not a first rate man . Gentlemen , is not effect the test of talent ? Can a man be hailed with acclamation as the most deserving citizen and virtual chief of the most enlightened and civilized nation in Christendom without talent ? Can a man pass through the twenty-four States of our Republic , and be welcomed every where on his passage as a sort of incarnation of the Divinity , without talent ? If we mean by talent the cunning of a Talleyrand , Lafayette has never shown it , because his principles would not permit him to employ such means . But the high inspirations of a noble heart are the sources of every thing truly great in thought , speech or action ; and impartial posterity , which will judge the character of Lafayette by the test of this principle , will pronounce him one of the greatest men of the age . But , Gentlemen , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What will be the end of all these movements ? Will the government now established in France be permanent ? Will the people settle down quietly under the p resent constitution and the present King , or will they move round a second time through the same vicious circle of anarchy , despotism , conquest by foreigners and domestic tyranny , which they travelled before ? Gentlemen , the issues of events are in the counsels of Providence . He must be a bolder man than I am , who will pretend to conjecture even , what may be the final consequences of the late change of Government . In the present state of things , there are very few symptoms of permanent tranquillity . Almost every arrival from Europe brings us intelligence of some new revolution ; - changes of Ministry in France and in England ; - the bombardment of Antwerp and the flight of the Prince of Orange ; - Belgium revolting agalnst the King of the Netherlands ; - Poland essaying to shake off the yoke of the Colossus of the north ;  --  the Russian armies in full march toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful note of preparation of other armies , making ready to meet them . Under all these circumstances , we may look upon another general war as exceedingly probable . Should this in fact happen , how will it terminate ? Will the armies of the people succeed in breaking up the alliance of the military monarchs of the East of Europe , or will the latter carry back the war into the enemy 's country , and occupy for the third and last time ,  --  for they would never relinquish it again ,  --  the capital of France ? Here too , Gentlemen , we must be content to rest in uncertainty . Who can undertake to calculate the respective forces of the moral enthusiasm on the one side , and the military masses on the other , that would enter the field in such a contest ? It has been our fortune to live in the age of revolutions . Our own emancipation from the government of the mother country was the first of the series . The late events of the memorable week at Paris , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be the last . However this may be ,  --  whatever may at last be the fruits of the present busy and eventful epoch , we can not but applaud the heroic self-devotion and s*.ib1ime 26 // moderation displayed on this occasion by the citizens of Paris , because we know that these qualities are good ; we can not but condemn the attempt at usurpation by the King , because we know That such attempts are bad . In selecting these events as the subject of my lectures , I have proceeded on the supposition that the mechanics of Boston were not less patriotic and generous than those of Paris , and that they would be willing to hear of what their brethren abroad have done . Your kind attention , Gentlemen , for which I beg you to accept my grateful acknowledgements , has sufficiently shown me that I have not been *s*ken.
