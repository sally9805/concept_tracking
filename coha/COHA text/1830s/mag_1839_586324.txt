txt The November Number of our Review contained our opinions on this subject at considerable length , in connexion with two remarkable disclosures of the ultimate designs of the Philadelphia papermoney speculators , viz , the unlucky letter of Mr. Biddle , of the 5th of April last , and Mr. Carey 's adroit attempt at defending its principles , under the title of " The Credit System of France , Great Britain and the United States . " Our readers we hope will not regard our recurrence to this topic as unwelcome , since nothing can be so vitally essential to the public welfare , as the equal and substantial value of the measure by which all contracts are settled , and every description of property estimated , amidst the infinite variety of interchange which necessarily occurs in all civilized communities . The attempts which have been recently made , to create a necessity similar to that of the deplorable state of affairs under which the public finances were formerly compelled to be surrendered to the practical control of private and irresponsible individuals , have not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthlessly destroyed the property and prospects of thousands of industrious and worthy citizens . But neither the gigantic speculations excited in 1835 and 1836 , nor their issue , the total banishment of sound currency from circulation in 1837 , have effected the object designed . To secure its eventual accomplishment , an entire change in the tactics of the warfare which has been unremittingly waged against the political rights of the people and the security of their permanent interests , appears to have lately taken place . The vigilance and firmness of the responsible public officers elected by the people to execute the laws having baffled the deeply laid measures concerted by the paper-money speculators , they have now undertaken to subvert the principles of justice and equal rights among tie people themselves . The exhibition of their self-sufficientim // portance , and contempt for the people  --  the promulgation of opin ions that the people are their own worst enemies , and in the man agement of important affairs are unworthy of regard and confidencehaving failed , we now find these unwearied schemers professing a degree of subservience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposes the rights of property to universal overthrow . We now see the devisers and supporters of the monopoly scheme of paper *irrency , to be alone by law re ceivable into the public treasury , boldly asserting the unqualifled right of the whole people to manufacture paper currency which shall be received in all payments . We now witness the projectors and advocates of a tariff policy which levied heavy burdens upon those whom the fluctuations of a monopoly paper currency could not directly reach , by imposing an enormous tax upon articles of prime necessity entering into the consumption of every individual in the community , becoming all at once the great champions of free trade , and denouncing all shackles upon productive industry , and especially that most important and substantial protection afforded by a sound and equal measure of value . In short the mischievous anarchical doctrines by which the whole property of the country is now proposed to be brought into jeopardy with a design to produce the necessity for the reconstruction of the great monopoly paper-coining machine , which shall exercise irresponsible control over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far greater want of respect for the discernment and good sense of the community at large , than the denunciations of the " swinish multitude " at a former period . The most elaborate and insidious appeal to the insurgent passions of unreflecting men that we have happened to meet with , appeared at the commencement of the present year , in a work recently established by the Whig party near the federal seat of government , in professed rivalry and opposition to the Democratic Review ,  --  in the guise of a reply to our former Article , from the pen of Mr. Carey . During the prostrated condition of practical morality in England through the operation of the South-Sea scheme and the other gambling speculations of that era of bubbles , Mandeville published his famous treatise to prove that private vices were public benetits . The book being written with talent and ingenuity excited great alarm among the sober and religious portions of the community. - After the usual fashion of former days , instead of shewing the fa&gt; lacy of its doctrines , those who considered them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundatjons of society . This brought the work into general notice , and gave the author an opportunity of publishing his vindication , in whica he undertook to show that the tendency of his doctrines was beneficial to society , since the excesses of men must inevitably // lead to those precautions for the general security which constitute the necessity for government , and are the main foundations of its strength and power . The principles of this new performance of Mr. Carey might possibly have been supported by a similar exer*ise of ingenuity so far as respects the encouragement and justification it affords to the extravagance , immorality and vice incident *o gambling ,  --  but they proce ? d to an immeasurably greater length than any doctrines before pul5*shed . While Mandeville only contended that the vices of individuals would in the long run be counterbalanced by the accession of strength to the body politic , the main object of the reply is to break down this strength . The destruction of all the safeguards by which the sober , industrious and honest portions of the community are protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now for the first time deliberately advocated . The checks which are intended to save the innocent from becoming involved in the destruction which sooner or later overtakes the guilty , are denounced as hostile to human freedom . The whole community are in effect to be punished for the fraudulent cupidity of a few gamblers and speculators . The doctrines contained in this reply greatly exceed , therefore , in their results , any which have been hitherto seriously addressed to the understandings of a peaceful , law-abiding and religious people in any age of the world . Were not these results carefully concealed from the observation of light and superficial readers , by a plausible perversion of language , wherever they would be likely to shock the moral sense by their transparency , we should leave this reply to lind its proper estimation among the Whig party , to which it seems to be particularly addressed , without any remarks on our part . Bet the mode now adopted , as we have already suggested for subverting the rights of the people by attempting to poison the fountain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should endeavour to expose such designs and prevent their influence . The corruption of the moral sense of the people-the purity and correctness of which are the main foundation upon which the success of our great experiment of self-government essentially depends-is too alarming an enterprize to be witnessed with unconcern , by any well-wisher to human happiness . Our readers will doubtless bear in recollection that the design of our former Article was to shew that " the credit system " of this country , by confounding two things radically and diametrically opposed to each other in their influences upon industry and enterprize-mere credit and actual capital-had impaired the security of property , and had deeply affected that mutual confidence and good faith among men which is so essential to social prosperity . We traced the present credit system of this country to its corrupt origin in the intrigues of Morris and Hamilton for bringing into operation an // irresponsible controlling power wholly independent of the people . after their plans for that purpose were defeated in the Convention which formed the Constitution of the United States . We explained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of the United States for the overthrow of the standard of value which it was one of the main objects of the Constitution to secure : and we endeavoured to illustrate the operation of the credit system of this country , *d its consequences upon our productive interests , by the condition into which the people of England and France had been plunged by the adoption of a similar system . The most reasonable feature in this reply , regarding it according to its professed import , is that not a single word can be found in it , from beginning to end , upon the principal and most important subject of our Article  --  the origin and operations of the credit system heretofore existing in the United States . We state this explicitly and distinctly in order that the friends of this system may first examine our Article and the performance which purports to be a reply , before they shall decide that Mr. Carey has refuted the facts and arguments contained in the Democratic Revie*v . The reply takes up entirely new grounds  --  the right of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all payments . It commences with a flourish upon the progress of the age , and the increasing power of the people , and immediately falls into the track of our illustrations of the injurious consequences of paper currency sanctioned by Government , which we had brought to bear upon the operations of the two Banks of the United States . In effect , the credit system of the United States as managed by the banks is abandoned to its fate as totally indefensible , and a new crotchet is brought forward to supersede them . Now , bad as we believe the management of many of the banks to have been , we think them to be far less injurious to the common welfare than Mr. Carey 's substitute as explained by himself . None can be more deeply anxious to promote the progress of human jmprovement than ourselves . It is precisely because we wish that the great advancement which is daily developing itself may not become a retrograde movement tenfold more rapid in its pace , which shall overwhelm at once all hopes of political and social amelioration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vital question of paper currency . Upon this rock many a gallant ship of state has already been wrecked . More poverty , misery and oppression have been created in the world by mistakes upon this question than by any other scheme of mis-government . As the most dangerous of Mr. Carey 's doctrines , because the most likely to impose upon inexperienced minds . are artfully enveloped in terms used in a sense wholly different from their ordinary signi. * fication , we regard it as an indispensable preliminary to explain , // that several expressions of the most frequent recurrence in the reply , do not convey to our minds the ideas which he assumes to be their import . It would indeed seem from many recent instances that the literati of the Philadelphia paper-money school are equally bent upon the destruction of nil confidence in language as well as in currency . We do not regard the circulating medium of a great producing and commerqial people , as a proper subject for the indulgence of an arbitrary andlrivolous play upon words , and as it is obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehended between the writer and reader , we propose to state explicitly what we do not understand by several of these phrases . 1 . By the term freedom as applieA to individuals , we do not understand an absolute exemption from every restraint upon the unbridled passions and fraudulent cupidity of mankind . By freedom of commerce , we do not mean a scheme of legalized plunder under the pretence of the protection of industry , vainly adopted to prevent the operation of the great laws of trade upon a false and deceptive measure of value . We think the experience of the last two years has sufficiently established , that free trade , in the proper sense of the term , can not exist either between the several States of the Union , or between this and foreign countries , except by a rigid adherence to the sound and equal measure of value established for that very purpose by the Constitution of the United States . 2 . We do not understand the word capital to mean mere facilities and contrivances for borrowing the fruits of labor . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proprietor of the accumulated proceeds of labor without being indebted to the producers for the amount . Those individuals without actual property , who lavish large sums in ostentatious and luxurious display , for the purpose of obtaining the credit of being men of wealth , are not capitalists in our acceptation of the term-even should several combine , with or without a charter procured from the legislative power , under whatever pretences or management , and club their mutual obligations together as the basis of paper currency to he imposed upon a credulous community as a substitute for the only sound and equal measure of value . Capital is not created by law , but by labor . Paper currency may enable individuals by law to obtain the proceeds of labor without expense or exertion , but we do not regard the privilege of manufacturing it to constitute a capitalist-although its actual cost to the industrious and producing interests is fully equal to that of metallic currency , besides the hazard of its perishing in their hands like the manna of the Israelites , should it be kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereby producing improvidence and consequent distress *3 By the term security , as applied to currency , we do not understand // the immediate and exclusive profit and advantage of any single class of individuals whether merchants or bankers . 4 . When the institutions of the people are mentioned , we do not understand private corporations established for individual profit drawn from the industry of the community . These two classes of institutions are entirely distinct in their objects , and are generally totally opposed in their results . The foregoing explanations , tt*ether with a distinction we shall immediately notice which forms the staple of the reply , substantially cover the whole ground assumed by Mr. Carey for the support of his new doctrines . He admits , nay he strongly and in express terms corroborates , our views of the consequences of the credit system in all other countries . But notwithstanding it was the object of his previous publication to prove the necessity of the interposition of the Government , for the purpose of giving confidence to the paper currency issued by the banks , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly depreciated , he now endeavours , with more dexterity than consistency , to make it appear that the disastrous consequences which have resulted every where in Europe from the use of paper currency , have not been owing to the people but to the governments . The great states of Europe where these melancholy results have been experienced on the largest scale are all monarchical in their forms . He accordingly insists in effect that excessive issues of paper currency can only impoverish the people under monarchies , where " the government is all in all . " In a republic he contends that the universal issue of paper currency by the people can not fail to produce the most perfect degree of security and steadiness . The fluctuations and insecurity which have been so frequently visited upon this country are wholly to be attributed to attempts on the part of our Government to imitate the example of the arbitrary sovereigns of Europe ! All the distress and embarassments into which our commercial and industrial interests have been from time to time involved have been exclusively owing to the interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase our stock of illustrations of the deplorable consequences of the credit system upon the people of the several European nations , has entirely overlooked the more immediate and striking instances afforded by the annals of our own country . Like many of our modern philanthropists , he is eagleeyed in detecting misery and oppression in distant regions , but ap* pears to be wholly blind and insensible to the every-day privations around him . A volume would not suffice for the description of the ruinous revulsions produced by the credit system of this country since 1791 . The immediate effect of paper currency is to expel specie from circulation . Whoever possesses the power of making payments in a currency which costs nothing will never pay in a val // uable and expensive medium . Wherever paper currency is permitted to become the exclusive medium of commercial interchange , the whole community is placed in the power of those who make it . By arbitrary expansions and contractions they are empowered to ruin the commerce and industry of the country at their pleasure Let us cast a hasty glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years . The most terrible revulsion this country ever suffered was turing 1819 , 1820 and 1821 , when the contraction of the operations of the Bank of the United States produced a change of ownership in the greater part of the property engaged in commercial pursuits throughout the Middle , Southern and Western States . What interference of the Government produced this series of disasters which ruined so many thousands * In 1825 another crisis occurred , in the course of which the Bank of the United States was saved from immediate destruction only by the promptitude , address and good fortune of its President , according to his own account published to the world shortly afterwards . Numerous commercial houses of the highest credit and most extended transactions were prostrated by the suddenness and severity of this shock . Was it caused by the interference of the Government ? Mr. Adams , the friend and correspondent of Mr. Biddle , was then President of the United States , and the attempt to make him responsible for this revulsion would hardly be successful . In 1828 many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a great number of failures occurred in our commercial cities . Mr. Adams was still President  --  but a strong probability existed that a ferocious military chieftain would be chosen by the people to succeed him . Perhaps , therefore , this awful revulsion should be attributed to the Executive magistrate about to be elected . We now come to the administration of that extraordinary man whose name and public services seem to inspire calumny *rmd detraction among the satellites of the credit system in the same ratio as his character and abilities have elevated the character of our country in every part of the world . Ia several passages of pie reply Mr. Carey has gratified his exquisite taste and his love of veracity , by the repetition of the stale morsels of slander from the newspaper letter writers of the panic era . As the venerable individual whom they were originally intended to asperse , has retired from public life , we can not envy the state of feeling which led to this elegant selection . The charter of the Bank of the United States would expire by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should he be re-elected . Gen. Jackson had been engaged in too many of the most important events of our history as a nation , not to have been fully aware of the destructive influence of such a Bank upon its highest interests , from the days of Morris and Hamilton . Measures were concerted to compel the people to re // charter the Bank in despite of thc Executive veto . An enormous but gradual increase of its accommodations was every where made , in order that as many individuals as possible might be brought into dependence . After these preparations had been completed , Congress was petitioned in 1832 , four years in advance of the expiration of the charter , and on the eve of the Presidential election , to re-charter the Bank . The bill for that purpose was carried through both Houses under the persons superintendence of Mr. Biddle , but received the veto of the President ,  --  upon which every expedient which influence , intimidation or bribery could bring into operation was used to defeat the re-election of the President . The expansions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course be attributed to Executive interference , since , had the President evinced the same docility with many others , these fluctualions which caused so much individual suffering would not have been necessary . They proved insufficient . Gen. Jackson was reelected by a greatly increased vote . He subsequently directed , for reasons which he believed to be sufficient , that the public deposits , then amounting to a comparatively small sum , should be removed from the Bank , in pursuance of an express power contained in the charter . For the purpose of compelling Congress to direct their restoration , another contraction so severe was produced by the Bank as to throw most of the other banks and the individuals dependent on them into deep consternation and embarassment . Was not this distress , then , clearly produced by the tyranny of the Government ? Ought the Bank of the United States to be regarded in any othex light than as the unwilling instrument used by the President to harass and ruin the merchants and speculators ? But unfortunately these measures wholly failed . The Bank then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twenty millions of dollars , and encouraged the other banks to a corresponding expansion . By producing a general rise of prices , from the abundance of paper currency in circulation , a multitude of preposterous speculations were inflated in every section of the Union , as well as a vast influx of importations induced from abroad . The immense amount of public lands purchased on speculation , and the duties accruing upon importations , brought into the banks in which the public money was deposited , according to the practice introduced into our political systcm by Hamilton , a great surplus revenue , which Congress , contrary to the advice of the President , directed to be divided among the States . This division compelled the banks to curtail their operations . Thousands upon thousands of individuals , whose expectations of profit were founded upon the increase of the previous expansion , and consequent accelerated rise of prices , found themselves at once , not only deprived of their anticipated fortunes , but of the property they bad before posscsse ( i , in complying // with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who can doubt but they were ruined by the Executive , when it is remembered that this division of the deposits in banks among the States was the favorite measure of the supporters of the Bank of the United States , and , like the present project of Mr. Carey , was to procuce universal steadiness and security ? Besides , to protect the banks , and throu*jh them their debtors from the common destruction in which the ra* of gambling threatened to involve them , the President had endeavoured to prevent them from hazarding the public money , by ordering a strict compliance with the law which requires payment for public lands to be made in cash instead of bank credits as had been the practice under the government of the Bank of the United States . Was not this a fiagitious interference by the Executive ? Is it not justly called by the highest authority " tampering with the currency ? " Who can doubt but the previous expansion was produced by the benevolent managers of the Bank of the United States , wholly from a patriotic desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifested in endeavouring to enforce the long established laws of the land ! But unhappily , while the banks of this country were carrying on this prodigious expansion of paper currency and producing universal wealth and prosperity , the Bank of England was contracting its issues . To such a degree of scarcity was currency brought in the English market that the prices of our principal staples were suddenly reduced to less than one half of their former rates . The previous enormous importations under this state of things soon produced a large balance against this country which was required to be paid , not in paper currency , but in gold and silver  --  the only currency recognized in commercial transactions between nations . This produced a run for specie upon the banks of New York . They were compelled to suspend payments , and were immediately followed by most of the banks throughout the country . The credit system was at once plunged into the greatest jeopardy . Had it not been for the ingenious expedient of issuing the defunct notes of the former Bank which nobody could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have forfeited its new charter from the State of Pennsylvania ! We have carefully examined Mr. Carey 's publications for the purpose of finding evidence that this contraction of the Bank of England , which produced such disastrous consequences , was caused by the interference of our Executive with the Government of England . Unfortunately he has omitted to specify that important fact . He has assigned the importation of the foreign indemnities in gold , as the occasion of this visitation upon our banks , but unluckily the indernuitics were not brought from England , and the bulk of those received from France and Naples were not remitted // until after the adoption of its restrictive measures by the Bank of England . Notwithstanding this slight discrepancy between cause and effect , how many of Mr. Carey 's readers will doubt but the suspension of specie payments was designedly brought about by the Executive for the purpose of establishing " one currency for the Government and another for the people , " by means of " Sub-Treasu .. ries , Receivers General , and Gpvernment paper ? " Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious chasm in the additional illustrations given in the reply , of the disastrous consequences of the interference of Government with paper currency , we leave to our readers to judge whether the ruinous fluctuations which within the last twenty years have swept away the fortunes and prospects of so many hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens , have not been wholly owing to the imitation by our Government of the practices of the arbitrary monarchs of Europe . The distinction on which the new scheme of Mr. Carey wholly rests-that excessive issues of paper currency are only destructive under a monarchical form of government , while steadiness and security are only disturbed in a republic by the interference of the Executive-is worthy of the doctrines it is brought to support . There is undoubtedly a wide difference in the practical operation of a government which employs its authority and power in defraud* ing and oppressing its subjects , and the theory of self-governmen4 which prevails in this country . But there can be no essential dif ference between them as to4he proper medium of commercial interchange . The necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards , while its debasement and corruption paralyze the energy of every pursuit , must be the same under any system of government which is entitled to the name It is quite as ridiculous to allege that a similar paper currency is beneficial under a popular form of government , and destructive under a monarchy , as it would be to contend that the same kind of diet will be salutary to the physical system in one and poisonous in the other . Mr. Carey not only admits , but produces several examplea in addition to those we had adduced , to show , that paper currency issued and received as money under the sanction of a monarchical government , whether through the medium of banks or otherwise , is a palpable cheat , and has invariably led to the impoverishment of the many for the aggrandizement of the few . But he furnishes no explanation of the mode by which these evils resulting from its uses , are to be avoided under a form of government like ours . In expatiating in vague and general terms upon the steadiness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue and receipt of paper currency by " the whole people , " in a country where they are the controlling power , he has entirely // overlooked the great principle of sovereignty which places them in the same position with regard to our institutions as the most absolute monarch within his dominions . Neither the continental paper issued by thir country during the Revolutionary struggle , nor the Assignats of France received any increased worth from being issued by the authority of the people and for their benefit . Like every experiment made upon currency without intrinsic and universal value , from the foundation of tht world-whether issued by kings or by people-by banks or by individuals-whether received for public taxes or not-whenever the amount of the continental paper or assignats was expanded beyond the aggregate of the quantity of gold and silver currency which the necessities of the people would have required for commercial interchange , had there been no paper in circulation , they inevitably depreciated . Such is the universal effect of the operation of the great laws of trade . For this reason t has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and consequently prone to excess , from becoming an instrument of fraud upon the industrious and producing classes. - Paper currency is no doubt convenient to a certain extent to the mercantile classes , but any use of paper currency is wholly a question between convenience on the one hand , and safety to the highest interests of the community on the other . This important question has been conclusively settled by Mr. Carey in his reply to our Article . By empowering " the whole people " to manufacture paper currency which shall be received in all payments , its quality as a measure of value must be destroyed . This quality alone enables commercial men to employ it as a substitute for actual money . To enable every individual in the community to establish a measure of value for himself is therefore precisely the great improvement which according to Shakspeare , Jack Cade promised to his misguided followers . " There shall be no more money , " was the rallying cry put into the mouth of Cade by the great painter of human motives , as calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disorganizers . We do not wish , however , to be understood as receiving the account of the poet as authority as to the facts of the attempted reform of the villeinage of the feudal system which was set on foot by popular desperation in England , France and the Netherlands at aboat the same period . But for the purpose of illustrating the most efficient springs of human action , we may , with the Duke of Marlborough , cite Shakspeare as the best writer of English history . Had the felicitous invention of paper currency as the means of overthrowing the established institutions of society , been introduced into England in his day , the incentives for the destruction of property put into the mouth of Cade would ( loubtIess have been similar to those used by Mr. Carey for the increase of production and the diffusion of universal plenty without labor . // The process by which Mr. Carey seems to have arrived at this final consummation of practical agrarianism , furnishes the American people a most important lesson , which we hope will be hereafter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disordered condition of the currency and the exchanges during the last two years . In his famous letter of the 5th of April last , Mr. Biddle expressed his firm determination to remain behind his cotton bags , and to prevent*ll the banks in the country from resuming specie payments , " until the enemy should be driven from the country " - meaning in plain language that he would continue to inAlict distress upon the people and involve their productive interests in the manifold embarassments occasioned by the want of a sound currency , until our citizens should be compelled to elect rulers who were ready to recharter his bank as the means of relief , and invest it with the absolute control of the public finances . As this avowal , for the character of which we find some difficulty in selecting a suitable epithet , created no little consternation among some of the firmest but honest supporters of the Bank , the publication of Mr. Carey which occasioned our former Article appeared , vindicating the course of the banks for refusing to fulfil their solemn obligations by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical formulas , that confidence alone , and not specie , was the true basis of paper currency . This " confidence " he asserted to be essential to enable the banks to resume their pro* per functions towards the community . But the main element of this " confidence " he maintained to be the countenance and support of the Government towards the banks . Until the present Administration should be expelled from power , and a new one elected by the people who would adopt the paper currency of the banks as the universal measure of value , he not only earnestly contended , but demonstrated in his peculiar manner , that the depreciation of bank paper must be cJntinued , and the activity and prosperity of the . country remain paralyzed . It was this torrent of wholesale deception which we undertook to turn into its proper channel in our former article . Not finding it precisely convenient to encounter the positions taken in that Article , derived from*the universal experience of the employment of bank currency by the great governments of Europe , Mr. Carey in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of argument marked out by us , and affects tocoincide entirely with our views of the destructive influence of paper currency under monarchical governments . Though the whole drift and design of his former publication was to shew the necessity of the interposition of our Government to sustain the currency of the banks by receiving it , however depreciated , in all public payments , he now discovers that it is the arbitrary interference of // the government alone which has produced such disastrous results from the use of paper currency in Europe ! Where the people are themselves the sovereign power , as in this country , he finds that unrestrained issues of irredeemable paper are universally beneficial ! Now it strikes us that there is an obvious clue to this new discovery made by Mr. Carey . A kind of management wholly different in its form and object is essential to produce unlimited issues of paper money under the tivo*lescriptions of government . An absolute king has only to authorize the issue of paper , and it is at once effected , whatever may be the interests or opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual governing power , as in this country , it becomes indispensable first to convince them that their interests will be promoted by exposing them to this hazard . Would our patriotic fathers have tolerated the paper currency which brought upon them so many privations , had they not believed that its issue was imperiously required by their paramount interests ! Assignats were issued by the French people under a similar view of the necessities of the emergency . In both instances the ultimate effects of this fraudulent system were overlooked under the pressure which existed for the immediate provision of currency to furnish the means of defence against their enemies. - Had not the evils of the system been inherent , the principle upon which the Assignats were issued afforded the strongest guarantee against dcpreciation . The national domain of France , possessing immense value , was pledged for their redemption , and was thrown * into market for that purpose , Assignats being received in payment . In this respect they closely resembled the currency lately issued under the provisions of the Free Banking Law of New York. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deposite of stocks and mortgages . But* whenever a period of difficulty and distrust shall arise , in consequence of the inflation of paper currency , either with or without such security , a demand for specie will take place for exportation . A panic must soon prevail . During the destruction of confidence of which we have witnessed so many instances from the same cause , it will probably be found impossible to sell the stocks and mortgages pledged for the redemption of these issues . Their discredit will then become inevitable . But even this security , insufficient as we fear it will prove , wholly conflicts with Mr. Carey 's views of the advantages to be derived from paper currency . To avoid all possible imputation of overstating his present notions , we will give his language on this point . He now says : " The steadiness and security of the currency are in the direct ratio in which the people are free to exercise the trade of Banking and the right of furnishing currency-that the unsteadiness and insecurity which have existed have been the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy therefor was to be found in the abolition of restrictions . " // February , The Credit System . And after giving a distorted view of the legislation of some of the States-too preposterous to impose on any citizens of this country - he adds : " New York has now gone further and has passed a general law under which all may associate for banking purposes , and for the supply of currency without application to the Legislature , so that the people of that State have now obtained almost entire freedom in regard to the trade in money . We say almost because even in that law there are regulations that will tend to prevent the action under it from being as advantageous as it otherwise *uld be . " Now we profess to be totally opposed to rnonopGlies in every shape and form . We are strongly in favor of free trade in banking , and every other pursuit calculated to afford real facilities to the legitimate pursuits of industry and commerce . But every person of reflection who either possesses property or hopes to possess any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the measure of value can not be safely trifled with by currency doctors either with or without charters . If , in the present state of things , paper is to be issued and received in payment , its practical redemption ought to be secured by the most efficient checks . Under the operation of such checks the industrious and unprotected classes might safely receive paper currency  --  but without them , they should refuse every thing as currency but gold and silver . Where paper currency is practically intended to be redeemed in specie , its issue would afford a comparatively small degree of profit , to that derived from a state of continual fluctuations . The most important and useful banks in Europe have always been those which pay out no currency for general circulation but gold and silver . Even d in England , oppressed as her productive interests now are by the incubus of the paper system which has grown out of the operations of the Bank of England , a large proportion of the Joint Stock Banks which within the last twelve years have arisen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stipulated to issue no currency but that of the Bank of England , for which they pay the rate of interest ordinarily charged upon its loans . They have wisely preferred a dimunition of their profits to encountering the hazards incident to the redemption of paper currency during those periodical revulsions which the prevalence of the system inflicts upon every country where it has been permitted to take root . But the " right of issuing paper currency " without effectually securing its prompt redemption in gold and silver , which is evide'itly Mr. Carey 's notion of Free Banking , is merely another name for free swindling . The design of his former publication was shewn in our former Article to be , to reconcile the citizens of this country to measures which might promote the scheme which has been long cher . ished , and at some periods has nearly succeeded-of banishing the use of gold and silver as currency from among the people of the United States ; and not the slightest symptom of a *denial of this intention can be discovered in the reply . // 1839 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public with any exposition of the mode in which he proposes to secure the convertibility of paper currency , the perfection of which , according to his former publication rests on confidence , and not on the assurance of its redemption in specie , we may presume , upon the avowal contained in Mr. BiddIe 's letter , that the design of the Philadelphia school , of pushing paper currency into exclusive use among the people , still exists , for the double purpose of def*auding all our productive interests by its de.preciation , and of ex*cising political control by means of the embarrassments into which it enables them to involve the people . We have no great faith in Mr. Biddle 's formal abdiction of political power . Though the late scenes at Harrisburg were concerted before his declaration was published , the attempt at consummating that stupenduous outrage was made afterwards . Whenever the proper degree of expansion of paper currency has been reached , a necessity will be created for the charter of the United States Bank by Congress quite as urgent as that which existe last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole people , " which is eulogized by Mr. Carey with so much enthusiasm , seems to be simply the resurrection of the skin-plasters which during so long a period expelled all sound currency from general circulation . After the experience enjoyed by the public within the last two years , we are induced to believe that those who did not participate in the profits of that admirable contrivance-which it seems , in Philadelphia at least , was ready for operation in advance of the suspension of the banks-are pretty well satisfied that even the Gold Humbug , the subject of so many refined witticisms , is on the whole " the better currency . " It may be urged that the evils growing out of this kind of paper currency will invariably cure themselves by their very excessthat the public will not permit itself to be cheated , and its highest interests trodden under foot beyond a certain point-that every body may be permitted to issue paper currency , since no body is obliged to receive it in payment . All this is unquestionably true . But this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every body now possesses the full power of issuing paper currency , but the great trouble is , nobody is obliged to receive it . A further step is , therefore , required to accomplish Mr. Carey 's views . It is so trifling and easy , that its refusal may well occasion all the clamor which has been excited against the interference of the Government with paper currency . It is only to receive all paper currency , by whomsoever issued , in payment for public lands , public taxes , and public dues of every description . Any government which woul ( l refuse so small an accommodation ought , indeed , to be denounced as hostile to the banks , to the merchants , and to the people ! // February The Credit System Now we assent to free banking and to the right of the people to issue paper currency , but contend that it shall be left free to mdi viduals to receive or reject it at their option . The receipt of such currency in public payments , places the whole community under the absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national legislators shall be prepared , by whatever appliances , or under the influence of whatever motives , to authorize the receipt and custody of paper currency which is not clearly and beyond all douht equivalent to gold *nd sil*r , for paying the expenses of our public establishments , the great work of destroying the measure and value is accomplished . The universal imposition of depreciated currency then is achieved . Public creditors are compelled to accept it or get nothing-for no suits can be brought ag.ainst the State or General Governments to compel the payment of their debts in the only medium recognized by the Constitution . When this degree of " steadiness and security " shall have been reachedto produce which , throughout the country , such incalculable distress , deprivation and loss have been inflicted within the last two years upon all our productive interests-who will venture to refuse paper of any or no value whatever in discharge of claims ? rj7l*e peculiar insidious art of the publication on which we have thought it worth while to devote so much of our space , consists in this-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free trade in banking , when organized on sound and proper principles , and attempts to pervert them to the support of the mischievous and rotten paper currency with which our country has heretofore been cursed . Mr. Carey would found his paper system on the basis of confidence alone , and is utterly hostile to the precious metals . The transparent object of his publication is to aid the great paper-money interests of the country in the desperate struggle they have so long been waging , to overthrow the Administration , and to counteract its policy of disconnecting itself from the papermoney system , and of introducing into its midst the regulating check of a moderate but steady ( lemand for and circulation of specie through its fiscal action ,  --  for the purpose of compelling the manufacturers of paper " currency , " whether corporate or individual , to keep down their emissions in reality and bona-fide truth , to that equivalency to specie which they profess , as their highest merit when in their most perfect state . We have at present about the worst paper-rnon*y system in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the common partisan slang of the " hostility of the Administration to credit and commerce , " would apply the abstract arguments which would be applicable to one of perfect freedom , and would denounce the " interference of government , " even to protect itself from its acknowledged evils . Our views of free trade in banking would lead eventually to the circulation of a large proportion of the pre // cious metals , as the only staple and uniform measure of value , and would keep all the paper currency in circulation down to the standard of real " equivalency " and " convertibility . " We would have the Federal Government conduct all its fiscal operations in that medium . Mr. Carey on the other hand would banish specie ; considers a universal circulation of paper-money the best possible state of things ; and while he perpetually invokes the name of freedom , yet by compelling the government and aU. public authorities to deposite the public revenues in banks , and is conduct all their transactions in paper , and by denouncing any attempt to promote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the A*pha* and Omega of his doctrines of currency , would maintain a system of exclusive paper currency practically , and to all intents and pur* poses , compulsory upon all classes of the community . It can require no gift of prophecy to foresee the consequences which must result from abolishing the most essential safeguard of property , by the operation of the demoralizing influence of an exclusive paper currency upon the people . An insatiate thirst for gain , at the expense of the common welfare , would soon pervad* our halls of legislation . Have not its indications already too often manifested themselves ? Did we not witness , even on the floor of Congress , during the last session , a deliberate and concerted attempt to deprive the public service of the means of support in order to compel the public officers to accept the depreciated notes of the Bank of the United States , in payment for its bonds to the v United States ? While we are writing this , we notice the introduc tion of a resolution into the Legislature of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring the right of its citizens to pay for public lands in the paper currency issued by that State , and asserting that the currency so received ought not to carried out of the State for expenditure , since in that case the public creditors might require its redemption in specie , or its equivalent . Whenever the people of the United States shall have generally adopted such notions of their rights and obligations , a unisrersal competition can not fail to arise between the several States for increasing their respective issues , with the view of depre ciating their own paper currency at the expense of the others . Jealousies and disorders of a more formidable character than any we have recently seen can not fail to spring up , and every day will increase their aggravation . The period will not then be far distant when those who have enjoyed the plunder which a general state of pecuniary embarrassment has enabled them to extort from the pro ductive classes , will probably evince the same predilection as that described in our former article , for the organizatio9 of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion as the only effec tual remedy for the very evils which its projectors have endeavoured // by such an infinite variety of expedients to bring upon the country . The vigilance , patriotism , and courage of those noble spirits by whose counsels and exertions our independence was achieved , pre* vented this result when the nation was before brought to the verge of anarchy by the abuse of paper currency . A specimen of the policy which will doubtless be adopted by the friends of the paper money system , was recently displayed in Pennsylvania , in an attempt , which was concerted *under the influence of the Bank of the United States , for seizing upon the government of that State by fraud , sustained by military force . Happily this force was not composed of mercenaries , and the citizen soldiers of that State could not be made subservient to this suicidal project . And yet the contrivers and upholders of an experiment in legislation similar in principle with those performed by Cromwell and Bonaparte , are hypocritically declaiming against the evils of a strong govern ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that legalized fraud leads to violence , is furnished by the origin and result of the French Revolution . Dr. Bowring , in his reports upon the public finances of France , made to the British Parliament under a special commission , officially states , upon the highest authorities , that it was the disordered condition of the finances which overthrew the monar* chy . This condition was undoubtedly brought about by the use and consequent abuse of paper currency , first introduced by John Law . The Republic , in its turn , was destroyed , mainly by the issue of Assignats in the name of the people , and the anarchy which -d this currency of the people produced subsequently enabled Bona. parte to establish his stupendous despotism . have speculators like Mr. Carey , and those who adopt their opinions without reflection , ever asked themselves , what is the office for the performance of which government is established and maintained ? The habit of denouncing Government for enforcing those laws which have interposed obstacles to the success of their schemes , seems to have wholly blinded them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are evidence of feelings , they appear to be ready to involve society into its original elements . The public interests are made the subject of jest and amusement . Not only is the enforcement of laws essential to the existence of organized society resisted ; but where violations of public duties of the most flagrant character have been exposed , impunity is attempted to be given to such offences in future , by preventing the adoption of efficient remedies . These individuals seem to have wholly forgotten that government is mainly established for the protection of the just rights of property against the invasions of fraud or force . Among a peaceable and commercial people , this protection is most essentially and practi // cally exercised by a rigid adherence to an equal and impartial measure of value-which in our country was so wisely established by the Constitution of the United Sti*tes . Excepting such unfortunate persons , either with or without souls , as may have incurred a greater amount of debt than they possess means of payment , measured by the existing standard of value , every class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps we ought to add another exception-those who have purchased property for the purpose of sale at an advanced price , who may hope to increase their nominal gains by the depreciation of the measure of value . But should the security and permanent prosperity of the whole community be sacrificed for the exclusive benefit of these two classes ? If an individual , in whatever condition of distress , know-* ingly offers false coin for the purchase of the necessaries of lifeor a dealer lessens his weights or measures of capacity , for the purpose of increasing his profits-such individuals are denounced as guilty of frauds upon society , and are justly punished by its penal laws . But those who depreciate the measure ordinarily employed in the transactions of property , between man an ( l man , by making it more plentiful , and consequently less valuable , than the constitutional standard , were that exclusively in use , are not merely tolerated , but held out as benefactors of society . Instead of being punished by law , as happens to those who commit trifling invasions upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V the purpose of enabling them to perpetrate fraud , not merely with impunity , but with secrecy , and upon a scale so magnificent as to invade all the pursuits of life . Mr. Carey insists , that " the people will not use bank notes unless they are satisfied that the gain on the one hand is equal to the loss on the other . " Where has he lived for the last two years ? Does he suppose that within that period every person who received bank notes in payment instead of gold and silver , has been induced to do it from absolute preference for the former ? Has not specie been expelled from circulation as cur* rency , and become the subject of purchase and sale , at a large pre mium , by the combined action of those whose interest it was to keep paper currency at a depreciation ? Besides , on this principle , why punish an individual for uttering counterfeit money -- its accep tance being wholly voluntary ? No one is compelled to receive it in payment , unless the gain on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Nor is any body compelled to purchase by short weights and measures . A grocer who buys a hogshead of sugar as a thou sand pounds , might sell it for fifteen hundred pounds , by simply diminishing his weights . Why should he not be permitted to do so as well as the speculator , who purchases a thousand lots of land at two hundred dollars a lot , who combines with others for the purpose of increasing the issue of paper currency , by which he is // enabled to sell them at three hundred dollars a lot ? There is no moral difference between the two operations , excepting that the latter , by affecting the transactions of the whole of society , is incalculably more injurious to its highest interests . Yet the individual who reduces the intrinsic weight of the measure by which he retails his sugar , is brought to condign punishment as a cheat , while the person who reduces the actual v*.lue of the dollar , by increasing the paper currency in circulation or 40 millions in six months , is complimented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such strange confusion have notions of right and wrong become involved in the minds of many intelligent persons , that while they denounce an act as fraudulent in an individual , if the same act is perpetrated by a powerful corporation it becomes praiseworthy in the highest degree ! Mr. Carey says , " the many desire to see the powers of the government diminished , arid trade released from the shackles which have heretofore been imposed . " We will not inquire as to the fact alleged , since it wholly turns upon the signification of the word many . The shackles to which he refers are those imposed by a settled measure of value . As he professes to speak in the name of the Whig party , which comprises many honest and well-meaning individuals , we would take the liberty of suggesting for the consideration of that portion of the party , whether , before adopting the measures advocated by Mr. Carey , for the total overthrow of the standard of value , upon the prospect of which he so warmly congratulates them , whether it might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed by a uniformity of weights and measures . The consequences of this release would be trifling , compared with the effect upon all property , by allowing every individual to fix the measure and value for himself . By way of trial it might be best to ascertain the effect of abolishing the small protection afforded to the industrious and unprotected classes by the standard measures for commodities of subsistence , before undertaking to subvert the main foundations of property among civilized communities . We have thus far regarded Mr. Carey 's expressions , repeated throughout his performance ; as to the steadiness , security , and advantages to be derived from paper currency , issued by " the whole people , " to have been intended , in good faith , to convey the meaning indicated by the ordinary acceptation of the terms . But from his constantly referring to the currency of New England , and of the Bank of the United States , as instances of such paper currency . it seems most likely that the phrase " the whole people , " is used but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency of banks , and possibly the currency alone of the Bank of the United States , agreeably to the suggestion contained in Mr. // Biddle 's Princeton Address , quoted in our former Article . We are not aware that this restriction upon tire signification of the term people *viIl affect the inferences which prove the disastrous consequences of issues of paper not converted , nor truly convertible , into specie . All experience shows that some more efficient means of enforcing this r*demption. which shall prevent undue expansions of paper currency , which injures the usefulness of sound banks , . by encouraging profligate specrnations , is essential to the general protection . " The advantage of combined action , " set forth by Mr. Carey , as the most powerful and salutary element in all operations of paper currency , happens , according to the recent experience of this country , not to be the advantage of the industrious and unprotected classes , but the emolurnent of those who combine to involve the productive interests in embarassment , for the purpose of preying upon the fruits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to by the laboring classes , would be called by the harsher name of conspiracy , must inevitably make such a system of free banking , as is plausibly pretended would produce universal steadiness and security , a tremendous engine of swind ling . Those banks , upon which such repeated eulogiums are bestowed , throughout both the original publication and the reply , were mostly established , not for the purpose of loaning actual capital , but for the purpose of borrowing it by the issue of paper currency . Those who have associated for this purpose were rarely men of accumulated capital , with the use of which they were willing , for a moderate remuneration , in the shape of interest , to accommodate commercial enterprize and manufacturing industry . On the other hand , they were generally such as wished to draw a revenue from the capital and industry of others , by the skilful management of credit . During periods of general confidence and prosperity , the temptation of exchanging inordinate amounts of their paper currency , bearing no interest-which is subsequently received at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producers and holders of capital-br the obligations of their customers , on which interest is paid , and by this means producing fictitious capital , has always proved almost irresistible . Combined action is extensively resorted to for the purpose of fostering arid sustaining this hollow and fraudulent system , by the operation of which interest is extorted from the industry and enterprise of the community , without the employment of capital . The abundance of this kind of currency , in time , causes it to return for redemption . The customers of these banks are either ruined by suddenly enforcing the payment of obligations , in order to furnish the means to redeem their issues , or they prove unable to pay the holders of their currency , and the loss falls upon the productive classes , among whom it circulates It is this system of building credit upon // credit , that has produced so many destructive revulsions within a few years past , which have been invariably attributed to the measures of the Government , by those who have enjoyed its profits , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of gambling , have endeavoured to sustain its reputation among those who have been the sufferers by its operations , both by systematic attacJ*s and indirect sneers upon the government of the people . So*many barefaced attempts to embarass its oI ) erations have been brought into play by the combined action , which Mr. Carey applauds with so much zeal , as to have , apparently extinguished , in many quarters , every such antiquated sentiments as patriotism and love of country . Having now laid before our readers at considerable length our ideas of the consequences of the doctrines advocated by Mr. Carey , those who took the trouble to examine our former Article may expect us to furnish his view of it . This we do in his own words , for we scorn to imitate the unfairness of which his reply is a continued instance from beginning to end-of perverting the language of a performance which we undertake to criticise . He says : " We were at first disposed to attribute all the erroneous views offered by this " writer to the consideration of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more " disposed to attribute it to the absence of any acquaintance with the principles of " trade or Banking . He has collected a large quantity of true etad false fads , and " has put them together , apparently without much regard to the effhct they were cal " eulated to produce , whether for or against his friends7 and the consequence is that his article is much more likely to estabiish a conviction of the danger of increas " ing the power of the government over the currency , than of the propriety of yield " ing to it what has been so pertinaciously insisted upon . " Now we frankly concede to Mr. Carey superior information in " the principles of trade and banking . " Our instruction not having been received in the Philadelphia paper-money school , we must acknowledge our ignorance of its higher mysteries , excepting those which have been disclosed in the productions of Messrs . Biddle and Carey . Whether we have not endeavoured to atone for our deficiencies by the study of their writings , with a desire to understand their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . As to our collection of true and false facts-our want of knowledge of this deep and important distinction must be attributed to want of instruction as to the mode by which the Philadelphia schooL distinguish a true fact from a false fact . It may be trivial or important , but a fact is neither more nor less than a fact with us .. A great favor would be conferred on the uninitiated , if the professors of that brilliant school would explain , when they assert facts , when false facts are intended . This would doubtless have saved much of the time employed upon this Article . Whenever doctrines however wild , extravagant , or destructive t*c* the best interests of society , are to be supported , no difficulty scent // to occur , under the practice of this school , in finding facts in abundance for their justification . It would afford many readers great satisfaction with regard to the personal integrity and charactcr for veracity of its professors , if they would be pleased to furnish the public with an indication of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wilful deception . In the reply before us , we could easily point out a multitude of false facts , but our limits will not allow us to elucidate tfl'em in the manner required to show the style of manufacture . We take a single instance which we have selected from a mass of the same kind with which Mr. Carey usually embellishes his productions , not on account of its importa.nce , but from the insight to be derived from it with regard to the elaborate process by which a false fact is got up , and the plausible and imposing manner in which it is maintained . In our remarks upon the credit system of England we undertook to show that its enormous political corruption had led to the general in*fpoverishment of the people . While the few had been enriched and aggrandized , we stated that the many , that is , the laboring classes , " are now reduced to a condition far more deplorable than the serfs of Poland and Russia , since the general diffusion of knowledge only serves to render the former sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them by the credit system , and to convince them that nothing short of revoludon can extricate them , by breaking at once these artificial restraints V upon their means of comfort . " This statement Mr. Carey does not venture to deny , since it is amply established by Mr. Marshall , an authority of so much reputation on these subjects , that all reference to his works is most discreetly avoided by Mr. Carey . He , however , mutilates the forgoing extract in his usual mode , and adds the following , by way of proving its inaccuracy : " We have before us a report from the commissioners on the revisal of the poorlaws , in which we find answers from 856 parishes to the question , what might be earned by a laborer , his wife , and five children , aged 14 , 11 , 8 , and 5 years P 856 parishes give for the man an average of - ? 27 17s. lOd. 688 do . do . wife and children - 13 19 10 ? 41 17 8 being equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family . This sum does not yield him the same comforts that could be obtained with a similar amount in this country , because food is much dearer ; but on the other hand clothing and house-rent much cheaper . A careful examination of the condition ot ' the laborers of England and of the United States would satisfy the reader that the difference in the reward of their services does not exceed 15 per cent. , yet it suits the purposes of the reviewer to inform us of their degraded condition ! " Now , this interesting fact , showing that there is but 15 per cent . difference in the actual means of comfort and independence between the laboring classes in England and those of this country , has been ostensibly extracted , parish by parish , from the voluminous reports // of the Poor Law Commissioners . So accurately and fairly has this been performed , that the results are given to a single penny . But what is the true fact ? Why that there are ten thousand parishesand among them a number greater than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the estates of great proprietors include a whole parish . A wealthy individual , who employs the whole laboring population of a parish , frequently gratifies his vanity , or his beneficence , by gr*t liberality to his immediate dependants . Other parishes comprehend or are in the neighbourhood of large and flourishing towns . The rate of remuneration , paid in such parishes is the falsest criterion that could be devised , as to the rate of wages paid in the 9,200 or 9,400 which are entirely unnoticed . the truth as to 600 or 800 parishes becomes palpable falsehood , when taken as evidence of the condition of the whole . We decline to follow Mr. Carey 's example , in undertaking the labor of showing , from the returns of the parishes , which he has so carefully omitted , the true average wages of the laboring classes . Generally it does not exceed from six to eight shillings a week , taking the families of agricultural laborers , who are by far the most numerous . As to their dcg*raded condition , we feel reluctant at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest character , from the same reports , which the suggestion that their condition is very nearly as elevated as that of the bulk of our own citizens , induces us to bring forward , not only to rebut his statemerit on that point , but to enable our readers to perceive , what is apparent to every one who reads his performance , the low estimate he has formed both of the understandings and morals of the American people . We take the following , verbatim , from the report of John W. Cowell , Esq. , a gentleman who has been for two years past in this country , as Agent for the Bank of England , and who is favorably known here for his intelligence , integrity , and ability . He says " It may almost be affirmed that the virtue of female chastity does not exist among the lower orders of England , except to a certain extent among domestic female servants , who know that they hold their situations by that tenure , and are more pru. dent in consequence . Among the residue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A daughter grows up-she learns what her mother was-she sees what her sisters and neighbours are-finds that nobody thinks the worse of them , and that nothing is expected of herself , and that there is a short road to marriage or a maintenance . " Did this appalling picture of the moral condition of the bulk of the English nation , meet the eye of Mr. Carey , in his investigation into the Poor Law Reports , and did it convey to his mind no idea of degradation ? If such be the condition of the purer sex , to what degree of demoralization must not the other sex have reached ! Such are the inevitable results of that terrible system which is always fatal to all the elevating sentiments of the heart , and which // has destroyed public spirit , as well as private morality , in all communities where it has gained the ascendency . Those American citizens who estimate purity of conduct . and the decencies of social life , at their proper value , must judge whether they are willing to place their posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded or not . But for the corrupt facilities arising from the introduction of the gaper system , explained in our former article , the public debt of G*eat Britain , which has brought her laboring classes into this situation , could never have reached onetenth of its present amount . Those States of the Union which are heedlessly incurring enormous masses of debt , for the gratification of the cupidity of speculators , to support which the whole community will hereafter be compelled to bear immense burdens of taxation , to be paid to its present holders , at home or abroad , will do well to meditate upon the present condition of England . Notwithstanding the large army employed to keep its laboring population in subjection to the laws , disturbances of the public peace , and destruction of property by wanton burnings , are affairs of frequent occurrence , upon an extensive and organized scale . The established order of society is in constant jeopardy , from the wild and ungovernable passions of the people , driven to despe.r*tion by the contemplation of their own necessities , contrasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits of their labors Before the credit system is allowed to fix itself deeper upon the vitals of our political bodies , let its advocates well consider the consequences of their rash cupidity . The apprehensions with these consequences must excite in every enlightened mind , are by no means alleviated by the systematic prostitution of the language of economical science , to the designs of a few gamblers and speculators , for the purpose of facilitating the execution of their unwearied intrigues against the perrnanent welfare of the community . No well-informed person can read Mr. Carey 's publications , without constantly discovering statements which create alternate astonishment and dismay . Indeed he appears to be not altogether free from these emotions himself when he happens to find any of his opinions out of his own writings . His reply contains the most extraordinary specimen of complaint on the part of any author that was ever heard of - whkn strikingly illustrates the complacency with which a mass of absurdities may be regarded by minds of a certain texture , while the individual instances which form this mass are each too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted a passage from his publication , precisely as it was there found , even to the words in italics . Its glaring absurdity was so tranparent , that we expressly stated that we should leave its meaning to be guessed by our readers-it was the remarkable passage where Mr. Carey // emhpatically affirms , that prices would rise by the diminution of currency . Now he complains-not that we have misquoted him-not that we have suppressed a syllable necessary to the understanding of his statement , for we actually gave the whole passage-*not that we have made comments calculated to mislead the reader as to its true interpretation  --  but " that the reviewer desires to have his readers believe that it is asserted that pripes always rise in proportion to the scarcity of currency . " Haviii* fairly left our readers to guess for themselves , we must be permitted to say that we conceive ourselves to be treated with great harshness , in thus having our secret desires unceremoniously dragged forth to the gaze of the world ! This strange assault upon the signification of a fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in character wi*th his other complaints of our quotations . There are some half a doren , and in every instance an explanation quite as conclusive might be made , did our time and space permit us to follow up such small game . We particularly regret that we are unable to ehrcidate the details given by Mr. Carey , as to the condition of France , for the purpose of invalidating the force of our statements , which he has not undertaken to contradict . A counterpart of the explanation of the degraded condition of England might he easily made on that subject . The preposterous libel upon the honesty and integrity of the whole manufacturing and mercantile men in France , is now charged by Mr. Carey upon M. Chevalier , who adduces in its s-npport , according to the reply , " the captain of the French discovery*-ship Favorite . " What a remarkable discovery-ship ! The system of the New England Banks is again the subject of unmeasured approbation in the reply , but no allusion is made to the explanation of the process by which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption , which was given at length in our former Article . To this process these banks have entirely owed , during the last fifteen years , their usefulness , and the confidence of the community . This important suppression was the foundation of a mass of false facts , and equally false inferences , in Mr. Carey 's former publication , as we abundantly demonstrated from the authority of the reports made to the Legislature of Massachusetts last winter . The repetition of these facts and inferences in Mr. Carey 's formal reply , without the slightest regard to the conclusive refutation furnished in the Article to which the reply is directed , indicates a persevering determination at deception , which appears extraordinary in any individual , of whatever standing in society , who undertakes to give information to the public upon questions deeply affecting its highest interests . As we have never been initiated into this marvellous distinction made between true and false facts , we take the earliest opportunity to correct an oversight which occurred in our former Article , and // which escaped notice until after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commencement of our remarks upon the failures of the banks of New England , on 226th page of the volume , a qualification , extending the period to which we referred in describing the extent and consequences of these failures , to the period of thirty years , instead of the twenty-five carefully adopted by Mr. Carey . The omission of the line containing this qualification affected the prec**e accuracy of our statement-since these five additional years i*ere intended to include the tremendous crash which occurred among the banks in every section of New England in 1808 , 1809 , and 1810 , as well as the explosions which happened in 1837 and 1838 . The disasters of the former period resulting from the false confidence and the over-banking irhich had previously existed , brought a torrent of abuse upon the government at that time , quite equal to any thing to be found in either of Mr. Carey 's publications . The banks in New England were almost wholly under the control of Federal politicians . The disturbed condition of our relations with the belligerent powers of Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our neutrality , enabled these politicians , by their control over the paper currency , and consequently over the subsistence and industry of the people , to excite great public discontent . So alarming were the distress and dissatisfaction which they succeeded in fomenting throughout New England , that John Quincy Adams , then a leader of the Federal party , and a member of the Senate of the United States from Massachusetts , thought proper to inform Pres*-dent Jefferson , that the Federal party had entered into a treasonable arrangement with the British Authorities in Canada , for the separation of the States , and the creation of a Northern confederacy . About the same time Judge Story succeeded in so effectually alarming the Democratic members of Congress , by his confident statements that civil war would inevitably break out in New England , unless the restrictive policy adopted by the government for the security of our commerce was rescinded , that this great and salutary measure was abandoned at the point of time when it has since become well known that the British government had felt themselves compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accede to our just demands . Had the embargo been persevered in a few months longer , no individual acquainted with the real state of affairs at that period , can fail to believe but the subsequent recourse to war for the vindication of our national sovereignty , would have been wholly obviated . It was at this period of depression and distress that Mr. Webster published that famous pamphlet inciting the people of the Eastern States to resist the laws by violence , of which he was compelled to avow himself to be the author , when under cross-examination upon the trial of his prosecution against Gen. Lyman for a libel , because the latter had stated , in one of the // Boston newspapers in 1828 , that Mr. Webster had co-operated with the individuals stigmatized as traitors by Mr. Adams , in his extraordinary publication on the eve of the Presidential election of that year  --  and which prosecution so signally failed . The most efficient agency in producing this deplorable state of public feeling throughout New England , was wielded by the banks They had been established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Great Britain , and had by degress been enabled to engross the control of all the curre4y in circulation . Their manngel 's as fully understood the principle of " combined action " as Mr. Carey , for the purpose of obtaining power , and at the same time increasing their individual profits , through the infliction of privations upon the industrious and producing classes , and throwing the odium of the measures pursued by them upon Government . Considerations of common justice-of national honor  --  and of permanent security for our foreign and domestic commerce-were equally disregarded in their measures , as in those more recently pursued . To such a pitch was this policy finally carried , that the confidence of the banks in each other was finally destroyed . A degree of embarrassment was produced , which greatly exceeded that of the revulsion inflicted by the operations of the Bank of the United States , upon the Middle , Southern and Western States , in 1819 , 1820 and 18 ' 21 . A single instance , out of many which might be mentioned , will fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all security for its redemptionwhich occurred , too in the State of Rhode Island , whose policy in regard to banking , is so extravagantly lauded by Mr. Carey , as a near approach to his beau ideal of currency . The Farmer 's Exchange Bank , of Gloucester , failed early in 1809 , with nearly seven hundred thousand dollars of its notes in circulation . On examination by a legislative committee , the whole amount of available assets to meet this enormous sum was found to be eighty-six dollars and some odd cents . Its currency to the amount of eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars had been exchanged for valuable property , by the individual who had obtained the control of the bank , but who was ostensibly neither president nor director . This vast issue had been made upon his obligations to the bank , which on their face left the period of payment to his option , and in fact afforded no indemnity whatever to . the public . During the three or four years preceding the war , the actual loss to the industrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of banks , reached several millions of dollars . To promote the political dissatisfaction which we have explained , the banks in the large towns had previously curtailed their issues , after having monopolized the principal amount of metallic currency  --  and had left the channels of circulation , throughout that section of the country , to be filled up // t'ith such currency as was afforded by the Farmer 's Exchange Bank , the Berkshire Bank , the Ilillsborough Bank , the Hallowell and Augusta Bank , and numerous other swindling institutions in each State . The banks in the large towns universally refused to receive this currency , and the principal merchants invariably declined it , because it could not be deposited with them . rrhe losses accordingly fell almost entirely upon the industrious and unprotected portions of the community . By the rigid system of cus ' *ilment previously adopted by the banks which survived , they were easily enabled to maintain specie payments , when the banks in every other part of the Union suspended in 1814 . The over-sight which has led to this explanation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged by Mr. Carey , as to the control exercised by " widows and orphans** over the banks of New England . It would be easy to shew that the seductions of this system , of which he so often boasts , are grossly exaggerated in his publication But after occupying so much space for the purpose of restoring our original statement to its integrity , and showing its bearing upon the banking system of New England , so much lauded in almost every.page of the reply , we must return to Mr. Carey 's suggestion that we haveCollected a large quantity of true and false facts , and has put them to0ether apparently without much retard to the effect they were calculated to produce , whether for or against his friends , and the consequence is much more likely to establish a conviction o.f the dancer of increasing the power of the government over the currency , than of the propriety of yielding to it what has been so pertinaciously insisted upon . " In another part of the reply he says : " The Democratic Review is an advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency , and of a diminution of the power of the people . ' And again : " It has been so uniformly the practice of governments to retain the control of the currency , that even of those who are friendly to the credit- etem , a large proportion can not conceive of steadiness in the absence thereof . In favor of regulation there are , therefore , the advocates of Executive power , like our Democratic Reviewer , and all those who are accustomed to think because it has existed , that its continuance must be necessary . " We have placed these passages from different parts of the reply together , and but for the trouble of copying them might have collected a dozen others of similar tenor , for the purpose of requesting our readers to examine them , and ask themselves what was the object and import of the several speeches upon the currency , delivered by Messrs . Clay , Webster , Southard , Davis , Crittenden , Merrick , Bayard , Robbins , &amp;c. in the Senate , during the special session and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually to the tempest of eloquence which issued from the House of Representatives , which was apparently as full of wind on this subject as the cave of Eolus of old . Did not every one of these distinguished // persons insist that the General Government not only possessed the power of interfering with the paper currency , but that it was its imperative duty to do so for the relief of the people ? We strangely misunderstood Mr. Webster 's celebrated speech which was stereotyped by the hundred-thousand , and sent into every part of the Union , at the expense of the Bank of the United States , if its whole drift was not to demonstrate this power and duty on the part of the Ceneral Government . We well remember that Mr. Clay assailed the President in unmeast*ed terms , during the special sessisn , for expressly disclaiming all power and jurisdiction in the General Government over the subject . In the message at the commencement of the session , it was strongly affirmed that the domestic interchanges among the people should be managed by themselves , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President explained his views of the Constitution at length , and with great clearness and effect . Up to the close of the *ast session , the Opposition orators in both Houses of Congress were importunately clamorous for the interference of the government with the currency , as the sole means of relief for the people , from the embarassments occasioned by the suspension . Now after the firmness of the Executive has compelled the banks to resume their duties to the community , and the confidence which their profligate management had destroyed has so far returned as to produce a general revival of commerce throughout thecountry-there comes a juggler from the Philadelphia school , professing to be the organ of the Whigs , and with a single stroke of his magical wand , totally reverses the relative position of the parties during the last two years ! Whether the distinguished leaders of the Opposition in Congress to whom we have referred , are ready to adopt the doctrines of the President , as stated in his message at the special session , has not yet appeared . The Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony involved them , seems rather too quick in its movement , and the " turn about ' rather too rapid to be consistent with senatorial dignity . As to ourselves , we deny now what we denied in our former Article , the existence of the right in the General Government to interfere with any currency whatever , excepting gold and silver , the power over which is expressly granted in the Constitution . And it is a specimen of the fairness of Mr. Carey 's reasoning on this subject , that while the very phrase which , by common consent , used to embody the general policy of the present Administration , in relation to the public finances , carries with it the idea of the total dis*. connection of the union heretofore existing between the Government and the banking system , he undertakes to designate the advocates of the " Divorce of Bank and State , " as the friends of a strong governmental influence and control over the business of banking , and the trade in money.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
