txt America is a vast continent comprising one of the grand divisions of the globe ; it contains an extent of territory nearly equal to half of the other three continental divisions , constituting about three-tenths of the dry land on the surface of the earth ; it is washed on both sides by vast oceans , on the east by the Atlantic , and on the west by the Pacific . It ranges from north to south through 125 degrees of latitude , and in its widest part 113 degrees of longitude , being in length about 9000 miles , and in average breadth about 2000 ; the extent of surface has been variously estimated at from 17,303,000 to 14,622,000 square miles , but in every estimate allowance must be made for the uncertainty of the northern limits , and our still imperfect acquaintance with some of the coasts . America comprehends the whole of the tropical and temperate climates , with part of the arctic on both sides of the equator . The whole of the continent north of latitude may be considered as a frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercury freezes in winter , and ice and snow accumulate on the land and water and covers a great part of the country throughout the year . The winter begins in August and continues for nine months . In summer the heat is as great as in New England ; it continues however for too short a period to bring grain to maturity , and cultivation is very little practised . Vegetation is too scanty to supply the inhabitants with any considerable part of their food , they therefore live chiefly on seals and other productions of the sea . Between and north the climate of North America is still severe . In winter the celd is intense , and the snow , which begins to fall in November , remains till May . The summer advances with such rapidity that the season of spring is hardly known . In June the fields and forests are covered with luxuriant verdure ; grain is abundant and in some portions is cultivated with success . The temperate portions of North America may be considered as extending from to north latitude . These regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a variety of fruits are produced in great abundance . From north to the latitude of 40 degrees south the climate is hot , and the products constitute some of the most valuable articles of commerce , being chiefly tobacco , cotton , rice , indigo , coffee , sugar , and the various tropical fruits . Beyond latitude south the climate again becomes cold , and at Tierra del Fuego it is severe ; at the South Shetland Islands , in latitude and south , the climate is that of Greenland and Spitsbergen ; islands of ice are tossing through the seas , and the land is peopled only by those animal forms peculiar to the Antarctic Circle . Nature in this continent assumes an aspect of peculiar magnificence , for whether we consider its mountains , its rivers , its lakes , its forests , or its plains , America appears to be distinguished in all those leading features by a grandeur not to be found in the other parts of the globe . This continent contains a great variety of wild animals , and since its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are now found in great abundance . The birds are exceedingly numerous , and are said to be more beautiful in their plumage than those of the old continent , but in their notes less melodious. in /z/ The vegetable kingdom is in the highest degree rich and varied , many of the trees are amongst the most ornamental and useful , the fruits are rich and in great profusion , the plants and flowering shrubs exceedingly diversified and beautiful , and almost all the various species of grain necessary to sustain life are cultivated and afford abundant crops . In mineral treasures America surpasses all the other quarters of the globe . South America and Mexico abound particularly in the precious metals , and such ample supplies have been carried to European markets that their value has been greatly diminished since the discovery of the American mines ; all the more common metals , minerals , and precious stones , are found in great profusion , and many of them furnish the materials for extensive and important manufactures . The inhabitants of this continent have been estimated by various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably about 44 millions ; of this number about 18 millions are supposed to be whites , 10 millions of the aboriginal race , 8 millions of negroes , and 8 millions of the mixed race , as mulattoes , zaroboes , &c.; The whites are chiefly English in the north , and Spaniards in the south , with some French , Portuguese , German , Dutch , Danes , Swedes , &c.; The negroes are Africans , whom the cupidity of the European races has dragged into slavery , or descendants of the earlier victims of a barbarous traffic . The aboriginal population consists of two distinct races , the Esquimaux , inhabiting the maritime districts of the Arctic regions , and the copper-coloured Indians , who are spread over all the rest of the continent ; their origin has been a subject of much investigation , but the total absence of historical records among the Indians themselves , renders it difficult to arrive at any satisfactory result . It has been discovered that there are remarkable resemblances between some of the languages of Asia and those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the Asiatic continent , but at what period they emigrated it is impossible to determine . It is evident that they are a distinct people , being essentially different in several respects from any of the existing races on the eastern continent . The natives in some parts , particularly Mexico and Peru , were considerably advanced in civilization . Those inhabiting Mexico were denominated Aztecs ; their government was a sort of feudal monarchy , in which the nobles and priests monopolized the power , the mass of the people being mere serfs attached to the soil . The Aztecs had neither tame animals , money , nor artificial roads ; but they were acquainted with the arts of weaving cloth , hewing stone , carving in wood , and of modelling in soft substances . Their method of picture writing , though rude , compared with the alphabets of the nations of the old world , was superior to any thing else found in the new , and enabled them to transmit intelligence and to record events with sufficient distinctness . Their calendar was more accurate than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of scientific skill that has created suspicions of a foreign origin . The government of the Peruvians , or Quichuas , was a theocracy of the most despotic character ; the sacred Incas , descendants of the sun , were at once temporal and spiritual sovereigns , and the people , or children of the earth , were kept in a state of complete servitude , living according to minute regulations which reduced them to mere machines , labouring in common , and holding no property . The Quichuas employed the lama as a beast of burden ; constructed roads of great extent and solidity ; built suspension-bridges of a most ingenious kind ; formed chisels of a hard alloy of copper and tin ; understood the art of moving large masses , and excelled the Aztecs in the perfection of their masonry , but were inferior to the latter in their mode of computing time and in their method of recording events . The political state of America presents some striking features and contrasts . The native tribes who still survive , are partly held in subjection by European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilds , either in rude independence , or ruled despotically by their chiefs and caciques . The European colonists , who form now by far the most numerous and important part of the population , were long held in subjection to . the mother countries , the chief of /z/ which were Spain and Great Britain ; but the greater part of them have now established their independence , and have generally adopted the republican form of government . Another political element is formed by the negroes , who are mostly in a state of slavery ; a numerous body of them , however , in one of the finest West Indian Islands , have emancipated themselves and become a free people ; while Great Britain has recently bestowed restricted liberty on the large numbers by whom her islands are cultivated . There yet remain about 5 millions of black slaves in Brazil and the United States , besides a considerable number in the other European colonies . Many of the indigenous tribes have become , at least in name and outward forms , converted to Christianity ; but a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their native faith . The European Americans have commonly retained the religious creed of their mother country , so that , while in the French , Spanish , and Portuguese colonies , the Roman Catholic is the prevailing system , those countries that have been settled by English colonists are chiefly of the Protestant persuasions . The negroes have generally been instructed in the elements of Christianity . The whole number of Roman Catholics may be estimated at about millions , of Protestants 15 millions , and of unconverted Indians 1 millions : on this estimate , however , the negroes are considered as belonging to the denomination embraced by their masters . No part of the world presents so great a number of languages spoken by so few individuals , as the American continent . It is estimated that more than 438 languages , and 2000 dialects , are here spoken by about 10 millions of indigenous natives , and consequently , about one half of the known tongues in the world are spoken by about one eighth of the population . An analogy of structure , however , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages as far as they are yet known , that they have been designated polysynthetic , a term descriptive of their remarkable powers of composition . No class of languages equals the American in its astonishing capacity for expressing several ideas and modifications of ideas , in one word ; and idioms of naked savages are not less regular and complicated in structure than rich in words . From the country of the Esquimaux to the Straits of Magellan , mother tongues , in their roots have , if the expression may be allowed , the same physiognomy . It is in consequence of this similarity of structure , that the Indians of the missions could learn the tongue of a different tribe much more easily than the Spanish , and the monks had once adopted the practice of communicating with a great number of hordes through the medium of one of the native languages . /z/ North America comprises that portion of the New World extending from to north latitude , and from to west longitude . The area of this vast region is about 7,200,000 square miles , exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay and Barrow 's Strait . Presenting a broad front to the Arctic Seas , it gradually expands in width to about north latitude , when it again contracts its dimensions until it terminates in the Isthmus of Darien . Its winding outline presents a great extent of sea coast , which is estimated to amount to about 9500 miles on the eastern , and somewhat more on the western side , exclusive of those on the frozen shores of the northern border . Mountain ranges , peculiarly distinguished by their magnitude and continuity , pervade this quarter of the world . Those of North America consist of two great chains , the eastern and western ; the latter , or Rocky Mountain range , known also as the Chipewayan . Passing through Guatemala from the Isthmus of Darien , it spreads out , in Mexico , into extensive table-lands , crowned by lofty volcanic peaks : running thence through the western regions of the United States , and the /z/ British possessions , it finally sinks to a level on the shores of the Polar Sea , westward of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5000 miles , and in its general course it is nearly parallel to the Pacific Ocean , forming the great dividing ridge , or line of separation , between the eastern and western waters , the principal of which have their origin in its rugged declivities . The only other extensive range is the Alleghany or Appalachian , which , running parallel to the eastern coast of the United States , throws off some irregular and rather slightly connected branches diverging into Canada , Labrador and the vicinity of Hudson 's Bay . This consists principally of two parallel chains , the Alleghany and the Blue Ridge . These , however , are not so extensive in their range , nor do they attain the elevation of the great western chain . The rivers of America constitute perhaps her grandest natural features , or at least those in which she may claim the most decided pre-eminence over the other quarters of the globe . They are unequalled , both in their length of course and in the vast masses which they pour into the ocean . The principal of these take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern side , whence , being swelled by numerous streams , they roll , broad and spacious , across the great interior plain , until they approach the eastern range of mountains : thence they derive a fresh and copious series of tributaries , till , bearing , as it were , the waters of half a continent , they reach the ocean . Thus , the Missouri- ( which , notwithstanding the error which has given the name of the Mississippi to the united channel , is undoubtedly , in a physical view , the main stream ) takes its rise in the Rocky Mountains , then flows eastward into the great central valley , where it is joined by the Mississippi , and there receives , from the Alleghany chain , the copious tribute of the Ohio . In its course thence southward , it receives tributaries both from the eastern and western range . The St. Lawrence and Mississippi proper derive their ample stores not from any mountain chain , but from that cold watery region of swamps and forests which forms the northern prolongation of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows through the north into the Arctic Sea , have a long diversified course , but , from the barren regions which they traverse , are of no commercial value . The Lakes of North America are numerous and important ; they are not , however , mountain lakes , nor formed by mountain streams . They originate in those great wooded and watery plains whence the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence take their rise . The chain of connected lakes on the upper course of the latter river , Ontario , Erie , Huron , Michigan and Superior , form the largest bodies of fresh water in the world . Communicating with the sea by the broad channel of the St. Lawrence , and in a country whose population is rapidly increasing , they are becoming of the greatest importance to commerce . Similar lakes extend to the northward as far as the Arctic Sea ; the Lake of the Woods , the Athabasca , the Great Slave , and the Great Bear Lake ; but these , unconnected with any other sea , and frozen for the greater part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Plains of the New World form almost as great and remarkable an object as its mountains . In North America , of those more especially worthy of attention , the first is the plain along the Atlantic , between that ocean and the eastern range of mountains . To that belongs the original territory of the United States . It is a region of natural forests ; of mixed , but rather poor soil , and of but moderate fertility . The second is that on the opposite side of the continent , between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean ; a country with a mild and humid atmosphere , as far north as but inhospitable beyond that latitude . The most extensive is the great central valley of the Mississippi , rich and well wooded on the east side ; bare , but not unfertile in the middle ; dry , sandy , and almost a desert on the west This vast plateau is prolonged without interruption , from the Gulf of Mexico to the shores of the Polar Sea , so that , as has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms and the splendid foliage of the tropics , while , in the other , the last buds of arctic vegetation expire . The area of this great plain is estimated at 3,240,000 square miles . /q/ It was formerly believed , on the authority of Buffbn , that the animals of America were inferior in size to those of the eastern continent The researches of , modern naturalists have not only refuted this error , but have established the fact , that where any difference of size exists in animals of the same class , the superiority in most cases is on the American side . The animal kingdom of North America embraces a considerable variety of species , some of which are not found in other parts of the world . Of the Bear species those peculiar to North America are the Grizzly , Barren Ground , and Black Bears . The great Polar , or White Bear , is found also in the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia . In North America it inhabits the continent as far south as Labrador and Hudson 's Bay , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it frequently floats a great distance from land . These huge creatures feed mostly on animal substances , and as they swim and dive well , they hunt seals and other marine animals with great success . The White Bear possesses prodigious strength , and often attacks sailors who visit the Arctic seas . It is also remarkable for its attachment to its young , and is of a dirty or yellowish white colour . The Grizzly Bear , the most powerful and dangerous animal of North America , inhabiting both sides of the Rocky Mountains , is , when full grown , reported to exceed 800 pounds in weight , and its strength so great that it has been known to drag to a considerable distance a buffalo weighing 1000 pounds ; the cubs of this species can climb tree ? , but the adult animal can not : the hunter may thus escape , but the infuriated beast will sometimes keep watch below , and thus confine his enemy for many hours . This is a carnivorous species , but will occasionally eat vegetables . The Barren Ground Bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that section of the continent called the Barren Lands , or grounds situated north of ; this is a formidable animal , and is much dreaded by the Indians , who are very careful to avoid burning bones in their encampments , or any thing that might attract its notice . It frequents the sea coast in autumn in considerable numbers , for the purpose of feeding on fish . In size it is between the Grizzly and the Black Bear . The Black Bear of North America is different from the European animal of the same name . It has a milder disposition , and lives more on vegetables : its favourite food is the different kinds of berries , and it will not , except from necessity , subsist on animal substances . The Cinnamon Bear of the traders , and found in the vicinity of Hudson 's Bay , is considered only an accidental variety of the Black Bear . Of the Deer kind there are several species not found in the old continent . The Moose Deer resembles- the Elk of Europe , but is of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind found in America , and perhaps in the world , being in height to the shoulder full six feet , and weighs when full grown from 1000 to 1200 pounds ; it is a solitary animal , and the most shy and wary of all the Deer species : it was formerly found as far south as the Ohio River , but now occurs most frequently in the countries north of the great lakes and in the unsettled parts of Canada , and also occasionally in the northern sections of New Hampshire , Maine , &c.; The Wapiti or American Elk is second in size only to the Moose , and formerly ranged over all the middle parts of the continent : it is now found only in the remote western districts of the United States and Canada , and also west of the Rocky Mountains . The size and appearance of the Elk are imposing ; his air denotes confidence of great strength , while his towering horns exhibit weapons capable of doing much injury when offensively employed . The Elk is shy and retiring , and has very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the horns when in a soft state are considered a delicacy . The Indians make bows of the perfect horn , which are highly serviceable from their elasticity ; and from their skins they prepare various articles of dress , and apply them also to other purposes . The Caribou , or American Reindeer , is a different species from the Reindeer of the old continent ; it is found in all the high northern latitudes of North America , and has never been domesticated or used as a beast of draught by the natives , being considered only as game ; there are two species , the Woodland and the Barren Ground Caribou . The Virginia Deer is one of the most ele- /z/ gant of the American animals of its class ; it lives in large herds , and is found over a considerable portion of North America ; it is said to display great enmity to the Rattlesnake , which it contrives to crush by leaping with its fore-feet conjoined and dropping perpendicularly on the serpent , bounding away with great lightness , and repeating this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antelope , the prong-horned , is peculiar to America ; it is a graceful and fleet animal , so swift that it seems rather to fly than leap from rock to rock in the rugged regions which it inhabits ; they live in small families , and are found in the vast plain of the Missouri and Saskatchawan , in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains . The American Bison , or Buffalo , once common in the United States , has gradually disappeared before the white population ; it now only exists to the west of the Mississippi , and roams over the vast grassy plains in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains ; here it is found in immense herds , amounting , it is said , oftentimes to from 5000 to 10,000 head ; the flesh is tender and juicy , and the tongue and hump , or wig , are in particular esteemed great delicacies . The Musk Ox derives its name from its flesh , when in a lean state , smelling strongly of that substance . It is truly an Arctic animal , being found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as far north as Melville Island in In size the Musk Ox scarcely equals that of the small Highland cattle , the carcass when cleaned not weighing more than 3 cwt. ; it assembles in herds and flees at the ' sight of man ; it is much hunted both by the Indians and Esquimaux . Herds of wild Horses roam over the great plains on both sides of the Rocky Mountains , and like those existing under similar circumstances in the southern continent , are the offspring of the European animal , imported soon after the first settlement of the country . They are found from Texas to the plains of the Saskatchawan , and are of great importance to the Nomadic Tribes , who train them not only for transporting their tents and families from place to place , but also for the purposes of war , the chase , and of food ; the flesh of the horse being thus mostly used by the Spokains and several other tribes , and likewise at times by the residents of the Hudson 's Bay Company 's posts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wild Horse purchased by citizens of the United States from the Indians , have been found remarkable for their speed and bottom . Of the Cat kind this continent contains several species , all equally remarkable , like their congeners of the old world , for the beauty and diversity of their colour , and the treachery of their disposition . The cougar , or puma , called also the panAher , is the largest and most formidable of its class found in North America ; it is about one-third less in size than the lion , and of sufficient strength to carry a man up a tree ; though now rare in the more settled parts of the continent , it is occasionally met with in the remote districts of the United States . It preys upon calves , sheep , &c,; but has also been known to attack man . The jaguar , an animal of the cat kind , resembling the panther , is found , though rarely , in Mexico ; also the ocelet and tiger-cat . The Rocky Mountain sheep and goat inhabit the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter is about the size of the domestic sheep , its fleece hanging down on both sides like that of the merino breed , the hair is long and straight , coarser than that of the sheep , but finer than that of the domestic goat ; the Rocky Mountain sheep is larger than any domestic sheep ; the horns of the ram are immense , in some of the old ones so much so as to prevent the animal 's feeding on level ground . The hair is like that of the reindeer , at first short , fine and flexible , but as the winter advances it becomes coarse , dry and brittle , though it feels soft ; it is then so close as to become erect ; they collect in flocks from three to thirty , the young rams and females herding together , while the old rams form separate flocks . The principal fur-bearing animals of North America are the beaver , musquash , or muskrat , pine-marten , pekan , or fisher , the Canada lynx , raccoon , and stoat , or ermine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians and the inhabitants of those settled parts of the continent in which any of them are yet found ; /q/ their skins make an important item of export to Europe , particularly from Canada ; some of these animals are evidently decreasing with great rapidity . The well known beaver is now almost exclusively confined to Canada and the north-west districts of America ; even here , however , their numbers are daily diminishingIn the year 1743 the imports of beaver skins into the ports of London and Rochelle exceeded 150,000 ; in 1827 the import , though from four times the extent of fur country known in 1743 , was less than 50,000 ; of the musquash , between 400,000 and 500,000 skins are annually exported from Canada , and of the pinemarten 100,000 skins ; the latter are used for trimmings , and will dye so well as to imitate sables and other expensive furs , hence they have always been an important article of commerce . The sea-otter also furnishes a large amount of valuable furs , principally to the Russians on the north-west coast . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world ; of these the Newfoundland dog is remarkable for its sagacity , great bulk and strength . The Esquimaux dog , also a large variety , is very useful to the Esquimaux and the traders in drawing their furs and baggage . The North American dog is used in the Hudson 's Bay countries both as a beast of draught and in the chase , and also for food , its flesh being esteemed by the Canadian voyagers , or canoe-men , superior to all other . Foxes and wolves abound in most parts of the central and northern regions of the continent ; of the former there are the arctic , sooty , cross , black , gray , and red fox , and of the latter , the Mexican , the gray , red , black , dusky , and barking , or prairie-wolf . Of the opossum , found from Pennsylvania to Brazil , there are several species , of which the Virginia , or common opossum , is well known in the United States ; also , the skunk , marmots of different species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other smaller animals . The whale species are numerous on the northern coasts ; the most useful and remarkable are the common and spermaceti whale , and the narwhale , or seaunicorn . The common seal frequents the sea coasts perhaps throughout the world. , but is in North America most numerous in high northern latitudes , and is of the greatest use to the Esquimaux and other inhabitants of those frozen regions , furnishing them with all the necessaries of life ; they are of various kinds , as the hooded , harp , fetid , ursine , and great seal . Most of the Birds of North America , and especially those of the United States , are now rendered as familiar to the European naturalist as those of his own country ; for they have been more ably and more fully illustrated than those of any part of the world . Rapacious birds are here as numerous as in other parts of the earth , and of a great many different species , including eagles , vultures , hawks , falcons , owls , &c.; The white-headed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own republic . It is common to both continents ; but , while it seems almost entirely confined to the arctic regions of the old world , it abounds in the milder regions of the United States , in the new . It is notorious for its lawless habits ; robbing the fish-hawk of his hard-won victim , and even compelling the vulture to disgorge its filthy prey . The vultures are the great Californian vulture , black vulture , and turkey buzzard . The first seems to be confined to California and the adjoining regions west of the Rocky Mountains : they build their nests in the most secret parts of the pine forests : they measure from four to four and a half feet in length . Their food is carrion or dead fish , and they will in no instance attack any living animal , unless it be wounded and unable to walk . In searching for their prey , they soar to a great height ; and , on discovering a wounded deer or other animal , they follow its track until it sinks disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in possession , it is eoori surrounded by great numbers , who all fall upon the carcass , and devour it to a skele ton within an hour , even though it be a horse or a stag . The black vulture and turkey buzzard are both well known and numerous in the southern States of our Union , where , notwithstanding their filthy habits , they are protected by law and common usage , being of great utility in devouring putrid animal matter which would otherwise be highly offensive and injurious . The wild turkey is peculiar to America : it is a fine large bird , of brilliant /z/ blacl /z/ blackish plumage . It breods'with the domestic one ; and when the latter is reared near the range of the former , it is sure to be enticed into the woods by it . Of this bird , Dr. Franklin observed , it would have been a much fitter emblem of our country than the white-headed eagle , a lazy , cowardly , tyrannical bird , living on the labours of others , and more suited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . Of the duck kind , of which there are many species , the best-known is the can vas-back . It is peculiar to America , and is more celebrated than any other for the excellent flavour of its flesh : they are found mostly in Chesapeake Bay and the neighbouring rivers . In winter , they are occasionally so numerous as to cover the water to the extent of several acres : this bird is an expert diver , and lives on the bulbous root of a w T ater-grass resembling garden celery in taste , to which is attributed its peculiar flavour : they dive in from 6 to 8 feet of water , and are frequently attended by the widgeon , or bald-pate duck , who never dives himself , but watches the rising of the canvas-back , and , before he has his eyes well opened , snatches the delicious morsel from his mouth and makes off : on this account , the two species live in continual contention . Perhaps the most characteristic of American birds is the humming-bird , re markable alike for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they are most numerous in South America , but are found in the northern continent as far north as Vast flights of pigeons migrate periodically to different parts of the continent , frequently extending for many miles on each side , darkening the entire atmosphere , and often requiring four or five days to pass over a particular place . Of the birds of game , the principal are the grouse , pheasant , partridge , &c.; The species of grouse are more numerous , and entirely distinct from those of Europe . The largest and most valuable is the Cock of the Plains . Some other of the peculiar American birds are the mocking-bird , blue jay , and whip-poor-will . Parrots and parroquets abound in Mexico ; and in the United States there is one species of parrot . The seas , lakes , and rivers of North America swarm with a great variety of delicious fish . The cod , so well known in commerce , is found only in the northern seas . Their great rendezvous is on the Bank of Newfoundland and other sand-banks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States : these situations they prefer on account of the number of worms produced in those sandy bottoms , which tempt them to resort there for food . Some conception may be formed of their amazing fecundity , from the fact that nearly ten millions of eggs have been counted in one fish of a moderate size . The mackerel and alewife fisheries , along the coasts of the United States , also give employment and food to great numbers of persons . The shad is taken in large quantities in all the rivers of the Atlantic States , and in the proper season is highly esteemed . The salmon is also found in the northern rivers of the United States and Canada , on both sides of the continent , and is especially plentiful in Columbia River . The white-fish , or titameg of the traders , is caught in all the great lakes from Canada to the Arctic Ocean . It is a delicious article of food , and as many as 900 barrels have been taken at a single fishery on Lake Superior . The Reptiles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this class in other parts of the world , the majority are apparently useless , and some dangerous . In North America , the alligator does not occur north of the Carolinas and the Red River of Louisiana . In severe winters he buries himself in the mud , and lies in a torpid state . The rattlesnakes are peculiar to the New World , and are particularly formidable on account of the deadly v'enom of their bite . There are four or five species of this reptile , all of which reach the length of five or six feet . The common species of the United States is extremely numerous about the sources of the Columbia River . There are several kinds of land tortoises , but they are all of a moderate size . Some curious salamanders have been recently discovered , and the celebrated siren is an inhabitant of the muddy lakes of Georgia and South Carolina . This sin- /z/ gular reptile has long perplexed naturalists , some thinking it a tadpole or imperfect frog ; it is now , however , fully ascertained to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present day , by their physical characters not less than by their languages , a race different from those known before the discovery of America , and preserve throughout this vast extent of country and variety of climates , the same essential characteristics . They have a copper colour , resembling that of rusty iron or cinnamon , coarse , straight , black hair , high cheek-bones , and sunken eyes ; it has been affirmed that they are without beards , but it is well ascertained that this is not the case naturally , but that most of them take great pains to pluck them out . Almost all the Indians near Mexico , and those on the north-west coast , wear mustachios . The American Indians are generally erect and of fine forms , with few instances of decrepitude or deformity ; they have cleaner limbs , not so muscular , and with less tendency to corpulence , than the whites . As a race they have countenances that are generally unjoyous , stern and ruminating ; it is with them either gloomy taciturnity or bacchanalian revel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain and death , invest their character with a kind of moral grandeur . It is to be doubted , however , whether some part of his vaunted stoicism be not the result of a more than ordinary degree of physical insensibility . Like all ignorant people unable to trace the relation between results and causes , they are beyond all other superstitious . It may be laid down as an universal trait of Indian character . The warrior who braves death a thousand times , and in every form in the fury of battle , carries with him to the combat a little charmed bag of filthy and disgusting ingredients , in which he places no little reliance or security against the balls and arrows that are directed against him ; all savages in this region are hospitable : j even the enemy whom they would have sought and slain far from their cabins , who presents himself fearlessly there , claims and receives their hospitality . They accord to the cabin hearth the honours and the sanctity of an asylum . Since the introduction of the horse by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing degree of skill in the management of that noble animal ; among these are the Pawnees , the Comanches , the Sioux , the Apaches , Shoshonees , Enneshoors , and other tribes : some of these have also borrowed the use of fire-arms from their European neighbours , but in general they have rejected the arts of peace and civilization . Perhaps there is no tribe among the American Indians so degraded that it has not some notion of a higher power than man , and in general they seem to have entertained the idea of a Great Spirit as a master of life , in short , a Creator , and of an Evil Spirit , holding divided empire with him over nature ; many of them have priests , prophets , and sorcerers , in whose supernatural powers they trust , and most , if not all , appear to believe in a future state ; many attempts have been made by benevolent persons to convert the aboriginal tribes to the christian religion , to teach them the arts of peace and civilized life , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the effect of those efforts , that many do not hesitate to pronounce it impossible to engraft the European civilization on the Indian character . Some doubtful exceptions to this general failure of the attempts to effect the civilization of the Indians occur in the United States , where some of the Cherokees and other tribes hold property , cultivate the ground , and practise the useful arts . There are some circumstances which invest the present missionary efforts with stronger probabilities of success than any that have preceded them . The number of Indians that are half-breeds , or mixtures of the blood of the whites , is great , and continually increasing . These generally espouse , either from conviction or from party feeling , the cause of civilization and Christianity . It is more universally believed than it once was , that Christianity is the religion of social and civilized man . Instead of relying much on the hope of the conversion of adult hunting and warrior savages , the effort is chiefly directed towards the young . Schools , the loom , the anvil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the romliirt , stability and plenty of cultivation , they are to be imbued with a taste for civilized /z/ institutions , arts , industry , and religion ; at the same time every philanthropic man will wish these efforts of benevolence all possible success . North America is politically divided into the Republics of the United States , Texas , Mexico , and Guatemala , which occupy the central and southern parts of the continent . The northern , the eastern , and central parts , contain the possessions of Great Britain ; and the extreme north-western section those claimed by Russia , The following estimates of the areas in square miles , and the population of the respective divisions at the present time , is probably as near an approximation to the truth as circumstances will permit : Square Miles .

The coast seems to be chiefly alpine , in some parts rising into snow-capped summits , of which the most remarkable mountain is St. Elias ; it is probably a volcanic peak , and is elevated to the height of 17,850 feet above the level of the sea , and is said to be visible 50 leagues from the coast . In this region there are computed to be 1000 white inhabitants , who are mostly traders ; the savages are estimated at near 50,000 ; they barter the furs obtained in hunting with the Russians , for fire-arms , beads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of factories , or trading establishments , on various parts of the coast : the principal of these are at Sitcha , or New Archangel , Kodiak , and Oonalaska . The Aleoutian Islands may be considered as belonging to this region ; they form a long and numerous group , extending westward from the Peninsula of Aliaska to Kamtschatka . They appear to be a continuation of the lofty volcanic ranges which traverse the opposite regions of the two continents . These islands are inhabited by a race sharing , in a measure , the features and aspect of the Mongols and Esquimaux . Considered as savages , they are mild in their manners and deportment , and display a considerable degree of industry and ingenuity : they dwell in large subterranean mansions , or rather villages , partitioned into numerous apartments , and containing from 50 to 100 , or even 150 inhabitants . These abodes , covered with turf , are almost on a level with the surrounding country , from which they are scarcely to be distinguished . Sitcha , or New Archangel , on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . may be considered the capital of the territories of Russia on this continent ; it is a village of about 1000 inhabitants , the houses of which , including the fortifications and public buildings , are built of wood , and are neat and well kept . The management of the trade at this and the other ports , has been injudiciously vested by the Russian government in an exclusive company , resident at /q/ ' Irkoutsk . The grand object of their trade is to collect the skins of the sea-otter j and other animals , for the market of Canton , where they are in very extensive demand . The annual value of the furs drawn by Russia from her North American possessions has been estimated at $200,000. /z/ The possessions of Great Britain irt North America are an assemblage of vast ill-defined and straggling ; territories , the remnant of that mighty empire of which the great revolution deprived her . Even in their present dismembered state , however , their extent and capabilities might , and probably will , enable them one day to surpass some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This country , taken in its full extent , is bounded north by the Arctic Sea , east by the Atlantic Ocean and Baffin 's Bay , south by the United States and the Atlantic Ocean , and west by the American possessions of Russia . Its area is equal to about that of the United States . About one tenth part only of this vast territory is as yet settled by a civilized population . The actual occupation by white settlers extends along the northern , and , in the lower part of its course , the southern , bank of the St. Lawrence , the northern shores of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie , and , in part , the eastern coasts of Lake Huron : it reachrs , though only in some instances , thirty or forty miles into the interior . The Company which enjoys the exclusive trade of Hudson 's Bay , maintains several forts on its western shore ; they have also small forts on the leading lakes and rivers of the interior , called Houses , where they are secure against the attack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can form a store of the articles necessary for the fur trade . Beyond this occupancy they have not attempted to exercise any jurisdiction , nor , as has lately appeared , could a peaceable colony form itself without imminent danger from these rude tenants of the wild . The climate is very severe , much exceeding what is felt under the same latitude in the old continent . Lower Canada for six and Upper Canada for five months of the year have a mean temperature below the freezing point , and are buried in perpetual snow ; yet after that period the sun breaks out with such force , that large crops of the most valuable grain can be raised on the great extent of fertile land of which the territory consists . Upper Canada is finely watered , clad with immense forests of valuable timber , and contains about ten millions of acres capable of culture . Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are well wooded countries , but less fertile ; and though the winters are less severe , the heavy fogs that prevail for a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosts and snows of Canada . The river St. Lawrence is the principal feature of this region , and one of the noblest river channels in the world . It is difficult to say where it begins . It has been held to issue from Lake Superior , a vast body of water , fed by about fifty streams , of which the St. Louis and Grand Portage Rivers are the principal ; but , in fact , the lakes are merely connected by short canals , through which the surplus waters of one are poured into the other . These canals bear the local names of St. Clair , Detroit , Niagara , &c.; The last is distinguished by its falls , the most magnificent in the world . From Lake Ontario to Montreal the river is broken by a succession of rocks , cataracts , and rapids , which render navigation very dangerous . It is after passing Montreal that it rolls in full grandeur in a deep continuous channel , conveying large ships and rafts down to Quebec . The navigation is blocked up for half the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some weeks with floating fragments . The other rivers of Lower Canada are its tributaries . On the north are the Utawas and the Saguenay , large navigable rivers flowing through a region little known : the former is supposed to have a course of about 600 miles , but its navigation is much interrupted by rapids ; the latter i3 remarkable for its great depth /z/ and width , and is navigable for 90 miles to its falls ; for the distance of about 50 miles it has the appearance of a long mountain lake . Tbe St. Maurice is also a considerable stream from the north , and the Montmorency , which falls into the St. Lawrence , is celebrated for its beautiful cataract , which pours a large* volume of water over a precipitous ledge . On the south are the St. Francis ; the Chaudiere , with a fine cascade rushing down a precipice 100 feet in height ; and tbe Sorelle or Richelieu , the outlet of Lake Champlain . The Thames , flowing into Lake St. Clair , and the Ouse , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which rises in Maine , is navigable 80 miles by sea vessels , but its course is much broken by falls and rapids . The Miramichi is the other principal river of New Brunswick . Lakes , in Canada , are on a greater scale than in any other part of the world ; and the united chain forms a vast inland sea of fresh water . The largest of these , and the largest fresh-water lake in the world , is Lake Superior , which is 420 miles in length by 170 in breadth ; having a circuit of 1500 miles , and covering an area of 35,000 square miles . It discharges its waters through the river or Strait of St. Mary , 50 miles long , into Lake Huron , which likewise receives those of Lake Michigan . Lake Huron is 280 miles in length , and 90 in breadth , exclusive of the large bay on the north-eastern shore , called Georgian Bay , which is about 80 miles in length by 50 in breadth . An outlet , called the river St. Clair , expands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same name , 24 miles in length , and 30 in breadth , which again contracts , and enters Lake Erie under the name of the river Detroit , 25 miles in length . Lake Erie , the next link in this great chain , is 270 miles in length , by from 25 to 50 in breadth . The river Niagara , 36 miles long , carries its surplus waters over a perpendicular precipice 165 feet high , into Lake Ontario , which is about 190 miles in length , by 40 in breadth . The surface of Lake Superior is about 625 feet above the level of the sea ; its medium depth 900 feet ; the descent to Lake Huron is by the Sault or Fall of St. Mary 23 feet , and by rapids and the gradual descent of the river , 21 feet , giving 580 feet for the elevation of the surface of Lake Huron , whose depth is equal to that of Lake Superior . Lake Erie is much shallower , not exceeding a mean of 120 feet , and having its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a depth of 500 feet , and its surface is 330 lower than that of Lake Erie . The waters of these lakes are clear and potable , and they abound with fish , among which are trout , weighing from 75 to 100 pounds , sturgeon , white fish , pike , bass , &c.; They are navigable by large vessels , and a great number of steamboats navigate their waters . Lake Simcoe , which is connected with Lake Huron , is already disturbed by the plash of the steamboat . Lake Nepissing is a considerable body of water , which a rapid and broken stream unites with Lake Huron . In the interior , are several smaller lakes , of which the principal is the Lake of the Woods , whose winding shores are 300 miles in circumference . Farther to the north-west is Lake Winnipeek . The name signifies muddy , and is descriptive of its waters . There is a water communication with Lake Superior by the rivers Winnipeek and La Pluie . Still farther to the north-west , a number of lakes extend nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , connected by a water communication , except in two or three cases , where portages or carrying-places intervene . This is the principal navigable route to the waters of the Arctic Sea , and is much frequented by the fur traders during the short period of summer in these regions . The principal divisions of British America are New Britain , with the provinces of Upper Canada , Lower Canada , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Prince Edward 's Island , and Newfoundland . The constitution of government for the provinces has been modelled on that of the mother country . Each province has a governor and a legislative council appointed by the crown , and a house of commons or representatives chosen by the inhabitants , upon moderate qualifications . The government of Canada was administered by a governor and council appointed by the crown , until 1791 , when the constitutional act divided the country into two provinces , and established a constitutional government for each . In Lower Canada , the legislative council is /q/ appointed for life , and consists of 34 members ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is composed of 88 members . In Upper Canada , the chief executive officer is styled lieutenant-governor : the legislative council consists of 17 members , and the house of assembly of 50 . Bills passed by the two houses become a law when agreed to by the governor ; though , in certain cases , the royal sanction is required , and in others reference must be had to the imperial parliament . The supreme legislative authority is vested therefore in the king and the two houses of the British Parliament , limited , however , by their own acts . The act 31 Geo . III . ch. 13 , declares that no taxes shall be imposed on the colonies but for the regulation of trade , and that the proceeds of such taxes shall be applied for the use of the province , in such manner as shall be directed by any laws made by his Majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council , and the House of Assembly . This point is one of the chief causes of the dissatisfaction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money raised within the provinces . In Lower Canada trial by jury is universal in criminal cases , but a very small proportion of the civil cases are tried in this manner . Law proceedings are in French and English ; and it is not unusual to have half the jury English and the other half French . In Upper Canada the laws are wholly English , as is also the case in the other provinces . The constitutions of the other provinces also resemble that of Upper Canada . The revenue of Lower Canada is about $800,000 ; and of Upper Canada $500,000 . These sums form the public resources of the provinces , and are employed in the current expenses of the provincial governments . Upper Canada has a debt of between three and four millions , contracted for public work , roads , canals , &c.; The expenditure of the British government , out of the imperial'revenues , was for the two provinces , in 1834 , ; of which was for civil , and the remainder for military purposes ; and for the other four North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which all but was for naval and military purposes : their revenue , during the same period , amounted to /z/ The natural resources of British America are more ample than would be inferred from its dreary aspect and the vast snows under which it is buried . Canada has a very fertile soil , especially in its upper colony ; and though it be free from snow only during five months of the year , the heat of that period is sufficient to ripen the most valuable kinds of grain . The vast uncleared tracts are covered with excellent timber . Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are less fertile , yet they contain much good land , and are well timbered . Newfoundland has on its shores the most valuable cod-fishery in the world . Even the immense northern wastes are covered with a profusion of animals , noted for their rich and beautiful furs , which form the foundation of an extensive and valuable trade . The commerce of British America is of vast importance : the fur trade , the original object for opening an intercourse with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place , chiefly from the shores of Hudson 's Bay ; but it was there injudiciously placed in the hands of an exclusive company , which greatly diminished its activity . Upwards of forty years ago some enterprising merchants of Montreal established the North-west Company , who , employing numerous and active agents , carried on their business with spirit and enterprise . The eager rivalry of the two companies , operating in regions beyond the pale of law , gave birth to many deeds of fraud and violence : within these few years , however , an union has healed the deadly enmity between them , and , by acting in concert , they have determined to diminish the issue of ardent spirits , and even to adopt every practical means for the moral and religious improvement of the Indians . The furs exported from Quebec , for 1831 , amounted in value to The timber trade , the value of which thirty years ago did not exceed has now surpassed all others in magnitude . The timber is obtained from the immense forests on the shores of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter by American axemen , who are peculiarly skilful ; and the business is attended with great hardship , both from the work itself , and the incle- /z/ mency of the season . The trees , when felled , are put together into immense rafts , which are floated down the St. Lawrence to Quebec . The Canada merchants lately estimated the capital invested in this business at It is also carried on to a great extent from Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , and even from Cape Breton . The exports to all quarters amounted , in 1831 , to sterling : other articles , the produce chiefly of agriculture , amounted , in the year 1831 , to The shipping employed between England and her American colonies was , in 1829 , inwards 1609 , of 431,124 tons ; outwards 1652 ships , of 418,142 tons .

The fishery is pursued upon these shores , to an extent not surpassed anywhere , else upon the globe . The rich supply of cod in the Newfoundland banks is wholly unparalleled : although all the nations of Europe have been lading cargoes of fish for centuries , no sensible diminution of them has been felt . The English employ about 40,000 tons of shipping , and 3000 men , in this fishery : in 1831 , they exported in fish , oil , and seal-skins , to the amount of and the Americans and French , in the same year , exported , the latter , to upwards of in value , and the former , to the amount of The interior communications of Canada are almost solely by the river St. Lawrence and the lakes , which open a very extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , between Montreal and Lake Ontario , where a series of rapids occur , over which only canoes can shoot , and all heavy goods must be landed and shipped . Great exertions have been made to improve , by canals , the interior communications of Canada .

One canal has been constructed from that city to La Chine , a distance of eight miles , at an expense of : another is the Greenville canal , eight miles long , constructed to avoid certain obstructions in the navigation of the Lower Utawas River . The principal operation , however , is the Rideau canal , reaching from the Utawas River to Kingston . It is 135 miles long , connecting together a chain of lakes , which admit of steam navigation ; and the dimensions are such as to allow vessels of from 100 to 125 tons to pass .

It comprises Labrador , New North and New South Wales , Prince William 's Land , Boothia Felix , lately discovered by Captain Ross , and the North Georgia Islands . Hudson 's Bay divides the country into two great divisions : on the east is Labrador and East Main , and on the west New North and New South Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hudson 's Bay Company , into various smaller districts , which are , however , of no political importance . The face of the country is generally a vast plain , intersected with numerous lakes and rivers , eome of which roll into the unexplored seas of the north , and others into Hudson 's Bay : among the former are the Mackenzie , the Copper Mine , and Thleweecho , or Great Fish River , lately explored by Captain Back ; and into the latter the principal are Churchill , Nelson , Severn , and Albany Rivers . The interior streams are the Saskatchewan , Winnipeek , and Red River , flowing into Lake Winnipeek ; and the Athabasca and Peace Rivers , emptying into Lake Athabasca : these may properly be considered head branches of the Mackenzie , as their waters finally reach the ocean through its channel . The lakes are exceedingly numerous ; some are extensive , and second only to the great Canadian lakes , and affording , during the brief period of summer , a long and almost continuous canoe navigation from Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Muddy Lake , Athabasca Lake , Great Slave , and Great Bear Lakes , are the principal : they are situated in a range lying N. W. from each other , and afford , for a short period , an almost uninterrupted navigation from Lake Superior to the Arctic Ocean . Lake Winnipeek is 270 miles long , and from 15 to 18 broad : it receives numerous rivers and enjoys a considerable extent of canoe navigation . Athabasca Lake , lying between 500 and 600 miles N. W. of Lake Winnipeek , is in length about 200 miles , with a breadth of from 16 to 18 miles : it receives several large streams , and is connected , by Slave River , with Great Slave Lake , still farther to the N. W. , which is one of the largest bodies of fresh water in North America , excepting Lakes Superior and Huron , and perhaps Lake Michigan . From Great Slave Lake flows Mackenzie 's River , which , in its course to the ocean , receives , from the eastward , the water of the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each way , and is deeply indented by several large peninsulas . In winter such is the severity of the climate in this region , that even in the lakes freeze 8 feet thick ; brandy and mercury congeal ; the rocks sometimes split with a noise like that of the heaviest artillery , scattering the fragments to a great distance . The temperature is capricious and the changes sudden . The Aurora Borealis sheds a light sometimes equal to that of the full moon . The vegetation in the northern parts is very scanty , but adjoining the northern boundary of the United States there are some fertile spots along the Red River of Lake Winnipeek . Lord Selkirk purchased from the Hudson 's Bay Company a territory of 116,000 acres , and formed the settlements of Pembina and Assiniboia : the soil has been found tolerably fertile , but the great distance from a market , being 2800 miles from New Orleans , and 1900 from Buffalo , must long prevent it from rising to much importance . It has suffered severely from contests with the Indians , fomented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of the recent settlement of the boundary line with the United States , half of it has been included within their territory . The only trade in these regions is that of furs ; to facilitate which , the Hudson 's Bay Company have established forta and trading-houses in various quarters , extending from Hudson 's Bay west into the territories claimed by the United States . On the shores of the Pacific Ocean , and to the north , almost to the Arctic Sea , from these forts , &c,; agents are sent amongst the Indians to collect furs , j /z/ in exchange for such European commodities as are prized by them . The furs exported , in 1832 , from Hudson 's Bay amounted to the value of The coasts of Labrador , and indeed the whole of the northern parts of this region , from Greenland to Bhering 's Strait , is inhabited by the Esquimaux , a race of savages who sustain existence chiefly by feeding on whales and seals , except in the more southern parts of Labrador : of the skins of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sinews they make thread . They travel over the snow in sledges drawn by dogs , of which they have a very hardy and sagacious breed , and will draw a considerable load 60 miles in a day . Their huts have been met with as far north as Little , squat , and feeble , the complexion of these polar men has little of the copper colour of the other American aborigines , and is rather of a dirty , reddish yellow . Their summer huts are circular , covered with deer-skins , and entered by creeping on the belly . Yet these isolated and simple beings have been taught by necessity , many inventions , which are highly creditable to their ingenuity . They make their winter habitations of frozen snow , in a few hours , exceedingly comfortable , and which remain durable till melted by the heat of the ensuing summer . Some of the tribes have canoes , made of the skin of the sea-calf , with which they sail with amazing swiftness . They also work a gray and porous stone into neat pitchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Strait display great ingenuity in the manufacture of trinkets and utensils of the fossil ivory , with which some parts of those regions abound . The Esquimaux met with by Captain Parry , in North Georgia , were exceeding lively and cheerful , more so than even the negro , the native of a sunny climate , and of a region producing spontaneously all the fruits of the earth . They are so fond of dancing that it seems almost their natural gait ; and they are always ready to return raillery or mimicry . They are , far more than the Indians , a social and domestic people . This is apparent in their good treatment to females , and their care and affection for their children . Among these people , on the coast of Labrador , the Moravian missionaries have established several settlements ; Nain , Okkak , Hopedale , &c,; and have , besides teaching them many useful things , built a magazine , in which each of the natives might deposite his useless stores , prevailing on them to set apart a tenth for widows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a savage people , by showing them the palpable fruits of the gospel . The Indians occupying this region are principally the Assiniboines , Knisteneaux , or Crees , Chippewayans , Beaver , Hare , Dog-rib , Copper Indians , &c.; The Assiniboines are a tribe of Sioux ; they are divided into several smaller tribes , as the Black-foot , Fall , and Blood Indians , &c.; They rear many horses , and subsist chiefly on the buffalo . The Knisteneaux , or Crees , inhabit a wide extent of country in the vicinity of Lake Athabasca : they were once numerous , but are now reduced to about 500 in number ; they are a well-formed race , and their women are the handsomest of all the Indian females ; they are hospitable , generous , and mild , when not infuriated by spirits ; they do not , however , consider chastity a virtue , and are not unkind to their women . The Chippewayans live to the north of the latter , and near the Great Slave Lake : their appearance is singular , with high projecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are persevering , incorrigible beggars , yet not dishonest , and so deeply imbued with national pride , that , while they give to other nations their proper names , they call themselves , by way of eminence , the people ; amongst them the lot of the female is grievous , and mothers have been known to destroy their female offspring that it might escape the same servitude . Aged and sick people are abandoned to perish . They are said to be the same people as the Chippeways of the United States , and are much reduced in numbers . The Copper , Hare , and Dog-rib Indians , occupy the country north of Great Bear Lake ; they much resemble the Chippewayans , but are of a more friendly and amiable disposition ; their humanity and faithful attachment were experienced by the recent travellers ( Captain Franklin , &c.); in those regions , on occasions of extreme distress . /q/ /z/ Upper Canada , commencing at Lake St. Francis , above Montreal , extends along the whole chain of the great lakes , almost to the western boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district attached to Quebec , at which period I a number of American loyalists and disbanded soldiers were settled in it , and the name of Upper Canada bestowed . Comparatively but a small part of this province is settled , and many portions of it are yet unexplored . The settlements are chiefly along the rivers St. Lawrence and Utawas , and lakes Erie and Ontario . The soil is in general excellent , and yields abundant crops of grain , wheat , Indian corn , hops , flax , ( fee . Cultivation , in Upper Canada , is still in an incipient state , but is rapidly advancing in consequence of the influx of British settlers . Government , for some time , allowed to every settler , fifty or even a hundred acres of land , upon payment of fees amounting to about a shilling per acre ; but since 1827 the lands have been disposed of by public auction . Among emigrants possessed of capital , a great proportion have of late made their purchases from the Canada Company . This body , incorporated in 1826 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,300,000 acres , for which they engaged to pay the sum of by sixteen annual instalments . These lands are dispersed through every part of Upper Canada ; but the largest portion , amounting to about a million of acres , and extending about sixty miles in length , is along the eastern shore of Lake Huron . The Company found towns and villages , form roads , and lay out the ground in convenient lots , and have agents on the spot , who afford every information and aid to emigrants . The climate of Upper Canada is salubrious , and epidemic diseases almost unknown . The winters are shorter and less rigorous than in the lower province : the spring opens , and agricultural labours commence , from six weeks to two months earlier than in the neighbourhood of Quebec . The summer heats are also more moderate , and the autumn pleasant and favourable for securing the produce of all the late crops . Population is advancing with great rapidity : it has hitherto been confined to the St. Lawrence and the shores of the lakes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns are extending in the fertile forest , some of which , in rapidity of increase , vie with those of the United States . Great extents of fertile land are yet unoccupied , and the parent country is furnishing every facility for transporting to these forests her surplus population , great numbers of whom , however , finally make their way to the United States . Toronto and Kingston , on the northern shore of Lake Ontario , are the two principal towns of Upper Canada . Toronto , formerly York , near the north-west end of the lake , owes ite support to its being tho ooat of government and of the courts , and to the extensive settlement recently formed to the north and east of it . Population 10,000 . Kingston , near the north-east point of the lake , has a commodious harbour , and is a neat little town with about 5000 inhabitants . Some of the other towns on Lake Ontario are Cobourg , Port Hope , and Hamilton . On the Niagara River are the villages of Niagara , Queenstown , and Chippewa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , opposite to Detroit , is a thriving little town ; as is also London , on the Thames , with a population of 2000 inhabitants . On the east shore of Lake Huron is the neat and flourishing town of Goderich , with a good harbour at the mouth of the Maitland River ; and at the bottom of Lake Manitouline , or Georgian Bay , is Penetanguishene , a British naval station , from which a steamboat runs occasionally to St. Joseph 's Island , at the west end of the lake , on which is kept a small detachment of British troops . Upper Canada is divided into 11 districts , which are subdivided into 25 counties . It is bounded on the north-east by Lower Canada , north by New Britain , west and south by the United States . The lines of division are , from Lower Canada , the Utawas River ; from New Britain , an imaginary line separating the waters flowing into the lakes from those of Hudson 's Bay ; and , from the United /z/ States , a nominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Erie and Ontario , and their connecting streams , and thence down the middle of the River St. Lawrence to Lake St. Francis , and thence north-west and north-east to the Utawas River . In this province is exhibited one of the most sublime and magnificent of Nature 's works , by the Niagara river . The accumulated waters flowing from four great lakes and all their tributaries , are precipitated over the Falls of Niagara , the ' mightiest cataract in the world . The whole mass is poured in one tremendous plunge of 165 feet in height . The noise , tumult , and rapidity of this falling sea ; the rolling clouds of foam , the vast volumes of vapour which rise into the air , the brilliancy and variety of the tints , and the beautiful rainbows which span the abyss ; the lofty banks and immense woods which surround this wonderful scene , have been considered by experienced travellers as eclipsing every similar phenomenon . The noise is heard , and the cloud of vapours seen , at the distance of several miles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a semicircular form ; that on the American side only 310 feet , and 165 feet in height , being six or seven feet higher than the former . The one , called the Crescent or Horse-shoe Fall , descends in a mighty sea-green wave ; the other , broken by rocks into foam , resembles a sheet of molten silver . Travellers descend , with the certainty of being drenched to the skin , but without danger , to the foot of the fall , and even beneath it . There are now excellent inns on both sides of the falls , which are crowded with visitants during : the summer months . /z/ Lower Canada extends along the River St. Lawrence , on both sides , from its ' mouth to Lake St. Francis , a short distance above Montreal . A considerable part of the province extends nominally into unexplored regions that are unoccupied by i white inhabitants . At the mouth of the St. Lawrence the country is rugged and J mountainous , and the climate very severe ; but the upper and more southerly por @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with a milder climate than the I lower part . All sections , however , have the winters of Sweden , though in the j latitude of France . The summers are warm and short , and the transition from i winter to summer is very rapid , leaving scarcely more than a month for the seal son of spring . More than three-fourths of the inhabitants of the country are of French descent , and speak the French language ; they are all Catholics , and much attached to their priests : the remainder are mostly natives of Great Britain and their descendants . Education is much neglected , and the mass of the people are very ignorant and illiterate . The Quebec Mercury lately gravely proposed the establishment of a seminary for the instruction of those members of their parliament who could neither read nor write . The native French Canadians are called habitans . They are gay , satisfied with a little , and strongly attached to their religion and native country .

The countenance of the Canadian is long and thin ; his complexion sun-burnt and swarthy , inclining towards that of the Indian ; his eyes black and lively ; with lank and meagre cheeks , a sharp and prominent chin , and such easy and polite manners , as though he had always lived in the great world , rather than amid thick forests . Their intercourse with eaeh other is to the last degree affectionate , and a French Canadian village constitutes one family . Their cheerfulness , whether in prosperity or adversity , is inexhaustible , and more valuable to them than all the boasted attainments of philosophy . In winter , their dress is that of the Russians ; their social intercourse that of the age of Louis XIV . As soon as the penance of their long fast is ended , their feasting begins . The friends and relatives assemble . Turkeys , pies , and all the dainties of the season , decorate the board . Coffee is introduced .

There is a marked difference between this province and the United States in the habits of the people , their buildings , and their modes of living . An individual from the latter country , who happens to be in Canada , will be reminded by every thing about him , that he is not at home . Lower Canada is divided into four districts , which are subdivided into 40 counties , and is separated from the States of New York and Vermont by the of north latitude ; from New Hampshire and Maine , by the highlands running between the rivers which flow into the St. Lawrence , and those emptying into the Atlantic Ocean ; from New Brunswick by the River Ristigouche ; from New Britain by the ridge separating the waters of Hudson 's Bay from those of the St. Lawrence ; and from Upper Canada by the Utawas River : the outline of the province is about 2250 miles in extent . The city of Quebec , the capital of Canada , is singularly situated , half on a plain along the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top of a steep perpendicular rock , 350 feet high . These are called the Upper and Lower towns . Quebec , as a military station , is very strong ; its fortifications render it almost a second Gibraltar . It was one of the most brilliant scenes of British glory . Near it , on the plains of Abraham , Wolfe , at the cost of his life , gained the splendid victory which annexed Canada to the British empire . The population of Quebec is about 25,000 : its commerce is considerable , as all the vessels , from Britain and other foreign quarters , stop there and unload their cargoes : 1132 vessels arrived in 1835 , estimated at 323,000 tons . The town of Three Rivers , containing about 3000 inhabitants , is situated on the River St. Lawrence , 90 miles above Quebec . The commercial capital of Canada is Montreal ; it is situated immediately below the rapids , at a point where the ample stream of the Utawas flows into the St. Lawrence . Most of the business , even of Quebec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It derives a great impulse from the transactions of the Hudson 's Bay Fur Company ; and it is the centre of the commerce with the United States , carried on by Lake Champlain and the Hudson . Vessels of 600 or 700 tons can , notwithstanding some difficulties , come up to Montreal ; its wharf presents a busy scene ,  --  the tall masts of merchantmen from the Thames , the Mersey , and the Clyde , with the steam-packets which ply between Quebec and Montreal . The island of Montreal is about thirty miles in length , and seven in breadth ; it is of alluvial soil , the most fertile in Lower Canada , and also the most highly cultivated . The view over it , of fruitful fields , gay country-houses , and the streams by which it is encircled , is one of the most pleasing that can be imagined . The interior of the town is not so attractive . It is substantially , but gloomily , built of dark gray limestone , with roofs of tin , the only kind , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter ; while the windows and doors are shut in with massive plates of iron . The streets , though tolerably regular , were inconveniently narrow ; but of late several have been formed , extending the whole length of the town , that are commodious and airy . The new cathedral , opened in 1829 , is considered one of the handsomest structures in America . It is 255 feet long , 134 broad , 220 feet high in its principal front ; and it is capable of containing 10,000 persons . Two Catholic seminaries , the English church , and the general hospital , are also handsome structures . The population amounts to /z/ The village of La Prairie , on the south bank of the river , is the medium of communication between Montreal and the United States . Dorchester , on the Sorelle , is a considerable village . La Chine , above the rapids , which interrupt the navigation above Montreal , is an important depot for the interior trade . A number of townships have been formed along the northern bank of the Utawas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The country is level and fertile , but its progress is much obstructed by the number of old unimproved grants ; so that the population does not much exceed 5300 . Hull and Bytown are small improving towns on the river ; the latter on the south , and the former on the north side . /z/ The tract of country lying to the south-east of the St. Lawrence , on the borders of Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine , has of late years attracted many settlers , to whom it is known under the name of the Eastern Townships . The lands here are held in free and common soccage , and the English law prevails . The population of the townships is now about 50,000 . Stanstead and Sherbrooke are the principal towns of this fine and flourishing region . On the south side of the St. Lawrence River are the neat and thriving villages of St. Thomas and Kamouraska ; the former about 20 and the latter 90 miles below Quebec . Kamouraska is pleasantly situated , and much resorted to by the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gaspe remains to complete the description of Lower Canada . It is on the south side of the St. Lawrence , near its mouth , bordering on New Brunswick . It is a country of irregular and sometimes mountainous surface , containing numerous lakes , and watered by several rivers , of which the Restigouche is the principal . The territory is covered with dense forests , inhabited by 7000 or 8000 woodmen and fishermen , and exports some fish , oil , and timber . The cod-fishery employs 1800 men , and produces about 50,000 quintals of fish , and 20,000 barrels of oil ; and about 400O barrels of herrings , and 2000 of salmon are shipped for Quebec . Douglas , Bonaventure , and New Carlisle , are small villages of forty or fifty huts each . /z/ New Brunswick is situated to the east of the State of Maine , and to the northwest of Nova Scotia , from which it is separated by the Bay of Fundy ; on the north it has part of Lower Canada , the boundary between the two being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winding coast along the Gulf of St. Lawrence , indented by navigable bays and inlets . The country , towards the seacoast and along the St. John 's River , is level , but the western and northern parts are somewhat mountainous . This colony is still almost one magnificent unbroken forest , and under the encouragement afforded by the mother country , almost all the energies of the inhabitants are directed to the lumber trade . The borders of the rivers , where cultivated , are fertile in grass and grain , though agriculture is not yet greatly advanced . The sea-coast abounds in cod and other fish ; the River St. John 's is thronged with herring , shad , and salmon . The fisheries are a source of considerable wealth and employment to the inhabitants ; the produce of which being , with timber , the great staples of export . The town of St. Johns , on a fine harbour at the mouth of the River St. John , is the most considerable place in New Brunswick . The population is about 10,000 : in 1829 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount , from all the other ports . St. Andrews , at the head of Passamaquoddy Bay , besides its timber trade , has a considerable fishery , and contains about 5000 inhabitants . Frederickton , the seat of government , is about 85 miles up the St. John 's River , which being navigable for vessels of 50 tons , is the seat of a considerable inland trade ; the population is 1800 ; it is rather regularly built of wood , with government offices , several churches , and a college . The River Mirimichi is distinguished by the extensive forests on its banks , whence large shipments of timber are made , at the port of that name , as well as those of Chatham , Douglas , and Newcastle . This tract of country was , in October 1825 , the scene of one of the most dreadful conflagrations on record . The flames , kindled by accident at several points at once , were impelled by a violent wind , and fed always with new fuel , till they spread over about 100 miles of territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ashes the towns of Douglas and Newcastle ; nearly 200 persons are said to have perished , and more than 2000 to have been reduced to entire destitution . The natural advantages of the country , however , have enabled them to recover with surprising rapidity . New /q/ Brunswick was originally settled by German troops in the service of Great Britain , and hence its name . It was included in Nova Scotia until 1784 . Dalhousie and Bathurst , on Chaleur Bay , and Liverpool , on the east coast south of Mirimichi Bay , are 6mall villages . /z/ Nova Scotia was first settled by the French , and named by them Acadia . It was granted by James I. to Sir William Alexander , a Scottish nobleman , by whom it was called Nova Scotia ; but was not confirmed to England until 1713 . It included New Brunswick until 1784 , when it was divided into two provinces . This colony is a large peninsula , bounded on the north by the narrow strait separating it from Cape Breton and Prince Edward 's Islands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the north-west by the Bay of Fundy , which penetrates so deep as to leave only an isthmus about nine miles broad , connecting it with New Brunswick . Nova Scotia is about 280 miles long , and from 50 to 100 broad , comprising about 16,000 square miles , or upwards of 10,000,000 acres . The surface of the country is moderately uneven , and in some places hilly . The climate is cold , but healthy , and , with the progress of cultivation , is gradually ameliorating . Spring is late and irregular in its approach ; but when vegetation commences , it is very rapid , and in a few days changes the whole face of nature . On the coast the soil is generally poor , but in the interior and northern parts it is well adapted to cultivation . Wheat and other grains are raised to some extent , and large quantities of the finest potatoes . The population , in 1832 , was , including Cape Breton , about 190,000 . The inhabitants are about one-fourth Acadians , or descendants of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1200 free negroes , and some of the aboriginal race of Indians , who still adhere to their roaming and hunting habits ; the remainder of the population are mostly from different parts of the British empire . The principal exports to Europe are timber and fish , and to the West Indies and the neighbouring States , timber , provisions , coal of fine quality , gypsum and freestone . The administration of the colony is vested in a governor , council , and house of assembly . There are colleges at Halifax , Windsor , and Pictou ; also numerous schools , partly supported by government , for the instruction of the lower classes . The religious denominations are Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists , Baptists and Catholics . Halifax is the capital , situated on one of the noblests harbours in the world , I capable of containing any amount of shipping of any burthen . It was founded in I 1749 , by General Cornwallis , and has since carried on almost all the trade of the colony . During the impulse given to it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is now only 9000 . The most extensive dock-yard in British America has been formed here , where a number of ships of the line and armed vessels are always lying , either stationed here or for repairs . A considerable number of troops are always in garrison , who , with the naval officers , give it the air of a military place . Lunenburg , the chief of the German settlements , contains a population of about 2000 inhabitants , and has a brisk trade . Liverpool also carries on a considerable trade ; but Shelburn , which , at the end of the American revolutionary war , was the largest place in Nova Scotia , has sunk to a mere village . The north-eastern coast has Pictou , from which , and the neighbouring bays on this coast , is shipped the largest quantity of timber and coal . On a river ailing into the Bay of Fundy , is Annapolis , the original French capital ; but since the transference of the government to Halifax , it has sunk into a mere secondly place . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yarmouth , at its mouth , the population of which , since 1791 , has risen from 1300 to 4500 . Gypsum is the principal export /z/ Cape Breton is a large island , separated from Nova Scotia by St. George 's Gulf and the Gut of Canseau , a great part of which is not more than a mile broad . The island is about 100 miles in length , and from 30 to 80 in breadth . It is penetrated by an arm of the sea , called the Bras d'Or , which divides it nearly into two equal portions , and is throughout navigable . The surface is diversified by hills , none of which rise above 1500 feet ; and the soil is fully equal to that of the neighbouring countries . Only the coasts , including those of the Bras d'Or , have yet been cultivated ; and the population in general is in a less improved state than in the other colonies . The climate resembles that of the neighbouring countries , in the intensity of the cold in winter and of the heat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortnight 's thaw occurs often in the midst of frost and snow . Yet these variations are not disadvantageous to agriculture , which , however , is still in its infancy , the valuable cod-fishery attracting the chief industry of the people . Cape Breton , therefore , imports wheat flour , though it affords a small surplus of oats and potatoes . The exports , in 1828 , consisted of 41,000 quintals of dry , and 18,000 barrels of pickled fish . About fifty vessels , averaging fifty tons each , are annually built . There are coal mines of great value . Cape Breton has excellent harbours , and commands , in a great measure , the navigation of the St. Lawrence . Of the population , exceeding 25,000 , the most numerous portion consists of Scottish highlanders , and next to them of Acadians . The island was , in 1820 , politically united to Nova Scotia , and sends two members to the house of assembly . Louisburg , which the French carefully fortified , and made one of the principal stations in their " New France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a village of 1000 inhabitants , is all the capital which Cape Breton can boast . St. Peters , on the south coast , and Arechat , a small fishing-town on Isle Madame , are the other principal settlements . To the south-east of Nova Scotia lies Sable Island , a dangerous sand-bank in the track of vessels sailing between Europe and America . /z/ Prince Edward 's , formerly St. Johns , is a fine fertile island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence , lying nearly parallel to the coasts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick . It is 135 miles long and 34 broad . It is deeply indented by bays and inlets . The area is computed at 1,400,000 acres . The surface of the island is level , and varied only by gentle undulations . It has shorter winters than the neighbouring colonies , and is exempt from those extremes of heat and cold , and heavy fogs , which render them often so gloomy . The soil is good and well adapted to agriculture , especially wheat and oats , of which it affords a surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The population is now 35,000 , chiefly Scotch highlanders , and some Acadians , and English from Yorkshire . Charlottetown is the capital , with a population of 3500 . There are several other small towns in the island : some of them are Georgetown , Belfast , Dartmouth , Prince Town , &c.; /z/ This large island is 420 miles long and 300 broad , situated at the mouth of the Gulf of St. Lawrence , and is the most eastern part of North America . The interior of Newfoundland has never been thoroughly explored . It presents a bold and rocky shore , abounding in harbours . The soil is mostly barren , and the timber scanty and stunted . Some tracts , however , are supposed to be well fitted for pasturage . The climate is severe , and the country is frequently visited by dreary fogs and storms of sleet and snow . This island owes its importance to its cod-fisheries , which are the most valuable in the world . The fish are taken singly , with baited hooks , upon the banks , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand brought down from /q/ the tropics by the gulf stream , which also bears down on its bosom countless millions of the animal on which the fish feed . The Grand Bank of Newfoundland , situated to the eastward of the island , is the greatest , , submarine elevation known . It is from 500 to 600 miles in length , and in some places near 200 in breadth . Some distance farther from the Grand Bank , is the Outer Bank , or Flemish Cap , about 90 miles in length , by 50 wide ; and to the westward are the Green and Whale Banks . These are the great rendezvous of the codfish , and form the fishing-ground for some 2500 to 3O00 vessels , and from 35,000 to 40,000 Americans , English , and French , chiefly , however , the first and last The banks are frequently enveloped in dense fogs from April to December . So early was the value of the Newfoundland fisheries discovered , that in 1517 , only twenty years after the first voyage , upwards of fifty vessels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The British soon took the most active part , and formed colonies on the island . Their sovereignty was acknowledged by the treaty of Utrecht , which reserved , however , to the French , the right of fishing on the banks . This was confirmed in 1763 , when the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon were allowed to them to dry their fish . The Americans have the right to take fish at any three miles from the shore , and to dry them on any of the neighbouring coasts unoccupied by British settlers . The fishing season begins in April and ends in October : the business is lucrative , dangerous , and an admirable nursery for our hardy and adventurous seamen , and furnishes one of the considerable elements of our trade . Many English and French vessels are here in company . Every part of the process , from taking the hungry animals from the water , and curing the fish and delivering it in all parts of the world , is specific , and employs its specific process . The English and French dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ours , pickled , to our own ports , and dry them there , particularly at Marblehead , Gloucester , and Beverly . A great number of acres around those towns are covered with the flakes or scaffolds on which those fish are dried . A vessel with twelve men usually takes from 20,000 to 50,000 fish . The whole employment not only rears thousands of men to consider the sea their home , and storms their element , but many other thousands are employed in the business to which this gives birth ; and our share of the business , in good years , amounts to some millions of dollars . Nothing can be ' more unique than the modes of life of these men , whose abode is on the sea . They are hale , healthy , honest , intrepid , and of reckless cheerfulness of character . Newfoundland contains 80,000 inhabitants , almost entirely fishermen . St. Johns , the principal place in the island , is little more than a large fishing station , the whole shore being lined with wharves and stages for landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of which , Fort Towneend , is the residence of the governor . The houses are built mostly of wood . This construction exposed the town to a series of dreadful conflagrations , in 1816 , 1817 , 1818 , and 1837 . In one of these , ( Nov. 7 , 1817 , ) property to the amount of half a million sterling The stationary population of St. Johns is estimated at 11,000 , but varies according to the season of the year . The uninhabited island of Anticosti , in the Gulf of St. Lawrence , and the coast of Labrador , are dependencies on Newfoundland . Near its southern coast are the little islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon , belonging to France , and inhabited by fishermen . In concluding our brief account of the British possessions in North America , we may remark that there appears no disposition on the part of the parent country to neglect or abandon them . Great Britain expends large sums in constructing military works for their defence , and lends her aid to numerous plans of settle ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting and important division of the western continent . They are distinguished for the excellence of their government , the rapid increase of the population , and for the intelligence , industry , and enterprise of the inhabitants . They occupy the most valuable and productive portion of North America , and rank amongst the most powerful commercial and wealthy nations of the globe . The United States are situated between 20 ' and 40 ' N. latitude , and longitude E. , and W. longitude , extending through 29 degrees of latitude and 58 degrees of longitude , and comprise a superficial area of upwards of 2,300,000 square miles . The frontier line has a length of 10,000 miles , of which about 3600 are sea-coast , and 1200 lake-coast . A line drawn across from the Atlantic to the Pacific , through the centre , is about 2500 miles in length . So vast a region of course includes a great variety of surface , soil , and climate . It abounds in navigable rivers , and a large proportion of it is susceptible of cultivation , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , more than almost any other region of the same extent in the world : but a small portion of its surface is occupied by mountains , which , from their height or ruggedness , forbid all attempts to render them productive in the means of subsistence to man . There are no great deserts , and few barrens ; nothing like the vast sterile plains which exist in other parts of the world . The basins of the rivers are exceedingly productive : that of the Mississippi , , including the Missouri , is undoubtedly the finest valley on the globe . It is abundantly watered by streams , which not only give fertility to their borders , but are ready to waft the gifts of the soil to the ocean , and bring back to the inhabitants the products of all other climes . The soil returns an ample harvest for all that is planted in it , and the climate is favourable to almost every production of the earth that can sustain life or increase its luxuries . Though lying within the temperate zone , the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern parts , the winters are long and severe ; snow often falls to the depth of two or three feet , and the cold is so piercing as to oblige the inhabitants to make very diligent provision against it . Spring returns here in April , and in summer the heat is great . In the southern parts of the country , snow is seldom seen , ice is rarely formed in the rivers , and those fruits which shrink from a northern climate , and flourish only in warm regions , are scattered over the spil . In Georgia , the inhabitants may collect the figs which grow before the windows , and may load their tables with oranges , lemons , and other exquisite fruits that grow in their gardens and groves , while in parts of Maine , New Hampshire , and Vermont , even peaches will not flourish . Between these extremities , as in Virginia , Kentucky , Missouri , and Illinois , there is a region adapted to the wine-grape , which thrives best in places removed from both the torrid and frigid zones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two subordinate ranges of mountains , the Rocky and Alleghany , the Ozark and Green Mountains . The Rocky Mountain , or Chippewayan range , forms the great dividing ridge of North America , separating the waters which flow in opposite directions , towards the great oceans which bound the opposite sides of the continent . They are situated at , a medium distance of about 600 miles from the Pacific ; the highest rise above the line of perpetual congelation , being estimated at about 12,000 feet in height . The Alleghany , or Appalachian range , runs in a north-easterly direction from the northern part of Alabama to New-York , stretching along in uniform ridges , at the distance of from 250 to 80 miles from the sea-coast , and following its general direction . It occupies in breadth a space of from 60 to 120 miles , and separates the waters which run into the Atlantic Ocean , from those which flow into the Mississippi and its tributaries . The highest elevation in this range , and the /q/ most prominent in the Atlantic States , is Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is 6476 feet in height . The Green Mountains extend from Connecticut , through Massachusetts and Vermont , to Canada , dividing the Atlantic rivers from those of Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence . Some of the peaks of this range attain considerable elevation . In New Hampshire and Maine , are found many considerable peaks , which are not connected with any systematic range , but are scattered in detached groups . The White Mountains , in New Hampshire , are the most elevated in New England . Mount Katahdin , or Ktaadin , near the centre of the state of Maine , is the highest in that state . The view from its summit is fine and varied , and extends over 80 or 100 miles . The other principal heights in Maine are Wassataquoik Mountain , Mount Abraham , Mount Bigelow , Speckled Mountain . The Ozark Mountains extend from Texas , through the western part of Arkansas , into the lead-mine region of Missouri . Their general direction is nearly similar to that of the Alleghany range , and their altitude is supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States is washed by three seas , the Atlantic Ocean on the east , the Gulf of Mexico on the south , and the Pacific Ocean on the west . The principal bays and sounds on the Atlantic border , are Passamaquoddy Bay , which lies between the state of Maine and the British province of New Brunswick ; Massachusetts Bay , between Cape Ann and Cape Cod , on the coast of Massachusetts ; Long Island Sound , between Long Island and the coast of Connecticut ; Delaware Bay , between Cape May and Cape Henlopen , which separates New Jersey from Delaware ; Chesapeake Bay , which communicates with the ocean between Cape Charles and Cape Henry , and extends in a northern direction for 200 miles , through the states of Virginia and Maryland ; and Albemarle and Pamplico Sounds , on the coast of North Carolina . In the Gulf of Mexico , the principal bays are Chatham Bay , near the southern extremity of the peninsula of Florida ; Appalachie Bay ; and Mobile Bay , in Alabama . In the Pacific , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western coast of the United States . It separates Qudra and Vancouver 's Island from the main land , and is about 120 miles in length from north to south , and from 5 to 20 miles in width . The great lakes Superior , Huron , Erie , and Ontario , not being altogether in the United States , have been described elsewhere . The boundary between the British and American territories passes through their centre , allotting about an equal share of their vast waters to each nation . Lake Michigan is wholly within the territory of the United States . It is connected with Huron by the Strait of Michillimackinac , and is about 320 miles in length , and from 55 to 60 miles wide , with an area of 16,200 square miles . The country around the head of this lake is settling rapidly ; and the mildness of the climate , the excellence of the soil , and the probable speedy junction of its waters with those of the Mississippi , will shor.ly fill this portion of the west with population and wealth . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waters of Huron rapidly descend to the St. Clair , a shallow lake about 90 miles in circuit . Detroit River connects Lakes St. Clair and Erie . The other lakes of any magnitude in the United States are Champlain in New- York , Winnipiseogee in New Hampshire , and Moose Head in Maine . Lake Champlain separates the States of New York and Vermont , and is in extent 140 miles nearly north and south . It is connected with the Hudson river by the Champlain canal , and with the St. Lawrence river by the Sorelle , or Richelieu . Large and elegant steam-boats ply daily between Whitehall and St. John 's , Lower Canada , which touch at the principal places , and numerous travellers are constantly passing and repassing this route during the season of navigation . Lake Winnipiseogee is one of the most picturesque sheets of water in New England . It is very irregular in form , and contains a number of islands , some of which are cultivated . The lake is about 22 miles long , and from 1 to 8 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of Maine . It is of an irregular form , about 38 miles in length , and from 2 to 12 wide . The main branch /z/ of Kennebeck river flows from it . Around it , at various distances , are situated some of the highest mountains in Maine . The Rivers which water the territory of the United States are numerous , and some of them among the most important in the world . No portion of the globe possesses greater facilities for inland navigation and trade , or is more generally intersected with large and navigable streams . They may be divided into four great classes : 1st . The streams which rise on the east side of the Alleghany mountains , and flow into the Atlantic Ocean ; 2d . Those south of the Alleghany range , which discharge themselves into the Gulf of Mexico ; 3d . The Mississippi and its wide tributaries , which drain the waters of the vast valley included between the Rocky and Alleghany ranges ; and 4th . The rivers which , rising on the western declivity of the Rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Penobscot is the largest river that has its course wholly in the State of Maine . It joins the Penobscot Bay between the towns of Penobscot and Prospect . It is navigable for vessels of considerable burden to Bangor , where navigation and the tide terminate . Large quantities of timber are exported from the sea-ports on the river and bay . The course of this river is near 300 miles . Kennebeck River is , next to the Penobscot , the largest in Maine . It is the outlet of Moose Head lake , the most considerable in the State . It is navigable for vessels of 150 tons to Hallowell , 40 miles from the sea . Its whole course is about 230 miles . Connecticut River , the most important stream in New England , rises in the highlands separating the United States from Canada , and flows into Long Island Sound , after a course of upwards of 400 miles . It is navigable to Hartford for large steam-boats , and vessels of 8 feet draught ; also for small steam-boats to Wells river , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head waters of this river are elevated 1600 feet above Long Island Sound . Its banks present to the eye every variety of scenery ;  --  magnificent mountains and hills , delightful valleys and meadows , unsurpassed in beauty and fertility , and many of the most beautiful towns and villages in New England . The Hudson River rises west of Lake Champlain in numerous branches , and pursuing nearly a straight southerly course of about 320 miles , unites with the Atlantic below the city of New York . This is one of the most important rivers in the United States . The navigation and commerce on its waters are very great , and annually increasing . By means of the Erie and Champlain canals , it is connected with Lake Erie and the St. Lawrence river . It is navigable for ships of large burden to Hudson city , and for the largest steam-boats to Albany and Troy . Delaware River rises in New York , and flowing south , separates Pennsylvania from New York and New Jersey , and falls into Delaware bay , after a course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigable for vessels of the greatest burden to Philadelphia , and for small craft to the head of the tide at Trenton , above which city it is navigable 100 miles for boats of 8 or 9 tons . Susquehannah River , one of the largest in Pennsylvania , is formed by its north and west branches , which unite at Northumberland . Its north , or longest branch , rises in Otsego lake , New York , from whence to its mouth is about 460 miles . The Potomac River rises in two branches in the Alleghany Mountains , and forms , during its course to Chesapeake bay , the boundary between Virginia and Maryland . It is navigable for vessels of large burthen to Washington city . Its junction at Harper 's Ferry with the Shenandoah , is regarded as a great curiosity . Its length is about 335 miles . James River pursues a course of upwards of 400 miles , and unites with the south part of Chesapeake Bay at Hampton Roads . It is navigable for sloops to Richmond , where the Great Falls formerly presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and the river is now navigable for batteaux 230 miles above the city . Savannah River separates South Carolina from Georgia , and enters the Atlantic 17 miles below Savannah , to which city it is navigable for vessels of large burden . Steam-boats ascend the river to Augusta falls . /q/ Appalachicola , which discharges itself into the bay of the same name , in the Gulf of Mexico , is formed by the union of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers . The former is navigated to Columbus by steam-boats : on its head-waters are numerous gold-mines . The Appalachicola and Chattahoochee united , are about 425 miles in length . The Mobile River is formed by the junction of the Alabama and Tombeckbee rivers , 40 mile3 above Mobile . The head-waters of the Alabama rise in the gold- 1 region of Georgia , not far from the sources of the Chattahoochee , and after a southwest course of near 500 miles , form a junction with the Tombeckbee . Steamboats ascend to Montgomery , a distance , by the meanders of the rivers , of near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America , and one of the noblest in the world  --  watering a more fertile region , and having a larger course of unin terrupted navigation , than any other known stream . Its course  --  taken in con nexion with its mighty auxiliary , the Missouri  --  is estimated at 4490 miles in length . The space drained by its waters is supposed to exceed 1,300,000 square miles , being upwards of two-thirds of the whole territory of the United States , or about one twenty-eighth part of the terraqueous surface of the globe . In no portion of the world has the triumph of art over the obstacles of nature been so complete . The introduction of steam-navigation has been productive of immense advantages , and has been carried to a greater extent than on any other river . Mississippi proper rises west of Lake Superior , in a dreary and desolate region , amidst lakes and swamps , and , after pursuing a south-east course of about 600 miles , reaches the falls of St. Anthony , where it descends perpendicularly 16 feet , and where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then southerly direction ; and after forming the boundary between Missouri , Arkansas Territory , and Louisiana , on the west , and Illinois , Kentucky , Tennessee , and Mississippi , on the east , discharges its waters , through many mouths , into the Gulf of Mexico . It is nearly 3000 miles long , and is navigable for steam-boats to the falls of St. Anthony . The following are the principal tributaries of the Mississippi from the west :  --  The St. Peter 's , which joins it at Fort Snelling , is a stream of about 400 miles , flowing a south-east course . The Des Moines , a river of about 400 miles in length , enters the Mississippi about 130 miles above the Missouri . The Missouri enters the Mississippi river about 18 miles above St. Louis , after a course of 3217 miles . Although it loses its name at its confluence with the latter , it is much the longer stream of the two ; but the Mississippi , having been first discovered and explored , has retained its name to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy , the Missouri must be considered as a tributary of the Mississipi . It is formed of numerous branches , which rise among the Rocky Mountains , between the parallels of and N. Latitude . The most remote are the Jefferson , Madison , and Gallatin rivers . The only obstruction that occurs to its navigation is at the Great Falls , a distance of 2575 miles from the Mississippi . Here the river descends 362 feet in 18 miles : the descent is by four great pitches or cataracts , of 98 , 19 , 49 , and 26 feet , respectively . The width of the river is about 350 yards , and the cataracts are considered to be , next to those of Niagara , the grandest in the world . About 100 miles above , is the place called the Gates of the Rocky Mountains . This river was lately ascended by a steamvessel 300 miles above the Yellow Stone , a distance from the mouth of the Mississippi of 3460 miles . The largest tributaries of the Missouri are , the Yellow Stone , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , of 1600 miles course , and the Kanzas , of 1200 miles in length . They all rise in the Rocky Mountains , and flow through a flat prairie country , inhabited by a widely scattered Indian population . The Arkansas is , after the Missouri , the most considerable tributary of the Mississippi from the west . It rises in the Rocky Mountains , and its course is computed to be about 2000 miles . It enters the Mississippi river about 540 miles below the Missouri . Steam-boats can generally ascend this river to the mouth /z/ of the Canadian , its largest tributary , and occasionally to Cantonment Gibson , 640 miles from the Mississippi river . The Red River is the first tributary stream of any note which enters the Mississippi , in ascending from its mouth . It has a course of about 1500 miles , and flows through immense prairies of a red soil . The principal tributaries of the Mississippi which flow into it from the eastward are as follows :  --  Chippeway River , 200 miles in length , enters the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River joins the Mississippi about 4 or 5 miles below the town of Prairie du Chien . In part of its course it approaches so near the Fox River of Green Bay , as to leave a portage of only 1 miles . It is one of the great natural channels of communication between the lakes and the Mississippi . The Illinois River enters the Mississippi 18 miles above the Missouri , after a course of more than 400 miles . It is near a quarter of a mile wide at its mouth , and has a remarkably smooth , gentle current . The Ohio River is the largest eastern tributary of the Mississippi . At its junction , and for 100 miles above , it is as large as the parent stream . This river , from its commencement , affords the most delightful prospects . Tributaries of romantic and beautiful character come in almost at equal distances , as lateral canals . The Ohio is formed by the union of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers at Pittsburg . It flows in a south-westerly direction for 945 miles , separating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Virginia and Kentucky , and falls into the Mississippi 193 miles below the Missouri . Its current is gentle , and is nowhere broken by any considerable falls , except at Louisville , in Kentucky , - where the water descends feet in 2 miles . This obstruction is now obviated by the Louisville and Portland canal , which affords a passage to steamboats of small draft , at all seasons , to the upper parts of the river at Pittsburg . The chief tributaries of the Ohio are the Wabash , a fine navigable river , which rises in the north-east part of Indiana . It is ih length about 450 miles . The Cumberland River rises in the mountains , on the eastern boundary of Kentucky . At high water , it is navigable for boats almost to its source , and for steam-boats to Nashville at all seasons . Tennessee River is formed by the union of several large branches , which rising in the mountainous country in western Virginia and North Carolina , unite in one in the vicinity of Knoxville , enters the Ohio 46 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its entire course from the source of its longest branch , is 850 miles distant from the Ohio . It is navigable for steam-boats , in most stages of the water , to Florence , at the foot of the Muscle Shoals . This is the most important of all the tributaries of the Ohio . The Yazoo , the most southern of the principal eastern tributaries of the Mississippi , has a course of 240 miles , and discharges its waters into the Mississippi about 12 miles above the- Walnut Hills . The most considerable river on the Pacific side of the Rocky Mountains is the Columbia , or Oregon . Its head-waters interlock with the Arkansas , Rio del Norte , &c.; : it is about 1400 miles in length , its principal branches are Lewis 's or Saptin river , 1000 miles in extent ; Clark 's or Flat Head river , 700 miles long , M'Gillivray 's , Okinagan , &c.; Fort George or Astoria , Fort Vancouver , and others , on these waters , are trading establishments belonging to the British Hudson 's Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 125 miles ; and large sloops may go up to the head of tide , 183 miles from the Ocean . Minerals abound in the United States in great variety and profusion . Iron is very generally diffused , and is very abundant . Lead , limestone , and coal both of the anthracite and bituminous kind , abound in quantities supposed to be inexhaustible , especially of the former description . Gold has recently been found to a considerable amount in Virginia , North and South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , and Tennessee . The most valuable mines are in North Carolina and Georgia . It is difficult to ascertain the amount of gold found in the United States ; but the value of the metal sent to the Mint , from 1823 to 1836 , was $4,377,500 , probably /q/ not one half of the produce for that period , as large amounts of it are sent to Europe uncoined . The lead-mines of Missouri , Illinois and Wisconsin , are said to be the richest in quality in the world ; and the quantity of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , has been so great as to exclude almost entirely the foreign article from our markets . The annual produce of the Missouri mines is estimated at 3 million , and of the Illinois and Wisconsin , 8 million pounda Salt springs abound in many parts of the Union , and large quantities are manufactured in New York , Western Pennsylvania , Western Virginia , Ohio , and Illinois : it is also made from sea-water in some parts of New England . The whole amount made is stated to be about 7 million bushels . The United States form a federal republic . Each of the States is independent , and has the exclusive control of all concerns merely local ; but the defence of the country , the regulation of commerce , and all the general concerns of the confederacy , are committed , by the constitution , to a general government . The legislative power is vested in a Congress , consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives . The Senate is composed of 2 members from each State , chosen every two years , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate is renewed biennially . The number of senators is at present 52 . The members of the House of Representatives are chosen every two years , each State being entitled to a number proportionate to its population , in a ratio , in the States which do not admit of slavery , of one to every 47,700 inhabitants ; and in the States where there are slaves , of one for every 47,700 of the free white population , and one for every 79,500 of the slaves . The number of representatives is now 240 . The judiciary is composed of a Supreme Court , of one chief and six associate judges ; of 33 District Courts , of one judge each , except that six of the States are divided into two districts each ; and of 7 Circuit Courts , composed of the judge of the district , and one of the judges of the Supreme Court . The executive power is vested in a President , who , together with the VicePresident , is chosen for four years , by electors from all the States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretaries of State , of the Treasury , of War , and of the Navy , the Postmaster General , and the Attoraey General . The President must be a native-born citizen , or have been a citizen at the adoption of the constitution , of 35 years of age , and have resided in the United States 14 years . The present constitution of the United States was adopted in 1789 , and has since been amended . It secures to the people the grand principles of freedom , liberty of conscience in matters of religion , liberty of the press , trial by jury , and the right of choosing and being chosen to office . The principal executive officers are the Secretaries of State , at War , and of the Navy , the Postmaster General , and the Attorney General . They are removable at the will of the President , and , with the Vice-President , form the cabinet . Th Department of State was created in 1789 . The Secretary conducts the negotiations with foreign powers , and corresponds with the public ministers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the United States . He has the charge of the United States seal , preserves the originals of laws and treaties , and of the public correspondence growing out of the intercourse between the United States and foreign nations ; he grants passports to American citizens visiting foreign countries , has the control of the patent office , and preserves the evidence of copy-rights . There are attached to the Department of State a Diplomatic Bureau , a Consular Bureau , a Home Bureau , the Archives , and the Patent Office . The Treasury Department was created in 1789 . The Secretary superintends the fiscal concerns of the government ; he is required to report to Congress annually the state of the finances , and recommends such measures as he thinks proper for improving the condition of the revenue . The Treasury Department comprises the offices of the Secretary , two Controllers , five Auditors , the Register , the Treasurer , and the Solicitor of the Treasury . As there is at present no direct taxation by the general government , the reve- /z/ nue is chiefly derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bank-stock , post-offices , lead-mines , &c.; The revenue on imports is the most important . The receipts into the treasury of the United States during the year 1836 amounted to 47,691,898 dollars ; those from duties , 22,523,151 ; those from lands , 24,000,000 , and the residue from miscellaneous sources . The expenditures for all objects during the year are estimated at 32,000,000 dollars . Balance in the treasury on the 1st January , 1837 , 41,723,959 dollars , which , with the exception of 5,000,000 dollars , are to be transferred to the several States , in accordance with the act regulating the deposits of the public money . The second great source of revenue is the national domain , or public lands , which consists of tracts of territory ceded to the general government by the several States ; of the lands in the territory of Louisiana , purchased from France ; and those in Florida , acquired by treaty from Spain . A vast portion of this land is occupied by the Indians , who are considered as proprietors of the soil , till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office at Washington directs the sale of these territories . All the lands are surveyed before sale ; they are divided into townships of six miles square , which are subdivided into sections of one mile square , containing each 640 acres , and sold in sections , half , quarter , and half-quarter sections . The minimum price is fixed by law at a dollar and a quarter . All sales are made for cash . Salt-springs and lead-mines are reserved , but may be sold by special orders from the President . One section of 640 acres is reserved in each township , as a fund for the perpetual support of schools . Five per cent , on all sales of land are reserved , three-fifths of which are expended by Congress in making roads leading to the States in which the lands are situated , and two-fifths are expended by the States for the promotion of learning . In the year 1820 , the sales of the public lands produced 1,167,225 dollars , which had increased in 1834 to 6,099,981 , in 1835 exceeded 12,000,000 , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The increase of population in the Western States , the extensive introduction of steam-vessels on the rivers and lakes , and the increased facilities of intercourse and transportation by rail-roads and canals , have concurred with the extraordinary high price of cotton in producing this wonderful result . The whole quantity of public lands sold is 44,500,000 acres ; quantity granted for various purposes , 16,040,624 acres ; unsold , within the limits of the States and Territories , at the end of 1835 , 220,000,000 acres ; beyond those limits , 750,000,000 ; whole quantity surveyed , 122,300,000 : total cost of the lands , 58,438,824 dollars ; total receipts thus far , 64,029,496 dollars . The War Department was created in 1789 : to this department belong the direction and government of the army ; the erection of fortifications ; the execution of topographical surveys ; and the direction of Indian Affairs . Attached to it are a Requisition Bureau , a Bounty-Land Bureau , a Pension office , an office of Indian Affairs , an Engineer office , a Topographical office , an Ordnance office , &c.; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dragoons , 4 of artillery , and 7 of infantry , containing , at the commencement of 1837 , an aggregate amount of 6283 men , including a corps of Engineers , Topographical Engineers , and Ordnance department ; the whole being under the command of a Major General and two Brigadier Generals . The expenditure of the year 1836 , for the military service , including fortifications , ordnance , Indian affairs , pensions , arming the militia , and internal improvements , was 20,322,083 dollars and 19 cents . The office of Secretary of the Navy was created in 1798 ; and there is a Board of Navy Commissioners , established in 1815 , attached to the department . The navy , though on a small scale , acquired great reputation during the three years ' war , when the American ships successfully encountered those of the mistress of the ocean . Much has since been done , both in enlarging the number of vessels , and extending and constructing suitable dock-yards ; but the naval force is not considered adequate to the exigencies of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 ships of the line , 16 frigates , 2 barques , 1 steam frigate , 14 sloops of war , 2 brigs , and 5 schooners . Of the above , there are on the stocks , 5 ships of the line , 7 frigates , 2 barques , 1 steam frigate , and 1 schooner : total 16 . In ordinary , 7 ships of the line , 4 frigates , and 5 sloops of war : total 16 . In /q/ commission , 1 ship of the line , 5 frigates , 9 sloops of war , 2 brigs , and 4 schooners ; total 21 : besides materials for 4 ships of the line , 8 frigates , and 6 sloops of war . The naval appropriation for the year 1837 was 5,167,290 dollars , and for the surveying and exploring expedition , 346,431 dollars . There are seven navy yards belonging to the United States , viz. : at Portsmouth ; at Charlestown , in Boston Harbour ; at Brooklyn , on Wallabout Bay , opposite New-York ; at Philadelphia ; at Washington ; at Gosport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are graving or dry-docks at Charlestown and Gosport , and a third is constructing at Brooklyn . The General Post Office is under the superintendence of a Postmaster General , who has the appointment of the postmasters throughout the country , and the power of making contracts for carrying the mail . The post routes cover an extent of 118,264 miles , on which the mails are carried 27,578,620 miles a year . The number of post-offices is 11,100 ; the revenue of the department for the year 1835 was 3,398,455 dollars ; the expenditure , 2,755,623 dollars , 75 cents . The office of the Mint of the United States was established at Philadelphia in 1792 , and in 1835 an act was passed for establishing a branch in New Orleans , for the coinage of gold and silver , and branches at Charlotte , North Carolina , and Dahlonega , Georgia , for the coinage of gold ; the general direction being under the control of the Director of the Mint at Philadelphia . The coinage is executed by machines propelled by steam-power ; the value vf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprising 2,186,175 dollars in gold coins , 3,444,003 in silver , and 39,489 in copper , making 15,996,342 pieces of coin ; and in the year 1836 , from January 1st to November 1st , the coinage amounted to 6,496,440 dollars , of which the gold was 3,619,440 , and silver 2,877,000 dollars . The chief agricultural occupations in the eastern states are grazing and the dairy . The middle " states are principally devoted to the cultivation of wheat and Indian corn ; the southern to that of tobacco , cotton , sugar , and rice ; and the western to Indian corn and wheat . Slave labour is chiefly employed in the southern and in some of the middle and western states . The cotton crop , in 1836 , was estimated at 480 million pounds , of the value of 80 million dollars . Tobacco 80,000 hogsheads , of the value of 6 million dollars ; of rice to the amount of million dollars ; and of sugar and molasses , of the former 100,000 hogsheads , and of the latter 63,000 hogsheads . The amount of wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , it is impossible to estimate with any degree of certainty , but it no doubt amounts to several million barrels . The manufactures of the United States are considerable , and gradually increasing . The eastern and middle states , which are most abundantly supplied with water-power , are most extensively engaged in manufactures , especially of cotton , woollen , iron , glass , paper , wood , &c.; In 1810 , the value of manufactures in the United States was estimated at $172,762,676 . The present annual value is computed at $350,000,000 ; and the capital invested in all the manufactories of the Union is estimated at more than 1000 millions . Most of the American manufactures are designed for home consumption ; yet , in 1834 , domestic manufactures were exported to the amount of $8,567,590 . The manufactures of cotton goods amount to about 50 millions of dollars ; woollen 70 millions ; leather and its manufactures 45 millions ; hats , caps , bonnets , &.c.; 15 millions ; cabinet-ware 10 millions ; cables and cordage , paper and glass-ware , each 6 millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco and refined sugar , each about 2 millions of dollars . In 1810 there was above 20 million gallons of spirituous liquors distilled from corn and rye , and upwards of 5 million from molasses ; and , although it is stated that , in 1835 , 4000 distilleries had been stopped by the progress of the temperance reform , vast quantities of these poisonous liquors are still prepared . The commerce of the United States is , next to that of Great Britain , the largest in the world . It consists principally in the exchange of agricultural produce , for the manufactures of other countries , and the productions of tropical climates . All vessels engaged in the foreign trade are registered by the collector of the district to which they belong , and those employed in the coasting trade and fisheries are /z/ enrolled and licensed by the same officer . At the commencement of the year 1835 there was of registered tonnage 857,438 , including 108,060 tons employed in the whale-fishery ; the enrolled and licensed tonnage amounted to 783,618 , and fishing-vessels 117,850 ; total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built in the United States , registered tonnage 52,622 , and of enrolled tonnage 65,707 ; total 118,330 : the number of vessels built amounted to 957 , including 88 steam-boats . The number of vessels and tonnage entering the ports of the United States , dining the year 1835 , was 11,292 vessels , amounting to 1,993,963 tons ; of which 7023 vessels , and 1,352,653 tons were American , and 4269 vessels , of 641,310 tons , foreign : cleared , during the same period , 11,515 vessels , of 2,031,341 tons ; of which 7285 vessels , and 1,400,517 tons , were American , and 4230 vessels , of 630,824 tons , were foreign . The value of the imports of the year 1836 , ending on the 30th of , September , is estimated at 173,540,000 dollars ; showing an increase , compared with the preceding year , of 23,644,258 dollars . The exports , during the same period , are estimated at 121,789,000 dollars ; of which 101,105,000 dollars were domestic products , and the residue foreign ; exhibiting an aggregate increase , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount exceeding the average of the last three years by 5,829,150 dollars . The most important article of export is cotton ; of which there were sent to Europe , in 1835 , of the value of 64,961,302 dollars ; of tobacco there was exported 8,250,577 dollars ; of flour , wheat , corn , rye-meal , rice , &c.; 8,383,977 dollars ; of cod-fish and the produce of the fisheries , 2,174,524 dollars ; of staves , shingles , naval stores , oak bark , &c.; 4,542,091 dollars ; of beef , pork , horses , and mules , and other agricultural products , 2,901,896 dollars ; of cotton goods , 2,858,681 dollars ; the other principal articles of export are skins and furs , flax-seed , soap and candles , manufactures of leather , of iron , of household furniture , &c.; &c.; Most of the fisheries are carried on from the New England states , and in New England ships . The whale-fishery is prosecuted in the Atlantic ocean , chiefly south of the line , for the right or black whale , and in the Southern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the year 1835 , 108,060 tons of shipping were employed in this business ; and in the course of the year 1835 , spermaceti and whale oil was brought home , of the value of about 6,500,000 dollars . Seal oil and furs are also obtained in the Antarctic seas by these adventurous seamen . The fishery is carried on chiefly from the ports of Nantucket and New Bedford , and also , but on a less scale , from New London , Sag Harbour , Warren , Bristol , Hudson , &c.; About 10,000 men are engaged in it , and the seamen are paid , not by fixed wages , but by a certain share in the profits of the voyage . Those in the Pacific and Southern oceans are generally absent from two to three years at a time . The cod-fishery is pursued on the banks and coasts of Newfoundland , and on the Labrador coasts . It employs upwards of 60,000 tons of small craft , some of which make several trips a year ; those on the coast-fisheries generally remain longer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1,500,000 dollars a year . The mackerel fishery employs about 50,000 tons of shipping , and produces about 2,000,000 dollars annually . No part of the world presents such an extensive river commerce . Steam vessels , a grand improvement , first introduced in America , ply on all the principal streams , and of upwards of 100,000 tons of this species of craft belonging to the United States in 1834 , almost the whole was on the interior waters . On the Mississippi and its tributaries alone , aa extent of 8000 miles was traversed by 230 steam-boats . Neither the States nor individuals have been slow in improving and extending these natural advantages ; and the spirit with which they have undertaken , and the perseverance they have shown in executing the most magnificent plans , have shed a lustre on the American name . The great land-locked bays of the coast have been connected by a chain of canals , affording a safe internal water-route from Narragansett Bay to Albemarle Sound . The eastern and western waters have been united by several channels , which either turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lakes and the Mississippi /q/ have been connected at various points , and the obstacles in the navigation of the most important rivers have been overcome by removing the bars or ledges which obstructed their channels , or by side-cuts , locks , and dams . The whole length of this artificial navigation is not less than 3500 miles ; all of which , with one or two trifling exceptions , has been executed in the short space of 20 years . These great works have already given fresh life to manufactures , and encouraged the establishment of new ones ; invigorated , and in many places created , internal trade ; promoted agriculture , which requires a cheap and easy transportation for the bulky articles which it consumes and produces ; and developed , in an astonishing degree , the mining industry of the country . The Americans have equally surpassed all other people in the number and extent of their rail-roads , having , in less than ten years , constructed nearly 1500 miles of these artificial levels , over which carriages are propelled by locomotive steam-engines at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although this contrivance is less adapted than canals to the conveyance of bulky articles , yet it possesses some advantages over that mode of transportation , such as that of not being interrupted by ice , and of being suited to certain localities in which artificial water-communication would be impracticable . To the State Governments is committed that branch of legislation which relates to the regulation of local concerns . These bodies make and alter the laws which regard property and private rights , appoint judges and civil officers , impose taxes for State purposes , and exercise all other rights and powers not vested in the Federal Government by positive enactment . They are , in their composition , very similar to the Federal Government . The legislature consists always of two branches , both of which are returned by the same electors ; and these electors may be said to comprise the whole adult white population , the usual qualifications being citizenship , with one or two years ' residence , and payment of taxes . In North Carolina , representatives are chosen by the whole resident free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in New Jersey and Virginia , the right of suffrage for both houses is limited to persons holding a small amount of landed property ; in Maryland the senators are chosen by delegates named for the purpose by the people . In all the States , the period for which the representatives serve is either one or two years . The elections are biennial in Delaware , South Carolina , Tennessee , Louisiana , Illinois , Missouri , and Arkansas , and annual in the other States . The shortest period for which the senators serve , in any State , is one year , and the longest five . In Maine , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New Jersey , North Carolina , and Georgia , the senators hold their office for one year only ; in Ohio , Tennessee , and Michigan , for two years ; in Mississippi , Alabama , and Indiana , for three years ; in New York , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Virginia , South Carolina , Kentucky , Louisiana , Illinois , Missouri , and Arkansas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Except in Maryland , when the Senate of any State serves for more than one year , it is renewed by parts or divisions , one-third of the members going out annually when they serve for three years , and one-fourth when they serve for four . In some cases , however , when the senators serve for four years , the renewal is by halves every two years . The United States are more distinguished for the general diffusion of knowledge , than for eminence in literature or science . The means of common education are widely extended , and there are numerous seminaries of learning throughout the country , though there are no literary establishments on so large a scale as many in Europe . As a general government , the United States have done but little for the interests of public instruction , except that they reserve for this purpose one section in every township of their new lands , besides other reservations for colleges . This highly important subject has , perhaps , been better attended to , by being left ta the individual States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England paid a very laudable attention to this important subject . As early as 1628 , a law was passed for the instruction of every child in the colonies ; and /z/ in 1647 , a school was established by law in every town or neighbourhood of 50 families , and a school for the higher branchss , for every 100 families . The number of colleges in the United States is 68 ; of medical schools 23 ; of law schools 9 ; of theological seminaries 37 . The country does not yet , however , furnish the scholar with those facilities for a finished learned education which are afforded by the scientific and literary establishments of Europe , and the want of good libraries is sensibly felt by every one who has attempted much learned research . The largest collection of books in the United States does not contain 50,000 volumes , and there are few which even approach that number . The Philadelphia Library has 42,000 volumes ; the Cambridge University Library about the same number ; the Boston Athenreum 30,000 ; the New-York Society Library 22,000 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of the Union have made some legislative provision for com . mon school instruction , and in some States ( especially in Massachusetts , Connecticut , New- York , and Virginia ) , large funds are set apart for this purpose . Private schools and academies of the higher order are quite numerous , especially in New England ; so that few grow up without enjoying the means of elementary instruction , or , if they desire it , of a more extended liberal education . In the Sabbath-schools of the United States , which are doing much for the intellectual as well as moral improvement of the young , about 600,000 children are weekly instructed by more than 80,000 teachers . There is no established church in the United States , religion being left to the voluntary choice of the people . No sect is favoured by the laws beyond another ; it being an essential principle in the national and state governments , that legislation may of right interfere in the concerns of public worship only so far as to protect every individual in the unmolested exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for the support of religion , except that , in Massachusetts , the legislature is enjoined to require , and in New Hampshire is empowered to authorize , the several towns and parishes to make adequate provision , at their own expense , for the support of Protestant ministers . The same was the case in Connecticut , until 1818 , when it was abolished by the new constitution . But in all the other States , the support of religion is left entirely to the voluntary zeal of its professors . The numbers of established churches , or congregations , are estimated at over 15,000 , and the ministers at about 12,000 . The Presbyterians , including Congregationalists , are the most numerous denomination . The Baptists are estimated as second in numerical amount ; and the Methodists , Episcopalians , Roman Catholics , Universalists , Lutherans , Christians , German Reformed , and Friends or Quakers , probably rank in point of numbers in the order in which they are mentioned . Other sects , respectable in amount of numbers , are Unitarians , Associate and other Methodists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cumberland Presbyterians , Tunkers , and many others . In fact , almost all the sects of Christianity are represented in our country . There are no early enumerations of the population on which much reliance can be placed ; but , in 1753 , the number was estimated at 1,051,000 . A regular decennial census , taken since 1790 , gave , at that period , 3,929,827 ; in 1800 , 5,305,925 ; in 1810 , 7,239,814 ; in 1820 , 9,638,131 . It is most interesting to consider , as the immensity of unoccupied land leaves full scope for this power of multiplication , how vast the future numbers may be with which this region will be peopled , and which will render it much the greatest state that ever existed in ancient or modern times . It is calculated , upon good grounds , that in a century it will contain 160,000,000 ; and still , being only half as . populous as Britain or France , leave ample scope for future increase . The Americans , should they continue united , would then become the greatest nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe would rank as secondary to them . The population , exclusive of the aboriginal races within the United States ' limits , whose numbers are not comprised in the above statements , consists of three classes : whites , free coloured persons , and slaves , whose relative proportions at five different periods are here given : /z/ Whites . Slaves . Free coloured . /z/ In regard to these numbers it is to be observed that in the census of 1790 , are not included the inhabitants of the Mississippi and Northwest Territories , estimated at about 12,000 ; and that between 1800 and 1810 , Louisiana was acquired with about 50,000 inhabitants , and 39,000 Africans were brought into the country . The following statement shows the relative rate of increase of the whole population , and of each of the three classes , in the two periods from 1810 to 1820 , and from 1820 to 1830. /z/ Increase of whole population 33.3 per cent 33.4 per cent Whites 34 33.9 Slaves 28.6 30.6 Free Blacks 24.8 37.4 Blacks 28.5 31.5 Maine ... .

Arkansas . .. . qwq /z/ The whole number of Aborigines existing at present within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States , is estimated at 333,464 , of whom about 80,000 reside west of the Rocky Mountains , and the residue east of that region . Of the Indians residing east of the Rocky Mountains , 57,433 are east of the Mississippi river , of whom 48,918 are under treaty stipulations to remove westward of that stream , 45,690 have removed from the east to the west side of the Mississippi , and are settled in the Western or Indian territory , assigned to them by the government of the United States ; and 143,750 are indigenous Indians , nowise under the control of our government : of these , the principal are the Sioux , Pawnees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assiniboines . The most humane exertions have constantly been in operation , on the part of the general government , to preserve the race from extinction , by severe provisions to prevent their obtaining ardent spirits , and by unwearied efforts to train them to the arts and agriculture , and to impart to them the blessings of education and Christianity . Under the system adopted by the government , agents and sub-agents , interpreters and mechanics , are employed among the different Indian tribes , to carry these purposes into effect ; and the President is authorized to cause the stores of the licensed traders to be searched , and if ardent spirits are found among the articles for sale , the whole goods are forfeited to the government . The whole number of Indian schools established among them , partly by charitable associations of the different religious denominations , and partly by pecuniary aid from the government , is 51 . The sum of 7840 dollars was allowed in 1836 , by the government , for the maintenance of these schools . The whole number of Indian children receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Choctaw Academy , in Kentucky , the expense of whose education is derived from funds set apart by the Indians themselves , under treaty stipulations for this specific object . In the whole number of scholars are included two students of law at the Choctaw Academy , also one at Buffalo , and one in Vermont . The territory of the confederacy is at present divided into twenty-six States , j two Territories , and one Federal District , which contains the seat of government . This does not include the extensive tract assigned to the Indians , called the Western Territory , the region west of the Missouri and north of the Platte , and that west of the Rocky Mountains , in which there is no white population , and which ; has received no political organization or official name , The States are divided for municipal purposes into small sections , styled counties , except in South Carolina , where they are called districts , and in Louisiana , where they are called parishes . In the States of New England , in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan , the counties are subdivided into townships , often called towns , and in Delaware into hundreds , /z/ New England comprises the six States situated east of the Hudson , viz. , Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , and Connecticut . The inhabitants are almost exclusively of unmixed English origin , and though never united as a political whole , they have at different periods been connected for their common interests . From the earliest settlement of their country , they have enjoyed peculiar advantages for literary and religious instruction , and , trained to habits of industry , economy , and enterprise , by the circumstances of their peculiar situation , as well as by the dangers of prolonged wars , they present traits of character which are considered as remarkable abroad as they are common at home . The surface of the country is infinitely varied . In the interior , it is mountainous , with fertile valleys between . The land along the sea-shore presents in general an irregular surface , consisting of hills and ridges , with flats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost constant sue- /z/ cession of short hills and narrow valleys . There are no extensive plains throughout the whole of New England . Much of the 6oil is good , yet in general it requires diligent cultivation , and compels the farmer to use great industry to procure tolerable crops ; and although it well repays the labour of the husbandman , it is on the whole less fruitful than many other parts of the United States . Most of the New England States are largely engaged in manufactures . The different establishments of various kinds are too numerous to specify . The cotton factories , in particular , employ a vast number of hands and a great amount of capital . A proof of the result of these great establishments may be found in the fact that twenty-five years ago the chief cottons of the United States were imported from India . New England now sends her manufactured cottons there , and finds the trade profitable . Since the manufacturing system has prevailed , this part of the Union has rapidly increased in population and business . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fisheries . This pursuit employs many thousands of hands , furnishes one of the most important items in this section of the United States , and trains vast numbers of the most experienced and intrepid mariners in the world . An active commerce is carried on from the ports of New England with all parts of the world ; their ships spread their sails in every sea , and her lumber manufactures and the produce of her fisheries are extensively exported . Almost every village carries on some handicraft , and the fanner often employs the long winter evenings in some gainful task . Thus are produced many little objects which although in appearance of small value , yet in the aggregate constitute a source of considerable wealth to the community , and are produced to such an extent as almost to rival in value the products of the large manufacturing establishments . From the first settlement of the country , the inhabitants of New England have been a religious people . The entire freedom of opinion enjoyed by them has led to a diversity of religious denominations . In almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to the different sects common in the country , among which are Congregationalists , Baptists , Episcopalians , Methodists , Unitarians , &.c.; It is disreputable for a man to have no religious belief , and there are few who do not give their support to some one mode of religious worship . The sabbath is strictly observed , and the people generally attend public worship twice during the day . Education is more universal here than in any part of the world . It is exceedingly hard to find persons of mature age who have not been instructed in the common branches of school learning . Institutions of learning and education were established at an early period by the first settlers of New England , some of which at the present day are the most respectable and efficient in the Union . A large part of the distinguished men of the United States have been educated at Harvard and Yale colleges , and though there are many similar institutions in other States , still many students from the south and west are annually taught in the colleges of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing . In 1700 it was about 120,000 , and in 1755 was estimated at 345,000 , not including the troops at that time in the provinces . Their amount in 1820 was 1,659,854 ; in 1830 , 1,954,609. and is now probably above 2,300,000 souls . /z/ Maine is the most northern and eastern of the United States . Previous to the year 1820 , it formed a part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , at which period it was received into the Union as an independent State . Maine is in length from north to south about 210 miles , and from east to west 162 ; the area is differently estimated at from 32,000 to 35,000 square miles . On the sea-coast , the country is generally level ; at some distance in the interior , hilly ; and in the central parts of the State are many mountains of considerable elevation . /z/ The principal rivers are the St. Johns , with its branches , the Allagash , Walloostook , and the Aroostook ; with the Penobscot , Kennebeck , Androscoggin , Saco , Pleasant , Damariscotta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably indented with bays and inlets , which afford great facilities for navigation and commerce . The principal are Casco , Penobscot , Frenchman 's , Englishman 's , Machias , and Passamaquoddy bays . The lakes are so numerous , that it is estimated one-sixth of the surface of the State consists of water , and indeed they form one of the characteristic features of the country . Some of them are remarkable for their picturesque beauties , and many of them will no doubt be useful mediums of communication when their vicinity is more populous . The most noted are Moosehead , Umbagog , Sebago , the Schoodic Lakes , and Lake Chesuncook . The soil on the coast is various , and of but moderate fertility : in the interior , most of the land is more productive , and some of it , especially on the Kennebeck and Penobscot rivers , is fertile , and well adapted to agriculture and grazing . One of the most important productions of this State is white-pine timber , which is found chiefly on the Upper Kennebeck and Penobscot rivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tract of country yielding this lumber to any considerable extent in the Atlantic States , the lands producing it have lately much advanced in price . The value of the lumber cut and sawed annually is estimated at $10,000,000 ; the yearly amount of the wool grown , $2,000,000 ; and of lime manufactured in the State , $1,000,000 . The total shipping belonging to the State amounts to 225,329 tons , and about 50,000 tons are annually built . The value of imports in the year 1835 was $883,389 ; of exports , $1,059,367 , of which all but $14,416 was of domestic produce . The constitution makes it the duty of the legislature to require the several towns to make suitable provision , at their own expense , for the support of public schools , and to encourage and suitably endow academies , colleges , and seminaries of learning . In pursuance of this provision , each town is required by law to raise annually a sum equal to forty cents for each inhabitant , which is distributed among the town schools in the ratio of the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the State in aid of their support . There are in the State 30 academies , a Baptist college at Waterville , a Congregational ist theological seminary in Bangor , a Wesleyan theological seminary at Readfield , and Bowdoin College , with a medical school , at Brunswick . The number of pupils in the common schools is about 15,000 . The principal religious denominations are Baptists , Congregationalists , and Methodists ; there are also Friends , Universal ists , Roman Catholics , Episcopalians , &c.; All of the towns are in the southern part of the State , in which , indeed , nearly the whole of the population is concentrated . There are some settlements on the St. Johns , in the northern part , which is , however , at present under British jurisdiction , and through which there is a road leading from Frederickton , in New Brunswick , to the River St. Lawrence . The central part is almost wholly uninhabited , and covered with primitive forests , which are visited only by hunters and lumberers . A rail-road from the coast-section of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route has been ascertained to be from Belfast ; distance 277 miles , cost 5,000,000 dollars . Maine is divided into 10 counties . /z/ In 1765 20,788 increase . 1790 96,540 From 1765 to 1790 75,752 1800 151,719 1790 to 1800 55,179 1810 228,705 1800 to 1810 76,986 1820 298,335 1810 to 1820 69,630 1830 399,455 1820 to 1830 101,120 Of the above population of 1830 , were , white males , 200,687 ; white females , 197,591 .

It is beautifully situated on Casco Bay , is well laid out and handsomely built , and has a safe and capacious harbour , which is defended by two forts . Upwards of 40,000 tons of shipping belong to the port , and the duties collected exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a court-house , theatre , an athenaeum , with a public library ; and the population , which in 1830 was 12,601 , is now believed to exceed 16,000 . The city of Bangor , the most important place on the Penobscot , has trebled its population since 1830 : it is at present about 8000 . From 300 millions to 400 million feet of lumber , are said to be annually exported from this place . Augusta , the capital of the State , occupies both sides of the Kennebeck river , 50 miles from its mouth : it contains a handsome State-House of granite , and an United States Arsenal . Below Augusta , are Hallowel , and Gardiner , both flourishing towns ; and at the head of ship navigation , and about 15 miles from the sea is Bath , noted for its ship-building . From Thomaston is exported large quantities of lime , marble and granite . Some of the other principal towns in Maine , are Eastport , Machias , Calais , Orono , Belfast , Brunswick , Saco , and York . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; on the east , by Maine and the Atlantic Ocean ; south by Massachusetts ; and west by Vermont . It is in length , from north to south , about 160 miles ; and from east to west , 70 is about the average breadth . It is , in area , 8,500 square miles . The sea-coast of this State , from Piscataqua Harbor to the south boundary , is but 18 miles in extent . The country on the coast is level : in the interior , the surface is greatly diversified by hills and valleys , and contains several mountains of considerable height ; among which are the White Mountains , the most elevated of any in the New England States . The other considerable elevations are , Moosehillock , Monadnock , Kearsarge , Sunapee , Ossipee , &c.; The White Mountains are distinguished by the names of Washington , Franklin , Adams , Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , and Pleasant . Mount Washington is 6,428 feet in height . They are covered with snow ten months in the year , and are often seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any intermediate land , although they are at least 65 miles in the nearest direction from the coast . The wild and sublime character of their scenery , causes them to be annually visited by numerous travellers . The ascent to their summits is attended with considerable fatigue , but has been surmounted in a few instances by ladies . The view is rendered uncommonly grand and picturesque , by the magnitude of the elevation , the extent and variety of the surrounding scenery , and above all , by the huge and desolate piles of rocks extending to a great distance in every direction . In the western pass of these mountains , there is a remarkable gap called the Notch , which is esteemed one of the grandest natural curiosities in the United States . To an admirer of the wonders of nature , the passage through the Notch , and the views from the summit , afford a rich repast . Though inferior to the Andes or the Alps in elevation , yet they display the grandest mountain scenery , surpassing everything of the kind to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England have their origin , either wholly or in part , in this State . These are , the Connecticut , Merrimack , Androscoggin , Saco , and Piscataqua . The other most considerable streams are , the Upper and Lower Amonoosuck , Sugar River , Ashuelot , Contoocook , Magallaway , and Nashua . The principal Lakes are the Winnipiseogee , Umbagog , Ossipee , Sunapee , Squam , and Newfound Lake . The inhabitants of New Hampshire are principally engaged in agriculture : the chief products are Indian corn , wheat , rye , oats , barley , flax , &c.; and horses and cattle , beef , pork , butter , cheese , &e.; are largely exported . There are some large manufacturing establishments , chiefly in the southern part of the State . /z/ In 1833 , there were in New Hampshire 60 cotton , and 32 woollen mills , 609 grist-mills , 952 saw-mills , 19 oil-mills , 15 paper-mills , 234 fulling-mills , and 236 earding-mills . Manufactures are also carried on in families to a considerable extent , and some vessels are employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants leave the State every year in search of employment . The mineral resources of New Hampshire are not great . Copper is found at Franconia , and iron is abundant in Lisbon and Franconia ; plumbago or black lead also occurs in several places , particularly at Bristol . A fine-grained granite , which is quarried in many places , affords an excellent building material . The forest affords abundance of excellent timber , and the white pine sometimes attains the height of 200 feet , with a straight trunk six feet and upwards in diameter . About eight miles from the coast are the Isles of Shoals , belonging partly to New Hampshire and partly to Maine . They lie between Portsmouth and Newburyport , and are hardly more than a cluster of rocks rising above the water . The inhabitants are about one hundred ; they live solely by fishing , ' and in connexion with those of the shore in their immediate neighbourhood , who follow the same mode of life , are the most rude and uncivilized beings in New England , except the Indians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they have now a meeting-house , school , &c.; Common schools are established by law throughout the State , and are supported in part by town taxes , in part by school lands or funds arising from the sale of them , and belonging to the towns , and in part also by the proceeds of certain State taxes ; the number of school-houses in the State somewhat exceeds 1600 ; and there are 35 academies , attended by about 1600 pupils . Dartmouth college , in Hanover , is a well endowed institution , and affords instruction in the common branches taught in the New England colleges . The principal religious denominations are Congregationalists , Baptists , and Methodists , with some Friends , Presbyterians , Episcopalians , and Roman Catholics . /z/ In 1701 , . . /z/ In 1790 , . . /z/ From 1790 to 1800 , . . /z/ 1800 to 1810 , . . /z/ 1810 to 1820 , . . /z/ 1820 to 1830 , .. /z/ Of the above population of 1830 , there were , white Males , 131,184 ; white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind , 105 ; aliens , 410 .

Portsmouth , the only sea-port , and the largest town in the State , is pleasantly situated on the Piscataqua , three miles from the sea . It has one of the finest harbours in the world , affording 40 feet of water in the channel at low tide , and being easily accessible to vessels of the largest size , and completely landlocked . It is protected by several forts . The tides rise ten feet . The town stands on a peninsular elevation , sloping towards the harbour , and is well built . It contains seven churches , seven banking-houses , the county buildings , &c,; and is well supplied with good water brought from the neighbourhood . Two wooden bridges have been built across the Piscataqua , one of which is 1750 feet long . There is here a navy-yard belonging to the United States , situated on Navy Island , on the east side of the river , and within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Concord , the capital of the State , on the west side of the Merrimack river , is handsomely built on two principal streets ; has the State-House , and State Prison of granite , besides banks , churches , hotels , &.c.; ; population 3727 . In the southeast part of the State , are several towns largely engaged in manufactures : these are , Dover , Somersworth , Newmarket , and Exeter , which , besides its mills and manufactures , contains Phillips 's Academy , a well known and respectable Seminary . These are all on navigable rivers , furnishing fine mill-seat3 and constant /z/ communication with the sea . Nashua , near the south line of the State , contains several large cotton mills ; its population in 1836 was 5065 , having rather more than doubled it since 1830 : Hanover , the seat of Dartmouth college , Haverhill and Lancaster , are towns of between 2000 and 3000 inhabitants ; and Amherst and Keene are neat thriving towns between the Merrimack and Connecticut rivers . /z/ Vermont Is bounded N. by Lower Canada ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by New York ; from which it is separated , in part , by Lake Champlain . It is 157 miles in length , from north to south ; 90 miles in breadth on the northern , and 40 on the southern boundary ; and contains an area of 10,212 square miles , or 6,535,680 acres . The Green Mountains , from which the state derives its name , on account of the evergreens with which they are covered , occupy a large part of the State ; and most of its surface is uneven . The range passes through its whole length , about half-way between Lake Champlain and the Connecticut river . From these mountains , many streams take their rise : the most important are , Otter creek , Onion river , La Moile , and Missisque , which empty into Lake Champlain , on the west ; the White , Pasumpsic , and West rivers , which flow into the Connecticut , on the east . The scenery of this State is romantic , and beautiful ; the air pure , and healthful ; and the natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile ; and all sorts of grain , suited to the climate , are produced in great abundance . Dark , rich , and loamy , it is admirably calculated to pustain drought ; and affords the finest pasturage of any State in the Union . Wool is becoming an important product here . Cattle of various kinds are raised , with great facility ; and nowhere is finer beef to be seen , than is fed on the rich white clover pastures of Vermont . The butter and cheese are universally known for their excellence . Vermont is entirely in the interior ; yet , by the system of internal improvement , the Champlain Canal , and the Lake , vessels and steam-boats have brought her territory in contiguity with the sea . Part of the trade goes by canal to Albany , and part down the Lake to Montreal : much of that which formerly went to Boston and Hartford , is now drawn by the Champlain Canal to New York . This canal has been of incalculable advantage to the State . Iron occurs in great abundance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyrites , is found at Strafford and Shrewsbury , from which three million pounds of copperas are annually manufactured , worth from 60,000 to 75,000 dollars . About 20 cotton-mills produce annually three and a half million yards of cloth , and 112,000 pounds of yarn . Domestic fabrics of linen and woollen are made in almost every family . In 1836 the Constitution was amended by the establishment of two houses , styled the Senate and House of Representatives . The Legislative Houses , the Governor , Lieutenant-Governor , and Executive Council , are chosen annually by the people . Each town has a right to send one Representative to the General Assembly . The Judges are chosen annually by that body . The Council of Censors is chosen once every seven years , for the term of one year , by popular vote . It is their duty to examine whether there have been any violations of the Constitution , and whether the Legislative and Executive branches have done their duty , and alsoto propose any alterations in the Constitution . The towns are divided into school districts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school at least three months during the year . An annual tax is levied for their support , and the rent of the reserves of school land in each township , called , here the school rights , is also distributed among the districts in proportion to the number of children in each , to aid in the same purpose . Tho number of the school districts is 1612 . There are 30 academies and county grammar /z/ schools , for the support of which similar reservations were made ; and the University of Vermont , at Burlington , is endowed in the same way . Middlebury college has been founded by private funds . These institutions are attended by nearly 200 students , and there is a Medical School connected with the former . The most numerous religious denominations are , the Congregational ists , Baptists , and Methodists ; and there are some Episcopalians , Christians , Universalists , and Roman Catholics . The State is divided into 13 counties . /z/ In 1790 85,539 /z/ From 1790 to 1800 68,826 1800 to 1810 , 63,430 1810 to 1820 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1830 , there were , white Males , 139,986 ; white Females , 139,790 ; deaf and dumb , 153 ; blind , 51 ; aliens , 3,364 . Total , 279,776.  --  Coloured Males , 426 ; Females , 455 . Total , 881 . The capital of the State is the little town of Montpelier , situated in a wild and rugged region , at the junction of the north and south branches of the Onion River . Here is a handsome State-House of granite , recently erected , together with the public buildings of the county . The population of the town is 1792 . West of the mountains are several flourishing towns , which enjoy the advantage of an easy communication with Lake Champlain , and through it with the Hudson and St. Lawrence . St. Albans is a neatly built town on a small bay , with an active and increasing trade , and containing 2375 inhabitants . Further south is Burlington , the largest town in the State , and the principal commercial place on the lake . It is pleasantly situated on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an excellent harbour . Here are the county buildings and the University of Vermont , and at the falls of the Onion River there are some manufactories . The population is 3526 . The city of Vergennes , with 1000 inhabitants , is accessible to Lake vessels , and the American squadron on the Lake was fitted out here in 1814 . The falls in the river afford some good mill-seats . Above Vergennes is Middlebury , which contains some mills , and a college . Marble of a good quality is quarried here . Population , 3468 . Higher up the river is Rutland , containing quarries of marble , several manufacturing establishments , and the public buildings of the county , with 2753 inhabitants . On the same side of the mountains , in the southern part of the State , is Bennington , in the neighbourhood of which are found limestone , marble , and iron . Here are some mills and iron-works , and a population of 3419 . Crossing the mountains , and entering the rich valley of the Connecticut , we find a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadows . By means of several short canals , boats are enabled to ascend the river above Newbury ; the principal of these cuts is at Bellows ' Falls , where a fall of fifty feet is overcome by nine locks , and an excavation of half a mile in length . Brattleboro ' is a busy place of 2141 inhabitants , and containing some manufactories . A Lunatic Asylum is about to be erected here . Windsor is a neat town in a picturesque situation , with the lofty peaks of Ascutney Mountain towering above it . A small stream , which runs through the town , serves to carry the machinery of several manufacturing establishments , and there is a State-Prison built of granite and conducted on the Auburn plan . Population , 3134 . At the little village of Bellows ' Falls , the river is suddenly contracted from 300 to 16 or 20 feet wide , and rushes with great impetuosity through a narrow chasm cut in the solid rock , having a fall of nearly 50 feet in a half of a mile . Woodstock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river ; and higher up , but on the Connecticut , is Norwich ; civil engineering and other practical sciences receive particular attention in the institution here , styled the Norwich University . /q/ /z/ This State is bounded north by Vermont and New Hampshire ; east by the Atlantic Ocean ; south by Rhode Island and Connecticut ; and west by New York . The average extent , from north to south , is 70 miles ; and from east to west , 140 : area , 8500 square miles . The Green Mountains range through the central parts of the State , from north to south . These mountains , in their whole extent , abound in noble elevations , dark green forests , pleasant and sheltered valleys , and an infinite variety of impressive scenery . The highest peaks are Saddle Mt. , Taghkonic , Mt . Tom , Mt . Holyoke , &c.; Massachusetts has no large rivers wholly within her bounds . The Merrimack passes out of New Hampshire into the northern division of the State , emptying into the sea at Newburyport . The Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bisects the State . The Housatonic , Charles , and Ipswich , Neponset , and Taunton , though they have short courses , are pleasant streams . The deep bay , between Cape Ann and Cape Cod , which has given name to the State , has caused it to be known in the other States by the name of the Bay State . Cape Ann bounds it on the north , and Cape Cod on the south . Agriculture receives here . great attention , and is conducted with a superior degree of skill and intelligence . Massachusetts is no doubt the best cultivated State in the Union . Both the Legislature and Agricultural Societies have made great efforts to encourage a skilful and thrifty husbandry , and to introduce the best foreign breeds of sheep and cattle . Commerce , manufactures , and the fisheries , are , however , the great objects of pursuit The shipping belonging to this State amounts to about 480,000 tons ; being greater than that of any other State , and nearly one-third of the whole tonnage of the country : 1522 vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of 248,188 tons , cleared at the different ports in 1835 . The value of the imports , for the same year , was 19,800,373 dollars ; of exports , 10,143,790 ; of which 5,464,499 were of domestic produce . There is also an active and extensive coasting trade carried on with all parts of the Union : the imports being chiefly raw produce and provisions , and the exports manufactured articles . The herring , or alewive , and mackerel fisheries , are carried on along shore ; the cod- fishery chiefly on the great banks , and the Newfoundland and Labrador coasts ; the whale-fishery in the South Atlantic , the Pacific , Indian , and Antarctic Oceans . Two hundred and ninety vessels , of about 90,000 tons , with upwards of 7000 men , were engaged in the whale-fishery , in 1834 ; and , during the year 1835 , there was brought in sperm oil , whale oil , and whalebone , to the amount of five million dollars . In 1834 there were inspected 252,880 barrels of mackerel . The cod-fishery is also largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yields annually upwards of 400,000 quintals of fish and 6000 barrels of oil , of the value of more than one million dollars . In Massachusetts there is a larger amount of capital invested in manufactures than in any other State in the Union : in 1831 there were 250 cotton-mills , consuming 24,871,981 pounds of cotton , and producing 79,231,000 yards of cloth ; at present the number of the mills exceeds 300 ; also 125 woollen mills , manufacturing broadcloths , flannels , satinets , blankets , carpets , &c.; There are likewise numerous carding-machines . The wool used in household manufactures is estimated at about 8,000,000 dollars . The silk manufacture has been successfully introduced : also iron manufactures , including nails , machinery of all sorts , hollow Iware , cutlery , &c.; The making of boots and shoes occupies the whole population of several considerable towns ; and large quantities are exported . Other productions of manufacturing industry are carried on in families , and furnish an important source of gain to the rural population . The braiding and plaiting of straw and palm-leaf hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though but lately introduced , already employs several thousand females . Of a similar character , but locally more confined , is the manufacture of brooms from the broom-corn , about one million being annually made . Ship-building is exten- /z/ sively carried on : the shipping built in 1833 amounting to 33,000 tons . And salt is also manufactured from sea-water , chiefly by solar evaporation , to the amount of about 500,000 bushels a year . Various important works of internal improvement have been executed , which afford great convenience and facility to travelling and transportation : they are the Middlesex canal , which extends from Boston to Lowell , 26 miles ; the Blackstone canal , from Worcester to Providence , Rhode Island , 45 miles , and the Hampshire and Hampden canal , 20 miles in length , is a continuation of the Farmington canal , from Southwick , on the Connecticut line , to Northampton . Rail-roads have been constructed from Boston to Lowell , 25 miles , of which a continuation to Nashua , 15 miles , and a branch to Andover , are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a branch of 10 miles to Taunton ; and from Boston to Worcester , 43 miles . The Western Rail-road , which has been begun , will extend from Worcester , through Springfield and West Stockbridge , to the New York line , 118 miles , where it will be connected with Albany , Hudson , and Troy , by roads already in progress . The Eastern Rail-road , also in progress , is to run from Boston , through Salem and Newburyport , to the New Hampshire line , 40 miles , where it will be connected with the Portsmouth and Portland Rail-road . Her literary , religious , and charitable institutions are the pride of Massachusetts . Within a few years Boston alone has expended nearly two millions of dollars for objects of that character , exclusive of an annual expenditure of about $200,000 , for the support of public and private schools . There are also 66 academies in the State , which , with the private schools , are attended by 25,000 scholars . Harvard University , at Cambridge , is the oldest and best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 40,000 volumes , and instruction is given by 30 teachers , in the various branches of a liberal education : law , theological , and medical schools , are connected with it . William 's College , at Williamstown , and Amherst College , at Amherst , are also respectable institutions . The prevailing religious sect is the Congregationalist ; the Baptists are also numerous ; after these come the Methodists , Universalists , Episcopalians , Christians , Roman Catholics , and Friends , with some Presbyterians , Swedenborgians or New Jerusalem Church , and Shakers . Massachusetts is divided into 14 counties . /z/ In 1701 , 70,000 ; in 1742 , 164,000 ; in 1763 , 241,024 ; in 1765 , 227,926 ; in 1776 , 384,094 ; in 1784 , 357,510 , /z/ From 1790 to 1800 44,058 1800 to 1810 49,195 1810 to J820 51,247 1820 to 1830 87,121 In 1790 348,787 /z/ Of the above population of 1830 , there were , white males , 294,685 ; white females , 308,674 ; deaf and dumb , 256 ; blind , 218 ; aliens , 8787 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3360 ; females , 3685 : total , 7045 .

Boston , the capital of Massachusetts , and the principal city of New England , is pleasantly situated upon a small hilly peninsula on Boston Bay , with a safe and commodious harbour , deep enough to admit the largest vessels , capable of containing 500 ships at once , and so completely landlocked as to be perfectly secure . Several forts , erected on these islands , command the approaches to the city . Beside the main peninsula , the city comprises another peninsula , called South Boston , connected with the former by two free bridges ; and the island of East Boston , with which communication is kept up by steam ferry-boats . Four wooden bridges also connect the city with Charlestown and Cambridge ; a solid causeway of earth unites it to Brookline , and a narrow neck of land which has been raised and widened by artificial constructions , joins it to Roxbury . The population , which in 1800 was 24,937 ; in 1820 , 43,298 , and in 1830 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free coloured persons ; but if the adjacent towns are included , which in fact form so many suburbs of the city , /q/ the population exceeds 100,000 . The State-house , fronting a fine park of 75 acres , called the Common , and standing on the most elevated part of the city ; the market-house , a handsome granite edifice , two stories high , 536 feet in length , by 50 in breadth ; the court-house , also of granite , 176 feet long , 57 high , 54 wide ; the city-hall or old State-house , and Faneuil-hall , more interesting from historical associations than from their architectural merits ; and the Massachusetts General Hospital , a handsome granite building , 168 feet in length ; the Institution for the Blind , in which are about 50 pupils ; the Boston Athenaeum , which has a library of 30,000 volumes , and a picture gallery ; the Medical School of Harvard University ; the Eye and Ear Infirmary ; the Houses of Industry , Reformation , and Correction , also deserve mention . The bridges and wharves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 2800 feet long ; the West Boston Bridge , 2760 feet , and some of the others exceed 1500 feet . The wharves have been constructed in a somewhat similar manner . Central wharf , 1380 feet long , by 150 wide , contains 54 large warehouses , 4 stories high . Long wharf , 1800 long , by 200 in width , has 76 warehouses equally , spacious . Commercial wharf is 1100 feet , by 160 , with a range of 34 granite warehouses . As a commercial city , Boston is the second in the United States , in the amount of its business . In the beginning of 1835 , the shipping belonging to the port was 212,536 tons ; entered in 1835 , 194,420 tons ; cleared , 181,293 tons ; duties paid , 2,845,884 dollars ; annual value of imports , 16,000,000 ; of exports , 10,000,000 dollars . The number of banking institutions is 28 , with an aggregate capital of 24,980,000 dollars ; of insurance companies , 30 , with a capital of about 9,000,000 . This city has ever been distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Latin school , the High school , nine grammar and writing schools , 57 primary schools , and one African school for blacks . There are also numerous private schools for children of both sexes . The American Academy of Arts and Sciences , the Historical Society , and the Natural History Society , are among the learned societies . There are 51 churches , 2 theatres , an Odeon , &c.; Charlestown , which is connected with Boston by three bridges , stands on a lofty peninsula , the centre of which is occupied by Bunker Hill . Though irregularly built , it commands many fine views of the harbour and the surrounding country . The Bunker Hill Monument , of granite , is yet unfinished . It will form an obelisk , rising to the height of 220 feet from its base , which is 50 feet square . The United States ' Dock-yard , comprising a number of store-houses , arsenals , magazines , barracks , and slips , with a graving or dry-dock , built of hewn granite , in the most solid manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about sixty acres . The population of the town is 8787 . Adjoining Charlestown is Cambridge , the seat of Harvard University , with 6071 inhabitants . At Watertown , adjoining Cambridge , there is an United States ' Arsenal . To the south-west is the little town of Brighton , noted for its cattle market , in which , in the year 1835 , the sales of cattle , calves , sheep , and swine , amounted to 1,878,032 dollars . Lynn , a neat and thriving town , whose inhabitants , beside making 2,000,000 pair of shoes annually , carry on the cod and whale fisheries , increased its population from 6138 in 1830 , to 9847 in 1836 . A long beach of smooth , hard sand , terminates in the rocky little peninsula of Nahant , a favourite watering-place of the neighbouring towns . Marblehead , long the principal seat of the cod fishery , has of late turned its attention partly to mechanical industry , particularly to shoemaking , which occupies the winter leisure of many of its hardy fishermen . About 60 sail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are owned here . Population , 5150 . The city of Salem , with 13,886 inhabitants , is noted for the commercial enterprise and industrious spirit of its citizens . It was long largely engaged in the East India and China trade , and its coasting and foreign trade is still considerable ; but it labours under the disadvantage of not having a sufficient depth of water for the largest vessels . The inhabitants have lately engaged in the whale fishery , in which they employ 15 ships , of 3500 tons : the whole shipping of the port amounts to 31,877 tons . The city is neatly built , and it contains an Athena ; - /z/ urn , a Marine Museum , a valuable collection of natural and artificial curiosities , belonging to the East India Marine Society , which is composed wholly of nautical men ; nine banking institutions , with a capital of about two millions of dollars ; six insurance companies , with a capital of 950,000 dollars ; fifteen churches , and several charitable institutions . The manufactures are also considerable . Beverly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has 4079 inhabitants , chiefly occupied in commerce and the fisheries ; and Danvers is a busy town , with a population of 4228 , containing 32 tanneries , with 3000 vats , and a rolling and slitting mill , with 14 nail machines , producing 600,000 pounds of nails annually : 500,000 pair of shoes and boots are also made here yearly . Cape Anne , the north point of Massachusetts Bay , is occupied by the fishing-town of Gloucester : tonnage owned here , 14,528 ; population , 7513 . A few miles north of the cape is the handsome town of Newburyport , situated at the mouth of the Merrimack . Its foreign commerce was formerly more extensive than it is at present , but its trade is still important , and the whale , mackerel , and cod fisheries , are also carried on from this place : tonnage , 21,535 ; population , 6388 . The south point of the great bay from which the State takes its name , is Cape Cod , a long irregular peninsula , of 75 miles in length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly of hills of white sand , mostly destitute of vegetation . The houses are in some places built upon stakes driven into the ground , with open spaces between , for the sand to drift through . The cape , notwithstanding , is well inhabited , and supports a population of 28,000 , the majority of which subsists by the fisheries and the coasting-trade . South of Cape Cod is the island of Nantucket , containing the town of the same name , with 7266 inhabitants , all crowded together close upon the harbour , which lies on the northern side . The island is merely a sand-bank , 15 miles in length , by about 5 or 6 in breadth , slightly elevated above the ocean . There are , however , some productive spots ; and about 14,000 sheep and 500 cows are raised , which feed in one pasture , the land being held in common . The inhabitants are distinguished for their enterprise . They have about 75 ships engaged in the whale-fishery , and a considerable number of small vessels in the coasting-trade : 64,545 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boys belonging to the island are employed in navigation . Martha 's Vineyard is somewhat longer than Nantucket , and contains considerable woodland . The inhabitants are mostly pilots and fishermen ; but some salt and woollen cloth are made . Holmes ' Hole , a safe and capacious harbour , on the northern coast , is an important station for ships waiting for favourable weather to pass Cape Cod . Fifty-seven miles south of Boston , and situated on Buzzard 's Bay , is New Bedford , the great seat of the whale-fishery . It is a handsomely built town , and has a safe and capacious harbour . The population , which in 1830 amounted to 7592 , at present exceeds 11,000 . The shipping of the district , which includes several other towns on the bay , is 76,849 tons : nearly the whole of this is employed in the whale-fishery ; and in 1835 , 84,966 barrels of sperm and 49,764 of whale oil were brought in here . There are here ten large establishments in which spermaceti candles are made and oil is prepared ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insurance office , 14 churches and chapels , an academy , &c.; In this State there are nearly 40 millions of dollars invested in manufacturing stock ; of which 6 millions are employed in Lowell alone . This place , which is the greatest manufacturing town in the United States , has been very rapid in its growth , and may be considered the Manchester of America . It was commenced in 1813 , but its principal increase dates from 1822 : it now contains 20,000 inhabitants . Its various cotton and woollen factories give employment to near 7000 operatives , the greater part of whom are females . About million pounds of cotton , and near seven hundred thousand pounds of wool , are expended annually in the production of 40 million yards of cotton and woollen goods and carpeting . The supply of water-power , from the Merrimack , is convenient and unfailing . Lowell also contains powder-mills , flannel-works , grist and saw-mills , glassworks , &c.; Among the other places noted for manufactures , are Fall River village , near /z/ the mouth of Taunton River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 32 miles south-west from Boston ; Worcester , west from Boston ; Springfield and Northampton , both on Connecticut River ; Pittsfield , in the western , and Adams , in the north-western part of the State . /z/ Rhode Island is bounded north and east by Massachusetts , south by the Atlantic Ocean , and west by Connecticut . Its extent , from north to south , is about 48 miles , and from east to west , 42 ; area , 1500 square miles . The face of the country is mostly level , except in the north-west , part of which is hilly and rocky . The soil is generally better adapted to grazing than tillage . A large proportion of the north-western and western part of the State has a thin and lean soil , but the islands and country bordering on Narragansett Bay are of great fertility , and are celebrated for their fine cattle , and the abundance and excellence of their butter and cheese . The products are corn , rye , barley , oats , and some wheat . The island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance , abounding in smooth swells , and being divided with great uniformity into well-tilled fields . The climate much resembles that of Massachusetts and Connecticut in its salubrity : the parts of the State adjacent to the sea are favoured with refreshing breezes in summer , and its winter is the most mild of any of the New England States . The rivers are small , with courses of not more than fifty or sixty miles , and discharging an inconsiderable quantity of water ; but as they descend from two hundred to four hundred and fifty feet , and are steady in their supply of water , they furnish a great number of valuable mill-seats ; and they have been extensively applied to manufacturing purposes . The Pawtucket , Pawtuxet , and Pawcatuck , are the principal streams . Some iron ore , marble , and freestone , are found , and anthracite coal occurs in extensive beds , but , although it has been pronounced of a good quality , it has not been much worked . The inhabitants have occupied themselves with commerce , the fisheries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were in the State 119 cotton-mills , 22 woollen-mills , 5 bleacheries , 2 calico-print works , 10 iron-founderies , 30 machine-shops , 40 tanneries , &c.; Since that period the number has been much increased : there is a silk manufactory in Providence , and lace is made in Newport . The people of Rhode Island not having made a constitution for themselves , the government is still conducted according to the provisions of the royal charter of 1063 . The official style is the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations . The Governor and Lieutenant-Governor are chosen annually by popular vote . The legislature , styled the General Assembly , consists of two houses , a Senate , chosen annually , and a House of Representatives , chosen semi-annually , which meet four times a year . The judges and other civil officers are appointed annually by the General Assembly . The State appropriates 10,000 dollars a year for the support of common schools , and a somewhat larger sum is raised by the towns for the same purpose , in addition to which , considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the free schools open some time longer than the public funds would admit . There are in the State 323 free schools , with upwards of 17,000 pupils . Brown University , at Providence , is a respectable institution on the plan of the other New England colleges . ' The Baptists and Congregational ists are the most numerous sects ; the Episcopalians and Methodists are also numerous , and there are some Friends , Roman Catholics , and Univerealists. /z/ In 1701 , 10,000 ; in 1730 , 17,935 ; in 1748 , 34,123 ; in 1755 , 46,636 ; in 1774 , ! 59,678 ; in 1783 , 51,809. /z/ In 1790 , 68,825 /z/ Increase .

The principal city of Rhode Island is Providence , the second in New England in point of population , wealth , and commerce . It is situated at the head of Narragansett Bay , and is accessible to the largest merchant vessels : it carries on an active coasting and foreign trade . The population of the city increased from 16,833 in 1830 , to 19,277 in 1835 . Here are 16 banks with a capital of about five million dollars ; also a number of cotton-mills , bleacheries , dye-houses , machine-shops , iron-founderies , &c.; Among the public buildings are the State House , the Halls of Brown University , the arcade , a handsome granite edifice , fourteen churches , &c.; Steam-boats , of the largest and finest class , keep up a daily communication with New York , during the greater part of the year ; the Blackstone canal , and Boston and Providence rail-road , terminate here ; and a continuation of the latter to Stonington in Connecticut , is now in progress . Pawtucket River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . North Providence , on the Massachusetts border , contains the manufacturing village of Pavvtucket , opposite which is the town of Pawtucket in that State . The whole , manufacturing district is also commonly called Pawtucket , and it contains 20 cotton-mills , beside machine-shops , calico-printing works , iron-works , &c.; There is a population of about 6000 souls on both sides of the river . Above this the Pawtucket takes the name of the Blackstone , and furnishes mill-seats which have created the village of Woonsocket Falls , also situated on both sides of the river , in the townships of Smithfield and Cumberland . There are also manufacturing establishments in other parts of Smithfield . The population at the Falls is about 3000 . Warwick , on the Pawtuxet River and Narragansett Bay , is a manufacturing and fishing town , with 5529 inhabitants . Bristol , on the eastern shore of the bay , is a busy town , with 3054 inhabitants actively engaged in the foreign and coasting trade and whale fishery . Nearly at the south end of the Island of Rhode Island is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies , and still a favourite summer resort , on account of its pleasant situation , the refreshing coolness of the sea-breezes , and its advantages for sea-bathing . The harbour is one of the finest in the world , being safe , capacious , and easy of access , and is defended by an important work called Fort Adams ; but trade has mostly deserted the town , and now centres chiefly in Providence . Population , 8010 . Prudence and Conanicut Islands in the Bay , and Block Island , at the entrance of Long Island Sound , belong to this State . The latter , although destitute of a harbour , has nearly 2000 inhabitants , engaged in the fisheries . /z/ This State is bounded on the north by Massachusetts , south by Long Island Sound , east by Rhode Island , and west by New York . It is 90 miles in length , 70 miles in breadth , and contains 4764 square miles . The principal rivers are , the Connecticut , Housatonic , Thames , Farmington , and Naugatuck . The face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts , mountainous . The soil is good , and the industrious inhabitants have not neglected its cultivation . The valley of Connecticut River , from Middletown to the northern boundary of the State , is a luxuriant meadow , chequered by patches of wheat , corn , and other grain . Some other parts of the State are well cultivated and fruitful , /q/ and some portions are beautiful , as well from the gifts of nature as the improvements of art . The chief productions are Indian corn , rye , wheat , in many parts , oats , barley , buckwheat , flax in large quantities , &c.; Orchards are numerous , and cider is made for exportation . The State is , however , generally better adapted to grazing than tillage , and its fine meadows and pastures enable the farmer to feed great numbers of neat cattle , horses , and sheep . The quantity of butter and cheese , annually made , is great , and of well-known excellence . The fisheries are carried on from several of the ports ; and there are valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of shipping from this State in the whale fishery ; and , in 1834 , 30,000 barrels of whale and sperm oil were brought in . The coasting trade is considerable , but most of the foreign trade is carried on through New York . The manufactures of Connecticut are considerable , and the ingenuity and industry of the people in this respect have a reputation coextensive with the Union . The principal articles are cotton and woollen goods , clocks , combs , and buttons , tin and wooden ware . Implements , and utensils of various descriptions are among the products of manufacturing industry . In 1832 , there were in the State 104 cotton-mills and 80 woollen factories . The annual value of cotton and woollen goods , iron manufactures , axes , boots and shoes , buttons and combs , paper , coaches and wagons , with other articles , amounted to an aggregate of 8,000,000 dollars . Common schools are supported by the proceeds of the school fund belonging to the State , which are distributed among the school districts in proportion to the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sixteen years . The money thus distributed is applied solely to paying the expense of instruction , the other charges being paid by the districts . The number of children of the above description is about 84,000 . The school fund amounts to about 1,930,000 dollars , and the income is about 84,000 dollars . There are also upwards of 30 academies and high schools in the State ; and three colleges  --  Yale College at New Haven , Washington College at Hartford , and the Wesleyan University , at Norwich . Yale College is one of the oldest and most respectable , and the most frequented of the collegiate institutions in the country . Attached to it are a theological department , a medical institute , and a law school . The duties of instruction are performed by twenty-seven teachers . The Congregationalists are the most numerous religious sect ; after them rank the Baptists , Methodists , and Episcopalians ; and there are some Universalists , Roman Catholics , and Shakers . The Farmington canal extends from New Haven to the Massachusetts line , 56 miles ; whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampden canal . Enfield canal , miles in length , serves to overcome a fall in the Connecticut , and supplies valuable mill-seats . A rail-road is in progress from Providence to Stonington , in this State , 45 miles in length ; it is intended to be connected by a steam ferry-boat with the termination of the Long Island rail-road . Another rail-road is also in progress between New Haven and Hartford , a distance of 40 miles . /z/ n 1701 , . /z/ In 1790 , . . /z/ From 1790 to 1800 , ... /z/ 1800 to 1810 , . . /z/ 1810 to 1820 , . . . /z/ 1820 to 1830 , .. /z/ Of the above population of 1830 , there were , white Males , 143,047 ; white Females , 146,556 ; of which are , deaf and dumb , 294 ; blind , 188 ; aliens , 1481 .

The harbour is safe and spacious , but it is shallow and gradually /z/ filling up . The city is regularly laid out and neatly built : many of the houses have fine gardens ; some of the principal streets are bordered by rows of shade trees , and the principal square is finely ornamented in the same manner . Among the public buildings are the State-House , the State-Hospital , the Halls of Yale College , ten churches , &c.; One of the wharves here is 3943 feet in length . The coasting and foreign trade of New Haven is considerable : steam-boats and packets keep up a regular and easy communication with New York ; and there are some extensive manufactories , particularly in fire-arms , carriages , &c.; The population is 10,678 . On the summit of West Rock , in the vicinity of the city , is a small cave , in which GofFe and Whalley , two of the regicide judges of Charles I. were concealed , and which is still called " the Judges ' Cave . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thriving town , with a good harbour on the Sound . In the interior are Danbury and Litchfield , with some manufactures . North-east from New Haven , on the banks of the Connecticut River , is the city of Hartford ; a neat and pleasant town , with considerable coasting trade . It stands in a fertile and highly cultivated district , abounding in neat and flourishing villages , which enjoy the advantages of numerous mill-seats and easy communication with the sea . The city has at present a population of about 9000 ; in 1830 , it contained 7076 inhabitants . Steam-boats run daily between Hartford and New York , and several small steam-packets and tow-boats are employed on the river above . The annual amount of the manufactures of Hartford is about 1,000,000 dollars ; the principal branches are printing and publishing , shoe-making , the manufacturing of saddlery , cards , and wire , wearing apparel , &c.; Among the public buildings are a State-House , City Hall , twelve churches , the Asylum for the deaf and dumb , retreat for the insane , &c.; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first institution of the kind established in America , was founded in 1816 , and has about 140 pupils , who receive instruction in the various branches of useful learning , and acquire a knowledge of the useful arts . Several of the New England States have made appropriations for the support of their indigent dumb here . The city of Middletown , a few miles below Hartford , is accessible to vessels drawing ten feet of water , and its coasting and foreign trade is considerable . The situation of the town is pleasant , and the houses and public buildings neat . Its manufactures are also pretty extensive , comprising cotton and woollen goods , firearms , paper , machinery , &c.; : population of the city , 2965 . Saybrook , at the mouth of the Connecticut River , was the first spot occupied by Europeans in Connecticut , and the ground was regularly laid out for a large city ; but the anticipations of its founders have not been realised . At the mouth of the Thames stands the city of New London : it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best harbours in the country . Its trade is considerable ; upwards of 40 ships sail from this place to the whalefishery ; and the shore fishery is also actively carried on . Population , 4356 . Norwich , 13 miles above New London , is a flourishing manufacturing city , situated in a beautiful and fertile tract . The water-power is here ample , and is already extensively employed for useful purposes . There are in the township seventeen manufacturing establishments , eight churches , three banks , &c.; Population of the city , 3135 ; of the township , 5161 . Stonington , in the south-east corner of the State , has twelve vessels in the seal-fishery , and carries on the shore-fishery successfully . /z/ The Middle States are bounded on the north by Canada , the River St. Lawrence , and Lakes Ontario and Erie ; south by Virginia ; east by the Atlantic Ocean and New England ; west by the State of Ohio and Virginia . As a region , the Middle States comprise New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 490 miles , and from east to west , /z/ 360 miles , with an area of 115,000 square miles , and occupies one of the finest parts of the Union . The surface presents every variety of mountain , hill , plain and valley . The Appalachian , or Alleghany Range , extends through this region , from south-west to north-east , in several parallel ridges , which attains in Pennsylvania its widest limits ; none of these , however , reach the elevation of the highest summits of the Blue Ridge in North Carolina , or the White Mountains in New Hampshire . The Alleghany is generally covered with forests , and contains many wild solitudes , seldom trodden by the foot of man , affording shelter to various species of game . The most prominent rivers of the Atlantic sections of the United States are in this region . The Hudson and Delaware rank amongst the most important and useful of our navigable streams ; but the Susquehannah is , notwithstanding its length , but little available without the aid of artificial navigation . The mineral productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several kinds of iron ore , salt , lime , excellent building materials , and clays useful in the arts , are among the treasures in which it abounds . Mining industry has acquired importance from the activity and success with which it has lately been pushed ; and the public works of this section are particularly remarkable for their number and magnitude . In general the soil is fertile , and particularly favourable to the production of every species of grain : wheat is the principal object of culture ; tobacco is extensively raised ; also Indian corn , rye , barley , &c.; The fruits common to the temperate regions are abundant , and of excellent quality . The commerce of the Middle States is extensive , and chiefly carried on through the cities of New York and Philadelphia , to which it centres ; the trade , however , of a considerable part of Pennsylvania and Delaware flows , to Baltimore . Manufacturing industry is carried to a greater extent , in proportion to the population , than in any part of the United States , excepting New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour , and affords generally a competent remuneration to thousands of both sexes . The Middle States were originally settled by people of various countries , having different habits , feelings , and opinions : society , therefore , does not possess that uniform character which admits of a general description . The people have not that unity of feeling and interest which is observed in the New England and Southern States ; and the only reason for their being classed together is their contiguity : they seldom unite for any public purpose , and there seems to be but little sympathy or common feeling , which prompts them to act in concert for public affairs . The great body is of British descent , but in New York and Maryland there are many Germans ; and in Pennsylvania they are so numerous as to constitute , in some respects , a separate community , retaining their own language , and being often ignorant of English . In New York and New Jersey there are many descendants of the original Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam ; and in some sections the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolutionary war , the emigration from the New England States into New York continued to set so strongly for many years , that a majority of the present population of that State are natives of New England , or their descendants . There is also a large body of New England emigrants in Pennsylvania . The whole population of the five Middle States is a little upwards of four millions ; in which number are 180,500 slaves , and nearly 170,000 free blacks . /z/ This great State , the most flourishing , wealthy , and populous in the Union , combining with almost unequalled natural advantages of soil , internal navigation , and easy access by sea , public works executed on a scale of imperial grandeur , exhibits one of those amazing examples of growth and prosperity , that are seen nowhere on the globe beyond our own borders . New York is the most northern of the Middle States , and is bounded north by Lake Ontario , the St. Lawrence River , and Lower Canada ; east by Vermont , /z/ Massachusetts , and Connecticut ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania ; and west by Lake Erie , Pennsylvania , and the Niagara River . Length , 316 miles ; breadth , 304 : containing about 46,000 square miles . This State forms a portion of the elevated table-land of the United States , broken in some places by mountainous ridges of inconsiderable elevation , and containing some remarkable depressions , which form the basins of lakes , or the channels of the rivers . The principal rivers are the Hudson , St. Lawrence , Delaware , Susquehannah , Alleghany , Genesee , Niagara , Oswego , and the Mohawk . A part of the lakes Erie , Ontario , and Champlain , are in this State . The other principal lakes are Lake George , Cayuga , Seneca , Oneida , Oswegatchie , Canandaigua , &c.; The soil in the maritime part of the State is sandy , in the middle beautifully undulating , and in the western and southern division remarkably level , rich , and inclining to alluvial formation . Iron ore is found in inexhaustible quantities and of a good quality in the northeastern part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eastern , and southwestern counties . Lead is found in some parts ; also gypsum , in the central counties , where it is extensively used for agricultural purposes . Limestone likewise occurs . Salt is procured in abundance from the Onondaga salt-springs , in the township of Salina ; the brine is conducted to Salina , Syracuse , and other neighbouring villages , where the salt is obtained by boiling , by solar evaporation , and by artificial evaporation , 45 gallons of water yielding a bushel of salt ; there are here 1,516,299 superficial feet of vats , and 3423 kettles and pans ; the quantity of salt made in 1826 was 827,508 bushels ; in 1830 , 1,435,446 ; in 1835 , 2,209,867 . The well-known springs of Ballston and Saratoga are partly saline , partly chalybeate , and the water is exported in considerable quantities not only to other States , but to foreign countries . In the western part of the State there are burning springs , yielding carburetted hydrogen , which is applied to economical uses in the neighbouring villages . Wheat is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions are largely exported . The manufactures of New York are also extensive and flourishing ; the aggregate value of manufactured articles , in the year 1835 , was stated to be 60,669,067 dollars ; that of the raw materials used , amounted to the sum of 43,400,922 dollars . In addition to these , there were made in families , cloth , flannels , and other woollens , and cotton , linen , &c,; of the aggregate value of 2,029,984 dollars . The cotton and woollen . mills produced 24,175,357 yards of cotton cloth , 6,626,058 of woollen , and 686,203 of cotton and woollen . The commerce of New York is also on a great scale , as , beside supplying her own wants and exporting her surplus productions , she imports a large share of the foreign articles consumed in the neighbouring Atlantic States , as well as in many of the Western States , to which her natural and artificial channels of communication give her access ; and her great commercial emporium is the outlet for the produce of the same regions . Thus in 1835 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly three-fifths of the whole imports of the country ; while that of the exports was 30,345,264 dollars , or more than one-fourth of the whole exports of the United States . The shipping belonging to the State at the end of 1835 amounted to 381,792 tons , making New York second only to Massachusetts in point of tonnage . The amount of toll collected on the State canals increased from 1,056,799 dollars in 1830 , to 1,548,108 in 1835 , notwithstanding several very great reductions of the rates of toll . The total value of the articles which reached tide-water , is estimated to have exceeded 20,000,000 dollars . Forty-five ships , of 13,000 tons , sailed to the whale-fishery in the same year , chiefly from Sag Harbour , Hudson , Newburgh , and Poughkeepsie . This State is distinguished for its magnificent public works , constructed for the purpose of connecting the great central basin of the lakes and the St. Lawrence with the Atlantic ; 663 miles of canal navigation have been obtained , at the cost of 13,497,568 dollars ; and goods are now carried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Florence , Alabama , 1935 miles ; to Nashville , Tennessee , /q/ 1850 miles , &c.; The great trunk is the Erie canal , extending from Buffalo on Lake Erie to the Hudson , 364 miles . Provision has recently been made for enlarging this great work , the longest of the kind in the world , by increasing the width to 60 , and the depth to 6 feet , lengthening the locks to 105 feet , and constructing a double set of lift-locks , at the estimated cost of above 10,360,000 dollars . The Champlain canal extends from Lake Champlain , at Whitehall , to the junction of the Erie canal with the Hudson , 64 miles , with a navigable feeder of 12 miles ; lockage , 188 feet , by 21 locks . Other branches of this work , pervading different parts of the State , are the Oswego canal , 38 miles , connecting the Erie canal , at Salina , with Lake Ontario ; Cayuga and Seneca canal , 23 miles , extending from Geneva to Montezuma on the Erie canal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake , 8 miles , connecting that lake with Seneca Lake ; Chemung canal , from the head of the latter to the River Chemung , or Tioga , at Elmira , 23 miles , with a navigable feeder from Painted Post to Elmira , of 16 miles ; Chenango canal , 97 miles in length , from Binghamton , on the Chenango , to Utica . Appropriations were made by the Legislature in the session of 1836 , for the construction of the Black River canal , 75 miles in length , from Rome on the Erie canal , to Carthage on Black River ; and the Genesee Valley canal , from Rochester to Olean , on the Alleghany River , 107 miles . Beside these works constructed by the State , the principal canal made by a private company , is the Delaware and Hudson , extending from the mouth of Roundout Creek , on the latter River , to Port Jervis on the Delaware , up that river to the mouth of the Lackawaxen , and along the latter to Honesdale in Pennsylvania : total length , 109 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honesdale a rail-road runs to the coal-mines at Carbondale , a distance of 16 miles , passing over Moosic Mountain , which is 1580 feet above tide-water , and 850 above the coal-mines . Two great projects , which will undoubtedly soon be executed , deserve to be mentioned here : these are a ship canal round the falls of Niagara , and another from Oswego , by the Oswego River , Oneida Lake , and the Mohawk , to the Hudson , thus enabling vessels from the upper lakes to reach New York with ' out breaking bulk . The following are the principal rail-roads already completed :  --  the Mohawk and Hudson , from Albany to Schenectady , 15 miles , continued northwardly by the Schenectady and Saratoga rail-road , 22 miles , and westward by the Schenec tady and Utica rail-road , 77 miles ; the Auburn and Syracuse rail-road , 26 miles ; the Tonawanda rail-road , from Rochester to Attica , 34 miles ; the Ithaca and Owego , 29 miles from the Susquehannah to Cayuga lake ; the Rensellaer and Saratoga rail-road , from Troy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail-road , 12 miles . It is also intended to connect the detached links between Albany and Buffalo , so as to form an unbroken line of road between those two places ; and rail-roads are now in progress from Hudson and Greenbush to West Stockbridge , in Massachusetts , which will serve to connect Boston , by the Massa chusetts western rail-road , with I.ake Erie . The Long Island rail-road , from Jamaica to Greenport ; the New York and Erie rail-road , from Tappan , on the Hudson , to Lake Erie , 480 miles ; and the New Yojk and Albany rail-road , be tween those two cities , a distance of 160 miles , are in progress . The latter passes up the western side of the river , partly through Connecticut and Massachusetts ; and a tunnel under the Hudson at Albany , has been projected . The legislature consists of two houses , the Senate , chosen for the term of four years , and the Assembly , elected annually ; the former are chosen by senatorial districts , and the latter by counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the term of two years . The chancellor and superior judges are appointed by the Governor and Senate , and hold their office during good behaviour , or until the age of 60 years ; the inferior judges are appointed by the same authorities , for the term of five years . Every white male citizen of the age of 21 years , who has resided in the State for one year next preceding the election , is entitled to vote ; but coloured persons must be possessed of a clear freehold of the value of 250 dollars , in order to be qualified electors . Ample provision is made for common education , and there is no country in the /z/ world where the body of the people is better taught , than in New York . The State has a school fund , the proceeds of which are distributed among the towns , oq condition that each town raise by tax a sum equal to that which it receives from the State ; the whole of these sums is expended solely in the payment of teachers ' wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other incidental expenses , are at the charge of the school districts . The school fund , at the close of 1835 , amounted to 1,875,192 dollars . The number of school districts at that time was 10,132 ; of which returns were received from 9676 , containing 541,401 pupils ; the sum of 312,181 dollars was distributed among these districts by the State , under the name of public money , of which 100,000 dollars was received from the common school fund , 193,760 was raised by a property tax , and the remainder was derived from local funds ; and the sum of 419,878 dollars was raised by the school districts . Provision has also been made at the public expense , for the education of teachers , by the establishment of a department in an academy of each of the eight senatorial districts , with the suitable books and apparatus for that purpose . There are also 66 academies and high schools , among which are distributed 12,000 dollars from the literature fund , containing 5296 students , and a great number of other high schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of the City of New York , and Columbia College , in New York city ; Union College , at Schenectady ; Hamilton College , at Clinton ; and Geneva College , with a medical department , at Geneva . The Episcopalians have a Theological Seminary in New York ; the Presbyterians , at Auburn ; the Baptists , at Hamilton ; and the Lutherans , at Hartwick . There are likewise medical schools in New York and at Fairfield . The principal religious sects are the Presbyterians , including Congregationalists , the Methodists , and the Baptists ; the Episcopalians and Dutch Reformed are also numerous , with some Lutherans , Roman Catholics , Friends , &c.; The increase of the population of this State has been very rapid ; in the 20 years from 1790 to 1810 , it nearly trebled itself ; from 1810 to 1830 , it doubled itself , and in the five years from 1830 to 1835 , the increase was 13 per cent . ; by the census of 1835 the population was 2,174,517 . It consists , in part , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , however , lost in a great measure their national characteristics , and the descendants of the German palatines , who removed thither in the beginning of the last century , with some emigrants from Great Britain and other European countries . But the mass of the people are of New England origin or descent , and they are favourably distinguished for enterprise , intelligence , and virtue . New York is divided for civil purposes into 57 counties , containing 9 cities , and 797 townships , with 122 incorporated villages , many of which have different names from the townships in which they are situated : /z/ In 1800 , . . 586,050 /z/ From 1790 to 1800 , . . 245,930 1800 to 1810 , .. 372,999 1810 to 1820 , .. 413,763 1820 to 1830 , . . 545,796 /z/ In 1701 , . . 30,000 /z/ Of the above population of 1830 , there were , white Males , 951,516 ; white Females , 916,670 ; deaf and dumb , 842 ; blind , 642 ; aliens , 52,488 .

The city of New- York is the largest , most wealthy , and most flourishing , of all American cities ; the greatest commercial emporium of America , and , after London , the greatest in the world . No city in the world possesses equal advantages for foreign commerce and inland trade . Two long lines of canals , stretching back in every direction , have increased its natural advantages , and rendered it the great mart of an almost indefinite /q/ extent of country , while its facilities of Communication with all parts of the world , have made it the thoroughfare of the same vast region . The progress of its population has never been paralleled ; in 1790 , it was 33,131 ; in 1810 , 96,373 ; in 1830 , 203,007 , and in 1835 , 270,089 , or , including Brooklyn , upwards of 297,500 . New- York is well built and regularly laid out , with the exception of the older part , in which the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now forms only a small portion of the city . It is chiefly as a great mart of foreign and inland commerce that New- York is most advantageously known . The shipping belonging to the port in the beginning of 1835 , amounted to 359,222 tons ; entered during the year , 465,665 tons ; cleared , 366,389 tons : whole number of arrivals from foreign ports in 1835 , 2049 . There are 16 regular packets plying between this place and Liverpool ; 16 packets to Havre ; with lines to London , Vera Cruz , Carthagena , &c.; The whole number of passengers arrived here from foreign countries , in the five years from 1831 to 1836 , was 205,500 . The inland and coasting-trade is also immense . There are here 23 banking institutions , with a capital of 18,861,200 dollars , and 43 insurance companies , with a capital of 14,800,000 dollars . Among the public buildings are the City Hall , a handsome edifice of white marble , with a front of 216 feet ; the Hall of the University , a splendid building , 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hospital ; the City Lyceum ; 150 churches ; Astor House , a hotel , of Quincy granite , 200 feet by 150 and 77 feet high , containing 390 rooms ; the Almshouse at Bellevue , on East River ; the Penitentiary , on Blackwell 's Island , in the same river , several miles from the city ; the Custom House , an elegant building , 177 feet long , by 89 feet wide , on the model of the Parthenon ; the new Exchange about to be erected in place of the one destroyed by fire in 1835 , &c.; The benevolent societies are numerous and well supported . They comprise an Hospital , with which is connected a Lunatic Asylum at Bloomingdale ; an Hospital at Bellevue , for the sick and insane poor , connected with the city Almshouse ; three Dispensaries ; an Institution for the Blind ; one for the Deaf and Dumb ; and a great number of orphan asylums , relief associations , education , bible , and tract societies , &c.; Neither is New- York behind her sister cities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already mentioned , the Historical Society ; the New-York Society Library , with 25,000 volumes ; the Lyceum of Natural History , and the American Lyceum , have published some valuable papers ; while the Mercantile Library Association , and the Apprentices ' Library , show that the merchants and mechanics are not indifferent to the intellectual improvement of their apprentices and clerks . There are also here an Academy of Fine Arts and an Academy of Design . The American Institute , for the promotion of domestic industry by the distribution of premiums and other rewards , holds annual fairs for the exhibition of the products of American industry . The city of Brooklyn , on Long Island , opposite to New- York , is pleasantly situated on a rising ground which commands an agreeable view , and it partakes in the commercial activity and prosperity of its neighbour . Here is a Navy-yard of the United States , on Wallabout Bay . There are in Brooklyn a handsome city hall , 17 churches , 3 banks , 2 insurance companies , &c.; Steam ferry-boats are constantly running between this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamaica , 12 miles of which , the continuation to Greenport , is already in progress . Its population has increased from 15,394 in 1830 , to 24,529 in 1835 . About 50 miles above the city of New- York , and on the west side of the Hudson , is West J Point , a celebrated military post during the war of independence , and now the seat of the United States Military Academy for the education of officers of the army . Newburgh , 10 miles above West Point , and on the right bank , with 5000 inhabitants , and Poughkeepsie , 14 miles higher , on the left , with 6281 , are neat , thriving villages , with considerable trade , and several ships engaged in the whalefishery . Near the head of ship navigation , 117 miles from the sea , stands the city of Hudson , on a commanding eminence on the left bank of the river . Its trade and manufactures are extensive and increasing , and it has eleven ships , of about /z/ 4000 tons , engaged in the whale-fishery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the neighbourhood presents many charming prospects . The population in 1830 amounted to 5392 , and in 1835 to 5531 . On the western bank of the Hudson River , 145 miles above New- York , is the city of Albany , the capital , and in point of size the second city of the State . Its wealth and trade have been greatly increased by the opening of the Erie and Champlain canals , which terminate in a large basin in the city ; and its situation renders it a great thoroughfare , not only for traders , but also for travellers on the northern route . It contains several handsome public buildings , among which are the old State Hall ; the new State Hall , and the City Hall , both of white marble ; the Academy , of red freestone ; 14 churches , &c.; The Albany Institute , with a library , and cabinet of minerals , coins , and casts ; the Athenseum has a library of above 8000 volumes ; and there is also an Academy of Fine Arts here . Regular steam-packets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rail-road cars are constantly departing for the northern and western routes ; and several lines of stage-coaches keep up a communication with the east . The number of persons who annually pass through the city has been estimated at upwards of 600,000 . The population in 1820 was 12,630 ; in 1830 , 24,209 , and in 1836 , 28,109 . The city of Troy , six miles above Albany , is situated on the opposite side of the river . The trade and manufactures of this place are both considerable . The city is regularly laid out and prettily built . The population in 1830 was 11,405 , and in 1835 , 16,959 , having increased nearly 50 per cent , in five years . Nearly north from Albany , at a distance of 29 and 36 miles respectively , are the most frequented of American watering-places , Ballston Spa and Saratoga . At the eastern end of Lake Ontario , at the head of a deep bay , is Sacket 's Harbour , an important naval station during the three years ' war ; and on the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourishing village of Watertown , prettily situated and neatly built , with a population of 3500 inhabitants . Up the valley of the Mohawk , and along the line of the Grand Canal and its branches , are a number of cities and towns , which have sprung up , as if by enchantment , in the bosom of a wilderness . Schenectady , Utica , Syracuse , Oswego , Auburn , Ithaca , Seneca , Canandaigua , Rochester , Lockport , and Buffalo , are the principal . The city of Schenectady , sifuated in the midst of a fertile tract , affording numerous mill-seats , traversed by the canal , and connected by railroads with Albany , Saratoga , and Utica , has an extensive and increasing trade , and some manufactures . It is the seat of Union College , one of the principal collegiate institutions in the State . The population increased from 4268 in 1830 , to 6272 in 1835 . Upwards of ninety miles north-west from Albany , on the Grand Canal , is the city of Utica . In 1794 , the spot contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wilderness : in 1835 , the city had a population of 10,183 souls , 13 churches , an academy , a State and county Lyceum , a city library , a Mechanic 's Association , with an extensive trade , and numerous manufactories and mills . Utica is in the valley of the Saquoit , which , on a territory of ten miles square , has a population of about 30,000 , and contains numerous cotton , saw , and grist mills , with bleacheries , woollen manufactories , machine-shops , &c.; Still farther west , on the canal , are the villages of Salina , Syracuse , Geddes , and Liverpool , the seat of the Onondaga salt-springs , which are the property of the State : the manufacturers pay a duty of six cents a bushel , and in the year 1835 made 2,209,867 bushels , much of which is sent out of the State . The works are capable of producing three million bushels a year . Population of Syracuse in 1835 , 4105 ; of Salina , 2500 . From Syracuse , a branch cana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most flourishing villages in the State : the river of the same name furnishes an inexhaustible water-power , which is very extensively employed for useful purposes ; and an excellent harbour , protected by piers , constructed by the general government . Since the opening of the Welland canal , a considerable portion of the trade of the upper lakes , as well as that of Lake Ontario , enters at Oswego , and large quantities of wheat are brought in to be ground /z/ here . The population of the village nearly doubled between 1830 and 1835 , having increased from 2117 to 4000 inhabitants . The city of Rochester , situated on the Genesee , seven miles from its mouth , and traversed by the Great Canal , is a busy and flourishing town . The river has here a fall of upwards of 90 feet , and a few miles below , it descends by a fall of 75 feet to the level of Lake Ontario : the whole descent from Rochester is 255 feet The motive power thus produced is constant and immense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several cotton and woollen manufactories , and a great number of other manufacturing establishments . The aqueduct over the river is a fine piece of work , consisting of ten arches of hewn stone . The population of the city increased from 1502 in 1820 , to 9269 in 1830 , and 14,404 in 1835 . The city of Buffalo , at the western termination of the canal , has a harbour on Lake Erie , protected by a long pier . The city is well built and finely situated , overlooking the lake ; and it contains a great number of large warehouses and manufactories . The population in 1820 was 2095 ; in 1830 , 6321 ; and in 1835 , 15,661 . The lake-trade is very extensive . In 1817 , there were but 25 vessels , and no steam-boat , on Lake Erie ; and in 1835 they amounted to 375 sloops , schooners , and brigs , and 34 steam-boats , most of which exceeded 200 tons burthen ; beside several ships , &c.; Buffalo contains , in addition to its numerous churches , a Handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village of Ithaca , at the head of Cayuga Lake , increased its population from 3324 in 1830 , to 5000 in 1835 . By the Owego rail-road it is connected with the Susquehannah , and by the lake , with the Erie canal and tide-water . Its situation is highly picturesque . There are numerous manufacturing establishments here . /z/ The State of New Jersey is bounded north by New York , east by the Atlantic Ocean and New York , south by Delaware Bay , and west by Pennsylvania . It is 138 miles in length , and 50 miles in breadth ; the area is about 6600 square miles . The soil of this State is not naturally well adapted to agricultural pursuits , much of the land being either sandy or marshy ; yet its proximity to two of the largest markets in the United States , and the industry of the inhabitants , have rendered it exceedingly productive of all sorts of grain , fruits , and vegetables , common to the climate . New Jersey is intersected by many navigable rivers , and has numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manufactures requiring water-power . The principal of these streams are the Raritan , Hackensack , Passaic , Salem , Tom , Cohanzey , and Maurice rivers . New Jersey abounds in valuable iron ores ; rich veins of zinc ore occur in the northern part of the State ; copper also abounds , and has been extensively worked . The greater part of the sandy tract is covered with extensive pine forests , which have afforded supplies of fuel for the numerous furnaces of the State , and the steam-boats of the neighbouring waters ; the middle section is the most highly improved and wealthy part of the State , being divided into small farms and kitchen-gardens , which are carefully cultivated , and which find a ready market in the numerous manufacturing towns of the district , and in the great cities of the adjacent States . The northern counties contain much good pasture land , with numerous fine farms . The apples and cider of the north are as noted for their superior quality as the peaches of the south . The industry of the inhabitants is chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ports of New York and Pennsylvania ; the north-eastern corner is , however , the seat of flourishing manufactures . The shad and oyster fisheries in the rivers and great estuaries that border on the State , afford a profitable employment to many of the inhabitants . The value of the iron manufactures was estimated , in 1830 , at about 1,000,000 dollars annually ; of glass , 500,000 ; of cottons , 2,000,000 ; of woollens , 250,000 ; but all these branches have very much increased since that time . Hats , boots and shoes , carriages , harness , &c.,; are also largely produced . /z/ The system of common school instruction has hitherto been defective ; but , in consequence of the recent efforts of the friends of education , measures have been commenced which promise cheering results . The State possesses a school-fund , which commenced in 1816 . The income from it , which is about $22,000 , is annually distributed , in small sums , to such towns as raise an equal amount for the support of schools . There are two colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Nassau Hall , at Princeton , is a highly respectable institution ; it has thirteen instructors , upwards of 200 students , a library of 8000 volumes , &c.; Rutgers College , at New Brunswick , was founded by the Dutch Reformed Church , and has a theological seminary connected with it . The Presbyterians have also a distinguished theological school at Princeton . There are several academies and high schools in the State . The Presbyterians are the prevalent sect ; but the Baptists , Methodists , Dutch Reformed , Episcopalians , and Friends , are numerous , and there are some Roman Catholics , Universalists , &c.; Several important canal and rail-road routes connect the eastern and western waters , or unite different sections of the State . The Morris canal extends from Jersey City to the Delaware opposite Easton , 102 miles ; inclined planes have been in part used instead of locks , and the boats raised and let down in a frame or cradle , moved by water-power . The Delaware and Raritan canal , uniting the navigable waters of the rivers from which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to New Brunswick , 45 miles , admitting vessels of 100 tons ; a navigable feeder , 23 miles in length , extends from Bull 's Island , in the Delaware , to Trenton . The Camden and Amboy rail-road is an important work on the great line of travel between the north and south , 61 miles in length . The Paterson and Hudson rail-road , from Paterson to Jersey City , opposite New York , is 14 miles long ; the New Jersey rail-road extends from New Brunswick , through Newark , to the last-mentioned road , a few miles from the Hudson ; length , 28 miles . The Camden and Woodbury rail-road , 8 miles , is in progress . The city of Trenton , on the east bank of the Delaware , at the head of sloop navigation , is the capital of the State . It is regularly laid out , and contains the State-House , State-Prison , and eight churches . A wooden bridge 1000 feet in length here crosses the river , just below the falls , and the Delaware and Raritan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-power for manufacturing purposes , and there are ten mills and manufactories in the vicinity . Population , 3925 . Ten miles from Trenton is the village of Princeton , the seat of New Jersey College , and celebrated in the revolutionary history for the action of January 3d , 1777 . The city of New Brunswick , at the head of sloop navigation on the Raritan , and at the termination of the Delaware and Raritan canal , and the New Jersey rail-road , is the depot of the produce of a fertile district , and a place of considerable trade . The upper streets are spacious and handsome , and command a fine prospect . Here are Rutgers College , and a theological seminary of the Dutch Reformed . The population of the city is about 6000 . At the mouth of the Raritan stands the city of Amboy , or Perth Amboy , with a good harbour , which is , however , little used . Elizabethtown is a pretty and thriving town near Newark Bay , with 3450 inhabitants ; it contains several mills . The city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , stands on the Passaic , three miles from Newark Bay , and has easy communication with New York by means of steam-boats and the New Jersey rail-road ; the Morris canal also passes through the city . Newark is prettily situated and well built , with spacious streets and handsome houses , many of which are ornamented with fine shade trees . The manufactures are extensive , and its surplus produce sent off is estimated to amount to 8,000,000 dollars yearly . Carriages , shoes and boots , saddlery , jewelry , hats , furniture , &c,; are among the articles produced . The population in 1830 was 10,953 , in 1835 about 16,000 . Paterson , at the falls of the Passaic , which afford an immense water-power , and are extensively applied to economical purposes , is one of the principal manufacturing towns in the country . Here are cotton-mills , with numerous other works , such as paper-mills , machineshops , button factories , iron and brass founderies , nail factories , woollen-mills , &c.; /q/ The town contains ten churches , and the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1835 . Below Trenton , on the Delaware , is Bordentown , pleasantly situated on elevated ground overlooking the river , and standing at the termination of the Delaware and Raritan canal . The city of Burlington , below Bordentown , is also a neat little town prettily situated on the banks of the river , with 2670 inhabitants . Steam-boats from Philadelphia touch at these places several times a day . The city of Camden , opposite Philadelphia , carries on some branches of manufacturing industry ; ten steam ferry-boats are constantly plying between the two cities . Population , 2340 . New Jersey is divided into 14 counties , which are subdivided into 120 townships . Owing to the great emigration , the population increased slowly until 1820 , but since that time the increase has been more rapid , on account of the growth of manufactures . /z/ East and West Jersey , in 1701 , 15,000 ; in 1749 , 60,000 .

Its greatest length , from east to west , is 307 miles , and its breadth 157 ; area , 46,000 square miles . The principal rivers are the Delaware , Schuylkill , Lehigh , Susquehannah , Juniata , Alleghany , Monongahela , and Ohio . The various ridges of the Alleghany range intersect the central parts of this State , whose general direction is from south-west to north-east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rich black soil , suited well to the various kinds of grass and grain . Some of the mountains admit of cultivation almost to their summits . No State in die Union shows to the passing traveller a richer agriculture than this . It is emphatically a grain country , raising the greatest abundance of fine wheat . It produces all the fruits and productions of the northern and middle States , and is particularly famous for the great size , strength , and excellence , of its breed of draught horses . Pennsylvania spreads a wide surface in the Ohio valley , and is rapidly advancing in wealth and population . New towns and villages are springing up in every direction . The State abounds in all the elements of wealth and power . Public opinion has given it a strong impulse towards manufactures , and it has a gigantic system of internal improvements . Its inhabitants , though composed of all nations , are distinguished for their habits of order , industry , and frugality . The passing stranger , as he traverses the State , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-cultivated farms and their commodious and imperishable stone houses , and often still larger stone barns . An agricultural country , alike charming and rich , spreads under his eye . The mineral wealth of Pennsylvania is very great , and , although but recently i /z/ begun to be developed , already gives an earnest of future importance . Coal , iron , and salt , occur in vast quantities . The coal of Pennsylvania is of two kinds , the Anthracite and Bituminous , which are quite distinct in their qualities and localities . The first is found in the eastern part of the State , between the Delaware and Susquehannah Rivers , and is estimated to cover an extent of about 624,000 acres . In 1835 , the quantity sent from the coal region , exclusive of that shipped by the Susquehannah , was upwards of 600,000 tons , valued at more than 3,000,000 dollars . The bituminous coal is found in the western parts of the State : it is supposed that about 460,000 tons are annually consumed in Pittsburgh , and at the different salt-works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river Ohio to Cincinnati , New Orleans , and other towns . About 1,000,000 bushels of salt are manufactured yearly at the works on the Kiskiminetas , Alleghany , and Beaver . Iron ore of an excellent quality is abundant and extensively wrought . The iron-mines in the eastern part of the State were explored and worked at an early period of colonial settlement , and had become an interest of great value before the Revolution . Since the peace of 1783 , with much fluctuation , iron has at all times employed a vast amount of capital and labour . In 1832 , upwards of 60 furnaces , and 100 forges , produced near 90,000 tons of pig iron , blooms , bar iron , and castings ; and no doubt the amount has much increased since that time . The manufactures of Pennsylvania constitute an important branch of its industry ; they include cotton and woollen goods , iron ware of all kinds , manufactures of leather , hats , paper , furniture , porcelain , &e.; In the year 1832 , there were 67 cotton factories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and making annually 21,332,667 yards of cloth . The total value of manufactures , including about 250 different articles , is estimated at upwards of 70,000,000 dollars . The foreign commerce of Pennsylvania is in part carried on through New York , Baltimore , and New Orleans ; and its actual amount can not therefore be fully ascertained . The value of the direct imports in 1834 , was 12,389,937 dollars ; of exports , 3,739,275 dollars ; an . active inland trade is prosecuted on her canals , on Lake Erie , and on the Ohio ; and her coasting-trade is extensive and valuable . The shipping belonging to the State , in 1835 , amounted to 78,993 tons . Little attention has been paid to the education of the people in this State , and , notwithstanding an express injunction of the constitution , no attempt was made to establish a general system of popular instruction , until 1834 , when an act was passed for that purpose , which was modified io 1836 . This act authorizes the towns to raise money for the support of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State school-fund among those towns which shall adopt the school system . Ample provision has , however , been made for the gratuitous instruction of poor children in the county of Philadelphia , in which about 9500 annually enjoy its benefits . There are in the State 55 academies , 2 universities , 8 colleges , 5 theological seminaries , and 2 medical schools . The University of Pennsylvania is in Philadelphia , and the medical school connected with it is the most distinguished and most fully attended in the United States . The Western University is at Pittsburgh . Jefferson College , at Canonsburg , which has a medical department in Philadelphia ; Dickinson College , at Carlisle ; Alleghany College , at Meadville ; Washington College , at Washington ; Pennsylvania College , at Gettysburg ; Lafayette College , at Easton ; the Manual Labour Collegiate Institution , at Bristol ; and Marshall College , at Mercersburg , are now in operation . Girard College , endowed with a fund of 2,000,000 dollars , by Mr. Girard , and intended for the support and education of destitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterians are the most numerous religious sects . The Lutherans , Baptists , German Reformed , and Friends , rank next in point of numbers ; after them , come Episcopalians and Roman Catholics , with some Moravians or United Brethren , Dutch Reformed , Universalists , &c.; The works for the improvement of internal intercommunication have been executed partly by the State , and partly by individuals , on a grand scale . Those of /q/ the State consist of several divisions composed of rail-roads and canals , extending across the country from tide-water to the Ohio , and branching off in different directions to almost every section of the State . The grand trunk extends from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh , a distance , by this route , of 400 miles . The first division of the work , from Philadelphia to Columbia on the Susquehannah , is a rail-road , 81 miles in length . At Columbia , the canal begins , and is continued up the Susquehannah and Juniata , to Holidaysburg , 172 miles . The canal is 40 feet wide at top , and 4 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alleghany Portage Rail-road , 37 miles in length , with a rise and fall of 2570 feet : the summit-level is 2490 feet above the sea . At Johnstown , the route is again continued by a canal , down the Kiskiminetas and Alleghany , to Pittsburgh , 104 miles . A branch of this great undertaking is the Susquehannah canal , extending from the mouth of the Juniata , up the Susquehannah and the North Branch , to the mouth of the Lackawanna , 115 miles : a second lateral division runs up the West Branch , to Dunnstown , 66 miles , The Delaware branch extends from Bristol to Easton , 60 miles : the Beaver branch , from the town of the name , up the Big Beaver and Shenango rivers , to Newcastle , affords a navigable channel of 30 miles , by means of eight miles of excavation , and seven dams in the river . The French Creek branch extends up that river , from Franklin , at its mouth , to Meadville and Conneaut Lake ; total length , 46 miles , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles is by excavation . Appropriations were also made in the spring of 1836 , for continuing the Susquehannah branch towards the State line ; for extending the West Branch division ; for continuing the canal in the western part of the State toward Erie ; and for ascertaining , by surveys , the practicability of connecting the West Branch with the Alleghany , by a canal . The principal works constructed by individuals are as follows : the Lackawaxen canal , extending from the mouth of that river , on the Delaware , to Honesdale , 25 miles , whence it is continued by a rail-road to Carbondale coal-mines , miles : the cost of these works was 2,000,000 dollars . The Lehigh canal starts from the termination of the Morris and Delaware canals , and goes to White Haven , 66 miles : the Mauch Chunk , Room Run , and Beaver Meadow rail-roads , connect this canal with the first and second coal basins . The Schuylkill canal connects Port Carbon with Philadelphia , by a succession of pools and canals ; the whole length of the navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,500,000 dollars . About 50 miles of rail-road branch from this canal to various collieries . The Union canal ' connects the Schuylkill at Reading with the Susquehannah at Middletown , 82 miles . A lateral branch to Pine Grove , 23 miles up the Swatara , is connected by a rail-road with the coal-mines . The Union canal , by the junction of the Grand Trunk and the Schuylkill canals , affords uninterrupted navigation from Philadelphia to the Lackawanna , Dunnstown , and Holidaysburg . The Susquehannah canal , from Columbia to Port Deposit , 40 miles , connects the main trunk of the Pennsylvania canal with tide-water . The Nescopeck canal , in progress , will connect the Lehigh with the North Branch of the Susquehannah . The principal rail-roads , exclusive of those in the coal region , which make an aggregate of about 100 miles , are the Philadelphia and Trenton rail-road , connecting those two cities , 26 miles ; the Philadelphia and Norristown , 17 miles , which is to be continued to . Reading ; the Central rail-road from Pottsville to Sunbury , 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Delaware railroad , 17 miles , is a part of the line of rail-road by Wilmington to Baltimore , now in progress . The Oxford rail-road , from Coatesville , on the Columbia rail-road , to Port Deposit , 31 miles ; the Lancaster and Harrisburg rail-road , 37 miles ; the Cumberland Valley rail-road , from the Susquehannah opposite Harrisburg , to Chambersburg , 49 miles ; the Wrightsville and Gettysburg rail-road , from Colum bia , through York , to Gettysburg , 40 miles ; the Susquehannah and Little Schuyl kill rail-road , from Catawissa to Tamaqua ; the Williamsport and Elmira rail-road from the West Branch to the Tioga , 70 miles ; and the continuation of the Baltr more and Susquehannah , from the Maryland line , through York , to the Susque hannah , are in progress .
