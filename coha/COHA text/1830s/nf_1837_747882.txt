It is agreed by those who have Ch . II . Legislation on Patent Rights . 5 seriously considered the subject , that no individual has , of natural right , a separate property in an acre of land ; for instance , by an universal law , indeed whatever , whether fixed or movable , belongs to all men equally and in common , is the property for the moment of him who occupies it ; but when he relinquishes the occupation the property goes with it . Stable ownership is the gift of social law , and is given late in the progress of society : it would be curious then if an idea , the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain , could of natural right be claimed in exclusive and stable property . If nature has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive property , it is the action of the thinking power called an idea ; which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself , but the moment it is divulged , it forces itself into the possession of every one , and the receiver can not dispossess himself of it . Its peculiar character too is that no one possesses the less because every other possesses the whole of it . He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mine ; as he who lights his taper at mine receives light without darkening me . That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe for the moral and mutual instruction of man and improvement of his /z/ 6 Principles and Motives of the Ch .

Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility . But this may or may not be done according to the will and convenience of the society , without claim or complaint from any body . Accordingly it is a fact , as far as I am informed , that England was , until we copied her , the only country on earth which ever , by a general law , gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea . In some other countries it is sometimes done in a great case and by a special and personal act ; but generally speaking other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society ; and it may be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of inventions are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices . " ' Letter dated August 13 , 1813 . Journal of the Franklin InsUtute . Vol . XVII. p. 97 . Feb. 1836 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renouard , the author of an elaborate French work on patents , goes into a particular discussion of the question whether an inventor has , by the principles of universal equity , and independently of the positive law , an exclusive right to his invention ; and he very satisfactorily establishes the conclusion to which every mind is constrained to yield assent , that no such natural right exists . Indeed there is no plausible ground whatever on which to rest such a right , since the fact of one person being the first inventor or discoverer , affords no pretence for disfranchising others of the right in their turn , of making and using the same discovery . If then there is no such original right , the question naturally arises , whether the law , granting the exclusive privilege to an inventor , is not unjust ? whether it does not wrong other persons , ' by depriving them of their natural rights ? It undoubtedly does take away rights which they would otherwise have , but it does not thence follow that it is unjust . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would enjoy , if each one existed in a state of entire independence of all others , if such a condition were possible ; but it does not thence follow that the laws are injurious to any one , since they give more than an equivalent for what they take away . The rights 8 Principles and Motives of the Ch. 11. taken from the members of the community generally , are , first , that of beneficially inventing the same thing , independently of the prior invention , and that of using and vending it for a limited time ; and second , the right of profiting by the prior invention or discovery of another , for a limited time . This last right is evidently subject to some qualification , for it is certainly just that the inventor should have a greater advantage of his invention than others , whereas if he 13 exposed to a universal competition in the manufacture and use of his invention , the probability is , that others will turn it to better account than he can himself , since the chances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecuting the manufacture and selling the article . Without some assistance from the legislature , therefore , he will be deprived of what he is equitably entitled to . If it be then admitted that he is equitably entitled to the exclusive use and sale for a time , against all others who do not make the same invention independently of him , and without deriving any hint or facility from his prior ingenuity or experiments , we have sufficient ground for a law giving him the exclusive right against aU others for a time , since it is a matter of too much difficulty and intricacy of proof , to distinguish the cases of others who have made the same invention Ch. n . Legislation on Patent Bights. 9 without any assistance from his ingenuity , from those of mere imitations . The law , in order to be practicable and convenient to be administered , must give the exclusive right . To this point the law is only an equitable regulation , which does not propose to deprive others of any right in behalf of inventors , but incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , because it is necessary for the purpose of doing justice to inventors . The granting of patents is not , accordingly , a mere matter of favor , as it has sometimes been represented by judges , ' but an equitable and just claim upon the government , as much so as the claim to protection ol individual industry and private property . ' The patentee , " says Lord Eldon , is a purchaser from the public , being bound to communicate his secret to the public at the expiration of his patent . " ' Thb right is recognised in very strong and absolute terms in the decree of the French National Assembly. * The language is , ' Every new idea , of which the manifestation or development might be usefril to society , apper- * ** Although/ ' says Mr. Justice Bay ley , " the thiog may be new in every particular , it is in the judgment of the Crown whether it will or will not , as a matter offavoTf make the grant .

" This language is , however , too comprehensive , as we have already suggested , that the granting of a perpetual exclusive right to an invention , would be a material retrenchment of the rights of others , and so the National Assembly doubtless considered it ; for after this preamble they proceed , not to grant such a perpetual privilege , but only a temporary monopoly . M. Renouard remarks , that ' an inventor has not , independently of positive laws , any exclusive property in his invention , any longer than he keeps it secret . " That is , others have a right to make the same discovery themselves independently of him , or to avail themselves of the inventor 's disclosure of his secret , " and this conflicting right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely defeats , any advantage to the inventor from a right universally admitted ; for he often can not use his invention , and at the same time keep it secret , and thus the very attempt to obtain the benefit of his discovery , forfeits it . This strengthens his claim on society , for it is precisely the /z/ 82 , c. 2 , B. I. Ch. li . Legislation on Patent Rights . 11 case of an individual too weak to protect himself and who , therefore , asks the protection of the community . If he is able to keep his secret , and yet turn it to profitable account , his case is that of the head of a powerful party or clan , who is able to defend and protect himself without the aid of a superior power . Such an inventor is in a condition to make his own terms with the community for the surrender of his secret ; and when the terms proposed by the laws are not satisfactory to him he may reject them . This is , however , true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genera , at most only lock up their secret in their own breasts , not being able to turn it to any advantage to themselves , except by means of a law enacted in their behalf . Their claim on the community therefore , for interposition in their behalf , is exceedingly strong ; they are entitled to assistance from the combined authority of the community , and it is essentially necessary to them . Though property in a discovery , therefore , like that in land , originates in and is created by legislation , the right to such property exists to an imperfect degree , independently of the positive laws . In this view Mr. Rawle remarks , upon the provisions of the constitution of the United States on this subject , that it was not intended thereby to create rights , but merely to 12 Prindphs and Motives of the Oh . II . regulate those already existing . ' The inventor has a right to keep his secret , and if he discloses it he has a just claim to remuneration and reward , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement . Many people form an erroneous notion of the kind of merit , and the degree of application , requisite for making improvements in manufactures . They seem to imagine that most of those improvements are lucky hits , which it is only surprising that nobody ever made before ; and so they are unwilling to bestow rewards with liberality on such as they conceive owe their success to fortunate accident , rather than to merit . Yet a little reflection may show how erroneous this opinion is . The great mass of useful inventions is made up , and must be , not of what is altogether new , but of improvements in what is already practised . Such improvements , it is also to be remembered , are more eagerly sought after , and by a greater number of competitors , when manufactures have so far advanced as to employ many hands in a single branch . Since then it must be a very limited branch that employs only a thousand persons ; how is it probable , that in a business where at least that number have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 102 . Ed. of 1825 . Ch . II . Legislation on Patent Rights . 13 employed for years , any improvement can come to be discoyered by chance ? Is it not obvious that all the improvements mere chance could bring about , are likely to be discovered at a very early period of such a business ; more especially under the operation of a patent law , to give to every eye the quick-sightedness of self-interest ? Tet persons are heard thoughtless enough to exclaim , of such an improvement as James Watt 's on the steam-engine , ' How simple ! and how wonderful nobody ever found it out before ! ' They that say of such an invention , How simple ! ' should consider what they mean . If the simplicity they speak of , refers to the adaptation of the means to the end , they are quite right . In this acceptance , simplicity is the very highest merit of an invention ; for of all the means that can be used to effect a given end , the simplest are evidently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ' they mean how easy to be done , and how easy to be found out , they are as wrong as they can be . For if the contrivance was thus easy to be hit upon , why had it been missed by the numerous persons engaged for so many years before , in the making , in the working , and even in the improving of steam engines ? The very simplicity of an invention , which leads the inex* perieoced to infer little merit or application in the /z/ 14 Principles and Motives of the Cb . IL inventor , is most commonly the sequel of complications , which in succession have been contrived by him , and in succession been rejected . Indeed , who that ever cast a glance of intelligent observation upon our manufactures , or that has ever been struck with the combined simplicity and efficacy of the means employed , can do otherwise than infer that any one of the means that he admires , must have been selected for superiority , when perhaps a thousand others have been rejected ? So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious to adopt , whoever has opportunities of watching young persons beginning to cultivate any branch of experimental science , may observe that complicated means to effect an end are those they try first ; and indeed , whenever there is witnessed , as in the case of Watt , an early or immediate adoption of simple means to accomplish a desirable end , it is safe to infer the possession of great powers , such as experience , in their exercise , can alone inspire . In the attempt of Watt , the only circumstance that can be attributed to chance , was that a working model of a steam engine came into his bands to be repaired . But what made that model suggest to his mind , inquiries and doubts that had never struck any mind before ? No one can read the simple account of his discovery , as given by himself Cb . II . Legislation on Patent Rights . 15 in hb Notes to Dr. Robinson 's Works , without being satisfied that when that model came into bis bands , it was to undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form had ever before been subjected to . " ' Another reason for granting this species of monopoly , is , that the whole community has an interest in the advancement of the useful arts , since the greater the perfection to which they are brought , the greater will be the amount of necessaries , conveniences , comforts , luxuries and amusements , within reach of every one , for the same expense . Thb presents a good reason , not merely for indemnifying the inventor or improver of an art , for his expense of time , labor and outlay , but also for giving him an absolute reward . It would be considered paltry to maintain that a general , who had achieved a victory , was sufficiently compensated by his pay , during the time he gave to the achievement . He is considered a benefactor to his country , and as such , entitled not merely to his pay , but to a reward . So is the inventor of a useful art a benefactor to his country , and to the whole civilized world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a debt due to him ; not one that he can demand by virtue of the law of nature , and independently of all civil insti- 7 Westminster Review , No. 43 , for January , 1835. 16 Principles and Motives of the Ch . II . tutionsi but one which it ought to be the early care of the positive laws to acknowledge and satisfy . Without some encouragement and hope of indemnity for expenses , held out by the law , many inventions , after being made , would not be rendered practically useful . * Very few inventions in manufactures are perfect , when iSrst contrived and introdticed into practice . Much further improvement is often peedful , in order to overcome unforeseen difficulties , and to meet all the wants of a manufacture conducted on a large scale . Prejudice , too , has to be overcome* The sanction of experience is wanting to confirm the advantage , and still more the permanence of the improvement . After Watt had taken out his patent , he was six years before he succeeded in making one steam engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , as bis patent and specification show it to have been . Part of this time was lost , perhaps , by inactivity ; another part by the failure of Roebuck , of the Carron Works , with whom he first associated himself , and perhaps a still greater part was owing to the imperfection of machinery in his time . But , making allowances for these causes of delay , still it is true that at least three or four years were necessary , to obviate the practical difficulties that lay in the way of making such an engine well , for the first time . Such difficul- Ch . II . Legislation an Patent Rights . 17 ties , and others too , attend all important new inventions in manufactures . The bringing of them into notice , the gaining of confidence in their permanence and worth , and the overcoming of prejudice against them , on account of their very novelty , require time , care , and much outlay . To insure success in such an undertaking , it is not unusual to spend years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to employ travellers , and advertise extensively , in order to bring the invention into general notice , to make a great outlay in order to establish the new manufacture , merely as an example for others to follow , or sometimes a greater outlay in order to get it establbhed on a large scale , so as to admit of a subdivision of labor , and the perfection of it in ail its parts . Now without the encouragement of a patent , how is any man to engage in a novel and expensive process , if the moment he succeeds , at the cost of all this outlay , he must be sure that his neighbors , who were cautious enough to shun all chances of loss , will come into competition with him , and make the remuneration of all this outlay impossible ? A landlord , possessing a farm that could not be made productive , till after the lapse of years , with continued cultivation and much outlay , will never get it rented without granting a lease ; and unless he makes such a grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IL or undertakes the labor and expense himself , the farm will remain for ever unproductive . Quite similar is the policy of granting patents , which may be considered leases for the cultivation of unprofitable farms , of manufactures , granted partly to reward the merit of invention , and partly to remunerate the cost attending the introduction of the improvement , and its early and unprofitable cultivation . By so granting patents , the country may hope , at the end of their term , to possess the new manufacture , in a profitable form ; whereas , by refusing patents , or withholding from them adequate protection , it will either not possess the inventions , or , if it do possess them , it will be in the form of unapplied and barren suggestions* Give the husbandman security that he may sit ' under his own vine , and his own fig tree , ' and the magic of that security will raise the vine and the fig tree , where else would be the barren wilderness . Watt , it has been said , spent six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . The late Lord Norton , of Leith , the inventor of the patent slip , as a substitute for dry docks , lost the same time , before his patent became profitable to him , although he brought the invention early into use . A like loss of time prior to the invention becoming productive , appears from inquiry , to be an almost constant occurrence in important inventions . /q/ Here is the authority of Mr. Farey in the report ** of the committee of the House of Commons , on the subject of patents , in June , 1833 , " for saying , that the expense of making the first steam engine on the plan of Watt , was such as no maker could have been rema** nerated for , by any subsequent profit he could make without the aid of what accrued from the patent , or some other extraneous source . And indeed , but fiir the security which Watt erroneously conceived the patent law to affird , there is little doubt that the invention might at this day have been sneeringly recorded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion exceedingly ingenious in theory , but altogether useless in practice . ' " The principles and motives of patent laws , then , are , 1 , the securing to the inventor the remuneration of his outlay ; 2 , a reward for his ingenuity , and the benefit he confers on the community ; and 3 , to encourage and stimulate the inventive faculties of men for the benefit of society. * Westminster Review , No. 43 . January , 1835. p. 94 . Foster 's Am . Edition . - Per Story J. 1 Mason R. 182 . See Holt 's N. P. C 58. n . Though monopolies , in the eye of the law , are odious , says Lord C. J. Erye , 2 H. B. 500 , the consideration of the privilege created by thitf patent is meritorious , because , to use the words of Lord Coke , the inventor bringeth to and for the commonwealth a new manufacture by his invention , costs and charges .

He was the son of an actor , and had himself written a play , which , however , he was too poor to get printed .

Not by any chance , not by a first lucky hit , but by contrivance , by experiment , by perseverance amid disappointment , and by knowledge obtained fiom failures , he succeeded in accomplishing this daring elBTort of his genius , and discovering an art which , if it can not vie with other ways of printing for extensive utility , will yet , for inventive merit , and with reference to the hopelessness of the rude but simple materials whereby it is worked , ever be ranked among the most wonderful of human inventions .

SI tion being , then , in the first place , to indemnify mventors , in the second to secure to the public the benefit of invention , and stimulate ingenious minds to make improvements , and , in the third place , to reward the inventors as public benefactors , according to the importance of their inventions , it follows that the earlier or later disclosure of the secret , and the investing of the public with the benefits of the discovery , are essential conditions of the grant of protection and reward . It is , as M. Renouard says , an exchange between the two parties , the inventor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or machine , and the community on the other , which grants in return to the inventor , indemnity and compensation . But as the publicity of the invention is a matter of public interest more especially , it may be dispensed with by an act of special legislation , a right to which is reserved by the government , to be used , when , from fear of benefiting a public enemy or a foreign competitor in the market , the advantages are supposed to be on the side of secrecy ; " though this latter ground is now mostly abandoned , and the former is , at the most , but occasional and temporary . /z/ " Renouu-d , c. 7 , i. 2 , p. 276 , Gd . of 1895. 9S DiffererU Kinds of Ch .

The inventor , then , having a just claim to remuneration and reward , we come next to the question what kinds of remuneration and reward are practicable abd suitable . And in this respect the community is not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enjoyment of the advantages of the use of his invention . Rewards in money have in many instances been promised before hand , or awarded subsequently , for discoveries . The divine honors , paid by the Greeks and other ancient nations to those who were public benefactors by their useful discoveries , originated in the principle upon which modern patent laws are founded , though the kind of reward bestowed in the two cases is different . In some instances the inventor can not be rewarded directly out of the fruits of his invention . This is the case with many discoveries in science . Were any philosopher to discover a certain and easy method of squaring the circle , he could not be rewarded by a grant of a monopoly of the advantage , if it consisted in mere calculation . The British government offered a reward for an improve- Ch . III . Encouragement to the Arts . S3 ment in the mode of ascertaining the longitude . Public grants have been made to Mr. Babbage in consideration of the utility of his calculating machine . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invention was not considered a practicable or a suitable or an adequate compensation to the inventor . The French government , accordingly , by a law of 1791 , provided for the annual distribution of 300,000 livres to artists ibr labors and discoveries in the useful arts , no part of which is to be given for improvements for which patents are taken out . But this species of reward is liable to much abuse by imposition on the officers of the government to whom the decision on claims is committed , and also by partiality and favoritism on their part in assigning the reward . A writer , already cited , ' instances the 5000 guineas paid to Dr. Smith for the ' discovery of nitric fiimigation to prevent the communication of contagion , " and says , were the reward to be granted now , ' when time and experience enable the public to estimate the value of the nostrum , five pence might be considered a reward somewhat above its value .

In the great mass of instances of useful improvements , however a temporary monopoly is not only the most appropriate reward , since it is the direct fruit of the improvement , and the most equitable , since it is graduated according to its utility , in the public estimation ; and the most convenient , since , as M. Renouard justly remarks , the inventor is saved from the mistakes , favoritism and prejudices of censors , and the public from being imposed upon by charletans and pretenders . This system has accordingly been adopted throughout the civilized world as the most suitable general mode of rewarding improvements in the useful arts ; not excluding other modes , however , in special cases . The writer in the Westminster Review , already cited , mentions a third mode of encouraging improvements in the arts adopted in some countries , by the establishment of professorships for the purpose . Where a regular routine of duties is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed with any extraordinary inventive power , or transported by enthusiasm , professorships may be very usefully instituted . 2 , 8. 3 , p. 42 . He does not oppose this mode of encouragement on the general objection to all bounties as interfering with the freedom of industry and checking competition , since this ground of objection is as inconsistent with patent laws themselves , as it is with other modes of encouragement . * No. 43 , January , 1835 . Ch . III . Encouragement to the Arts . 25 So salaries , as well as other incitements , niay be held out as rewards for inventions , as well as for excellence in the practice of any art , or the knowledge of any science . The appointment of Poet-Laureate in England is of this description .

But it is not practicable to carry this system of encouragement to all the innumerable useful and ornamental arts by which the condition of men is ameliorated , and civilized society adorned . A stimulus must be applied , and a helping hand held out to genius in the lowest walks of life , in the workshops and in the fields . The encouragement should be proffered freely , so as to be attainable without solicitation , and without the intervention of influence , power , and great names , so that genius may work its way in solitude , borne forward only by the impulse of its own enthusiasm . For this purpose a limited monopoly , a temporary enjoyment of all the advantages of a discovery , is not only the most appropriate , but by far the most effectual encouragement in a great majority of improvements in the useful arts . /z/ General Provisions of Ch .

It would be a wrong to the community at large . It would , besides , be highly prejudicial and even dangerous to the general interest , to lock up the useful arts that may minister to the necessities and wellbeing of the great mass of society in a few hands . All laws of this description , therefore , give only a temporary monopoly . They offer a compromise between the inventor and the rest of the community , by which each party surrenders something , and it is proposed that each shall receive an equivalent . /z/ General Provisions of the Patent Laws . The first question in devising a patent law relates to the subject for which a patent shall be granted .

The notion of those in favor of thus extending the privilege was , that if an inventor had discovered this application of the power of steam he should have the monopoly of it for the accustomed period , not only in the way particularly specified by him , but in all other modes , or in other words , bis patent should be a prohibition of all use of power for mechanical purposes during the period of the patent . But others were decidedly opposed to this extension of the exclusive privilege , ' and I can not but think that these This subject is discussed at pages 11. 15. 35. 36. 39. and 76. of the Report , and perhaps in others also , which I have not noted .

Perhaps , however , he has exhibited the principle in one or more modes of execution . But in this case the public may be just where they were , , in respect to all other modes essentially diiSerent fiom his , and if he ought not to have a monopoly of the naked principle without any practical application , his monopoly ought to be confined to the practical applin cation which he has invented .

The object of this provision apparently is to prevent foreigners from taking out patents here , merely to prevent their inventions from being prac-* tised by others in the United States , that they may thus command our market for a supply , fiom a foreign manufactory , or , in other words , secure a foreign monopoly of our market . This is a very reasonable condition , in regard to this sort of patents . The French law imposes a similar condition on all patents , by providing that they shall be forfeited if the invention be not reduced to practice within two years , though it does not require the continuance of the use for any particular period . The ground of this provision may be the presumed abandonment of the invention by the inventor , so that the words of the Jaw , if they expressed its principle , would be that a patentee who does not reduce his invention to use within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presumed to have dedicated it to the public . The law of the Netherlands follows that of France. * The - Law of Jan. 25th , 1817 , art . 8. 38 ' General Provisions of Ch . IV . laws of Austria and Spain are still more strict , and require the inyention to be reduced to practice under the patent within one year , under penalty of forfeiting the privilege/ The law of Great Britain has no such requisition ; nor has that of the United States , excepting in the case above mendoned , of an alien patentee domiciled abroad . A question was raised in the investigations of the special committee of the British House of Commons in 18S9 , whether patents ought to be granted for patterns /z/ for calicoes , ribbons , &c.^; But this seems rather to be a question under the law of copyright . Another difficult subject of legislation relates to the novelty of the invention . The very term invention implies novelty , but where must it be novel and when must it be so ? The English , French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is novel within the country ; if it has not been described in any printed work at home or abroad , then , though it may have been prac  - -  tised abroad , still it is a good subject of a patent by either of those laws . Some of the laws go farther ; in England the invention is new , though described * AustrUn Decree of Dec. 8Ui , 1880 , ch.4 , art . 23 ; Spanish Uw of March 27th , b26 , art 21. 7 Rep. p. 27. 34. 90 . Ch . IV. the Patent Lam. 33 abroad in a work circulated abroad , if not described in some publication circulated in England , and it has not been used there . According to the French law , if the thing has been described in any printed and published work , whether in France or elsewhere , it is no longer novel . And M. Renouard considers a publication in the French or a foreign language to have the same effect . The Austrian , Belgian , and American laws agree with that of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , that the invention , as far as its novelty is to be affected by a previous publicatiou merely , is to be considered novel , unless it is described in some book , engraving , picture , model or plan in the Royal Conservatory of Arts. * Such is a general outline of the provisions of the patent laws as to the place where the invention must be new . Secondly , when does the law require that the invention shall be new , at the time of the invention being made by the applicant for a patent , or at the time of his application , or at the date of his patent ? The American law is satisfied if it be novel at the ' Law of January 7th , 1791 , art . 16. - C. 6 , aft . 27 . " Art . 7 . " French Law of Jan. 25th , 1817 , art . 8 ) act of congress of July 1836 , c. 357 , 8. 7 . Law of March 36 , 1826 , art . 21 , 34 General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the applicant ; the French , Belgian , Austrian and Spanish laws seem to be satisfied if the invention is original at the time of the applicant for a patent having made his invention , if he succeeds in first obtaining a patent . But by the American law the first inventor is entitled to a patent , unless , by his unreasonable delay he forfeits the privilege , though a subsequent inventor anticipates him in taking out a patent ; and the earlier patent thus taken out by the later inventor will be superseded by that of the first inventor , though subsequent in date . By all these laws , if the first inventor obtains his patent before others , and by the ' American law , whether he obtains it before or after others , his patent is good . This refers the question of novelty to the time of the invention . The English law , on the con* trary , as to the novelty of the invention , has , heretofore referred to the date of the patent . By that law if any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even after the first inventor has applied for his patent , his privilege was defeated . This defect in the British law is much dwelt upon by the persons who made statements on the subject before the committee of the Commons in 1829 . " The British act , passed Ilep. p. 9. 10. 18. 19. 20. 74. 75. 76. 82 . Ch . IV. the Patent Lam. 36 in 1835 , provides that if an applicant believes himself to be the inventor , but it is proved in the sequel that his invention was not original and new at the date of the patent , his patent may , notwithstanding , be confirmed by the council of state . This provision is an approximation to the American law upon this subject , being intended no doubt to remedy the former defect of the British law and the abuses and frauds which had taken place under it . How the provision will work in this respect remains to be proved . The constction put upon the American law by the courts is much more just , simple and effectual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the courts , notwithstanding that a later inventor or piratical infringer may have anticipated him in the date of his patents Such is a general outline of the provisions of the patent laws upon the subject of the novelty of the invention , the more particular construction of which , in the United States especially , will be considered subsequently . Another important provision of the patent laws is that which determines what persons , as to their national character , shall be entitled to take out a patent . And in this . respect the laws of the United States , Great Britain , France , the Netherlands , Spain and Austria , now agree in conceding the right to foreigners 36 Oeneral Provisions of Ch. domiciled abroad as well as to citizens , or to these and resident foreigners . The law of the United States of 1793 restricted the privilege to citizens , then extended it to aliens resident in the country for a certain period , and finally , in 1836 , to aliens domiciled abroad ; still however making a distinction by requiring them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States for one year who have made a formal declaration of an intention to become citizens . But foreigners have been in the practice of heretofore obtaining patents by special act of congress . " France , " Spain , the Netherlands , ' * mentioned above , permit it , and that of France " provides for the registering of assignments , that the public may have notice of them . The Austrian law provides that assignments may be made on special permission of the emperor . " The American law recognises the validity of an assignment made before the patent is taken out . * I understand from Dr. Jones , who is familiar with all the law and practice upon this subject , that not one of the patents granted in the United States on special acts of congress , is now in . use .  --  Law of January 7th , 1791 , and of March 27th , 1826 , art . 9 .

IV. the Patent Laws . 37 A patenti according to the definition already given , is a grant ; certified by a written document . The law must accordingly provide the steps necessary to be taken to obtain this grant . More preliminary precautions would be necessary in making it , if it were dbsdute , but , since it b taken by the patentee , subject to all the proYisions , and conditions , expressed in the patent itself , and the law , in inrtue of which it is granted , and confers no right whatever unless the patentee brings himself within those conditions , and , on the other hand , if he brings himself within those terms and conditions , his case is one for which the laws intended an exclusive privilege , it does seem to be necessary , to guard the grant with great formalities and preliminary investigations . The French , Spanish , and Belgian patents , contain a clause , that the government does not , by granting the patent , guaranty either the novelty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a variety of conditions , provided for by the laws ; so that it is on the whole nothing more than a certificate , that the patentee , having paid the legal fee and made oath that he is the inventor of a machine , method , or composition of matter , described in his specification , if he has really invented such a machine , it is useful , &c.; &c.,; shall be entitled to an exclusive use and sale of it for the term of years /z/ 38 General Provisions of Ch . IV . specified , but if he fails in any of these requisites he shall be entitled to no privilege at all . This is the practical construction of patents , as well in the United States , as in all the other countries above mentioned . Besides the conditions already mentioned , on which the validity of the patent rests , another , common to all the patent laws of the countries already mentioned , is , that the patentee shall make a full , and clear description of the thing , both to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at its expiration to give the public the benefit of his invention as a consideration for the grant of the privilege . The law itself gives one security for a compliance on the part of the patentee , with this condition , since by all the above patent laws , his failing to comply , defeats his privilege . Now , one of the most difficult questions as to legislation on patents , is , to detennine whether to leave the subject wholly to the operation of this condition , permitting the patentee to specify , as he chooses , at the hazard of not securing his privilege in case of his not giving a full , clear , and exact description , or to attempt , by a preliminary examination of the specification , to give the public an additional security for a proper specification . The problem is , whether it is most expedient to leave the question of the novelty and utility of the invention , and the suffi- Ch . IV. the Patent Laws . 39 ciency of the specification , to the discretion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some officer or board . All the patent laws do in fact , by their very terms and structure nominally commit a discretion on these questions , to some executive officer or board . And the exercise of some degree of discretion on these questions , seems to be necessary , since it would be derogatory to the dignity of the government , and inconsistent with ordinary administrative decorum , to grant even pretended exclusive privileges for the practice of scandalous , or grossly immoral , or illegal arts and processes . It was on a similar ground that Napoleon Bonaparte , when first consul , hesitated to sign a patent for what seemed to him a frivolous contrivance in acoustics , called the invisible woman , though his scruples were overcome in that particular case , by the introduction of the clause into the patent itself that the government did not , by granting it , guaranty the novelty or utility of the invention . The necessity of the exercise of some degree of discretion in this respect , arises from the fact of the direct agency of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the similar case of copyrights , there is no agency of any such officer in securing the privilege in Ekigland ; and in the United States the law does 40 General Provisions of Ch . IV . not forbid the clerk of the district court to receive the copy of a work , however immoral and illegal it may be , and thus the proprietor obtains just as good and authentic a recognition of an exclusive privilege to publish his work , as a patentee of an invention , which is liable to a similar objection , would obtain by his patent . In either case no privilege is in fact guarantied , since it is defeated by the law . But no complaint has been made in the case of copyrights , whereas that of patents has been much discussed . There is a difference , however , in the two cases ; first , on account of the direct agency of the higher officers of the government , in granting patents , which renders the question of decorum attd dignity , of more weight in that case ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full disclosure of the process of a useful manufacture ; and third , inasmuch as a patent trenches upon privileges , vhich other persoiis would have had , if the invention had not been made or patented . Though the patent laws are generally so worded as to give the right of exercising a discretion , as to granting the patent , and the officers entrusted with the execution of the law would no doubt exercise that discretion in a case of palpable immorality or illegality , yet no instance has occurred , as far as I am informed , of a rejection of an application for a Ch . IV. the Patent Laws . 41 patent upon those grounds . In the examinations already mentioned , by the committee of the House of Commons , in 1829 , the whole discussion related to the interest of the public ; firstly , in not allowing an imposition upon the comniunity , by a multiplicity of groundless patents , and secondly , in securing to the public a sufficient description of the thing patented , that they might have the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent is granted . It is evidently of importance to the public that sufficient specifications should be given , for the reasons above stated , and also the additional one , that other members of the community ought to have distinct notice of the extent of the exclusive privilege claimed that they may not unwittingly infringe upon it . This subject was one of the leading topics of inquiry by the committee of the Commons , ** and all the persons there examined , agree , and indeed in all the records of jurisprudence upon this subject the counsel and judges also agree , that it is of impoitance to the public that specifications should be clear and definite . But the great difficulty is in devising any mode of securing this object , other than the condition that a Rep. p. 7. 16. 24. 27. 30. 38. 41. 42. 44. 46. 55. 56. 67. 68. 74 , /z/ 42 Oeneral Protisions of Ch , IV . defect in the specification shall defeat the privilege of the patentee either partially or wholly . The mode proposed , and indeed the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or board with the preliminary jurisdiction of patents in these respects . Now , as already remarked , the very phraseology of the patent laws does generally invest the executive officers of the government with this discretion . Mr. Jefferson , in a letter written by him in 1813 , respecting Oliver Evans 's patent for improvements in flouring mills , which has been the subject of much litigation , incidentally states some circumstances that are applicable to our present subject . He says , ' I know well the difficulty of drawing a line between two things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent , and those which are not . As a member of the patent-board for several years , while the law authorized a board to grant or refuse patents , I saw with what slow progress a system of general rules could be matured . Some , however , were established , by that board . One of these was that a machine of which we were possessed , might be applied by every man to every use of which it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from him and given to a monopolist , because he first , perhaps , bad occasion so to apply it . Thus , a screw for crushing - f Ch . IV. the Patent Lawi. 43 plaster , might be employed for crushing corn-cobs ; and a chain pump for raising water , might be used for raising wheat ; this being merely a change of application . Another rule was , that a change of materials should not give title to a patent , as the making a ploughshare of cast rather than wrought iron ; a comb of iron instead of horn or of ivory ; or the connecting of buckets by a band of leather rather than of hemp or iron . A third , was that a mere change of form , should give no right to a patent ; as a high-quartered shoe instead of a low one ; a round hat instead of a threesquare ; or a square bucket instead of a round one ; but for this rule all the changes of fashion of dress would have been under the tax of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could not be brought under rule until they should have presented themselves under all their aspects ; and these investigations occupying more time of the members of the board than they could spare from higher duties , the whole was turned over to the judiciary , to be matured in a system under which every one might know when his actions were safe and lawful . Instead of refusing a patent in the first instance , as the board was authorized to do , the patent now issues of course subject to be declared void on such principles as should be established by the courts of law . This business , 44 General Provisions of Ch . IV . however , is but little analogous to their course of reading , since we might in vain turn over all the lubberly volumes of the law , to find a single ray which would lighten the path of the mechanic , or mathematician ; it is more within the information of a board of academical professors ; and a previous refusal of a patent would better guard our citizens against harassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges , and the usual predominancy of her example carried it to ours . " Such is the experience in the United States , in the * Journal of the Franklin Institute , 17 , p. 98 , 99 , No. for Feb. 1836 . Mr. Jefferson probably refers to the administration under the patent act of April 10th , 1790 , which was in force until the act of Feb. 21 , 1793 , was passed , during which period he was secretary of state , and by that law , it was provided that it should be * lawful for the secretary of state , the secretary for the department of war , and the attorney-general , or any two of them , if they shall deem the invention or discovery sufficiently useful and important , to cause letters patent to be made out , &c."; By turning the matter over to the judiciary , he probably refers to the act of Feb. 21 at , 1793 , in which are incorporated the rules above mentioned by Mr. Jefierson . The matter handed over to the judiciary was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the above board ; for the court does not exercise the discretionary power , with which the patent-board had been Tested . There is an apparent inconsistency in the remarks at the close of the extract , for a tribunal , such as Mr. Jefferson describes the courts to be , in reference to the subject of patents , would be very little likely to mature a system ** under which , every one might know when his actions were safe and lawful . " But the decisions of a judicial tribunal , proceeding in open court , where all interested parties are heard , are doubtleai Ch . IV. the Patent Laws . 45 matter of a board , invested with general discretionary power , as to granting patents . And I have not met with any other instance in which the whole question of making such grants has been referred to a board with authority to decide according to their opinion of the merits of the application generally . In France the proceeding in granting patents is in some degree analogous to that suggested by Mr. Jefferson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the public offices . If the committee find the specifications or drawings insufficient , they ask the applicant for written explanations , which are annexed to the specification . ' The committee , " says M. Perpigna , ** " is merely instituted to guard the applicants from throwing away their time and their money , upon patents which would upon a trial be most certainly repealed . If , therefore , the committee find that the invention presented as new , is already patented or become public property , they inform the petitioner of their opinion and invite him to renounce his demand , and withdraw the tax paid . those , under which every one has a better prospect of knowing ** when his actions are safe and lawAxl , " than under those of any other tribunal .  --  French Law of Patents , English Ed. published inPtris , ISW , p. 91. 46 Oeneral Provisions of Ch . IV . Ify notwithstaDdiog this waraing , he persists in his demand , the patent must be granted to him , but he runs the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " in illustration of which he instances Raymond 's application for a patent for paddle-wheels fixed at the stem of a steamboat , which the minister , on the suggestion of the consultative committee , advised him to withdraw . He however took out his patent , which was , after divers decisions , in the lower courts , finally repealed by the court of ultimate jurisdiction , on the ground that such paddles had been described in a work publbhed in the United States. ** The British patent act of 1835 , affords an instance of discretionary authority in the king , by the advise of his council , to confirm a patent for a thing , of which the patentee , at the time of taking out his patent , thought himself the original inventor , though it may appear subsequently , that the thing was , at the time of taking out the patent , known , and used by others . This is a legislative act , to which the British parliament was driven by the doctrine of the English law , that if any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practice , before the patent of the inventor passes the great seal , though he is not chargeable with any * Perpigna on Patents , Eng . Ed . Parii , 1882 , p. 63. 54. 55 . Ch . IV. the Patent Laws . 47 negligence he yet loses his right to a patent . This is a radical defect in the British law , to compensate for which parliament resorts to a very objectionable remedy , in conferring upon the king , under the advise of his council , a discretionary authority , instead of removing the defect itself , by testing the originality of the alleged invention , by a reference to what was known and used at the time when the invention was made , and not at that of sealing the patent . Such is the experience , and such are the enactments , on the subject of the preliminary exercise of a discretionary authority in granting patents . It is true , that the act of congress of April 10 , 1790 , did not profess to refer it to the mere discretion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized them to cause patents to be granted for inventions , which they might consider mfficiently useful and important . But it is evident that by such a vague limitation of the exercise of the authority , it was , in effect , a matter of discretion with the board . Now , it will readily occur , that this discretionary authority , whereby the functionaries of the government are empowered to act , as they may think expedient , is precisely the most unsatisfactory , the most odious , and most liable to abuse , that can be granted . It is that exercise of authority , which it is the especial r 48 General Provisions of Ch , IV . object of a great part of the legislation of every State to avoid . Rules are laid down , first by the legislators , and then as matters of copstruitioD and interpretation by the judges , that every one may know , to use Mr. Je &rson's; expression , when his actions are lawful . . But if a board may grant a patent when they deem the invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is void by the law , where they are of opinion that there is some good reason for so doing , it is not in the power of an inventor to Jcnow whether he is entitled to a patent until this administrative board has exercised its discretion upon his application . The matter becomes one of solicitation , instead of bebg one of right , determined by definite rules . Our patent laws , as do those of other countries , for the most part , treat the claim rather , as a matter of right , though the language imports a discretion to be exercised on the part of the administrative officers ; for the law of 1793 , said the secretary of state in the cases mentioned , may cause letters patent to be issued , and the act of 1836 , adopts the same pharseology ? substituting the commissioner of patents for the secretary of state . Neither act , says he , shall cause the letters patent to be issued . The phraseology of the sixth section of the British act of monopolies , taken in Cb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first , is equivalent . The phraseology of the French law is more absolutej and those qt the other qountries mentioned above follow more nearly the French law in this respect . The spirit of the administration of both the British , and our law bas been , however , conformable to the phraseology of the French and other laws in this respect , or rather the latter laws have copied and followed the practical administration of the British and American laws . So that allowing room for the exception of extremely scandalous or trivial inventions , or palpably immoral and illegal ones , the applicant in practice , has been put upon the footing of a claimant of right , and not that of a mere solicitor of a favor . Having considered the provisions for mere discretionary authority on this subject ; we next come to a question of very great importance , and of not a little difficulty in legislation , in regard to the novelty and utility of the invention , and especially the sufficiency of the specification , which last is the subject with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the law should submit these subjects to the preliminary decision of a board or tribunal , or leave the applicant , as the French law professedly does , and our law , and the British , as practically administered hitherto have done , to take out a patent for /z/ 50 General provisions of Ch . IV* aoy subject on whatever specification he may choose to make , upon his own responsibility , and at his own peril . We do not inquire here as to the exercise of a discretionary authority , but suppose the board of preliminary jurisdiction to investigate and adjudicate upon the subject precisely as a judicial tribunal does in the ordinary administration of justice , that is , according to /z/ the rules of the law . This subject was . one of those which occupied much of the attention of the committee of the British House of Commons , whose report has already been sd frequently mentioned . A greater number of the persons examined by the committee , were in favor of the institution of such a tribunal , for the preKminary adjudication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ' Those in favor of it , referred to the French law as a precedent , whereas that law , as we have seen , is directly against it , as the French consultative board or committee merely recommend , and do not definitively decide any thing . The projectors of the British law of 1835 , probably found some difficulty in constituting such a board , since they made na provision for it in that law . " Rep. p. 7. 15. fU , 27. 30. 38. 41. 42. 44. 46. 55. 56. 67. 68. 74. /z/ Ch . IV. the Patent Lam. 51 Such a boardi invested with authority to make a preliminary definitive decision on the points of useful* ness and novelty especially , is liable to very grave objections , since one party alone , the applicant , being before then ) , it is not usually possible to have such a full presentation of the case as is desirable in making a final decision , as it will depend on the members of the board itself to find the evidence against the claim , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unwieldy agent in collecting facts and precedents . Again , any board , proceeding ex parte , is open to the influence of favoritism . And then , in the early stages of an invention , there are much less means too of obtaining facts , bearing on the questions of its novelty or utility , than afterwards , when the thing has been in use and has become known . Again , there is very little probability of so much time and labor being bestowed upon the investigation , as in a case presented by opposing par* ties , spurred on by interest on each side , and excited by the contest . And it is another very material objection that the applicant is subjected to very great expense and trouble in the threshold , before he can have fully ascertained whether his invention Is worth pursuing . Notwithstanding these objections , the projectors of the act of congress of 1836 , have attempted to form a tribunal of this description , by authorizing 53 General Provisiom of Cb . IV . the commissioner of patents to reject the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merits of the invention , as well as on account of defects in the spedfication ; and in case of the applicant 's still persisting in bis claim , the matter is referred to a board of examiners appointed by the secretary of state , before whom the claimant appears with his reasons in lavor of his claim , and the commissioner of patents is the opposing party , who , in effect , represents the public , as an alleged infringer does in an action for an infringement , after a patent is granted . This mode of proceeding puts the claim in as good a position as it can be placed in for a trial , in this stage of the invention , since the commissioner of patents is incited to make as strong an opposition as he can , in vindication of his rejection of the claim . But still , I can not but think that the objections to such a system , entirely outweigh the reasons in its favor . The case is not wholly similar as to the specification , since it can as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intelligible and clear . The public is interested in having the specification full and clear , and the claim of the patentee precisely and definitely stated ; and it can as well be decided whether they are so at the moment when the specification is drawn , as at any future period . And the objection to a dec'ision on Ch . IV. the Patent Lam. 53 these points in the first instance , are , by no means , so weighty , as against a decision on those of the novelty and utility , since the decision , though definitive as against the claimant as to the use of a particular mode of describing his invention and claim , is not conclusive as to the claim itself , and so amounts in effect only to a recommendation of a ccurrection of the specification . This recommendation is definitive , it is true , but then it is definitive upon a point that is not material to the claim itself , since it goes only to the form of presenting it . These considerations lead to the conclusion , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patents is entrusted , should be invested with authority to reject the application in case he deems the claim to be plainly immoral , or illegal , or not intelligibly or distinctly specified ; and that the applicant may appeal to a board or tribunal that shall be arbiter between him and the administrative officer ; the decision of which arbitrator must of course be final , if against the applicant , but need not necessarily to be so if in his favor , there being no necessity to bind every member of the community , on a question in which many may be personally and individualljr interested , and perhaps deeply so , by a decision to which they can not be personally parties . I can not but think it is very difficult , if not absolutely impracticable , on ex- /z/ 54 General Prtmsiom of Ch . IV* periment , to carry prelirohiary adjudications beyond these bounds , and that it would not be of material public importance that they should be carried further , if it were practicable , and attended with no great difBculty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadvertence or mistake , the American law has always permitted the patentee to surrender his patent and take out a new one with a corrected specification . The British law does not provide scifically for this , but the act of parliament of 1835 , makes an equivalent provision by permitting the patentee , or his assignee , at any time , to make an alteration of his specification , or disclaim any part of it . The act of congress just referred to , also provides that in case of a specification , partly good and partly defective , and the failure of an action for an infringement in consequence of the defect , where the patentee is entitled to a part of what he claims in his specification , and has well described , the court may , in taxing costs , have regard to the fact that the patentee is entitled to a patent and has well described what would be a good subject of a patent .

Such a provision would very materially relieve patentees from the em  --  Ch  --  IV. ihe Patent Laws . 5S barrassment under which tbej labor in vindicatiDg their privileges under their patents . A number of the per sons examined before the committee of the house of commons , in 1829 , were decidedij of this opinion . ' In reviewing the general grounds of legislation upon patents , the next subject that naturally presents itself is the fee , or tax , to be paid by the applicant for the guaranty of bis exclusive privilege , upon which I purpose to reserve any remarks that may occur for the place where that subject is particularly conakiered in the course of this treatise , when the doctrine will be maintained that the fee ought , at the outside , not to be greater than may be sufficient to defray the expenses of administering the law , if it ought to exceed half of that amount . If this proposition be correct , the laws of most countries , at least , which have legblated upon this subject , excepting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a wrong principle , for most of them , at least , and especially those of Great Britain and France , not only demand from patentees a reimbursement , - but also extort a payment as the price of his monopoly . On this subject the persons examined before the committee of the house of conunons , in 1829 , disagreed ; most , though not all of them , being  --  * Rep. p. 8. 16. 37. 39. 77. 56 Oeneral Protinont 0/ Cb .

The practice there is to enter a caveat for the purpose of getting notice of the inventions dnd applications for patents that are on foot , and either extorting money from the patentee , as a compromise for withdrawing opposition to his patent , or taking out a patent for the same thing before the real inventor can obtain his . To do this the piratical applicant gets a longer time allowed him within which to enrol his specification , so that as soon as the real inventor has enrolled his specification , the patent*jobher pirates the invention into his own , Rep. pp. 13.14. 15.17. 37. 38. 40. 46. 47. 48. 50. 52. 71. 72. /z/ Ch .

It is remarkaUe that such swindling should not be within reach of the laws of a country in which the legislation is so far advanced as in England . It is very possible that the large tax levied upon patents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of swindling . But admitting this to be the effect , it b not a sufficient gnound for imposing the tax . There is also a class of patent-jobbers in the United States , but they carry on their trade in a very different manner , since the practice of specifying before obtain ing the patent does not give opportunity for the same kind of piracy to which the English practice opens the door . In the United States they have heretofore gone to the patent office and copied from different drawings , models , and specifications , relating tti the same subject , such parts as would , out rights or shares , or gave licenses ; And so made a business of selling patent after patent . This class of persons , both in England and the United States , ought to be dealt with by indictment under the criminal law , since the practices in each country are plain swindling , and if the law is not sufficient to 58 General Provisions of Ch .

All the patent laws provide for the assignment of patents , and this is a material provision of such laws , since a patent is often of but little value without the right of assignment . The right itself would , however , exist without any special enactment on the subject , the object of the enactments being to regulate its exercised The British practice , and under the act of congress of 1836 , the American law , allow of the filing of caveats , whereby the person filing the caveat is entitled to notice of any application for a patent on the subject named , which , if it interferes with his own , he may thus have an opportunity of opposing . The Spanish law of patents , passed in 1820 , under the constitutional government , had a provision for caveats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The particular proceedings for taking out patents in the United States will be hereafter described . It is not necessary to dwell upon those of other countries . Much of the examination by the committee of the Ch . IV. . the Patent Laws . 59 British House of Commons in 1829 was taken up with this subject , which it is not of practical impcntance to American patentees to refer to particularly . Another material consideration , in legislating upon patents , relates to the period for which they shall be taken . The French and Belgian laws allow of patents for different periods of five , ten , or fifteen years , apportioning the tax . to the time . The Austrian law , also , accommodates the tax to the period during which the patentee uses his invention and avails himself of his privilege , not exceeding fifteen years , and , after the first five years , very judiciously renders the payments annual , increasing from year to year , so that the patentee pays the tax for his privilege as he may be supposed to acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his invention . The smallness of the fee in the United States , which is not a tax , renders any such apportionment of it over the period of the existence of the exclusive privilege , unnecessary . In the examinations by the committee of the British commons above mentioned , a number of the persons examined were of opinion that patents should be allowed for different periods , on the ground that some inventions could not be brought into profitable use , so as to remunerate the inventors , within the period of fourteen years allowed by the British law , while other inventions . so Oenerdt PravirioM of depending on fashion , or relating to things of transitory interest , become obsolete long before the expiration of that period. * ' As far as the latter consideration is of weight , it applies merely to the amount of the tax , and it is not applicable in the United States , where the amount exacted of patentees is intended merely for the purpose of indemnifying the public for the ex* penses of administering the patent laws . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , like that of Mr. Walt , * do not remunerate the inventor for his time and outlay within the common period of fourteen years allowed by the British and American laws for the exclusive privilege . This period is , however , probably of sufficient length for the majority of cases , and the laws of England now authorize the king , and those of the United States authorize a board , consisting of the secretary of state , the commissioner of patents , and the solicitor of the treasury , to extend the terra of the patent not exceedmg seven years , in case of its appearing that the patentee has not been ihdemniBed for hb expenses and rewarded for his ingenuity and the benefit he has confeired on the public Rep. pp. 10. 27. 32 , 33. 39. 47. 74. 84. 91. 92. 105. *7 Supra p. 18 .

Each of these provisions , as far as they have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be considered in the following chapters . /z/ Character and Spirit of the Jurisprudence upon Patent Rights , The jurisprudence on patents has been said to constitute the metaphysics of the law . The difficulty of administering and giving a constructicMi to this branch of law , lies , says Mr. Justice Story , " not so much in the general principles , as in the minute and subtle distmctions which ocQasionally arise in the ap* plication of these principles . " ' For instance , the subject of a patent must be new , and useful , and clearly described , for so the law requires . There is not the least difficulty respecting these general doctrines ; but when we come to inquire what is new , that is , whether the thing is so similar to , or di- 1 1 Mason R. 472. 62 Character and Spirit of the Ch . V. verse from , what has already been done or produced , as to be substantially the same , or different , the ques* tion is often of a subtile metaphysical character . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful , and a decision on the other of these questions , relating to the sufficiency of the specification , involves a nice analysis of the invention and the description of it by the patentee . It follows , from this character of the jurisprudence on this branch of law , that the beneficial effect of the law depends quite as much upon the principles and spirit with which it is interpreted and administered , as upon the general provisions of the law itself , since it is to no purpose to provide for a temporary monopoly of a thing on condition that it shall be described with greater clearness and precision than the nature of the case admits of , or than can be attained by the skill of those whom the inventor must employ. * If , therefore , the doctrine laid down by Lord Ken- - Mr. Arthur Aiken , Secretary to the Society for Encouragement of Arts , in his testimony before the Committee of ( he House of Commons on this subject , in 1629 , remarks that the cases turn upon points of law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Mr. Newton says the merits rarely come in question .

He says , ' I confess I am not one of those who greatly favor patents ; for though , in many instances , the public are benefited by them , yet on striking the balance upon this subject , I think great oppression is practised on inferior mechanics , by those who are more opulent . " ' This is stepping aside a little from the judicial , and assuming the legislative functions , for the favor to be extended to patents is properly a matter to be determined by the law , not by the discretion of the judge , or his opinion as to the effect of the law on inferior mechanics . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small mechanics , if it in fact exist , is owing , in part , to the very strictness and illiberality of construction , which Lord Kenyon professes to favor , since it tends to render the validity of patents so precarious , that only men of ample fortune can afford to run the hazard of speculating in this species of property ; especially since the practice mentioned by Lord Brougham has prevailed , who states that it not unfrequently happens that those who are interested in quashing a patent make up a stock purse , to defray , 8 .

In the examinations before the Committee of the House of Commons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently Ch. v. Jurisprudence upon Patent Rights . 65 In the United States the jurisprudence on this branch of law has in general been marked by more broad and hberal views . Its leading principles can not be better expressed than in the language used by Mr. Justice Story , in the case of Ames 's papermaking machine . He says , ' Patents for inventions are not to be treated as mere monopolies , odious in the eyes of the law , and therefore not to be favored , but on the contrary to be construed with the utmost rigor as strictissimi juris . The Constitution of the United States , in giving authority to Congress to grant such patents for a limited period , declares the object to be to promote the progress of science and the useful arts , an object as truly national and meri- torious , and well founded in public policy , as any that can possibly be the object of national protection . Hence it has always been the course of the American courts ( as it has latterly been that of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not to subject them to any over-nice and critical refinements . The object is to ascertain wbatj from the fair scope of the words , is the nature and extent of the invention claimed by the party , and when the nature and extent of the claim is apparent , gave a more liberal construction to the patent Uwi , in fcvor of patentees . Rep. p. 77. 96. /z/ 66 Character and Spirit of the Ch . V. not to fritter away bis rights upon formal and subtle objections of a purely technical character . ' ' The writer in the Westminster Review , already quoted , goes into an argument and cites examples , to prove that the illiberal and captious jurisprudence on this branch of law , is owing to the incompetency of the judges to understand the merits of the cases , and a consequent inclination to put the decision upon legal technical points , with which they were more conversant. * He does not proceed to the proposal of any remedy , and accordingly the argument and citations stand as merely a charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges ; and of these the reader in left to infer the former ; the latter being indeed totally destitute of pretence , for no one at all acquainted with the history of English jurisprudence for a long series of years , will for a moment think of drawing in question the general integrity and laborious fidelity of the English judges , for in these respects those of no country stand above them . Still on this subject it is admitted that at least very many of them have fallen into a narrow and inadequate system of jurisprudence . The fair inference , however , is not , as the writer seems to insinuate , that juriscon- B Ames V. Howard , C. C. U. S. Mum . Oct. 1833. - Weetm . Rev. No. 44 . April , 1835. p. 251 , 252 , Foster 's Am . Ed . Ch. v. Jurisprudence upon Patent Rights . 67 suits by profession are not suitable judges in cases of patents . The same objections would lie against professed jurisconsults as advocates yet no patentee , having a controversy on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate capable of un* derstanding his invention . The judges are not less likely to be able to understand the principles of an invention than an advocate . It would evidently be quite impracticable to procure judges or even jurymen , who have actually worked at or practised all the innumerable trades and professions by which civilized society is diversified , nor would it be desirable were it practicable . It is then quite nugatory to object that judges have not practical experience in any trade to which any particular patent relates . It is enough that they understand the law of patents . Were tradesmen to be appointed judges , any one would understand but one trade , when the cases arising on patents relate to a thousand ; and then the still stronger objection would be , that he would not understand the law of that particular trade . The only remedy for the inconvenience mentioned , if it indeed be one , would be the selecting of special juries . This is the conclusion to which the remarks of the writer just referred to , would tend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifications of the court and 68 Jurisprudence upon Patent Rights , Ch .

But the views expressed by these persons , as well as the remarks of the writer quoted above , go , at the most , to the appointment of special juries , and the reasons for this are quite as strong in cases arising on questions of commercial law as in those on patents. * 10 See Rep. p. 4. 72. 89. 91. 101. 102 , /z/ Ch .

Sec. 1 .  --  Mebe Introducer op an Art or Machine . We are next to inquire what party is entitled to a patent for any particular invention , and what persons in general are permitted to take out Patents . And in the first place the patentee must be the inventor . Mr. Godson remarks , that " the character of an inventor may be obtained by a person in three ways , by bringing with him and publishing to his countrymen the productions of the genius of foreigners ; by pub- 70 What Persons are entitled to Patetits , fyc .

Two descriptions of persons then are entitled to patents , namely , the inventors of a thing , and the introduces of what others have invented abroad , but which was before unknown in England . The doctrine of the English jurisprudence as to the right of importers of an art or machine , has , as we have seen , been incorporated into the laws of France , Spain , the Netherlands , and Austria . The law of the United States limits the right to take out a patent , to the original inventor ; it does not give the privilege to a person who merely introduces a foreign invention . The statute of 1793 gave the privilege to the inventor and required that he should make oath that he verily believed that he was the " true inventor , which words have been construed not to be applicable to the importer of another 's discovery ; though the expressions do not exclude /z/ Ch. 2. p. 59 . Sec . I. Mere Introducers of an Art or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the English statute of 2 James I. , the fifth section of which excepts from the general prohibition of monopolies , those theretofore granted of the " sole working or making of any manner of new manufacture within this realm , to the first and true inventor or Inventors . " And the sixth section , which provides for the future grant of monopolies , is in precisely the same words in this respect . As it had been customary , before the passage of that act , to grant patents to the first introducers of foreign inventions into England , who were accordingly placed upon the same footing as inventors in respect to this privilege , when the statute made an exception of patents for inventions from the general suppression of monopolies , it was very naturally construed to except inventions introduced from abroad as well as others , and the words of the sixth section , describing the persons entitled to future grants of patents , being the same as those of the fifth section in relation to the then existing patents , the same construction was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American law . It has always been an essential qualification for the claimant for a patent in the United States that he should be the true inventor. 72 What Persons are entitled to Patents , fyc . Ch.VL Sec . II .  --  Joint Patentees . A joint patent cannot be sustained upon a sole invention of either of the patentees , for the patent act gives no right to a patent except to the inventor ; and requires an oath from the party who claims a patent , that he is the true inventor. * Joint inventors must therefore be joined in the patent . Sec . III .  --  Sole Patentee . If the invention is suggested by another , the person to whom the suggestion is made , though he proceed to reduce it to practice , is not the inventor within the meaning of the statute . This proposition might , however , be limited to the case of a suggestion of the specific process or machine . A general theoretical suggestion that a steam vessel might be made to navigate the air or water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a cylinder , would not be such a suggestion of the invention as would preclude the person to whom it should be made , from taking out a patent for a particular process or specific machinery for effecting the result suggested . But if the specific nMuon , 153. 478 . Sec . III . Sole Patentee. 73 process is pointed out , the person to whom it is so pointed out , can not afterwards be the inventor of such process or machine . In an action by a patentee , for an infringement of a patent for a bleaching liquor , a chemist deposed , that previously to the grant of the patent , he had had frequent conversations with the patentee , on the means of improving bleaching liquor , and that in one of them , he had suggested to the patentee , that he would probably obtain his end by keeping the lime water constantly agitated ; and it appeared that this was indispensable in the process . Lord Ellenborough thereupon nonsuited the plamtifF , on the ground that it was not his invention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an improved method of making hats , a witness , who was one of the plaintiff 's men , stated that he invented the improvement which was the subject of the patent , while employed in the work-shop of the plaintiff . The plaintiff was thereupon nonsuited. * Mr. Justice Bayley throws out the suggestion that if the witness bad been employed by the plaintiff for the express purpose of devising improvements , the construction might have been otherwise. * This was supposing aa ' Tenant 's case , Dav .

This would not , however , make the employer the inventor though the real inventor would thereby lose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another case , in which a head colorman employed to mix colors for calico printing , had , during his service , kept a book in which were entered the processes for mixing the colors , many of which were of his own invention . Mr. Justice Chambre said , the master has a right to something beside the mere manual labor of the servant in the mixing of the colors ; and though the servant invents them , yet they are to be used for his master 's benefit , and he can not carry on his trade without his book . ' And it was held accordingly that on discharging the colorman , his employer was entitled to retain the book and use the mixtures . This case does not give the right of taking out a patent to the employer , but it proceeds upon the doctrine that the inventor , being employed for the purpose of compounding these mixtures , and havmg entered them in the book , thereby lost his property in them as an invention . The case can , however , * Makepeace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV . T%e Original Inventor. 75 hardly be shaped into a general doctrine ; it is a matter of construction of the particular circumstances whether the inventor , by the nature of his employment , or by his contract , either assigns his invention to his employer , or at least divests himself of his own property in it . It is not only , not always the case ; but , on the contrary , the inventor would most frequently retain his property ; for most persons are employed to practise arts already known , not to invent new ones . We must limit the doctrine strictly to the case put by Mr. Justice Bay ley , of the employment of a person for the purpose of superintending and directing the processes , and who uses them without reservation for the benefit of his employer . Sec . IV .  --  The Original Inventor . To entitle a party to a patent he must not only be an inventor , but also the original inventor ; that is , the first inventor who reduces the invention to practice . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dolland 's patent for an improvement in reflecting telescopes , for Doctor Hall had first made the invention and reduced it to practice in his closet , and kept it secret , and yet DoUand 's patent for the subsequent invention was held to be valid ; for he was 76 What Persons are entitled to Patents c .

" A short abstract of the point as above stated , is the only report of this case , from which it does not " Dixon Mayor , C. C. U. S. Penn . April , 1821 .

The latter is the moce obvious construction of the report as Mr. Coxe gives the case . And this doctrine is countenanced by an intimation of the same judge in another case. * ' So in another case ' it is implied that the patent was taken out by the assignees . But whatever may have been held or intimated or implied to the contrary on this subject , it seems , from the whole language of the act of Congress of 1793 , especially the form of the oath , and from the cases already cited , * and also from the common form of the patent itself , that it can be taken out only on the application and oath and in the name of the inventor i*Reutgen v.

We DOW resume a very difficult branch of the law of patents , the inquiry being as to what Jcinds of 82 Subjects of Patents . Ch . VII . new inventions are patentable . Nothing is patentable but an invention ; but not every invention is so . After the adoption of the French patent law , patents were taken out for systems of finance ; * but these were declared not to be within the class of inventions comprehended under the law . To decide this question , our first resort is to the words of the law ; or in the British statute , the word ; for the kinds of subjects intended by that law , are expressed by the single word manufacture ; and , as we shall see , the meaning and extent of this word , in reference to the subject in hand , is restricted , in the first place , by express provisions in the law , and then again by construction , and yet a very extensive signification is given to it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of 1836 , give a more full and definite description of patentable subjects ; the words are , " any new and useful arty machine manufacture , or composition of matter J The laws are intended to express more fully and precisely , the practical construction which had already been given to the fifth and sixth sections of the British act of monopolies , and are thus , at the same time , the law of the United States , and an exposition of that of England . The language of the French law is , 1 Renouard . Sec . L Kindt of Subjects Patentable. 83 perhaps broader than either that of the English or American law the expression in that law being , " every invention or discovery in any kind of industry ; ' ' which , taken in its full extent , comprehends things not embraced by the language of either the English or American law , taken in its widest construction , though the words of these laws , taken in their broadest signiQcation , include subjects which can not be brought within the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with the American law , for the words art and tnachiney may be applied to things not included under discoveries or inventions in industry . The truth is , that the practical construction , given to the three laws , in regard to the kinds of invention that are patentable , is substantially the same . The description of patentable subjects in the law of the Netherlands , ' is " an invention or essential improvement in any branch of arts or manufactures ; " in the Austrian law , ' " new discoveries , inventions , and improvements in every branch of industry ; " and in the Spanish law , " any machine , apparatus , instrument or a mechanical or chemical process or operation , which shall be wholly or in part new .

If we take all these expressions in connexion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kinds of subjects intended by each of these laws , for the subject of the patent must , in the language of the French law , be an invention or discovery in industry ; but under the construction given to that law , not every invention or discovery in industry is patentable ; then the word manufacture points out the species of discovery or invention intended to be protected ; but lest this word , though by a liberal construction it is applicable to all the proper and all the intended objects of encouragement by the law , should receive too narrow an interpretation , the act of Congress adds , what in fact amounts to a liberal construction of the word manufacture by expressly extending the act to any art , machine , or composition of matter . But it will be evident that we must accept the expressions art and composition of matter , in this case , with large restrictions , since the word art is applied to mere skill , and yet it will appear very obviously that any discovery in the mode of managing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is comprehended under the expressions skill , or address , as in horsemanship , in steering a ship , or playing on a musical instrument , can not be made the subject of monopoly , and if it could be , that any such monopoly Sec .

We must then resort to manufaciurey used in the English law and our own , to limit the construction to be put upon the other expressions used in our law . In examining more particularly the kinds of subjects cavered bj the law of patents , it is difficult to distinguish and arrange them into different classes , under the various expressions which have been used to designate them , since these expressions are all of very various , and not very definite signification ; and , besides , the subject has been perplexed , by a loose use of these expressions in the opinions of courts in patent cases , and also by the use of the same expression in different senses . The discussions on this subject in the cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we are occupied with a branch of jurisprudence which may aptly be denominated the metaphysics of the law ; since , in the subtile and nice distinctions often requisite , and still oftener attempted than requisite , language fails to supply adequate and precise phraseology , so that we are without the usual help to satisfactory speculation , that is , clear language , intelligible to every one , which proves , in this , as in other cases , a double hindrance , first to clear and discriminating thinking , and second , to the ready and perspicuous communication of thought . As the /z/ 86 Suhf'ects of Patents . Ch . VII . different expressions used in describing patentable subjects are very analogous to each other in signification , and are mutually blended and implicated together in their meaning , and in the application made of them in the cases , the most convenient mode of treating of them , at least the most concise , will be to enumerate them all , and examine them successively , without confining ourselves rigidly to that order , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering the subject any clearer . : . The expressions by which patentable subjects have been defined and described , then , are , first , those used in the laws already enumerated , ' viz. invention , discovery , manufacture , art , machine , composition of matter , and others used in the cases , viz. a method , principle , application of a principle , process , effect , result , product , device , combination . Sec . II .  --  Manufacture . The term most discussed in the English reports , as descriptive of the kind of subjects for which patents may be granted , is the description given in the statute of 21 James I. c. 3. s. 5 and 6 , and also one of the descriptions in the act of Congress of 1836 , namely , manufacture . The subject was much discussed in the Sec . IL Manufacture , 87 cases arising on Watt 's patent for an improvement in the steam-engine . In one of these cases , Lord Chief Justice Eyie thus explains this term . He says that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as usage will expound it , has gone very much beyond the letter . In 2 Salkeld , 447 , the words *new devices ' ' are substituted and used as synonymous with the words *new manufactured ' It was admitted in the argument at the bar that the word manufacture , " in the statute , was of extensive signification , that it applied not only to things made , but to the practice of making , to principles carried into practice in a new manner , to new results of principles carried into practice . Let us pursue this admission . Under things made , we may class , in the first place , new impositions of things , such as manufactures in the most ordinary sense of the word ; secondly , all mechanical inventions , whether made to produce old or new effects ; for a new piece of mechanism is certainly a thing made . Under the practice of making , we may class all new artificial manners of operating with the hand , or with instruments in common use , new processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Boalton V. BuU , 2 . H. Bl . 481. 88 Subjects of Patents , Ch . VII . In the same case , Mr. Justice Heath gives the following exposition of this term : " What are new manufactures within the scope of the provbo of the statute 21 Jac . 1 ? Such as are reducible to two classes . The jBrst class includes machinery , the second , substances ( such as medicines ) formed by chemical and other processes , where the vendible substance is the thing produced , and that which operates preserves no permanent form . In the first class , the machine , and in the second , the substance produced , is the subject of the patent . I approve of the term manufacture , in the statute , because it precludes all nice refinements ; it gives us to understand the reason of the proviso , that it was introduced , for the benefit of trade . " - Lord Kenyon , in one of the same class of cases defines the word according to its etymology ; considering it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a subsequent case we find the same term thus explained by Lord Chief Justice Abbott : " The word ' manufacture , ' in the statute 21 Jac . 1 . c. 3 , has been generally understood to denote either a thing made , which is useful for its own sake , and vendible as suchj  --  Boulton V.

Manufacture . 89 as a medicine , a stove , a telescope , and many others , or to mean an engine , or instrument , or some part of an engine or instrument , to be employed either in the making of some previously known article , or in some other useful purpose , as a stocking-frame , or ' a steam engine for raising water from mines . Or it may perhaps extend also to a new process to be carried on by known implements , or elements , acting upon known substances , and ultimately producing some other known substance , but producing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a better and more useful kind . " ' . .. , . . : . Lord Ellenborough gives the following description of what is a manufacture within the statute . . ' In every invention through the medium of mechanism , there are some materials which are common , and can- , not be supposed to be appropriated in the terms of any patent . There are common elementary materials to work with in machinery ; but it is the adaptation of those materials to the execution of any particular purpose , that constitutes the invention ; and if the application of them be new ; if the combination in its nature be essentially new ; if it be productive of a new end , and beneficial to the public , it is that species /z/ 90 Subjects of PaitifUs .

" * *'The true foundation of all patents , " says Mr. Justice Bulter , ' must be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 c. 3 . And whether the manufacture be with or without principle , produced by accident or by art , is immaterial . Unless this patent can be supported for the tnanufacture , it can not be supported at So Mr. Justice Story says , " It is of no consequence whetlier the thing be simple , or complicated ; whether it be by accident , or by long , laborious thought , or by an instantaneous flash of mind , that it is first done . The law looks to the fact , and ioi to the process by which it is accomplished . Ir gives the first inventor or discoverer of the thing , the exclusive right , and asks nothing as to the mode or extent of the application of his genius to conceive or execute it . " " The expression in the French law on this subject , is not , as we have seen , precisely equivalent to that of the English statute , or rather , the terms are not those of which the word manufacture would be a literal * Huddart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulton y . Bull , 2 H. Bl . 486 . " Earle v. Sawyer , 4 Mason , 6 . Sec . II . Manufacture . 01 translation , and yet the construction put upon their law is very similar . Accordingly , M. Renouard 's description of patentable subjects will answer very well as an exposition of the sixth section of the British act of 21 James I. or the acts of Congress of 1793 and 1836 , on this subject . He says , ' ' It is not every kind of invention and discovery that is the subject of a patent right . It is necessary that the invention or discovery should be of a nature to uSbrd products that may be fabricated by the hands of man , or by the labor which he directs , or which may be subjects of commerce by sale and purchase .

" ** ' Renouard , c. 5. 8. 1 . p. 165 , 16C. 92 Subjects of Patents . Ch . VIL Sec . III .  --  Method . Having given a definition of the word manufacture hj the use of the other expressions already enumerated , the judges and the writers proceed to analyze those other expressions , and make the necessary distinctions , qualifications , and exceptions . The words method and process are often used in these definitions of manufactures , and also in giving titles to patents , as a new method of effecting such or such an object , or a new process . Mr. Godson ' ' thinks a method or process is not patentable , but the reason of his being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning upon the terms . He says , " Vhen an invention is not of a thing made , it can only be known by being taught by the inventor himself , or by being learnt fix ) m experiments made on the faith of the description given of it in the specification . With that assistance , however well the method or process may be set forth , some time and experience must necessarily be required , before a person can make use of the invention so beneficially as the discoverer . But the public are not bound to make experiments , and , therefore , it " Patents , p. 85 . Sec . III . Method . 93 seems reasonable to infer that a mere process or method can not be the subject of a patent . " " But supposing it possible that a new method of operating with the hand , or a new process to be carried on by known implements ot elements , might be so described as to be , by bare inspection , made as beneficial to the public as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , are required to put it in practice ; still it is not a substance or thing made by the hands of man ; it is not vendible ; which is an inherent , primary quality of a new manufacture . " ' The advantages of a method or process , in truth , arise from the skill with which it is performed . Suppose , for instance , that one person can with a certain machine , produce a particular aiticle of dress , of a certain quality ; and another , with the same machine , by using it in a different manner , can make the same article in half the time , and reduce it to half the price ; however new and ingenious this method may be , still it is nothing substantial or corporeal . But suppose that in thus using the machine , some appa Ttnily inconsiderable alteration is made , that would be sufficient to support a patent ; and it is indeed difficult to imagine , that any beneficial effect could be produced without some material alteration in the 94 Subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then why not oblige the inventor to take out a patent for the improvement ? It is expressly enacted in the statute of 21 James I. that the new manufacture must not be ' hurtiul to trade , nor generally inconvenient . " To monopolize such methods as above enumerated , appears to be particularly hurtful to trade . In every branch of it there are workmen who use the machines employed in their respective trades more skilfully than their fellows . This superior skill may be in consequence of a particular method of applying their implements . But it would be carrying the doctrine to a great length , to decide that the workmen are entitled to patents for their respective methods of working . " * ' And further , every master is bound to teach bis apprentice the best way , or means within his knowledge of following his trade . If , therefore , a master obtained a patent for fourteen years , for a particular method of operating with known instruments to produce a known article in less time than usual , or of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to exercise his hands in the most skilful manner he was able , until several years after he had commenced business for himself . Such a patent would , indeed , be f generally inconvenient . " There would be a monopoly in every handicraft Sec . III . Method . 95 trade ; one person only in each calling would be allowed to work in the most skilful manner . " " For these reasons  --  that Dr. Hartley 's case an invention of iron roof-coveringsj is the only one in support of the doctrine , and he did not first make iron , nor first discover the effect of iron on fire , so that he was not the inventor of any substance or instrument  - -  that a method does not possess the qualities which have been shown to be inherent in the subjects of patents , and can be known only by making experiments , and that it is inconvenient to the public , particularly to masters and apprentices ; that methods should not be monopolized ; it might perhaps be fairly inferred , that a method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of the statute of monopolies . " Mr. Godson is undoubtedly right in his doctrine that methods and processes , in the sense adopted by him , are not patentable ; but it will appear in the sequel very satisfactorily , that in other senses they are so ; and it would be very singular , if they were not so , that the very word method should be so often used in the title of inventions ; and Mr. Godson himself recommends the use of this term ; ' * and yet , as M Patents , p. 88. 96 Subjects of Patents . Ch , VIL we shall see , under the English statute , the title must truly describe the invention , or the patent in void . We can say , then , that a method in general , merely as suchf is not patentable , or , in other words , that methods are not , universally , and without exception , subjects of patents . And the cases will illustrate what methods are , and what are not patentable . " This expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of two significations . A stocking was a new manufacture the first time one . was knit ; but a stocking was again a new manufacture the first time one was made by a loom . In the first case , the thing made was hew ; in the other , the art of making that thing in a particular way . Accordingly in these two senses , the reader will find the word manufacture set down in Johnson 's dictionary , and Webster 's . This well known , double signification of the word , has , however , often most unaccountably been overlooked . Some judges , in ill accordance with other terms of the act they interpret , ** have insisted that a new manufacture behoves to be a new salable thing made ; and they will not admit a new " Westminster Review , No. 44 , April , lc35 , p. 247 , Foster 's American Edition . " 21 Jac . I.e. 3 . Sec . III . Method . 9T method to be a new manufacture , except when that method , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mechanism , itself an article of sale ; but when the new method constitutes only a new process , then , however valuable that process may be in manufactures , and however difficult and meritorious to discover , they will not regard it as a manufacture , and consequently not as a proper subject for a patent . " In illustration of this remark , the writer refers to the case of Wattes patent , which was endangered by the doubt on the part of the judges , whether he had made what could be considered in law , an improvement ' in any manner of manufacture . This doubt arose from Mr. Watt 's having used the word method in the title of his invention , his patent being for a method of lessening the consumption of fuel and steam in the use of steam engines , a doubt being entertained by some of the judges whether a method was patentable . The use of this word by Mr. Watt , in his title , endangered the validity of his palent , whereas , had he called it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the sense would have been the same . But it will appear very satisfactorily that a method may be the subject of a patent , the doubt in this respect being , as already suggested , 96 Subjects of Patents . Ch . VII . not whether a method maj be patented , but in what sense this term is applicable to patentable subjects . . In one of the cases on Watt 's patent , Mr. Justice Heath defines in what sense a method is an inventtcm within the statute , where he describes it to be a principle reduced to practice . " So Mr. Justice Buller , in the same case , says that a method must be reduced to practice , in order to support a patent . He says , the mere application or mode of using a thing was admitted not to be a sufficient ground for a patent ; for on the court putting the question , whether , if a man by science were to devise the means of making a double use of a thing known before , he could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that he could not . The method and the mode of doing a thing are the same ; and I think it impossible to support a patent for a method cmly , without having carried it into effect and produced some new substance . ' ' ** And Mr. Justice Gvose makes the same distinction . ' * And so Mr. Justice Rooke , in one of the same series of cases , ' * speakttig of Watt 's specification , said , as to those parts of the specification which denoted intention only , and " Boulton V. Bull , 2 H. Bl . 481 . Bottlton , Y. Bun , 2 H. Bl . 486 . Hornblower v. Boulton , 8 T. R. 102 . Boulton V. Bull , 2 H. Bl . 479 . Sec. m . Method . 99 did Dot state the thing to which it was to be applied , he did not think the patentee could maintain ao action for a breach of them . That is , whether the question relates to an invention a discovery , a manufacture , method , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually and practically carried into effect . Mr. Justice Eyre very clearly explains the same distinction . In Watt 's case a patent was granted for a new invented method of lessening the . consumption of steam and fuel in steam-engines . Eyre J. C. Shall it now be said , after we have been in the habit of seeing patents granted , in the immense number in which they have been granted for methods of using old machinery J to produce substances that were old , but in a more beneficial manner , and also ibr produce ing negative qualities by which benefits result to the public , by a narrow construction of the word maniiir fa/cture in the statute , that there can be no patent for methods producing this new and salutary effect , con-* nected , and mtimately connected , as it is , with the trade and manufactures of the country ! This I confess , I am not prepared to say . " ' * The same judge thus further illustrates this subject : He says , ' when the effect produced is no substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Patents . Ch . VII . or composition of things , the patent can only be for the mechanism , if new mechanism is used , or for the process , if it be a new method of operating , with or without old mechanism , by which the effect is produced . To illustrate this . The effect produced by Mr. David Hartley 's invention of a ' method for securing buildings from fire , ' is no substance or composition of things ; it is a mere negative quality , the absence of fire . This effect is produced by a new method of disposing iron plates in buildings . In the nature of things , the patent could not be for the efilect produced . I think it could not be for the making the plates of iron , which when disposed in a particular manner , produced the effect ; for those are things in common use . But the invention consisted in the method of disposing those plates of iron , 50 as to produce their effect , and that effect being a useful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly granted to him for his method of securing buildings from fire . In IVfr . Hartley 's method , plates of iron are the means which he employs ; but he did not invent those means , the invention wholly confl'isted in the new manner of using , or I would rather say , of disposing a thing in common use , and which thing every man might make at his pleasure . In the nature of things it must be , that in the carrying into Sec . III . Method . lOt execution any new invention use must be made of certain means proper for the operation . Manual labor , to a certain degree , must always be employed ; the tools of artists frequently ; often things manu- factured , but not newly invented , such as Hartley 's iron plates ; all the common utensils used in conduct**-iDg any process , and so up to the most complicated machinery that the art of man ever devised . Now let the merit of the invention be what it may , it is evident that the patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted for the means by which it acts , for in them there is nothing new , and in some of them , nothing capable of appropriation . Even where the most complicated machinery is used , if the machinery itself is not tlgsAj invented , bat only conducted by the skill of the inventor , so as to produce a new effect , the patent can not be for the machinery . In the list of patents with which I have been furnished , there are several for new methods of manufacturing articles in common use , where the sole merit and the whole effect produced , are the saving of time and expense , and thereby lowering the price of the article , and introducing it into more general use . Now I think these methods may be said to be new manufactures in one of the common acceptations of the word , as we speak of the manufactory of glass , or any other thing /z/ n 102 Subjects of Patents . Ch . VII . of that kind . The patent can not be for the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , or , what is exactly the same thing as to the question upon a patent , no new substance , but an old one produced advantageously for the public . It can not be for the mechanism , for there is no new mechanism employed . It must then be for the method ; and I would say , in the very significant words of Lord Mansfield , ** * it must be for method detached from all physical exists ence whatevdrJ " * The same judge proceeds to point out a distinction , which is of great importance , and which serves as a clew to clear up some of the obscurity that hangs over the cases on this subject . He says , " When the object produced is some new substance or composition of things , it should seem that the privilege of the sole working , or making , ought to be for such new substance or composition without regard to the mechanism or process by which it has been produced , which , though perhaps also new , will be only useful as producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , perhaps , exceptionable , for that was for a method of producing a new object-glass , instead of being for the object-glass produced . If s 4 Burr . H. Bl . 403 . Sec . III . Method . 103 Dr. James 's patent had been for his method of preparing his powders , instead of the powders themselves , that patent would have been exceptionable upon the same ground . " There certainly is a plain distinction between an invention of a new composition , as a medicine , and a new process , art , or method , since in the former case , there may be nothing new in the process or mode of proceeding in compounding or manufacturing the substance , in the latter the mode of proceeding to construct the machine or instrument to which the patent relates , may be the only thing invented . Hence , in discussing this subject , judges and writers sometimes having in view one class of these causes , say , that the substance only is the subject of the patent ; at other times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that a method may be patentable . Now according to the explanation of Lord Chief Justice Eyre , both these propositions are true to a certain extent , but neither is true to the extent laid down in some of the cases , that is , we can not say that substances alone are patentable , nor that methods only are so . Accordingly Mr. Grose , in one of the Watt and Boulton cases , says it signified nothing to the inventor or the public , whether the patent be for s  --  2 H. Bl . 492. n 104 Subjects of Patents . Ch . Vlt tbe engine made or the method of making it . Indeed , to the purposes of a title to a patent or a apecificatiocr , judges have considered the words method and engine to be synonymous . ' Engine and method mean the same thing , " says Mr. Justice Lawrence , " and may be the subject of a patent . Method , properly speaking , is only placing several things and performing several operations , in the most convenient order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so may an engine ; and therefore I think it may aiiswer the word meth " od . " And Abbott C. J. says on the same subject , **When a person applies to the crown for a patent for a new engine or instrument , he may represent a himself to be the inventor of a new method of accomplishing that object , which is to be accomplished by his engine or instrument . " " That a method or mode of operating may be the subject of a patent , is plain from this , that when the object of two patents or efiect to be produced is substantially the same , they may both be valid , if the modes of attaining the desired effect are essentially different . Therefore where judges or writers lay down the general doctrine that a method can not be the subject of a patent , as * Homblower Boulton , 8 T. R. 106 . King Y. Wheeler , 2 B. 4 Aid . 350 . ' " Huddart v. Grimshaw . Day . Pat . Cas. 290 . Sec . IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above case of Boulton V. Biill , the proposition is true in such a restricted sense as on the whole to render it erroneous . Sec . IV .  --  Process . The word process has been suggested instead of method as descriptive of the subject of a patent , and what has been said of method is , in many cases , applicable to process , the difference between the two terms , as applied to this subject , being , that method is of a wider signi6cation . Thus Abbott C. J. says , " The word manufactures , in the statute Jac . 1 . c. 3 , miy , perhaps , extend to a new process , to be carried on by known implements , acting upon known substances , and uhimately producing some other known substance ; but producing it in a cheaper or more expeditions manner , or of a better and more useful kind . '  --  * It is true the Chief Justice speaks with great caution , because he was using a mere illustration , in doing which , he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question which 2 H. Bl . 483 . King y . Wheeler , 2 B. &; Aid . 349 . IOC Subjects of Patents . Ch . VII . might be a subject of much subtile discussion , but be distinctly implies his own opinion . He seems , however , to have been over-cautious , for if a method may be patentable , of which it is apprehended there can be no doubt , then , of consequence , a process , which in this application of the term is , in many respects , synonymous with method , may be so also ; may be so , for in respect to this latter , we must spfeak with the same qualifications , and subject to the same exceptions as when we use the term method , as descriptive of the subjects of patents . Sec . V.  --  Pkinciple . The question whether a principle is a subject of monopoly under the patent laws , was much discussed in the cases relating to Watt 's specification of his improvement in the steam-engine . In that specification , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles/ and then proceeded to describe particularly the construction of the engine according to hisimprovenlent . This gave occasion to numerous , elaborate , and subtile discussions on the patentable character of a principle . And Watt described his invention as consisting of the ' following particulars , " all this disquisition would have been lost , Sec. v. PHnciph. 107 and yet this would hare been substantially equivalent to the phraseology he did use , for after stating that his invention consisted of principles he proceeded to define and explain what he meant by that expression , and it was not objected that his description was at all defective . ' The real question then was , whether Mr. Watt had used the word principle in a wrcxig sense , and , if so , whether his patent was defeated for this philological inaccuracy , which to all practical purposes was not of the sh'gbfest importance , since any person could understand the construction of his mar chine , and any mechanic could construct another after his description , as well as if he had committed no such inaccuracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been lost , bad not the judges , on the final decision of the cause , been very strongly disposed to maintain it on account of the great merit and utility of the invention . We will proceed to a review of those discussions , which are useful in throwing light on the question , what are pa- But Mr. John Farey in his statement before the Committee of the House of Commons in 1829 . Rep. p. 32 , says the description in Watt 's specification was allowed by the courts to be sufficient upon very insufficient evidence ; and that it was not so in fact , and that a knowledge of his mode of constructing engines came out incidentally thirty years after the date of his patent , and not by means of the specification . 108 Subjects of Patents . Ch . VIL tentable subjects , though the case which gave rise to this term does not , in this respect , seem to have been one of any well-grounded doubt . " It is a clear position of law , " says Mr. Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the subject of a patent , but princvples can not . Indeed it seems impossible to specify a principle , and its application to all cases , which furnishes an argument , that it can not be the subject of a patent . ' ' * ' ' The very statement of what a principle is , " says Mr. Justice BuUer , ' proves it not to be a ground for a patent . It is the first ground and rule for arts and sciences , or in other words , the elements and rudiments of them . A patent must be for some new production from those elements , and not for the elements themselves . If the principle alone be the foundation of this patent , it can not possibly stand , with that knowledge and discovery which the world were in possession of before . The efiect , the power , and the operation of steam , were known long before the date of this patent ; all machines which are worked by steam , are worked on the same principle . The principle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation of the patent , though 7 Boulton BuH , 2 H. Bl . 482 , 483 . Sec. v.

" If the objection were well founded in fact , it would be decisive ; but I do not think that it is so  --  ' I am inclined , " said Mr. Justice Grose , ' to think that a patent can not be granted for a mere principle .

The true legal meaning of the principle of a machine with reference to the patent act , is the peculiar structure or constituent parts of such machine .

Now the princiciples of two machines may be the same , although the form or proportions may be different . They may substantially employ the same power in the same way , though the external mechanism be apparently different .

The word is principle . To make this lawfantom , the witchcraflt used by the lawyers consists in mingling three different meanings together , used by the aid of certain professional solemnities , producing a mystical word , capable of harlequinizing an idea into many various forms . " The writer should have said , the toard is harlequinized , not any idea ; and his own expression seems to be quite as mystical as any thing to be found in the arguments of the lawyers , or the opinions of the judges , whom he probably intends to include in the class of lawyers .

" ' . Sec . VI .  --  Application of a Principle . Another word often used in connexion with prin*-ciple , and with other words , in defining the subjects of patent rights , is application .

Law of Paten to for Inyentions , 1886 . London , p. 14. /z/ 114 Subject of Patents . Ch . VlL such manufacture , method , process or princple , is the substantive subject of a valid patent ? In answering the general question , whether a new applicatiott of either of these is a proper subject of a patent , we have not only to distinguish whether the thing to be applied may , or can not be , itself the subject of a patent , but we have the additional uncertainty of meaning and ambiguity in the use of the word application . If by application be meant the mode of operating , or the mechanical combinations , means , or instruments , by which a principle or theory is carried into operation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or principle , may be the subject of a patent . The whole circle of inventions for which patents have been granted , consists of new applications ( in this sense of the term ) of the mechanical powers and chemical properties of matter . But if by new application be meant only the new use of a thing , requiring no new apparatus or instrument , and involving no invention whatever , such for instance as using a nail machine for making copper nails , which had been patented , or had before been used only for making iron nails , in this sense a new application can not be patented . The proposition may then be laid down that a new application of a theory or principle , or of an art , process , or machine , in itself patentable in its charac- Sec . VI .

In this sense , Mr  --  Justice Buller says , the new application of the effect of water in changing colors , may be the subject of a new patent , when applied in a new manner , and by new processes , to a species of manufacture to which it had not been before applied . He illustrates this in the citse of the invention of water-tabbies , which * owed its rise to the accident of a man 's spitting on a floorcloth , which changed its color ; from which he reasoned on the effect of intermixing water with oils or colors and found out how to make water-tabbies , and had his patent for water-tabbies only .

The doctrine is laid down by Mr. Justice Story , that " a patent can , in no case , be for an effect only , but for an effect produced in a given manner , or by a peculiar operation . For instance , no patent can be obtained for the admeasurementof time , orthe expansive operations of steam ; but only for a new mode , or new application of machinery , to produce these effects ; and therefore , if new effects are produced by an old machine in its unaltered state , I apprehend that no patent can be legally supported ; for it is a patent for an effect In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be something new in the method , process , combination , or composition , in order to lay the foundation of a patent .

When the thing is done or produced , then it becomes the subject of a patent . " " The thing to be patented , " says Mr. Justice Story , " is not a mere elementary principle , or intellectual discovery , but a principle put in practice , and applied to some art , machine , manufiicture , or composition of matter . " " This is the doctrine of all the cases . It is laid down by Mr. Justice Buller , in M 2 H. Bl . 479. w 2 H. Bl . 437. - *Earl V. Sawder , 4 Mason , I. Sec . VIII .

" So Mr. Justice Eyre says , in the same case , ' ' For a principle so far embodied and connected with corporeal substances , as to be in a condition to act , and to produce effects in any art , trade , mystery , or manual occupation , I think there may be a patent . Now this is the thing for which the patent stated in this case was granted , and this is what the specification describes , though it miscalls it a principle .

It is the art , process or method , if any thing , in such a case , which is patentable , not the substance ; so that if any other person had found out a different method of analysis he would have been no less entitled to a patent for his method . Our statute provides for granting a patent right of a new composition of matter . This expression has reference to medicines , and compositions used in the arts . The same subjects are covered under the English statutes under the general term manufactures . In these instances the composition itself is usually considered to be the subject of the patent , and not the mode or process of conipounding , ' but both the composition and the mode of compounding may be considered to be included in the invention , where the /z/ Sec .

And in this case it will be immaterial whether the inventor has the monopoly of the compounding or the composition , since the monopoly of either , will , in effect , include both . The expressions , composition of matter , are usually applied to mixtures and chemical compositions . It is no objection to a patent for a composition , that all the ingredients were known and in use ; it is enough that the compound is new . And this composition may be merely the imitation of some natural composition or mixture ; for a new method , by invented processes and apparatus , of producing a composition of matter , which is sometimes , or in some places , to be met with as a natural production , is as much the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known and old effect . 130 Subjects of Patents .

A combination as the subject of a patent is analogous to a composition of matter , the former expression being usually applied to mechanical inventions as the latter is to chemical .

And there it was also resolved that if the new manufacture be substantially invented according to law , yet no old manufacture in use before can be prohibited .

I paid great attention to it , and mentioned it to all the judges . If the general point in law , viz. that there can be no patent for an addition , be with the defendant , that is open upon the record , and he may move in arrest of judgment .

" Mr. Justice Grose makes a similar remark upon the same case . He says , " A doubt is entertained whether there can be a patent for an addition to an old manufacture . This doubt rests altogether upon Bircot 's case , 3 Inst. 184 ; and if that were to be considered as law at this day , it would set aside many patents for very ingenious inventions , in cases where the additions to manufactures before existing , are much more valuable than the original manufactures themselves .

The cases on Watt 's patent brought this question directly before the courts for his invention was professedly an improvement on the steam-engine . In one of those cases which came before the Exchequer Chamber in 1795 , Mr. Justice Buller said , ' * that a patent for an addition or improvement may be maintained , is a point which &as; never been directly decided ; and Bircot 's case , 3 Inst. 184 , is an express authority against it , which case was decided in the Exchequer Chamber . What were the particular facts of that case we are not informed , and there seems to me to be more quaintness than solidity in the reason assigned , which is , that it was to put but a new button to an old coat , and it is much easier to add than to invent . If the button were new , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coat , on which the button was to be put , was old . But in truth arts and sciences at that period were at so low an ebb , in comparison with that point to which they have been since advanced , and the effect and utility of improvements so little known , that I do not think that case ought to preclude the question . In later times whenever the point has arisen , the inclination of the court has been in favor of the patent for the improvement , and the parties have acquiesced , where the objection /q/ /z/ might have been brought directly before the court . The preceding cases have been cited rather to show the course of the jurisprudence on this subject , and the grounds on which an addition or improvement was held to be patentable under the English statute of monopolies , than for the purpose of establishing the point that it is so , of which there can be no doubti since , as we have seen , the act of Congress expressly recognises the right to such a patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 . Whether a thing is new , or the improvement merely of what was known before ; and 2 . Where the alleged invention is described to be an improvement merely , whether it is a substantial material improvement , or only a change in form . On the first of these questions Mr. Justice Story says , ' it is difficult to defiae the exact cases , when the whole machine may be deemed a new invention , and when only an improvement of an old machine ; the cases often approach very near to each other . In the present improved state of machinery , it is almost impracticable not to employ the same elements of motion , and in some particulars , the same manner /z/ 2 H.

Wheels , with their known modes of operation , and known combinations , must be of very extensive employment in a great variety of new machines ; and if they could not , in the new invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist for a whole machine embracing such mechanical powers . " " Where a specific machine already exists , producing certain effects , if a mere addition is made to such machine , to ' produce the same effects in a better manner , a patent can not be taken for the whole machine , but for the improvement only . The case of a watch is a familiar instance . The inventor of the patent lever , without doubt , added a very useful improvement to it ; but his right to a patent could not be more extensive than his invention . The patent could not cover the whole machine as improved , but barely the actual improvement . The same illustration might be drawn from the steam-engine , so much improved by Messrs . Boulton and Watt . In like manner if to an old machine , some new combinations be added , to produce new effects , the right to a patent is limited to the new combinations . " ' On the other hand , if well knoum effects are produced by machinery in ail its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a patent may be claimed for the whole machine . ' " * An eminent jurist remarks that ' in the present improved state of the arts , it is often a question of intrinsic difficulty , especially in cases of the invention of minute additions to complicated machinery , to decide whether one machine operates upon the same principle as another , and whether that which is stated to be an improvement , be really new and useful , ' And he proceeds to suggest , upon the authority of the above decisions of Mr. Justice Story , that , in deter* mining whether a machine is an improvement upon those already known , or substantially the same , the material point of inquiry is , not whether the same elements of motion , and , in some particulars , the same manner of operation , and the same component parts are used , but whether the given effect be pro duced substantially by the same mode of operation , and the me combination of powers in both ma- chines .

ViL above , proposes the combination of these two circumstances as a criterion . But his meaning doubtless is that these are characteristic of an improvement constituting an invention which may serve to distinguish it where other characteristic distinctions are wanting ; and Chancellor Kent , would not probably be understood to lay down a different doctrine . The use of different elements of motion , or different mechanical principles or combinations ofler equally marked grounds of discrimination , which are no less to be resorted to , than the method of operating and the result . Indeed the result or effect can scarcely be considered a criterion , for this by itself is not , as we have seen , patentable . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not merely a slight , immaterial , formal variety of what was already known , whether patented or not , we must look , not at a part merely , but at all of the characteristics of a patentable invention , the elements , principles , method or mode of operation , and according as we find these , originally , more or less combined in the alleged improvement , it will appear proportibnably more or less satisfactorily to constitute the basis of a patent . The following case in the Court of King 's Bench , in England , illustrates what may be considered as amounting to a patentable improvement . A patent was /q/ granted for an improvement in the manufacturing of chain cables . The improvement was alleged to con* sist in so applying the link to the force to operate on it , that that force should operate in one place , namely at the end ; and this was effected by having a broad-ended bar across , instead of a conical one , which broad-ended bar lapped round the link , instead of perforating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were weak in themselves , and if broken , there would be a pressure in some other part . The links were to have circular ends , and sides nearly parallel , but bulging out towards the middle . Abbott C. J. As at present advised , I am inclined to think that the combination of a link of this particular form , with the stay of the form used by the patentee , although the form of the link might have been known before , is so far new and beneficial as to sustain a patent . " Bayley J. was of the same opinion . ' In this case a link of the same form had been before in use , and it had been strengthened by a bar across it , but a change of the form of this bar , and the manner of attaching it to the link , was considered , and as it should seem with very good reason , by Chief Justice Abbott and Mr. Justice Bayley , to be a good founda- Bruoton ? .

Insufficiency of the Invention . Ornaments . The second section of the act of Congress of Feb. 2 , 1793 , c. 55 , s. 3 , which authorizes a patent for an im* provement , declares " that simply changing the form or the proportions of any machine , or composition of matter , in any degree , shall not be deemed a discovery . " This construction would undoubtedly have been put upon the law without any such express exception . It is indeed but the branch of a more general rule in giving a construction to the law , namely , that any change or modification of a machine or other patentable subject , which would be obvious to every person acquainted with the use of it , and which makes no material alteration in the mode and principles of its operation , and by which no material addition is made , is not a ground for claiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an article to be patentable , or a reconstruction of it upon substantially the same principles , with unimportant differences in form or proportions , Sec . XIL Change of Form , fyc. 141 would defeat the beneficial operation of the statute and in effect repeal it . The principle of this pravision of the statute is as applicable to most alleged new inventions as to professed improvements on patented machines , since almost every invention is an alleged improvement , either on what has been patented , or what has been practised without ever having been subject to a patent , and as soon as a patented art or machine has become firee by the expiration of the patent , it stands upon the same ground as any art or machine which has been in free public use time out of mind . To authorize a patent in either case , there must be , not merely a fbrnaal , trivial variation from what was known , but a distinguishable , substantial difference . In a case in the English Court of Chancery , Mr. Bell , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessary to show that an invention was the result of long application or deep skill . He remembered that many years ago ladies wore flowered tabbies . The method of working the flowers was discovered by mere accident ; a man having spit upon the floor , placed his hot iron on it , and observed that it spread out into a kind of flower . He afterwards tried the ex* periment upon linen , and found it produced the same , 142 Subjecis of Patents . Ch . VII- eShcU He then obtained a patent , and lived to make a considerable fortune . ' " * The sufficiency of the invention depends not upon the labor , skill , study , or expense applied or bestowed upon it , but upon its being diverse and distinguishable from what is familiar and well known , and also substantially and materially , not slightly and trivially so . This requisite of an invention is sometimes expressed to be a difference in principle . " What constitutes a difference m principle between two machines , is frequently a question of difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the machinery complicated . But we think it may safely be laid down as a general rule , that where the machines are substantially the same , and operate in the same manner , to produce the same result , they must be in principle the same . I say tvhsiantiallyy in order to exclude all formal differences , and when I speak of the same result , I must be understood as meaning the same kind of result , though it may differ in extent . So that the result is the same according to this definition , whether the one produce 7  --  Walker v. Congreve , 29 Rep. of Arts , 2d Series , Vol. 29 , p. 311 . Sec .

A patent had been granted , in 1818 , to Hadden , for an improvement in manufacturing woolen cloth by passing the wool between hollow iron rollers heated by putting heaters into them . Lister varied the process by heating the rollers by steam , and by passing the wool through hot water to soften it . This was ruled at nisi prius not to be a sufficient improvement upon Hadden 's invention , or rather , not to be a sufficient vari- Per WashiDgton J. , Gray and Osgood y . Jamea and others , 1 Pet .

Ch . VII . ation from it , to constitute an invention , and the patent was on this ground repealed . The question of the identity or diversity of two manufactures was much discussed in the case already cited on the patent for an improvement in the manufacture of ships ' anchors . The specification stated that in place of the common method of joining the two flukes , consisting of distinct pieces of iron , to the shank by welding , which requires the iron to be so frequently heated as to destroy its tenacity , the patentee made the shank in one piece , and the two flukes in another ; and the piece intended for the arms was formed of such a thkkness in the middle as to allow a hole to be made through the centre , to receive the thick end of the shank ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no strain could separate the flukes from the shank ; by which means the necessity of endangering the solidity of the materials was avoided , only one heat being necessary to bring the thick end of the shank and the hole into perfect contact . In an action for an infringement , Abbott C. J. said that " the improvement claimed by The Kiiig y . Lister , Gods . Sup . 71 . Hadden 's patent was also repealed on scire facias , at the instigation of Lister on the ground that it was not a new invention . The King V. Hadden , Gods . Sup . 71. /z/ Sec . XII . Change ofFortny c. 145 the patentee , was precisely the method by which the shank of the mushroom anchor is united to the mushroom top ; by which the shank of the adz anchor is united to its other parts . It is indeed the mode by which the different parts of the common hammer , and the pickaxe also , are united together . Now a patent for a machine , each part of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the difkreit parts is new , and a new result produced , is good ; because there is a novelty in the combination . But here the case is perfectly different ; formerly three pieces were united together ; the plaintiff only unites two ; and if the union of those two bad been effected in a mode unknown before , as applied in any degree to similar purposes , I should have thought it a good ground for a patent ; but unfortunately , the mode was well known and long practised . I think that a man can not be entitled to a patent for uniting two things instead of three , where that union is effected in a mode well known and long practised for a similar purpose . It seems to me , therefore , that there is no novelty in this improvement . " Bayley J. ** Could there be a patent for making , in one entire piece , what before had been made in two pieces ? I think not . After having had a one-fluked anchor , could you have a patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 146 Subjects of Patents . Ch . VII . much . After the analogies alluded to in argument of the hammer and pickaxe , I do not think that the mere introducing the shank of the anchor , which I may call the handle , in so similar a mode , is an invention for which a patent can be sustained . It is said , in this case , that the mushroom anchor and adz anchor , are not ships ' anchors , but mooring anchors . I think they are ships ' anchors ; they are not indeed such anchors as ships carry with them for the purpose of bringing the ship up ; but if the ship is required to be stationary , at a particular place , then the common mode of making it stationary , is by the mushroom anchor . So the mode adopted to bring a ship containing a floating light to an anchor , is by mooring her to one of these mushroom anchors . That is the description of anchor for a holdfast to the ship . The analogy between the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close to that of the present anchor , that it does not appear to me that this discovery can be considered so far new as to be the proper ground of a patent . " Best J. ' It is said that the invention consists in the application of that which was known before to a new subject matter , viz. that the patentee had , for the first time , applied to the manufacturing of anchors , a mode in which welding was avoided , which however had been long practised in other instances ; but the Sec . XII . Change ofForniy c. 147 ) ) atentee does not state that as the ground upon which he had applied for his patent , nor state in the specification , that it being known that the process of welding weakens the anchor , be had first applied to an anchor a mode long practised in the manufacture of other instruments , viz. of making the two flukes of one piece instead of two . If he had so described this process , the question would then arise , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I incline to think , however , that it having been long known that welding may be avoided in instruments of a similar form , the application of that practice for the first time , to a ship 's anchor , can not be considered a new invention , and , therefore , that it is not the ground of a patent . It is unnecessary , however , to decide that question in this case , because the patentee has claimed the mode of avoiding welding as a new discovery . " " Mr. Chief Justice Gibbs gives an illustration of variation in form merely . In the case of Bovill v. Moore , ( Dav . Pat . Cas. 361 , ) he mentions the expedient used by a man in Cornwall , who endeavored to pirate the steam-engine . ' He produced an engine , which , on the first view of it , had not the least resemblance to Boulton and Watt 's ; where you look- 79 Brunton v.

" The distinction of a mere formal variation from a substantial improvement is in many cases very nice . In a case before Lord Ellenborough , Huddart had obtained a patent for a new mode of making cables and other cordage . It appeared that his invention differed from Belfour 's , because that which was efiected with a ring by Belfour , was produced by a tube in the mode of making ropes by Huddart . Ixrd Ellenborough . The tube does seem to me an important difference from the mere circle through which the strands pass , because it keeps them in a degree of confinement for a longer time , and more certainly obtains the end pointed out ; in Mr. Belfour 's specification the same end is to be attained ; and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tube , which was before done by a ring or ; ircle , I should have thought the patent good ; for that is a distinct substantive invention. * 19 Huddart GrimabaW Day .

Sir John Leach , in an argument made by him as counsel , in the case of an alleged improvement in the construction of barrels for containmg gunpowder , said , ' ' The making of an old machine of new materials , could not be a discovery ; and the plaintiff could claim no protection , for an invention , the only merit of which consisted in being made of brass instead of wood .

The provision on the subject of change of proportions is expressly extended by the act of Congress , to compositions of matter as well as to machines , and yet there are instances of compositions of matter in which the proportions are material . In one case one Walker v. Converse , Rep. of Arts , 2d Series , Vol. 29 , p. 311 .

When the invention depends materially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where , accordingly , a change in this respect makes a different process or a different result , such a change would certainly come within the description of patentable subjects in the second section of the act of Congress ; it would not be " simply " a change of proportions . The French law of 1791 classes mere ornaments with changes in form and proportions , as not being subjects of patents . But this appears to be a very questionable position , for it would never be contended , in case of an invention of which a part was ornamental merely , that this part might be infringed with impu* nity ; and there appears to be no more ground for yielding any more protection to ornamental parts in an original invention , than in an improvement , or in a case where a part of the invention was ornamental , than one which should be wholly confined to ornament .

By the sixth section of the English statute of monopolies it is provided that , in order to exempt a manufacture from the general prohibition of monopolies , it must be one that is ** not mischievous to the State by raising the price of commodities at home , or hurt of trade , or generally inconvenient . " The only part of the act of Congress of 1793 , and that of July 4th , 1836 , in this respect , is simply the epithet usefidy the provision of the first section of the former , and the third of the latter , being , that if any one shall allege that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or composition of matter , he may apply for a patent .

" ' ' In some of the earlier cases in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts for infringements of patents , the defendants , putting the same construction upon the act of Congress as that put upon the English statute of monopolies by Mr. Godson , and by some of the English judges , set up the defence that the machine , for the infringement of which the action was brought , was not a useful one , as it was no improvement on the methods previously in use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come within the description of inventions far which a patent was authorized . ' On this ground of defence the deciaons of Mr. Justice Story are very full and explicit .

It is not necessary to establish , that the invention is of such general utility as to supersede all other inventions now in practice to accomplish the same purpose . It is sufficient that it has no noxious or mischievous tendency , that it may be applied to practical uses , and that so far as it is applied it is salutary . If its practical utility be very limited , it will follow , that it will be of little or no profit to the inventor , and if it be trifling , it will sink into utter neglect .

Neither the oath re* quired by the second section , nor the special matter of defence allowed to be given in evidence by the sixth section of the act contains any such qualification or reference to general utility , to establish the validity of the patent . Nor is it alluded to in the tenth section as a cause for which the patent may be vacated . To be sure , all the matters of defence or of objection to the patent are not enumerated in these sections ; * ' but if such a one as that now contended for , had been intended , it is scarcely possible to account for its omission . In . my judgment the argument is utterly without foundation . All that the law requires is , that the invention should not be frivolous , or injurious to the well-being , good policy , or sound morals of society .

But if the invention steers wide of these objections , whether it be more or less useful is a circumstance very material to the interest of the patentee , but of no importance to the public If it be not extensively usefiil it will silently sink into contempt and disregard . " Mr. Justice Story bints , upon this kind of defence , in a case of infringement , that it , in some cases , reduced the defendant to a dilemma , since if he had not used the invention , there was no occasion to resort to this defence ; if he had , the averment that it was useless came with an ill grace from him , since it was contradicted by his practice . This ground of de  - -  fence accordingly does not appear very frequently in the reports . It does , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a patent . It was held in England , that in an action for the infringement of an improvement , the inutility of the original invention , could not be given in evidence in defence , or in other words , though the original invention was not useful , the improvement might be so , for Lowell T.

' It is not , " he remarked , ** the intrinsic value of the thing itself , but its capacity to be converted into something which may be usefiif , that gives it value . Admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , ( the one infringed upon ) , in the form in which it came from his hands , was so far inferior to the nail machines then in use as to deprive it of all intrinsic value ; yet if another person can superadd to that invention something which will remove all its defects , and render it useful , it immediately becomes valuable , not on account of its own qualities , but because of its capacity to receive the improvement , and with its aid to become useful . The original discovery and the improvement become articles of traffic between the two discoverers as soon as the improvement was made which it was their mutual Aject to give value to. /z/ /z/ 158 SubjecU of Patents .

The requisite of usefulness has been sometimes contrasted with frivolousness , ** and the multiplicity of patents for trivial subjects has been occasionally deprecated by judges , " An invention may be slight and trivial as being so obvious and apparent that it can not be considered a discovery , or it may be trivial or frivolous in respect to its e &ct; upon industry and production .

It is not provided by law that the patentee , unless he is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or be able to find a purchaser ibr the thing of which he has the monopoly ; nor has either of these conditions been insisted upon by any construction put upon the law . To make any such condition , would be the same as to make it imperative upon a party to whom a reward is offered to accept it . The meaning of monopoly . Act of CoDgresB of July 4 , 1886 , c. 357 , s. 15. 164 Subjeets ofPaitnis . Cfa . YIL ( and a patent , as we have seen , is one , ) is the exclusive privUege of selling the subject of which die monopoly is granted . In some monopolies , as , for instance , that of the trade to a particular foreign port , or in a particular article , a condition may be made that the monopolist shall avail himself of the privilege or lose it . So it might be provided in the patent law , that the patentee should either himself make the thing to which the patent relates , or authorize others to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , should be offered for sale ; still if it leaves him the privilege of fixing his price , this would put it in his power to prevent the sale , and so render the requisition that It should be offered for sale , ine &ctual.; K the law should go still further , and provide for prescribing the terms on which the article should be offered for sale , by referring it to some board to regulate the market value , it would subject the monopolist to much embarrassment , and , at least , greatly impair the value of his privilege , besides opening a door to vexatious interference and abuse . There might be still another provision on this sub - ject , requiring that the matter to which the patent related , or its products , should be sold publicly within a certain time , under penalty of forfeiture of the privilege . But if the quantity or number of speci- Sec . XV . Vendibiliiy. 165 mens were not fixed , the proviaon might be easily evaded , and , in order to fix the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to constitute a board , with an arUtrary discretion in the case ; to which there would be the same objections as to a board for regulating the price . Then , again , the reason why the patentee makes no sale , nray be that the invention is considered of no value whatever by any person , excepting the inventor himself , and so other peisons do not regard his ex* elusive privilege to be any interference with their pursuits or bterests . This is , in fact , the case with many patents ; and , in all these instances , there is po motive for any requisition or regulation on the subject . And , finally , in still another case , a sale may not be practicable , though the invention may be useful and valuable , merely because it is not well understood by other persons than the inventor , or because no one , who has the necessary means and facilities for putting it into actual operation , has made it a subject of his attention . These are reasons why the law does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , require that the invention , or its products , of which the privilege of exclusive sale is granted , shall be sold or offered for 166 SubjecU of Patmt9 . Cb . VIL sale . It may be asked theo , whether there ought not to be some provision against the perverseness of a patentee , who should willingly sacrifice his own in- Cerest for the satisfaction of acting the dog in the manger , and enjoy his exclusive privilege , by observing bow much the public is incommoded , and how great a benefit it is in his power to withhold from them ? Certainly not ; for this is an inconvenience and depriva* tion to which the community is exposed in another case , namely , that of an artist who is able , by his superior genius and skill , to produce the most admira ble work , but who , bom indolence , or some other or , as sometimes happens , from mere wayward ness , neglects to make use of the exclusive privilege conferred by his superior genius and skill . His privi* lege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patentee , inasmuch as that of the latter is one of express grant ffom the government ; but this difiference will not be so material , on consideration , as it might at first view appear , since the grant is made , not like that of a branch of foreign trade , in consideration that it is to be used during the existence of the privilege , but in consideration that the patentee has given a specification whereby the public may have the benefit of his invention at the expiration of his privilege . During the privilege , therefore , all the conditions having been Sec . XV Vendibility. 167 complied with , it stands on the same ground as an7 other pifivate right , as that of property , or of using one 's industry , and so should be subject to the same rules of legislation and regulation , and no others . lo regard to all kinds of private rights , the community is affected by the good or bad use of them ; but in this , it is necessary to rest , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give directions for the use of alt individual rights , in all respects , and one universal exception is made to the expediency of any legislative regulation , namely , when the real and obvious interest of the individual is coincident with that of the public . In such cases , the interest of the community is generally left free to be promoted or prejudiced , according as the individual has or has not the good sense to make the use of his rights , that his own interest , properly understood , would dictate . If , then , the doctrine that the subject of a patent or its products , must be vendible , does not mean that a demand for it must exist , nor that there must necesh sarily be an offer for sale , as an essential condition of the validity of the monopoly , what is the construction ta be put upon the doctrine ? It is , that the thing patented , or its products or results , must be of a vendible character or description ; or , such as can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to 168 Subjects of Patents . Ch .

The very terms invention and discovery import , in their general and most obvious signification , that the thing discovered or invented is new to the inventor . But it is not so distinctly and necessarily implied in those terms bow far it must be new to other persons , as to exclude all doubt , since an invention may be new to the inventor , which is familiar to many others ; or it may be new in his neighborhood , and well known in other parts of the country ; or it may be new in his own country , while it is in familiar use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already known , it may have been so recently invented , as to be still new , at the time of the posterior invention .

" So the act of Congress limits the privilege in like manner to the things not known or used before the application " for the patent . On this subject of the novelty of the invention , we shall find some difference between the English laws on one side , and that of the United States on the other . The first inquiry relates to the time in reference to which the invention must be new . Must it be so at the time of the granting of the patent , or at least at the time of the application for it , or is it enough that /z/ no Subjects of Patents . Ch .

It the moment of the delivery of the patent , does , or does not , receive the communication of a species or mode of industry which it did not before possess ; " if it does the patent is valid , otherwise it is null . This is the rigorous doctrine of the English law , ** from which M. Renouard apparently adopts it . The doctrine strikes the mind as preposterous in either country , but more palpably so in England , where ordinarily very considerable time necessarily elapses between the application and the granting of the patent , so that the inventor thereby , in the very act of applying for a patent , takes the hazard of defeating his right to one , since he thereby gives some publicity to his invention , and thus unavoidably holds out to others a facility in pirating it before the patent can be issued , and so is obliged to risk the rendering his patent void by the very means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 174 . Jones Pearce , Grodson Sup . 4 . Sec . XVI . Nwelty , fyc. 171 law to take to obtain it . Nothing can be imagined more preposterous than this doctrine . It could hardly be supposed that a doctrine , so repugnant to the principles and spirit of the patent laws , could have arisen by mere construction of language , which admitted of any other interpretation ; and we accordingly find , by recurring to the fifth and sixth sections of the Englbh statute of monopolies , which constitute the patent laws of England , that it is derived from the language of the law taken in a strict and literal sense . The sixth section of that law , after abolishing monopolies generally , makes an exception of temporary monop* olies for the sole working and making of any manner of new manufactures to the true and first inventor , ' which others , at the time of making such letters patents and grants , shall not use . By taking this clause in a literal sense , the English courts have gone far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to inventors by that section ; and if we may rely upon M. Renouard 's exposition of the French law , the same doctrine , so fatal to patents in England , * " has been adopted in France . The operation of the doctrine would not probably be so prejudicial to the Weitm . Rev. No. 48 , Jan. 1835 . Foster 's Am . Edit . p. 100 , 172 Subjeds of Patents . Ch* VII . interests of inventors in that country as it has proved to be in fkigland , since , in examining the proceedings for the taking out of a patent , as described by that author , it seems that much less time would be requisite than is necessarily consumed in England , in applying to one office after another , before the inventor can obtain the grant promised to him by the law . Still the doctrine is the same , and bears upon its face the same absurdity , in one country , as in the other . It has the effect of exposing the inventor to the loss of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent for the purpose of making experiments to perfect his invntion . The ground of this doctrine , as far as it can be supported otherwise than on the literal provision of law , is , that a thought or art having been published , and the public having taken advantage of it and reduced it to use , is their property , from whatever source they may have obtained the information . But a moment 's reflection will show us that there would be the same reason precisely for sheltering a public use arising after the grant of the patent , as one arising after the application for it , since Westm .

There does not , on the whole , seem to be any foun* dation for this doctrine , unless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too plain and absolute to be controlled by construction , which is not the case with the section of the statute of monopolies above cited , since it is an absurdity so to construe a law as to hold that the very means prescribed by the law as a compliance with its provisions , should , without any fault of the party for whose benefit the law is made , expose him to a forfeiture of its benefits . We shall introduce the authorities as to the degree of publicity and kind of use by others by which the inventor forfeits his privilege , in a subsequent part of this chapter ; for whether the time to which reference is had in determining on the novelty of the invention be the date of the invention , of the application for a patent , or the grant of it , the doctrine as to the degree of publicity , or extent and kind of use whereby the patent is defeated , may be the same . The cases subsequently cited will show very distinctly that the doctrine of the English law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the examinations that took place on the subject of patents before the committee of tho British House of Commons in 1829 , a number of th /z/ 174 Sulytcii of PaienU .

' ' The same question has come up in discussion in the United States . ' There is/ ' says Mr. Justice Story , a difference between the language and efiect of our statute respecting patents , and that of England . The statute 21 Jac . 1 , c. 3 , prohibits the grant of monopolies generally ; but in the sixth section it excepts Metters patent and grants of privileges for fourteen years or under , of the sole working or rnakiing of any manner of new manufacture iPiihin this realm to the true and first inventor and inventors of such manufacture , which others at the time of making such letters patent and grants , shall not use. * Upon this statute it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be new to all the world , but it is sufficient , if new vnihin the realm of England , and it mattera not whether learned by travel or by study .

" " The patent act of the United States , st. 1793 , c. 156 , uses language somewhat different .

If this were all , there would be great difficulty in construing the words not known or used before the application ' differently from the words of the English statute , ' which others , at the making of the letters patent and grants , shall not use .

Ch . VIL tain with more precision the intention of the legblatare . That section authorizes the defendant to give certain matters in evidence , hy way of defence , under the general issue , upon proper notice , and among other things , that the thing thus secured by patent was not originally discovered by the patentee , but had been in lue , or had been described in some public work , anterior to the supposed discovery of the patentee . Upon these clauses it has been uniformly held , that it must be shown that the invention is new not only in the United States , but to the world , and that it was not in me before the asserted discovery . The fact of its being in we before his discovery , is , by the sixth section , made decisive against the patentee . Now if the intention of the legislature had been , by the first section , to provide that the mere fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventor 's permission , before the application for a patent , should destroy his right , however otherwise well founded , it is strange , that the use should not be limited , in the sixth section , to the time of such application instead of the ' supposed discovery , The sixth section manifestly proceeds upon the ground , that the same thing being in use at the time of the supposed discovery , establishes , that there is nothing new in the invention ; but it may be known and used Sec .

' "  - -  It being once settled that the first inventor is entitled to a patent , it follows of course that the period referred to for testing the novelty of the invention is not the date of the application , since , at this date , in /z/ V.

The general object of the law roust , therefore , be defeated in those cases where there are independent inventions of the same thing , or the date , not of the application , but of the invention , must be referred to in determining on the novelty of the art or manufacture . At the time of the invention by the prior inventor , he has a right to a patent , of which he may avail himself unless he subsequently forfeits that right . By the law on this subject , as construed and administered in the United States , he may realize the fruits of his invention unless he loses them by his own negligence ; whereas in England , as we have seen , he may be deprived of his privilege , though he may not be chargeable with any fault or negligence . The characteristic diffei*ence between the law on this point , as administered in England and the United States , is , that in England the inventor is not supposed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patent , whereas in the United States the law supposes him to have a right at the time of invention , which he may forfeit , it is true , but which it depends on him- Sec . XVI . Novelty , c. 179 self either to forfeit , or , by taking the proper steps , to perfect and establish . In reading the English and American cases , it is necessary to bear constantly in mind the distinction above pointed out . In regard to England , for instance , if the inquiry relate to the use of the invention by others , as affecting the rights of the patentee , the use or knowledge at the time of granting the patent is referred to , whereas in the United States the mquiiy would , to many purposes , relate to the use made of the manufacture by others at the time of the patentee 's invention , for we suppose him to invent the thing at any rate , in order to raise any question , since , if he be not the inventor , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , if he be the inventor , he has no claim , if others knew of and used the art or manufacture at the time of his making the mvention . There is distinction in terms between a prior invert iion and a prior use , though in relation to this subject the two expressions mean , in some respects , substantially the same thing , but in other respects they are distinguished from each other . In the leading sense of the term invention it signifies an intellectual process , that is , to use Dr. Johnson 's definition , an excogitation . In treating of the subject of invention in a former 180 Subjects of Patents . Ch . Vil. sectioD , ' it appeals , however , that the law does not regard a mere conceptioD , imagiQation , or intellectual process , as being the subject of a monopoly , independently of its reduction to use . The things for which patents are grantable , we have seen , must be arts , machines , manufactures , practical methods or processes or applications of principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation for a patent , something must be wrought , done or produced . The same construction is necessarily adopted in considering the question of prior invention ; the question of priority is not limited to the mere conception , but has respect to the invention as already explained , and if the patentee is the prior inventor in this sense his patent will not be defeated merely because some other person may before have imagined something of the same sort . That the prior inventor , in the sense already explained , has the preference , and is entided to a patent , unless he forfeits his right , is held in many /z/ The kind of use or reduction to practice , and putting into operation , necessary to constitute an invention , so lo ' Section 8 .

The law in such case can not give the whole patent right to each inventor , even if each be equally entitled to the merit of being an original and independent inventor ; and it therefore adopts the maxim , qui prior est in tempore , potior est in jure* The statute 1793 , c. 156 , s. 6 , declares it a good defence to an action for the infringement of the patent right , that the thing thus secured by patent was not originally discovered by the patentee , but had been in use , or had been described in some public work anterior to the supposed discovery of the patentee .

But if the first inventor reduced his theory to practice , and put bis machine or other invention into use , the law never could intend , that the greater or less use in which it might be , or the more or less widely the knowledge of its existence might circulate , should constitute die criterion by which to decide upon the validity of any subsequent patent for the same invention .

A case in the English reports supplies an exception to the doctrine as to the priority of invention which will entitle the inventor to a patent as above laid down , namely , where the first inventor , though he reduces the invention to use , yet keeps it secret , and shows an intention not to give the public the benefit of it . It was the case of an improvement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but suppressed by hira until Mr. Dolland had subsequently made the same invention and procured a patent for it , the validity of which was disputed on the ground that he was not the first inventor .

See alao Forsyth v. Reviere , Chitty Jr 's . Prer. of the Crown , 1822 , n . Sec . XVL JoneUj/j c. 185 since it would put the priority , not upon the circumstance of the invention , but of the publication , which would be contradictory to the current of the decisions .

That is , as the inventor now permits the public to use his invention without taking out a patent is held thereby to abandon it to the public , so that if he uses it in secret , without applying for a patent and in a way to show that he does not intend to apply for one , he ought to be considered as having abandoned his right to claim a patent . Under the act of congress of 1793 Mr. Justice Washington laid down a doctrine at variance with that of Dollands case . He considered that the inventor lying by for ever so long a period , and not taking out a patent , or continuing to use his invention , did not thereby forfeit his right of a patent , and that he might thus stand in the way of a patent being granted to any other inventor of the same thing .

But if both applied at the same time for a patent , and their claims were referred to arbitrators , according to the statute , no patent could be granted unless the of priority were decided in favor of one of them , and perhaps a case could hardly occur which could not be decided , if the claim turned merely upon the question of priority . It seems , however , from an English case , that where there is no other ground of discrimination the priority of application would decide the right .

We perceive how prejudicial the rule adopted ip England and France must be to the interests of the inventor , and to the beneficial operation of the patent law , by depriving the inventor of all the advantage of communication with others on the subject of bis invention previous to taking out his patent , for if he so makes it known , it may give others an opportunity to defeat his patent by piracy . An instance of the danger an inventor is under of losing the benefit of his invention , by letting it in any way transpire before he has the great seal , is mentioned by Mr. Davis . A person had invented an improvement upon spectacles , and as his patent was in a state of forwardness , he had not been sufficiently cautious in keeping the invention to himself , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knowledge of it , and hastily got a pair made upon the same construction , and exposed them in his window ; fortunately , however , the inventor happened to pass the shop , and seeing them , employed a friend to go and purchase them , in which he succeeded , and his 190 Subjects of Patents .

There are many reasons which may , it is conceived , be assigned why the grant would not be good in law . By the imprudence of the discoverer himself , two persons at least became acquainted with his invention before the patent was sealed , and one actually made the article and exposed it to sale . The moment the third person bought it , he , as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made public , if it had not become so by the exposure to sale . It is difficult to imagine upon what principle this publicity could he done away with ; certainly not by the gift of it back to the discoverer . There was knowledge of the secret  --  an actual making  --  and a public sale by a person who was not the patentee . " " ' Such is Mr. Godson 's view of the English doctrine on this subject . In whatever relation we view the subject , we meet with the inconveniences of that unfortunate doctrine . Whereas , on the contrary , in n7 Dav . Pat C. 445 . Godion , 63 . Sec .

The doctrine of the English courts , that the inventor , by disclosing his secret , and permitting the use of his invention before obtaining a patent , though without the intention of waiving his privilege , in fact forfeits his right to a patent , has been adopted in France in its full rigor , as appears from an adjudication of the Court of Errors , of February , 1806 . In that case the inventors of a carding machine had disclosed their invention to the municipal administration of Orleans , who , at their request , had tested its utility by a public inspection and experiment , of which they had given a formal certificate to the inventors . The inventors had besides voluntarily permitted a manufacturer to use their machine to card with . It was adjudged that in thus giving publicity to their invention , they had voluntarily made it public property , and consequently , that the patent subsequently ob 192 Subjects of Patents . Cli .

' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being too rigorous , and contended that their intention to abandon their privilege ought not to be presumed , but , on the contrary , that their right ought to remain unimpaired , unless an intention to abandon it were clearly proved . But M. Renouard , in 1825 , approves of the judgment , on the ground that it was immaterial to the public , whether it was the intention of the inventors to abandon their privilege , or retain it ; that the only question was , whether publicity had been given to the invention , from whatever cause , for it was this publicity which gave the public the right , and consequently deprived the inventors of their privilege . He thinks , however , that the inventor has , in such case , an action against one who may have injured him by a piracy of his invention . The same author puts the case of a patent being taken out by the party who has pirated the secret , before the invention has been patented by the inventor , and is of opinion that , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out " ' Renouard , c. 5. s. 1 , p. 170 , cited by him from the General Jurisprudence of M. Dalloz , t. 2 , p. 263 . Sec . XVII . Previous Publication . 193 another patent yet he has the right to be substituted in the patent taken out for the party who has thus fraudulently obtained it . For in such case , he says , the public has obtained such possession of the invention as is inconsistent with his privilege . Neither the English law , nor our own , has any form of proceeding for such subrogation or substitution ; but our law admits of the inventor 's taking out a patent himself , and then procuring the one previousjy taken out to be cancelled , or treating it as null and void , and prosecuting the piratical party , and those claiming and using the right under him , for an infringement of his patent. *** The case is otherwise if the invention has been described in some public work . The act of Congress is explicit upon this point . The sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of defences in an action for the infringement of a patent , on the establishment of either of which , the court may declare the patent to be void , mentions , as one of these defences , proof that the invention was not originally discovered by the patentee , but had been in use , or had been described in some public work , anterior to the supposed discovery of the patentee . The seventh * See Renouard , c. 8 , a. 2 , p. 313 , 314. /z/ 194 Subjects of Patents . Ch .

In such case , the description belongs to the public , and any one person can not , by reducing the thing to practice , deprive others of the advantage of the description .

" It may be , ' ' says Chief Justice Marshall , that the patentee had no knowledge of this previous description ; still his patent is void ; the law supposes he may have known it . " *** And the same rule has , by construction , been incorporated into the English law , upon this subject. * ' Upon these provisions the question may arise : What is a description ?

The courts would not , probably , require that the description should fully answer as a specification , but they would not consider any statement to be a description within the meaning of this clause , which should not serve as a direction for making , doing , or compounding the thing to which the description related . This is the construction adopted by M. Renouard . The same author also considers the question , What is a publication of the description within the meaning of the French law ? the phraseology of which is equivalent to that of the act of Congress of 1836 , the expression of the French law , section 16 , being , that the patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' described in printed and published works . ' ' As the law makes no distinction as to the language or place , M. Renouard thinks that a description in a work printed in any language , at any place , is within the provision of the law . It does not appear what publication will be considered by our courts a " public work " within the act of Congress of 1793 . The provision of the act of 1793 is applicable to all patents granted before July 4th , 1836 . The court certainly would not limit the construction to a work published in the United States , nor to works published in the English language ; but whether they Sec . XVIII . Foren Inventions . 197 will take the position laid down by M. Renouard , remains to be seen . Sec . XVIII .  --  Foreign Inventions . In regard to the novelty of the invention , there is one material difference between the construction given to the section of the English statute of monopolies , that has constituted the English patent law , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolies in the English act of parliament , as we have seen , is of the monopoly of the " sole working or making of any manner of new manufacture tvithin this realm ; " which has been construed to extend , not only to inventions originally made in England and not known elsewhere , but also to inventions made abroad and introduced into England , since such inventions were considered to come within the conditions of the exception , because they were new in England . This construction arose out of the practice of granting patents at the common law for imported inventions . In the case of the Cloth workers of Ipswich , which oc* curred nine years before the stature of monopolies was passed , it was said by the court , that ' if a man w Oodbolt , 2S2. /z/ 196 SkJyecU of PatenU .

But when that patent is expired , the king can not make a new grant thereof ; for when the trade is become common , and others have been bound apprentices in the same trade , there is no reason that such should be forbidden to use it . " * ' ' The same doctrine prevailed after the statute of monopolies was passed . It was early held , under that statute , that a grant of a monopoly may be to the first inventor by the 21 Jac . 1 ; and if the invention be new in England , a patent may be granted , though the thing was practised beyond sea before ; for the statute speaks of new manufactures within this realm ; so that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the act intended to encourage new devices useful to the kingdom , and whether learned by travel And see 9 Johns .

' * " Mr. Farey , one of the persons examined by the committee of the British Commons , in 1829 , discusses the question of the expediency of patenting inventions introduced from abroad , at some length , and concludes that it is decidedly expedient to allow patents in such cases to persons who introduce an invention , though themselves not the inventors , for the purpose of promoting a more early introduction of the invention , and to remunerate the patentee for the expense of introducing it. *** The law of the United States makes no distinction between inventions made abroad and at home as to the right of taking out a patent , except that a foreigner not resident in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention to become a citizen , pays a higher fee than a citizen or an alien resident in the country and having made such a declaration .

The other and greater hazard he would run in England would be the loss of his right by piracy , since a piratical use of the machine would there defeat his patent no less than one authorized by himself . In the United States , the jurisprudence in this respect is well settled on different principles , much more favorable to the interests of the inventor , and much more in accordance with the spirit of the patent laws . In a case in the Circuit Court of the United States , before Mr. Justice Thompson he said , ' No man is permitted to lie by for years and then take out a patent . If he has been practising his invention with a view of improving it , and thereby rendering it a greater benefit to the public , before taking out bis patent , that ought not to prejudice him . But it should always be a question submitted to the jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whether allowing the invention to be used without a patent should not be considered as an abandonment or present of it to the public . " The doctrine here laid down as to the experiments , and the use of the invention for the purpose of perfecting it , is assumed and taken for granted , as if a fonnal statement of it were superfluous , in the opinion of the whole Supreme Court , delivered by Mr. Justice Story . " The 15th section of the act of Congress of 1836 , c. 357 , seems to settle this point , and distinctly recognise the right of the inventor to take time to adapt and perfect his invention . We next consider how far an acquiescence of the inventor in , or his connivance at , the use of the invention by others , before taking out his patent , will affect its validity ? And here we are again considering a question that belongs to the American and not to the English jurisprudence ; for in the latter , as we have seen , the piracy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the consent or acquiescence of the inventor , and in spite of his vigilance to prevent it , is held to defeat the patent right ; much more should this result be held to follow the use of it by others with his knowledge and consent . And on this subject there is no doubt , according to our law , that if the inventor allows and encourages others to use his invention without interposing or asserting his claim to an exclusive privilege , or if he authorizes such use of it in a way inconsistent with his claim to such privilege , Pennock &; Sellers y . Dialogue , 2 Pet . 8 . C. R. 1 . Sec . XIX . Delay to take out a Patent , fyc. 205 he thereby dedicates it to the public and forfeits his right to take out a patent . This doctrine is founded upon the plainest principles of common honesty , for it would be inconsistent with the obvious rules of fair dealing that the inventor should either tacitly or expressly authorize others to erect machines and put them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat their labors and render their property of no value . The plainest case of this description , and one on which all the decisions are agreed , is that of a sale by the inventor , of the articles which are the subjects of his invention . It has been uniformly held that if the inventor , before applying for a patent , manufactures and sells the articles to which his invention relates , he thereby loses his right to a patent . So it has been held in England. * " In the jurisprudence of the United States , though the inventor is much more liberally treated than in that of England , still it has been distinctly held that a sale of the article before the grant of the patent , will render it void . " ' This question was very much discussed in the case of Pennock &,; Sellers v. Dia- 1 Holt , 11 . P. C. 68. wMelluf V. SiUbee , 4 Mason , K. 108. /z/ 206 Subjects of Patents . Ch . VIL logue , first in the Circuit Court of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Supreme Court of the United States. * The invention in question was that of an improvement in hosepipe in the mode of riveting the joints . The inventors had manufactured the article and authorized others to manufacture it for seven years before the grant of the patent ; and thirteen thousand feet of the article had been made and sold before the patent was taken out . It was held clearly , both in the Circuit and the Supreme Court , that the patent was void . Mr. Justice Washington , in charging the jury in the Circuit Court , said , " We are clearly of opinion that if an inventor makes his discovery public , looks on and permits others freely to use it without objection , or assertion of claim to the invention , of which the public might take notice , he abandons his inchoate right to the exclusive use of the invention , to which a patent would have entitled him , had it been applied for before such use . And we think it makes no difference in the principle , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular individual , who did so by the private permission of the inventor . As long as an inventor keeps to himself S. C. R.l. /q/ the subject of his discovery , the public can not be injured ; and even if it be made public , but accompanied by an assertion of the inventor 's claim to the discovery , those who should make use of the subject of the invention , would at least be put upon their guard . But if the public , with the knowledge and consent of the inventor , is permitted to use the invention without opposition , it is a fraud upon the public afterwards to take out a patent . ' ' Mr. Justice Story , giving the opinion of the Supreme Court in the same case , said , " It has not been , and indeed can not be denied , that an inventor may abandon his invention , and surrender or dedicate it to the public . This inchoate right , thus once gone , can not afterwards be resumed at his pleasure , for when gifts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become absolute . The question which generally arises at trials , is a question of fact , rather than of law  - -  whether the acts or acquiescence of the party furnish , in the given case , satisfactory proof of an abandonment or dedication of the invention to the public . " The act of Congress of July 4th , 1836 , c. 357 , s. 15 , settles this point by providing as one ground of defence in an action for an infringement , that the ' ' invention had been in public use or on sale with the consent and allowance of the patentee before Am 208 Subjects of Patents . Ch , VII . application for a patent . " This clause , it is to be observed , points to the time not of the grant of the patent , but to that of the application for one . If before making application for a patent , the inventor consent to , and allow of , the sale or public use of the invention , he thereby loses his right to take out a patent . The public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inventor is , by the provision just quoted , put upon the same ground as a sale by him . This raises the question . What is a public use ? And on this question some discussion was had before passing the act of July 4th , 1836 , and the law is the same on this subject since as before the passage of that act . The law on this subject is very explicitly laid down by Mr. Justice Story , in two cases that came before him in the Circuit Court of the Uuited States in the district of Massachusetts . In an action for the violation of a patent for a machine for making cotton and wool cards , it was contended that the patent should have been for an improvement of such machinery only . Story J. said , ' That it would not protect the plaintiffs patent , that he was the inventor of all the material improveTPRpt ? in the old machine , ( as is asserted ) if he suf- Sec . XIX .

' " ** In the other case the same judge said , U the inventor dedicates his invention to the public , he Can not afterwards resume it , or cliaim an exclusive right in it . It is like the dedication of a public way or other public easement . The question in such casies is a question of fact  --  Has lie so dedicated it ? I agree his acts are to be construed liberally ; that he is not to be estopped by licensing a few persons to use his invention to ascertain its utility , or by any acts of such peculiar indul-* gence and use , as may fairly consist with the clear intention to hold the exclusive privilege . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and suffers it to go into general and public use without objection ; if he asserts no exclusive right for years , with a full knowledge , that the public are led by it to a general use , such conduct amounts to strong proof , that he waives the exclusive right and dedicates the  --  i Whitemore Cutter , 1 Gftllison , 482. /z/ 210 Sidyeds of Patents . Ch . Vll. ioventioD to the world . After such conduct , the attempt to regain the exclusive right and secure it by a patent , would operate as a fraud upon the public ; and would hold out inducements to incur heavy expenses in putting inventions into operation , of which the party might be deprived at the mere will or caprice of the inventor. " *** . Mr. Justice M'Lean , giving . the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States upon this subject , said , Vigilance is necessary to entitle an individual to the privilege secured under the patent law . It is not enough that he should show his right by invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law And if the invention , through fraudulent means , shall be made known to the public , be should assert his right immediately , and take the necessary steps to legalize it . , The patent law was designed for the public benefit , as well as for tbebint of . inventors . For a valuable invention , the public , on h complying with certain conditions , give him , for a limited period , the profits arising on the sale of the thingn vented* This holds out an inducement for the exercise of genius and skill in making discoveries which may be useful to society , and profitable to the disco ver . t MeUofi y .

In the progress of society , the range of discoveries in the mechanic arts , in science , and in all things which promote the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged . This results from the aggregation of mind , and the diversity of talents and persuits , which exist , in every intelligent community . And it would be extremely impolitic to retard or embarrass this advance , by withdrawing from the public any useful invention or.art.and making it a subject of private monopply . Against this consequence , the legislature , have carefully guarded , in the laws they have passed on the subject . It is , undoubtedly , just that every discoverer should realize the benefits resulting from his discovery , for the period contemplated by law . But these can only be secured by a substantial compliance with every legal requisite . - His legal right does not rest alone upon his discovery ; but also upon the legal sanctions which have been : given to it , and the forms of law with which it has been clothed . . No matter by what means an . invention may have been communicated to the public before a patent is obtained ; any acquiescence in the public use , by the inventor , will be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted by him who fraudulently obtained it . B12 Subjects of Patents . Ch . VII . perhaps do lapse of time could give it validity . But the public stand in an entirety different relation to the inventor . The invention passes into the possession of innocent persons , who have no knowledge of the fraud , and at a considerable expense , perhaps , they appropriate it to their own use . The inventor or his agent has full knowledge of these facts , but fails to assert his right ; shall he afterwards be permitted to assert it with effect ? Is not this such evidence of acquiescence in the public use , on his part , as justly forfeits his right ? If an individual witness the sale and transfer of real estate , under certain circumstances , in which he has an equitable lien or interest , and does not make known this interest , he shall not afterwards be permitted to assert it . On this principle it is , that a discoverer abandons his right , if , before the obtainment of his patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be secured by giving public notice that he was the inventor of the thing used , and that he should apply for a patent . Does this impose any thing more than reasonable diligence on the inventor ? And would any thing short of this be just to the public ? The acquiescence of the inventor in the public use can , in no case , be presumed , when he has no knowledge of such use . But this knowledge may be presumed from the circumstances of the case . This will , See . XIX . Delay to take out a Patent , fyc. 813 in genera , be a fact for the jury . And if the inventor do not , immediately after this notice , assert his rights it is such evidence of acquiescence in the public use , as for ever afterwards to prevent him from asserting it . After his right shall be perfected by a patent , no presumption arises against it from a subsequent use by the public . When an inventor applies to the Department of State for a patent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is required to do so under the solemn obligations of an oath . If his invention has been carried into public use by fraud ; but for a series of months or years be has taken no steps to assert his right , would not this afford such evidence of acquiescence as to defeat bis application as effectually as if he failed to state that he was the original inventor ? And the same evidence which should defeat his application for a patent , would , at any subsequent period , be fatal to his right . The evidence he exhibits to the Department of State is not only ex parte , but interested ; and the questions of fact are left open to be controverted by any one , who shall think proper to contest the right under the patent . The strict construction of the act , as it regards the public use of an invention , before it is patented , is not only required by its letter and spirit , but also by sound policy . A term of fourteen years was deemed sufficient for the enjoy- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aa exclusive right of an invention by the in* ventor , but if he may delay an application for his patent , at pleasure , although hb invention be carried into public use , he may extend the period beyond what the law intended to give him . A pretence of fraud would afford no adequate security to the public in this rpect , as artifice might be used to cover the transaction . The doctrine of presumed acquiescence , where the public use is known , or might be known to tbe inventor , is the only safe rule which can be adopted on this subject . Some of the decisions of the Circuit Courts were overruled in the cases of Pennock b Sellers v. Dialogue . They made the question of abandonment to turn upon the intention of the inventor . But such is not considered to be the true ground . Whatever may be the intention of the inventor , if he su &rs; bis invention to go into public use , through any means whatsoever , without an immediate assertion of his right , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obtained under such circumstances , protect bis right .

Delay to take out a Patent fyc , 215 an alien , he could not , at that time , take out a patent for his invention ( which was that of the percussion ' gun-lock ) within two years , that is , until 1819 . He did not take his patent out until 1822 . His invention had , in the mean time , been sold m England , in 1819 , by his brother , to whom he had entrusted the secret , and was in public use there the two following years ; and during the latter of those years also in France .

He had taken no steps during this time to assert his right , and he could not satbfactorily soount for this delay . It was considered , therefore , that he had forfeited his right . A patent once granted is not forfeited in the United States by the neglect of the patentee to put his invention into practical operation .

The French law , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactorilj accounted for , and every law containing such a limitation of the time for putting the invention into use ought to have some provision for extending the time , since some inventions , requiring extensive preparations and large outlay , can not be brought into operation in two or three years . In the United States , Mr. Justice Washington distinctly lays down the doctrine that no neglect of the patentee , to put his invention into practical operation , will be construed to be an abandonment of his patent right . And such is the language of all the cases . Our law appears to go upon the presumption that the public benefit may in this case be left wholly to the influence of the interest of the patentee ; and confides to him the absolute control and disposal of his invention for the period of his monopoly .

Sec . III .  --  Distinct Inventions can not be joined IN THE SAME PaTENT . The doctrine is equally clear that different , distinct and independent inventions can not be joined in the same patent . Mr. Chief Justice Marshall says , in giving the opinion of the court , ' Under the general patent law alone , a doubt may well arise , whether improvements on different machines could regularly be comprehended in the same patent , so as to give a right to the exclusive use of the several machines Sec . III . Patent for Divers Inventions . ' 825 separately , as well as a right to the exclusive use of those machines in combination . ' So Mr. Justice Story says , Though several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent , it does not ibUow that several improvements in two different machines , having distinct and independent operations , can be so included . Much less that the same patent may be for a combinatiori of different machines , and for distinct improvements in each . ' ' ' And in another case the same judge says , that " a patent under the general patent act , can not embrace various distinct improvements or inventions ; but in such case the party must take out separate patents . If the patentee has invented certain improved machines , which are capable of a distinct operation , and also has invented a combination of those machines to produce a connected result , the same patent can not at once be for the combination and for each of the improved machines ; for the inventions are as distinct , as if the subject were entirely different . " * So Mr. Justice Wilde , of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts , was of opinion , where a joint patent for a reel and lap-frame was granted to two persons , that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 454 . Moody T. Fiske , 2Ma8on , 112. * Barrett v. Hall , 1 Maaon , 475 , 236 Patents for Divers Inventions . Ch . IX . separate inventions and machines , the joint patent was for that reason void ; but that the parties might procure its repeal and obtain separate patents for each machine . In regard to the case put by Mr. Justice Story , of joining the invention of an improvement of one machine in the same patent with an invention of a combination of the machine , so improved with others , I can not but think they may be joined , where the improvement in the separate machine , and the combina ' tion , have the same object ; for , suppose the combination to be of two machines , ope of which is improved ; the improvement is one addition , or modification , and the combining it with the other , is a second modification or addition . The case can not easily be distinguished from divers improvements of the same machine , and that such divers improvements may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground to doubt . A case decided in the English Court of King 's Bench , presents a combination of things in the same patent , of very considerable diversity , though all the different things were used in connexion , viz. an improvement in ships ' anchors , cables , and windlasses.

Patent for a Part of a Machine . 227 The objectioD was not made to this patent that it embraced distinct subjects of patents , so that on this point the case has only the feeble authority arising from the fact that the counsel did not raise the objection , and that the court did not , of its own motion , notice it . Sec . IV .  --  Patent for a part op a Machine . We next consider whether a patent may be taken out for a part of a machine . A patent for an improvement is usually for a part of an entire thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for something that can not be used separately to any practical purpose . It is not necessary , then , that the subject of the patent or exclusive right should be capable of an independent separate use . But suppose the case of two persons , independently of each other , inventing the parts of a new machine , are they entitled to separate patents ? Mr. Justice Story says , " if two persons invent several parts of a machine capable of a distinct use , then those parts might be considered as separate inventions , for which such inventor might perhaps be entitled to a separate patent . " ' - Stearns v. Barrett , 1 Mason , 153 2S8 Title of the Patent . Form , fyc . Ch . X.

Difference in Form  --  - tween English and American Patents . Construction of Patents . We come now to the inquiry , what steps and forms are necessary in order to secure the exclusive privilege granted by the patent acts . The principal subjects to be considered in this connexion , are the specification , the drawings , models , and specimens , the Ch . X. Titk of the Patent . Form , fyc. 2S9 oath of the inventor , the petition , the payment of the tax or fee , the reference to arbitration in case of interfering claims , the letter patent . It is proposed to notice here the different modes of granting patents in England and the United States , and as consequent upon this difference , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this diversity is first noticed and kept in view , there will be some confusion and obscurity between the English and American cases on the subject of the specification . The form of American patents was prescribed by the act of Congress of 1793 , s. 1 , which provided , among other things , that on a petition for the purpose , the secretary might cause letters patent to be granted , " reciting the allegations and suggestions of the said petition . " Mr. Justice Washington ruled that a compliance with this requisition was material . In an action for an infringement of Evans 's patent for the Hopperboy , it was objected that the patent did not recite the allegations and suggestions of the petition . Washiugton J. ' If the allegations and suggestions of the petition are substantially recited , it will be sufficient . But in this case they are not . " He said the patent gave no description of the hopperboy and its use , and the manner in which it worked . The petition gave a minute and full description of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fyc . Cb . X. ought to have been substantially recited/ The English law contains no similar express provision , bat the practice is to recite the allegations of the petition , and the provision of the American statute in thb respect , was , no doubt , borrowed from the EInglish practice . The act of congress of July 4th , 1826 , c. 357 , s. 5 , prescribes the form of the patent , omit* tmg the provision that it shall recite the allegations and suggestions of the petition , and providing instead that it shall contain ' a short description or title of the invention , correctly indicating its nature and design , referring to the specification for the particulars thereof , " so that the above decision is not applicable to patents granted under this act . In England the patent is granted before the speci* fication is made , a certain time being allowed by the patent for enrolling the specification varying from two to six months or longer , according to the circumstances , it being left to the discretion of the executive officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englind Mr. Justice Grose is reported to have said , that the specification was fairly to be considered a part of the patent itself , * the cases are entirely otherwise , and Eyans Chambers , 2 Wash .

' In the United States , the doctrine is different on this subject , the specification being always drawn up before the patent is granted , and being referred to in the patent . It is well settled in our courts that it is a part of the patent , in the prescribed form of which , under the act of 1836 and in the usual form under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressly referred to as " a part of these presents .

Both in English and American patents a title is necessarily given to the invention whereby it is patented . The American patent act of 1793 , s. 1 , provided , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state might cause letters patent to be granted , " giving a short description of said invention or discovery . " The act of 1836 , s. 5 , varies a little from that of 1793 , as above stated. * This short description or title is usually in the words of the patentee , either prefixed to his specification , or being the introductory part of it . In American patents any defect in this title might , under the act of 1793 , be remedied by the specification ; how far it may be so under that of 1836 remains to be decided . The accuracy in the title required by the English law , renders the choice of titles matter of the greatest difficulty , since , if the title is too narrow , the patentee either fails of securing the exclusive privilege entirely , or , at least , to the extent to which he is entitled to it , and if it is too broad , the patent is void by reason of its covering too much . Many English patents have been defeated on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing of great generality and indefiniteness in the description . * Supra p. 230 . Ch . X. Title of the Patent . Formy fyc. - 233 ** Such , " says Mr. Godson , " is the technical use that has for a long time been made of the word method in patents , that it is quite common for inventors to ask for a patent for a method of doing something , and then to set forth ' a description of some new substance or machine . It is a convenient way to avoid giving a title to the invention . And therefore it is now clearly established , that if the patentee claim a method , and yet in the speci6cation describe some tangible matter , the grant is valid . In other words , though the patent is for something called a method , yet the real subject of the grant is either a substance , machine , improvement , or combination . " ' Thus Watt 's patent for his improvement in the iMeam engine was for " a method of lessening the consumption of steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cover a large part of the improvements in steam engines and boilers invented from Walt 's day to the present , and yet it was held to be a sufficient description and a valid patent , after much doubt and discussion , and the case has been a leading one on the subject to the present time .

Now in every one of these cases , if , as in American patents , the specification could have been resorted to for a construction of the title , the objections , on which the patents were declared void , would have disappeared . It is a general rule in construing written instru* ments , that other documents referred to in them must be taken into consideration . Thus th drawings annexed to a specification in compliance with the statute , are considered to be a part of the specification , and so to be taken into consideration , in putting a construction upon it .

This is illustrated in the case of a patent for ' an apparatus for extracting inflammable gas by heat , from pit- ; oal , tar , or any other svbstance , bom which gas or gasses , capable of being employed for illumination , can be extracted by heat . " It was proved that the apparatus would not succeed in making gas from oil , and it was objected to the patent that there was nothing to prevent a person , who saw the specification , from considering that it was meant to be included , and so that the specification covered more ground than the invention , and was not true , and that accordingly the patent was void .

The specification is no less important than the invention itself , and the instances of patents being declared void by the courts on account of the defects of the specification , are probably quite as many as those of failure from the insufficiency of the invention . It requires no little skill and knowledge of the subject of the invention , to draw up an adequate and apt specification . And skill and knowledge of the subject will not suffice for this purpose , without also a knowledge of the law of patents generally . The frequent failure of patents in consequence of defects in the specification through inadvertency , has heretofore been a subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until the legislatures of both countries , that of the United States in 1832 , and again in 1836 , and that of Great Britain in 1835 , passed laws to remedy this evil .

In treating of the specification , the cases and the law will be stated just as if those provisions had not been made , the reader being apprized that for some of the defects , on account of which the patent right would otherwise be defeated , those provisions afford a partial remedy , that is , the patentee does not absolutely lose his privilege , provided he takes advantage of the provisions thus made in his favor .

The other object of the specification is to give the public the advantage of the invention after the expiration of the patent .

" " The provisions of the act of 1836 , s. 6 , are substantially the same on this subject as those of the ibrmer statute . As the specification is addressed to artists acquainted with the subject of the patent , it is no ground of objection that it contains technical terms . It would be quite impracticable to give a description of many inventions without the use of such terms , and the de- o 3 H. Bl . 497. 11 Gray dc* Osgood v. Jamei , ftod others , 1 Pet . C. C.

If the patent and specification state an invention which has not been made by the patentee , the patent is no doubt void . " If , " says Abbott C. J.

" The case on Tumers patent is an illustration of a defect from an erroneous statement of the process and result . In an action for an infringement of that patent , which was " for producing yellow color for painting in oil or water , and making white lead , and separating the mineral alkali from common salt , all by one process , " it was objected , that the white lead produced by following the directions in the specification , was not what was sold as such , but a white substance , the basis of which was lead , and which was applicable only to some of the uses of common white lead . Ashburst J. ** It is said that the patentee did not profess to make common white lead .

' * In the case on Bloxam 's patent for a machine for making paper , the patent was held to be void , because the patentee represented that his machine would do what in fact could not be effected by it . It was recited in the letters patent that the patentee had represented to the king that he was in possession of a machine for making pa ( er in single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and upwards wide , and from one to forty-five feet and upwards in length . It also appeared by the specification , that the machine then invented was so constructed as to be capaUe of producing paper of one definite width only , and that in order to vary the width a new machine was required . By the subsequent improvements , however , one and the same machine became capable of producing paper of various widths . C. J. Abbot . " If any material part of the representation was not true , the consideration has failed in part , and the grant is consequently void , and a defendant , in an action for infringing the patent , has a right to say that it is so . Now I think it impossible to say that both width and length are not important parts of this representation . Boulton T. Ball , 3 H. Bl . 498. 248 Sjfecificaiiou . Gb . XL It msLj be that if the representauon bad mentioped length only , a patent would have been granted for the iayention , which ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very important manufuture , as jHiving both time and labor in a very considerable degree . But although I may think this probabloi I am not at liberty to pioBounce judicially that it would have been so . I must therefore see whether the representation was true . It has been contended , in support of the patent , that the recital does not import that paper of different widths was to be made by one and tbe same machine , but may mean only that the width might be obtained by different machines , each adapted and constructed to the extent required . But I think this construction of the recital can not be allowed ; for it is a di &rent; thing whether a manufacturer must supply himself with several different machines or with one only , capable alone of accomplishing all tbe pui*poses to be obtained by many . And if the width is not to be considered as material , the length can not be so considered , and then tbe representation will only be , that he has invented machines , by the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengUis may be made without seam or joining . And this will be at variance with all tbe specifications , which plainly show that whatever was done , was to Sec. v. Must be true , and not mislead . 5249 be done by one and the same machine . Then if the representation be ( as I think it is ) that paper of various widths may be obtained by one and the same machine , I must look to the evidence to discover whether the patentee was possessed of a machine , or of the invention of a machine , capable of accomplishing this object . And unfortunately the evidence shows that he was not . I say unfortunately , because it is to be lamented , that the advantage of great ingenuity , labor , anxiety and expense , should be lost to those who have bestowed them . The patentee was at the time possessed of one machine , and one only , and this adapted to one degree of width , and one degree only . And he was not then possessed of any method by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine or by any other . " ** Where superfluous processes or machinery are described for the purpose of misleading the person consulting the ' specification , and preventing him from getting a knowledge of the process or machine patented , or of the best mode of using or making it , this will vitiate the patent . Thus a patent for a process for making Seidlitz powders was held to be void because the patentee , in his specification , gave three recipes for Bloxam v. Elsce , 6 Barn . &; Creis 169 . SSO Specification . Ch . XI . producing three different substances , of which he directed the mixture to produce the Seidlitz powder , without disclosnig that these three substauces were Rocheile salts , carbonate of soda , and tartaric acid . Abbott C. J. " It is the duty of any one , to whom  --  patent is granted , to point out , in bis specification , the plainest and most easy way of producing that for which he daims a monopoly ; and to make the public acquainted with the mode which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specification , would be led to suppose a laborious process necessary to the production of any one of the ingredients , when , in fact , be might go to a chemist 's shop and buy the same thing as a separate , simple part of the compound , the public are misled . If the results of the recipes , or any one of them , may be bought in the shops , this specification , tending to make people believe an elaborate process essential to the iuTcntion , can not be supported . " " Arkwright 's patent for cotton spinning madiinery is another instance of a patent being vend by the mtiodttction of things into the specification which were *7 Savory v.

These fquisites are , however , laid dowb by judges in some instances , with too great strictness and severity In some of the English cases , a jealousy of patent lights as an infringement of the rights of the cobh community by the common law , has formerly led the judges to a very strict construction against patenteeti Thus in the case on Turner 's patent , Mr. Justice Asbhurst says , ' as every patent is calculated to give a monopoly to the patentee , it is so far against the principles of law , and would be a reason against it , were it not for the advantages which the public derive from the communication of the invention after the expiration of the time for which the patent is granted .

XL opinion upon the specification , in the case of Ames 's patent for an improvement on a machine for papermaking . He says , * ' Let us see what is the invention as claimed by the inventor in this case . I agree that if he has left it wboly ambiguous and uncertain , so loosely defined , and so inaccurately expressed , that the court can not , upon a fair interpretation of the words , and without resorting to mere vague conjecture of intention , gather what it is , then the patent is void for this defect .

" * The case in which the above remarks were made , is an illustration of the doctrine laid down by the judge . In the specification , the patentee , after describing the machinery and apparatus for making paper ; to which bis patent related , proceeded , ' I do not claim the felting , vats , rollers , presses , wirecloth , or any separate parts of the above described machinery or ap- *- Ames V.

What I claim as new and as my invention , is , the construction and use of the peculiar kind of cylinder above described , and the several parts thereof in combination for the purpose aforesaid . " The cylinder had been described particularly , together with the construction and operation of the machinery and apparatus generally . The question was , whether , under this specification , the patentee had claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in combination with each other . Upon this construction , the court remarked that it would be mere tautology , for if the patentee claimed the cylinder , this was a claim of the several parts thereof in combination , and , vice versa , if he claimed the several parts in combination with each other , this was nothing more nor less than claiming the cylinder . This construction was to be avoided if any other could be put , not inconsistent with the specification generally , that would give significance to the words . The court was accordingly of opinion ' that the patent was for the construction and use of the peculiar kind of cylinder , and the several parts thereof in combination toith the other parts of the machinery , for the purpose of making paper . " To make this specification clear , it was necessary to insert , after comhination , the words , " with the other machinery y and 9S6 Specification . Ch . XI . to interpret ' ' the purpose aforesaid/ ' to mean , the purpose of making paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opinion of the court , taken altogether , afforded means of giving a construction consistent with the validity of the patent . Instead of adopting a rigid , cautious , and jealous interpretation , after the example of the English courts in many similar cases , and thereby defeating the patent , when it was admitted by the court that the plaintiff had a right to one , it was saved by adopting a broad , liberal , and fair construction . In the case of Metcalfe 's improvement in brushes , the decision was against the validity of the patent , on the ground of the alleged inaccuracy of the description of them in the patent , as tapering " brushes . It was a scire facias brought to repeal the patent . The specification directed that the hairs or bristles should be taken of a length that was described , and before their insertion into the holes in the stock of the brush , should be mixed up together , so that when they were collected and drawn through the holes , and secured by a brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas , according ta the usual mode , the bristles were inserted in the stock , so as to be as neai ly of the same length as possible , and were afterwards Sec .

The counsel for the patentee stated that by compressing the bristles in each tuft ; the efiect would be to make them converge to a point . Lord EUenborough : * If the word tapering be used in its general sense , the description is defective . Tapering means , gradually converging to a point . According to the specification , the bristles would be of unequal length , but there would be no converging to a point . " His lordship advised the jury to find that it was not a tapering , but only an unequal brush* A verdict was rendered for the crown . ' ' It has been remarked upon this case , * that the description proposed by Lord JBllenborough , that of tin* equal brush , is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of tapering brush , used by the pa* tentee One can not readily imagine a description more vague , indefinite , and ambiguous , than that given by Lord EUenborough in this case , and the fact that no better substitute suggested itself to bis mind as a general description in a title of the invention , ought to have been a sufficient ground for a very liberal inter* pretation of the title given by the patentee , which , it is true , gave no dbtinct idea of the invention , and , as " The King t . Metcalfe , 2 SUrk . N. P. C. 249. /z/ 258 Specification . Cb . XI . we have seen , the titles of patents frequently give do distinct idea of the invention . The patent in this case would , as has been suggested , have been good in the United States , " as the defect was in the title , and remedied in the specification . And Mr. Perpigna says it would have been good in France as a sufficiently accurate description . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considered to be defective in exactness . A patent was granted for a machine for giving a fine edge to knives , razors , scissors , and other cutting instruments . The specification described a machine for sharpening cutting instruments , by passing their edges backward and forward In an angle formed by the intersection of two circular files* . The specification also stated that other materials besides steel might be employed , according to the delicacy of the edge required . It was proved that if both rollers were files , it would not do for scissors ; and that for these one of the rollers should be smooth ; but that if Turkey stone were used for both the rollers , instead of steel , it would be possible to sharpen spissors with a jnachine so constructed .

The decision was againsiihe plain tifif . In an action for an infringement of a patent for an improvement of the hautboy by increasing the number of notes , ( in the plural ) it appeared by the specifica* t'lon that the patentee had invented only one new note . The patent was held to be invalid , although it was proved that great ingenuity had been exerted , and that the fingering was rendered less complicated by the invention .

XI . the accuracy and exactness requisite in the specification , than those on Watt 's patent for ' a new invented method for lessening the consumption of steam and fuel in steam-engines . " The specification stated that the method consisted of certain principles , and attempted to describe the application of these principles . The novelty consisted in keeping the cylinder , or steam-vessel , as hot as the steam which enters it , during the whole time the engine is at work ; first , by inclosing it in a case of wood or any other materials , that transmit heat slowly ; secondly , by surrounding it with steam or other heated bodies ; and thirdly , by sufiTering neither water , nor any other substance colder than the steam , to enter or come in contact with it during that time . The steam was condensed in vessels distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entirely new , as in the old steam-engines water was admitted into the cylinder to condense the steam . The specification did not state in what manner the new machine was to be constructed , in what respects it varied from the old one , or in what way the improvements were to be added ; but in the opinion of the judge** it was sufficient to enable a mechanic , * Mr. John Farej , in his statement before the Committee of the Hoase of Com . 1829 , says the specification in Wait*s caae waa not sufficient to enable a workman to construct the machine . Sec . VL Mast beftdl cleat and exact . 261 acquainted with the steam-engines previously in usey to construct one wiih this improvement . Lawrence J. " Two objections have been made to this patent : first , that it is not for any formed or organized machine or manufacture , but for mere prin-* ciples ; secondly , that the specification is bad . By looking at the patent and the recital in the ac of Parliament , it appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lessening the consumption of steam in steam-engines . It is clear , that the legislature understood that the patent was for an engine or some mechanical contrivance , and the form of the patent and the specification does not contradict this . JSngtiie and method mean the same thing , and may be the subject of a patent . Method , properly speaking , is only placing several things , and performing several operations in the most convenient order ; but it may signify a contrivance or device ; so may an engine , and therefore , I think it may answer An act of Parliament was passed to extend the patentee 's term , which , after reciting that the patent was ** for making and vending certain engines , hj him invented , for lessening the consumption of steam and fuel in fire-engines , " granted to him the sole right of** constructing and selling such engines for twentyfive years ; " it was , however , provided , that this grant should be subject to ** every objection in law competent against the said patent . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So principle may mean a mere elementary truth ; but it may also mean constituent parts . " Then , taking this to be a patent for an engine , it is objected that the specification is bad . The patent must be supported as granted for an improvement and addition to old engines , known and in use , and I think that the patent is good in this point of view . For Watt claims no right to the construction of engines for any determinate object , except that of lessening the consumption of steam and fuel in fire engines . His patent supposes the existence of such engines , and his contrivance , method or engine , is for lessening the consumption of fuel in such pre-existing engines , and for nothing else . Some of the difficulties in the case , have arisen firom considering the word engine in its popular sense , namely , some mechanical contrivance to effect that to which human strength , without such assistance , is unequal ; but it may also signify device ; and that Watt meant to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood it , is evident from the words engine and method being used as convertible terms . Now there is no doubt but that for such a con  - -  trivance a patent may be granted , as well as for a more complicated machine ; it equally falls within the description of a ' manufacture ; " and unless such de- Sec . VI . Must bejidlf dear , and exact . 263 vices did fall within that description , no addition or improvement could be the subject of a patent . " Wheeler 's patent for a preparation for coloring beer was adjudged bad , on account of . the inaccuracy of the description in the title , and the insufficiency of the specification . It was for ' a new and improved method of drying and preparing malt . " In the specification it was stated that the ' invention consisted m the heating of malt to 400 degrees and upwards , of Fahrenheit 's thermometer , according to a process or processes hereafter described . " Abbott C. J. This is a patent for the invention of a method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or organ , to be used for the accomplishment of some purpose ; or at least of a process to be so used . The patentee does not profess to be the inventor of any engine , instrument , or organ ; he says , that a coffee-roaster , or a kiln , or any thing by which the grains may be kept in motion during their exposure to the requisite degree of heat , may be used . Neither has he described any certain or precise process , which , admitting that there may be a patent for a process only , ought unquestionably to be done . He does not mention the state in which the malt is to be taken , for the purpose of undergding the process , whether in a moist or dry state , as was before noticed ; he does not say , what heat beyond 400 degrees of 264 Specification . Cli .

A specification which casts upon the public the expense and labor of experiment and trial , is undoubtedly bad . If it be said that all these matters will be well or easily known to a person of competent skill ( and to such only the patentee may be allowed to address himself ) , then the inventor will not in reality have given any useful or valuable information to the public ; so that in either way of viewing the case , there is either no certain and clear process described , or the process described is such as might be practised without the assistance of the patentee .

Whether it be so or not will evidently depend , in a great degree upon what may be supposed to be known to persons practised in the manufacture of malt , and in the art of brewing . The writer just alluded to , supposes that a person conversant with these manufactures would very readily learn to make and use the new invented malt by the directions given in the specificatbn . However this may have been in the particular case , the doctrines and principles of the decision are no doubt correct , and the precedent is equally good , whether the court applied these doctrines to the actual case before them , or to one supposed by them through mistake .

Mr. Justice Park says , any ambiguity may be avoided by the patentee 's disclaiming that which is not his own discovery .

In specifying an improvement in a machine it is often necessary to describe the whole machine as it operates with the improvement , in order to make the description intelligible , and enable an artist to construct the machine , as the inventor is bound to do in his description , and which , if he fails to do , he falls into the fault of obscurity . On the other hand , if the whole machine , as well the old as new part , be thus described , it is requisite to distinguish what part the patentee claims , since if this does not satisfactorily ap- Campion Beoyon , 8 Brod . &; Bing. 5 .

The only object of this distinction is , however , to specify what the patentee claims , and the mere discrimination of the new from the old would not necessarily show this , for , perhaps , he does not claim all that is new . When the cases say , therefore , that the specification must distinguish the new from the old , we must understand the meaning to be that it must show distinctly what the patentee claims , the only object of this distinction being for this purpose . This doctrine is illustrated by some of the cases already stated , and it runs through them all wherever this question arises . ' Hill T. Thompson , 3 Meriv. 629 ; Barrett v.

The Court of King 's BMh held - it sufficient , in one case , to describe the whole inaehine as improved , tod refer to the patent of the original machine on which the iisproveroent was made , the two specifications being so framed that a person , by consulting both , might distinguish what was new . A patentee of a nrachine for dressing woolen cloths , duly enrolled his specifica* and , several years afterwards , obtained another patent for certain improvements in the machine , in wMch the grant of the fprmer patent was recited . The specification of the latter patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved state , but did not point out or distinguish the improvements fix ) m the former machine by any verbal description , or by any delineation or mark in the drawing . The improvements , however , could be ascertained by referring to the first specification , apd comparing it with the second specification and the drawings . It was held that the second specification was sufficient . Lord EUenborough . " I own I was disposed to think that V. Smethurst , 1 Stark . R. 205 ; The King v. Elaee , Bull . N. P. i6 ; Rogers v.

The act of Congress of J 836 , and the act of Parliament of 1835 , as subseqaently slated , in Sec. 10 of this chapter , make provision whereby the patentee may ayoid the entire loss of his privilege in consequence of including too much in his speoification . Sec . VII . Newmtut be distinguished from Old . 269 it was a departure from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inquirer who came to consult the specification , how he might learn what the invention was , instead of giving him that information directly . But I feel impressed by the observation of my brother Le Blanc , that the trouble and labor of referring to and comparing the former specification with the latter , would be full as great if the patentee only described in this the precise improvements upon the farmer machine . Reference must indeed often be necessarily made in these cases to matters of general science , or the party must carry a reasonable knowledge of the subject matter with htm , in order clearly to comprehend specifications of this nature , though fairly intended to be But this is by no means a skilful or safe mode of making a specification of an improvement . Upon this subject Mr. Justice Story says , ** If the description in the patent mixes up the old and the new , and does not distinctly ascertain for which in particular the patent is claimed , it must be void ; since if it covers the whole , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , it is impossible for the court to say what , in particular , is covered , as the qwq The law is laid down in the same manner by Mr. Justice BuUer . A patent was granted for a new invented manufacture of lace , caed French laee . Tbe specification went generally to tbe invention of mixing silk and cotton thread upon the frame . It was clearly proved that , prior to the patent , silk and cotton thread bad been used together and intermixed upon the same fiame ; and tbe counsel for the patentee acknowledge ed the fact , but . said he could prove , that the former method of using the and cotton thread was quite inadequate to the purpose of making lace , on account of its coarseness , and that the patintee alone had in* qwq liberty of making lace composed of silk and cotton thread mixed ; noi of any particular mode of mixing it , and therefore , as it has been clearly proved and admitted , that silk and cotton thread were beibie oiixed on the same frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearly void , and the jury must find for the crown . " * In putting a construction upon a peci6cation as to the extent of the patentee 's claim , the whole is to be taken into consideration , and general expressions which accepted literally would cover too much ground , may be limited by other parts of the specification . A specification stated the invention to be an approved apparatus for extracting inflammable gas by heat , from pit-coal , tar or any other substance from which gas or gasses , capable of being employed for illumination , can be extracted by heat . " It was proved tbtf the apparatus would not succeed in making gas from oil ; and it was argued , that there was nothing to prevent a person who saw this specification from considering that oil gas was meant to be included in it . /q/ qwq and that oil was not meant to be included in iiy it being proved that , at the time in question , oil was considered much too expensive too be used for the making of gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known to afford an imflammable gas . " ' The patent for Brown 's improvement on a lacemachine , was ruled by Gibbs C. J. to be void , because the specification claimed the whole machine , though a considerable part of it had been long in use . So in an American case , where the general description in the letters patent stated that the grant was fos a new and useful improvement in manufacturing cotton and wool cards , " Mr. Justice Story held that the specification must be considered as controlling the generality of expression and limiting the grant to the machine specifically described therein . It IS sufficient to defeat the patent , though the part claimed , which is not new , or not invented by the patentee , be unimportant . Mr. Justice Story says .  --  Crosily V.

His patent covers it , and if it be not new , the patent must be void .

Abbott C. J ' It is quite clear , that a patent granted by the crown can not extend beyond the consideration of the patent .

S ! 74 Specijicatian . Ch . XL Thompson , ( 2 J. B. Moore , 424 , ) and this is , that here the patentee , instead of saying that he has made certain improvements , states the improvements , but still he claims the merit of having invented improvements in the manufacture t ) f three things . The consideration is entire , and if it turns out that there is no novelty in one of the improvements , the consideration fails in the whole , and the patentee is not entitled to the benefit of that other part of his invention . " * In the description of an improvement , the phrases " improved machine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same The patentee should not claim a new mode or device as detached from the machinery , but as combined with the machinery or construction by which the effect , whether new or old , is produced . " If , " says Mr. Justice Story , " an invention consist in a new combination of machinery , or in improvements upon an old machine to produce an old effect , the patent should be for the combined machinery , or improvements on the old machine , and not for a mere mode or device for producing such effects , detached from the machinery . Sec. yiL Newmtui be distinguished from Old . 275 This doctrine may not be of as extensive consequence under . our patent act , where the specification forms a part of the patent , and may control its generality , as in England , where the specification is separated from it ; but it distinctly shows the necessity of an exact description , so that the patent may conform to the invention . " ** This subject came up very early in the cases on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice BuUer said , that since the case of Morris v. Branson , in 1776 , ' it has been the generally received opinion in Westminster Hall , that a patent for an addition i$ good . But then it must be for the addition only , and not for the old machine too . In Jessop 's case , the patent was held to be void , because it extended to the whole watch , and the invention was of a particular movement only . It was admitted , in the reply , that the patent should be applied to the invention itself ; but it was contended that if , in consequence , the patent gave a right to the whole engine , that would be no objection . To this I answer , that if the patent be confined to the invention it can give no right to the engine , or to any thing beyond the invention itself . Where a patent is taken for au improvement only , the  --  Barrett t .

So in the case of the watch , may not other persons in the trade buy the new movement , and work it up in watches made by themselves ? Where men have neither fire engines nor watches , it is highly probable that they will go to the inventor of the last and best fanjproveroents for the whole machine ; and if they do , it is an advantage which the inventor gets from the option of mankind , and not from any exclusive right or monopoly vested in him . " ** A case came before Lord Ellenborough at nisi prius , on a patent for an improvement in making parasols and umbrellas , in which it was objected that the specification did not clearly direct how to make the article , and did not distinguish what was new . The specification professed to set out the improvements as specified BoaRon v. Bull , 2 H. fil . 489 . Sec . YHJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drawings annexed . Tbe subjoined description contained a minute detail of the construction of umbrellas and parasols , partly including tbe usual mode of stretcbing the silk of the umbrella , and also certain improvements , which consisted cbid9y in the insertion of the stretchers , which were knobbed at the sockets formed in the whalebone , instead of attaching them to the whalebone in the usual way . Drawings were given of the umbrellas and parasols in their improved state ; but throughout the whole specification no distinction was made between what was new and what was old . The counsel for the pkin contended that the specificaticm was sufficient , since one of the annexed drawings contained a representa* tion of the particular invention which had been pirated , and was confined to the exhibition of the insertion of the knobbed stretchers in the whalebone sockets , from which an artist would be able to construct an umbnella OD tbe improved plan . Lord Ellenborough. * The patentee , in his specification , ought to inform tbe per son who consults it , what is new and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this , describkig it by words , if he can , or , if not , by reference to fig* ures . But here the improvement is neither described in words nor by figures , and it would not be in the wit of man , unless he were previously acquainted with the /z/ 378 Sedjicatian . Ch . XI . construction of the instrament to say what was new and what was old . The speciBcation states , that the improved instrument is made in manner following : this is not true , since the descripdon comprises that which is old , as well as that which is new . Then it is said , that the patentee may put in aid the figures , bat hoW can it be collected from the whole of these in what the improvement consists ? The plaintiff was . nonsuited .

' I doubt whether this patent can be sustained , for the specification can not stand as a description of a new combination of known principles ; it claims an invention as o a part of it which certainly is not new . I allude particularly to the form of the link . The specification states , that the object to be gained is the greatest possible strength fixm a given quantity of materials , keeping in mind the direction in which the strain is to be borne .

It appears to me , that the patentee here first claims the merit of originally using the links in the particular form described in his specification , instead of circular links . Now there can be no doubt that links of that form bad been used long before . " ** Sec . VIIL  --  The Specification must direct how /z/ THE Inventor of making , the articie . The act of Congress of 1636 , s. 7 , following very closely that of 1793 , s  --  3 , requires the inventor to describe his invention , in his specification , so as " to enable any person , skilled in the art or science to ** Brunton Hawkes , 4 Barn . &; Aid . 540 . The French law does not reqnim the new to be distinipoished from the old , bat M. Perpigna , in hit Treatise on Patents , says , it would be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect /z/ This is only an express enactment of what has been the established oonstruction of the English statute of OMMopolies . And , following out the spirit and principle of this rule , the cases decide that the specificalion must not only direct how the thing patented is to be made , used , or compounded , but must also direct the most economical and advantageous materiab , construction and method for ttus purpose , known to the inventor , and must not mislead the person who consults it . The patent law is founded on the principle of giving the public the full benefit of the invention , which it could not do unless the best mode of using the invention were described . " The end and meaning of the specification/ ' says Mr. Justice Buller , * is to teach the public , after the time for which the patent is granted , what the art is , and it must put the public in possession of the secret in as ample and beneficial a way as the patentee himself uses it . If the specification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or defective , the patent is against law and can not be supported . If the specification be such that mechanical men of common understanding can comprehend it , to make a raachioe by it , it is sufficient ; but then it must be such that Sec . VIIL Must give best way of making . 881 persons skilled in the art or science to which the invention relates may be able to make the machine by following the directions of the specification without making any experiments , and without any new invention or addition of their own* " * " Mr. Justice Story thus states the law on this sub- ' ject . The law confers an exclusive patent right on the inventor of any thing new , and useful , as an encouragement and reward for his ingenuity , and for the expense and labor attending the invention . But this monopoly is granted for a limited term only , at the expiration of which the invention becomes the property of the public . Unless , therefore , such a specification was made as would , at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to construct similar machines , the advantage to the public , which the act contemplates , would be entirely lost , and its principal object would be defeated . It is not necessary , however , that the specification should conta'in an explanation , level with the capacities of every person , ( which would , perhaps , be impossible , ) but , in the language of the act ( of 1793 ) , it should 1t ) e expressed in such full , clear The King v.

' ' * And so Lord EUenborough says , A specification should be sufficient to enaUe persons of reasonably competent skitt in such matters to construct the machine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an examination of the drawings referred to in it. ** Where it was objected that the dimensions of a stay of a link ( a chain cable were not given in the written specification Abbott C. J. said to the jury , If a drawing or figure will enable a workman of competent skill to construct the improvement , it is as good as any written improvement . " " Mr. Justice BuUer remarked , in an early case , that * wherever it appears that the patentee has made a fiiir disclosure , I have always had a strong bias in his favor , because , m that ease , he is entitled to the protection which the law gives him ; but where the discovery is not fully made , the court ought to look with a very watchful eye to prevent any imposition on the public ; " and Mr. Justice Gibbs says that * a patentee who has invented a machine useful to the public , and can construct it one way more extensive in its benefit than in another , and states in his specificatioQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself the more beneficial mode of practising it , although he will have so far answered the patent as to describe in his specification a machine to which the patent extends , yet he will not have satisfied the law by communicating to the public , the most beneficial mode he was then possessed of , for exercising the privilege granted to him . " " * A mistake or an incorrectness in what is not material , will not render the patent void. * It is enough that the specification is substantially full and accurate . This is distinctly implied by Abbott , C. J. in a case already cited. * ' It is no objection that a mistake is qwq made by which nobody can suffer , that is , by which no person could be led into an infringement of the patent , without any such instruction on his part , while It is in force , and which will not prevent an artist from constructing the machine , by following the specification , after the patent has expired . The rules above stated have been applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkwright 's machine to prepare cotton , silk , flax and wool for spinning , he described all the parts of it as one entire instrument .

" At the trial , it was objected to the specification that , after directing that the lead should be calcined , it stated that minium might be used , which would not answer the purpose . Neither was it said that the minium should be calcined or fused ; but if minium had any reference to the preceding words , then it was to be calcined , which would not produce the effect , fusion being necessary . BuUer , J. said , that it was not pretended by any of the plaintiff 's witnesses that he ever made use of minium . And it was proved by the defendant 's witnesses , that from the specification , they should be led to use minium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the specification directs in the first instance . But minium will not answer the purpose . Then as to fusion , it Is said , that the public are directed , by the words of the specification , to continue the heat till the effect is produced ; which must necessarily lead to fusion , though fusion is not expressly mentioned . But that is no answer to the objection ; for the 8pecifica  --  - tion should have shown by what degree of heat the effect was to be produced . Now it does not mention fusion , and , as one of the witnesses said , in order to produce the effect , you must go out of the patent ; for fusion is beyond calcination , and in some sense contrary to it and by mentioning calcination , it should Sec .

" Asburst J. ** The first objection to the speci6cation is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and calcine it , or minium , or red lead ; ' from whence it is inferred that calcining is only to be applied to had ; I confess , if the objection had rested here , I should have entertained some doubt . " " The same specification proceeded as follows : To any given quantity of the above-mentioned materials , add half the weight of sea salt , with a sufficient quan* tity of water to dissolve it , or rock salt , or sal gem , or fossil salt , or any marine salt , or salt water proper for the purpose . . It was objected that fossil salt was improperly mentioned . For fossil salt is a generic term , including all mineral salts , only one of which ,  --  a/em , would answer the purpose ; because that alone has marine acid . Asburst J* " I understand that sal gem 18 the only one which can be applied to this purpose ; so that throwing in fossil salt can only be calculated to raise doubts and mislead the public .
