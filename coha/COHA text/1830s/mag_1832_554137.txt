txt The more we contemplate the subject of reform in Europe , the more important does it seem to us . In our number for July , we submitted to our readers our impressions upon some general topics , connected with the present aspect of things , on the other side of the Atlantic . The state of the reform question in England , as the most interesting and important of these topics , received a proportionate share of our attention . We approached it with a diffidence , inspired by the magnitude of the subject ,  --  our distance from the stage on which the great drama is acting ,  --  and our consequent ignorance of many of the local details and secret springs of the movement . But its momentous character grows upon us , as we contemplate it . It tasks the apprehension , it excites the imagination . We can not sit still , and behold unmoved this mighty operation in human affairs . The experimentum in co*pore vili , the fate of East Retford , and Grampound , and Cricklade , and Aylesbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the experimentum crucis . It is an operation of life or death on a mighty empire . The question of reform in England is an American question ; and this is among the strongest of the motives , which lead us to discuss it . Our greatest commercial connexions are with England ; half of our foreign commerce is carried on with her ; and much of the remainder is affected by the state of her markets . As the great emporium of the world , whatever powerfully affects her is felt by us . An English pamphlet now before us uses a language on this subject , which justifies us in this view of it. * Our commercial readers will recollect // the great temporary stagnation produced in our trade with France , by the brief commotions of the three days . ' It was at one period impossible to dispose of the best bills on Paris ; no one was willing to execute an order from France ; and the price of our staples was immediately affected . The influence of that revolution on this country may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France , which in the year ending in September , 1830 , was two hundred thousand seven hundred and ninety-one bales , sunk , in the year ending September , 1831 , to one hundred and twenty-seven thousand seventy-nine ; a decline of one-third . But we ought , perhaps , to be ashamed to resort to such an illustration of our assertion , that this is an American question . Any such effect on commerce , will , except in the event of a convulsive and bloody revolution , be temporary . But our political relations with Great Britain are so numerous and intimate , that whatever changes the nature and permanently modifies the action of the British Government , is very important to us . From the time that our continent was first settled till 1815 , our politics were to a great degree affected and decided by the state of things in England ; and this almost as much after the Revolution as before . The new position of the world since the downfal of Napoleon , has happily rendered our politics much more independent of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , which should essentially disturb the action of England on the politics of the world , ( and this , as we shall endeavor to show , will be the inevitable consequence of the reform of Parliament , ) would be almost as promptly felt in this country as in England herself . Then , too , it is to be rememhered , that we are completely surrounded by British colonies . We have the West Indies on our front , and the continental colonies on our flank and almost in our rear . An idle controversy , relative to the form in which our trade with these colonies shall be carried on , has , for the country . All great private undertakings are suspended . The opulent of every class , ( but those more especially who derive their incomes from the funds , from the clerical or legal professions , or from any department of the public service , ) oppressed with a growing sense of the insecurity of their resources , are limiting their expenditure very generally to articles of urgent necessity ; and that instinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great national convulsions , is already beginning to operate on prices , as well in this country as over the continent . ' // last five years , had a very considerable influence on the domestic politics of the United States . It requires no sagacity to perceive , that any thing which should seriously affect the existing organization of the British Government at home , would , in its effect on these our colonial neighbors , give rise to the most important and agitating questions in this country . Besides all this , the general position which England stands in , as a great first-rate power , is to be confirmed or changed in the issue of the present controversy . She now claims the right to interfere in every great question of international politics , whoever may be the more immediate parties . As late as May , 1830 , we find Mr. Huskisson , who adopted , with the political system of Mr. Canning , little of his ambition and less of his temperament , declaring that England , as the first maritime power in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominion a greater portion of the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , than they now possess . ' This was said apropos of some speculations in the American newspapers , on the desirableness of the purchase of Texas by the United States ; a province , which , in the opinion of many of our soundest statesmen , was legitimately included within the limits of Louisiana , and which stretches for a vast extent along our south-western frontier . We think it very probable , that , on the evening when Mr. Huskisson permitted himself this menace , the British ministry had received the advice of some new kingdom added to their Eastern empire . We shall have occasion , in the course of our remarks , to express the opinion , that , with the adoption of the proposed new principle of organization in the British Government , this extensive interference in foreign politics will both from necessity and of choice cease . The event of the measure pending in Parliament is , of course , in the highest degree uncertain , and to us beyond the reach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , a House of Commons which appeared too nearly balanced on the question , has been dissolved , and a new one , with a great supposed accession of strength in favor of reform , has been elected . The issue of this appeal to the electors showed the popular favor with which the bill was regarded ; and it was supposed that , on the organization of the new Parliament , it would be urged with rapidity through a consenting House . But the details of the bill have been attended with perplexity and embarrassment . It has been voL. xxxlv. - No. 74. 4 // forced to run the gauntlet through the ranks of officious friends and relentless foes . Amendments both bonafide and vexatious have obstructed its way . It has been felt , at every step , that while the bill professed a remedy on principle of enormous evils , the remedy itself was laboring under a portion of the very evil to be remedied ,  --  and that without the apology of prescription . It will probably be found in the practical operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a law , that of itself , and unattended with other great measures of reform in the constitution and administration of the country , not one of the evils of which the people most complain will be remedied , while the bill itself stops far short of its own principles . In this state of things , a warfare truly terrific has been waged against it by some of the most powerful periodical presses . It is attacked as a whole and in detail . The objections against the entire system are pressed forward to outweigh specific improvements ; and the inconveniences of the detail are arrayed and exaggerated in prejudice of the system . It is but a few years , since it was deemed impossible even for a tory ministry , to fight through the House of Peers , the transfer to large towns of the franchise of single boroughs , convicted of the most profligate venality . What is to be expected n6w , xvben boroughs are to be disfranchised by the wholesale , without any specific charge , and the representation of towns and counties created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whig ministry , who , though carrying with them the majority of the community and of the writers for the daily press , must , from the constitution of English society , be opposed by a great proportion of the men of high education and literary influence in the country ? Nor is the vehemence , with which the Reform Bill is assailed , matched , as it seems to us , with corresponding ardor and concert of defence . As far as we can judge beyond the Atlantic , the fervor of reform is somewhat abated on the part of its friends , and pride of opinion may possibly come in for a portion of the enthusiasm which still remains . No man can tell what he will think of a subject , till it has been not only solemnly but passionately argued . He can weigh it solemnly in his own mind and his own closet , but the heat of angry debate opens and expands the argument , and shows its joints , and seams , and cracks . The reformers in England appear to us somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are less sanguine of its successful operation , and more awakened // to its difficulties . They fell in love with it at a distance , as an ideal perfection . When it is practically handled , it is found a thorny and perplexing matter of fact . They find that they are making themselves responsible for the happy issue of a thousand doubtful experiments , and buying with certain odium a very uncertain reversion of praise . Should we venture an opinion , as to the precise state of mind with which the ministers regard the bill , we should say they would not lament to have it defeated by a small majority . They would then go out in a good cause , claiming the merit of all the benefits which would have flowed from the adoption of their measure , and ascribing all the evils and troubles that exist or may arise to its rejection . They are not men , judging of course on general principles of human nature , seriously to wish to take on their shoulders the re*ponsibility of a great revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove . A revolution may be headed by men of two classes . One class consists of those who are fired by intense ambition ,  --  who look upon the country , its laws and institutions , and the welfare of its citizens , as the steps by which they are to mount to guilty and bloody greatness . The C*sars and Cromwells , who feel the passions which civil war enkindles , and are willing to use the means which it furnishes , are the men to lead on a revolution of this kind . It is they at least , whoever may commence it , that are too apt to break in and carry it on. - An outraged , oppressed , and exhausted people , trained in the school of liberty , but denied its rights , after years and generations of suffering , will follow the patriotic men , who , through self-denial and personal sacrifice , lead them to a revolution of the second class . The present ministry of England fall into neither of these classes ; nor do they regard the situation of affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character is to be brought on . They are able and accomplished men of wealth and education , happily situated in life , enjoying ,  --  whether in office or out ,  --  some of the most enviable positions in society , with every thing to risk and nothing personal , to gain , by a great change ; and though they take up the question as one of enormous evils requiring a strong remedy , they do not admit the evils to require , nor do they propose to apply , the remedy of revolution . Should it be found or made to assume that character , they are not of the class of men elected to conduct it . It is not from elegant saloons , well furnished libraries , luxurious cabinets , nor princely // villas , that the spirit of radical reform ever did or ever will march forth , with decision in his port , and fearful change , perhaps convulsions , war , and death in his eye . That spirit issues , as the case may be , from the conqueror 's tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able , needy , and reckless adventurers , or the humble ahodes of a longsuffering and exasperated people . Prosperous gentlemen must content themselves with amateur reform . Grand changes in the constitution of ancient monarchies ,  --  great and radical re-* form ,  --  may be contemplated and worshipped at a distance as a mild and genial star . But as it draws near , it swells and reddens , and throws out its streaming terrors across the firmament ; and when it comes hiazing down from its aphelion , heaving the tides to the mountain tops , changing the zones , unfixing the poles , and melting the heavens with fervent heat , it is a season , when none but the Titans and demigods of the moral and intellectual world may go forth to lay the foundations of the new creation amidst the wrecks of the old . Our last accounts from England have carried the Reform Bill not quite through the Committee . When it has passed the House of Commons , it is to stand the trial of the Lords , where but last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer of the elective franchise from the rotten horoughs to the large towns. * And here we can not withhold our testimony to the sagacity , with which Mr. Huskisson foresaw the course , which this great question has taken . This distinguished statesman , to whose character we hope to find another opportunity of doing justice , ( justice which shall not he stinted by the unfriendly judgments , which he took some occasions to propagate on the subject of the American policy , nor by the false fame , which his admirers and partisans have claimed for him , as the head of a new school in British legislation , ) partook all Mr. Canning 's opinions and prejudices against theoretical reform . He , however , * My right honorable friend , the Secretary of State for the Home Department , gave this House to understand , upon a former evening , that on some future occasion , he may acquiesce in granting the franchise to these towns . Now , sir , I contend that if we are to give representatives to these manufacturing districts at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am afraid , sir , that whatever this House may do , it will be disappointed in its efforts , by an opposition in another place . ' - Mr. Husicisson 's Speeches , Vol . III . p. 494. // strenuously urged the gradual transfer of the franchise of corrupt boroughs to populous towns , and sacrificed his place in the Duke of Wellington 's cabinet to his adyocacy of such a policy , in the case of East Retford . It was proposed to transfer the representation of that corrupt borough to the great unrepresented city of Birmingham . The Ministry had such a horror of the slightest approach to the principle of theoretical reform , that they insisted on giving the forfeited franchise to the neighboring hundred of Bassetlaw ; and the Duke of Wellington allowed Mr. Huskisson , on this slender schism , to go out of his cabinet . In his speeches on that subject , Mr. Huskisson distinctly told the Ministers , that the refusal to adopt the moderate and practical course of transferring to the large towns the vacated privilege of the corrupt boroughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of measures for a general and sweeping reform . The event has fulfilled the prediction , sooner perhaps than its lamented author had foreseen . It is probable that before these pages see the light , the question will have been decided . In this country , and under the lights here possessed , it is the better opinion , that the bill will , in some form , become a law ; but this opinion is entertained with less confidence than formerly . But suppose it passed . A great change has then taken place in the British Constitution . We will not insist on the word revolution , if it is thought necessary to limit that term to unconstitutional changes of Government accompanied by violence and blood . But a great change has taken place . This change is the abandonment of prescription , as the principle on which the British House of Commons is constituted . It is not denied , that small encroachments have from time to time before been made on this principle . It is only by such encroachments and concessions , that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is now avowed , that the House of Commons shall no longer be constituted upon this principle . The Reform Bill comes to this , for it assumes a minimum of certain required theoretical qualifications , and prescribes that all seats , not possessed of these qualifications , shall be vacated . The old seats which remain untouched ( besides the innovations applied to them in the matter of suffrage ) remain so , not in virtue of the prescription , but in virtue of possessing the new theoretical qualifications . // It will , iherefore , be borne in mind , ( what we have not seen distinctly stated , ) that the proposed reform extends to every individual seat in the House of Commons ; for in addition to the boroughs wholly or partially disfranchised and the seats now for the first tune given to counties or cities , every other seat is shifted from the basis of prescription to that of qualification. * What is the new principle of the House of Commons , and ( for it comes to the same thing ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King of England ; his present Majesty , William LY . The words of kings are weighty , at least when they speak of the Constitution of their own kingdoms . The late House of Commons was very equally divided on the Reform Bill . The Ministry ventured an appeal to the people ; and the King , in his speech from the throne , declared that the dissolution was ordered , for the purpose of ascertaining the sense of the people . ' The going of the King to the House of Lords , to proclaim this dissolution , is described , by the journals friendly to reform in England , in the most glowing and triumphant terms . We seem almost to he reading of the descent of the god of navies , from the summit of Thracian Samos to the depths of IEg* T9E** 3 ' o*a 1taxpa KcLC IIo*rcriv is &amp;Oavdrow* lloau3dwvo* 16vro* . ' The House of Lords shakes with the concussion of ' booming ' artillery , and its portals fly asunder before the approach of the patriot King . Seated upon his throne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his faithful Commons in attendance at the har , he tells them he dissolves the Parliament , for the purpose of ascertaining the sense of the people , in the only way in which it can most conveniently and authentically he expressed , for the purpose of making such changes in the representation as circumstances may require . It is true , the only question avowedly put to the people hy the dissolution was , whether they , or rather such of them as exercised the right of suffrage , were in favor of the bill . But that bill is a great change in the representation . It applies a new principle to every seat of the Commons ' House of * We except , of course , the seats already and within recent times created for qualification ; as one of the seats of the County of York , which was taken from Grampoand for corruption . // 31 Parliament , and the King says , the adoption of this change is referred by him TO THE SENSE OF THE PEOPLE . For as good a reason as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this change ought to be , and eventually and indirectly will be , referred to the sense of the people . For the same reason , if any other mode of collecting the sense of the people on these great questions , more authentic and convenient than that of an election of members of Parliament , should be proposed , it must be adopted . That is , if a regular* constituent assembly should be convened , on the principle of an equal geographical representation , or any other equal principle , the sense of the people , thus authentically expressed in favor of some farther modification of the Constitution , must be accepted and obeyed . For the same reason , if this popular sense should settle down in favor of a Government popular in all its branches ,  --  whoever else may stand uncommitted ,  --  the present King of England and his responsible Ministers stand pledged to adopt it . But the King and his Ministers have , as the event proved , not gone farther than the majority of the people of England . The election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of ascertaining the sense of the people , and would have shown it much more decisively , had the elections been more popular . The sentiment expressed by the King is undoubtedly that of a majority of the people of England , and this it is , which gives it its significance and weight . There can not be a doubt , that , as the sense of the people has been for a century and a half more and more the directing principle in the administration of public affairs in England , it is henceforth to be so , much more eminently and authoritatively . It has henceforward been applied to the administration ; now and hereafter it is applicable to the Constitution . Mr. Pitt , after valiantly sustaining himself for three months against a majority of the House of Commons , took the sense of the people , ( meaning always the electors , a body then smaller imd less popular than now , ) whether he should continue in office . The question now taken has been , whether the House of Commons , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it has been decided in the negative . The people have decided that a new House on new principles shall be created . The importance of the subject , to which this principle is now // applied , no less than the Constitution of the House of Commons ,  --  the great effective power in the British Government ,  --  and the entire parity of reasoning , by which the same principle must and will be extended to every other question , require of us to regard it as the 1 ) rinciple , on which the British Government is henceforward to be organized and administered . It is , therefore , very important and curious to inquire what will be the consequences of taking the sense of the people , as the rule of the Government ? In discussing this subject , we shall endeavor to establish and enforce the opinions , briefly indicated in our article of last July . The following seem to us as some of the most natural and inevitable consequences First . A provision , in the words of his Majesty , of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people . As to convenience , there is none to be compared with that of popular representation , the discovery of which is the merit of our forefathers , who settled the American Colonies . For though the then existing organization of the British Parliament wore , as it does now , a semblance of a representative body , it was but a semblance ; whereas the state of things in this country made it necessary to create a real representation . In our article of last July , we stated that Mr. Canning denied that the House of Commons was intended to represent the will of the people . The correctness of this statement has been called in question . But if our readers will turn to his speech , made at Liverpool , on occasion of his re-election , 18th of March , 1820 , they will find him using this language The radical reformer will tell me fairly , that he means not simply to bring the House of Commons back either to the share of power , which it formerly enjoyed , or to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to make it what according to him it ought to be ,  --  a direct , effectual representative of the people ; representing them , not as a delegate commissioned to take care of their interests , but as a deputy appointed to speak their will . Now to this view of the matter , I have no other objection than this : - that the British Constitution is a limited monarchy ; that a limited monarchy is , in the nature of things , a mixed Government ; but that such a House of Commons , as the radical reformer requires , would in effect be a pure democracy ; a power , as it seems to me , inconsistent with any monarchy and unsusceptible of any limitation . ' // There are many other passages in Mr. Canning 's speeches to the same effect . We consider it then admitted , that the House of Commons , as now constituted , does not express the sense of the people . That it does not , is declared by the authors of the present bill , to be a grievance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Parliament places the House of Commons on a new basis ; a basis far more favorable to an authentic expression of the people 's sense . But the reform neither can , nor should stop here . Although the constituency ( we quote a word of recent British coinage , which we commend to Sir Robert Peel , as an offset for talented ) is greatly increased , every reason that has been or can be given for increasing it , demands a farther and systematic extension . What is now proposed to be done is too loose , too conjectural , too destitute of uniformity and equality . A vote in Parliament is too momentous to be given or taken away on averaging calculations . If the bill become a law , it will appear that towns which differ considerably in wealth and population elect the same number of members ; that adjacent counties differing in like manner do the same thing , and that a still greater disproportion exists between counties and boroughs as compared with each other . It will also appear , that large numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as competent and as well entitled to exercise it as their neighbors . In the last debate , of which we have seen a report , Lord Granville Somerset moved an amendment to the bill , providing for a new district of boroughs in the county of Monmouth . Taking the population of the three northern counties together , Northumberland , Cumberland , and Durham , he found that there was one member to every nineteen thousand persons ; but , taking the population of the three counties of Monmouth , Glamorganshire , and Brecknockshire , the proportion was but one to every twentyfour thousand . Lord John Russell said , in reply ; That in arranging this system of representation , his Majesty 's Ministers did not affect to have settled the just proportion between the population and the number of members , in every case ; though the population altogether was more fairly and equally represented than before . If an addition was made to the representation , he could assure the noble Lord , that greater irregularities might be pointed out than that of Monmouth . Monmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four thousand persons , whilst Derby had only one member to thirtyfive thousand souls , and Lancashire only one member to every forty-seven or forty-eight thousand persons ! ' When great questions come to be decided by a few votes in the House of Commons , will Lancashire , with one member for forty-eight thousand inhabitants , be content to be voted down , by members representing other counties on a ratio of one for nineteen thousand ? London is to have eight members , which , we suppose , is one for every hundred thousand persons . Liverpool sends but two , which is one for every seventy thousand . Again , it will appear that great differences exist between England , Ireland , and Scotland , in all these res1ects . Ireland contains one third of the population , and will send but a sixth of the members . Will this satisfy Ireland ? These diversities are all at war with the true principle of the bill . They require for their justification , the old and now discarded principle of l ) rescliption , and can not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to work ; and when momentous questions come to be carried by very small majorities , and it then appears that a different result would have been produced , had the representation been equal and apportioned on any systematic l ) lan among the population of the United Kingdom , it will be impossible to resist the demand for such a plan . It will be absolutely necessary to organize the House on a system , which will represent the sense of the people authentically . There is no way to do this , but that of dividing the country into districts , according to population . There rs no other systematic plan that will bear examination . The idea of combining with a ratio of population a ratio of wealth , has something plausible in it . It was one of the provisions of the first new Constitution , adopted in France after the revolution of 1 789 . But it is wholly nugatory . Under the idea of representing property , as well as population , you apportion representatives among the districts according to the amount of taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looks well ; at least it conforms to the principle . But when you enter the districts , and come to the exercise of the right of suffrage , you find that you have given to the poor inhabitant of the rich district a larger share of constituent power , than to the rich inhabitant of the poor district ;  --  a result neither reasonable in itself , nor such as the plan was intended // to produce . Mr. Burke exposed the vices of this plan , in his comments on the French Constitution referred to above . But in addition to this , it is as impossible as it is needless , from the nature of things , in a representative Government , to represent property as such . Has there been a question resj ) ecting property before Parliament since 1688 , on which the men of property of all classes ,  --  nobles , gentlemen , and cornmoners ,  --  have not been divided ? One great interest rules in one county ; an opposite interest rules in the next . One J ) eer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and another with the same rental is on the other side . There is no interest in the community , which can be identified as that of the property , apart from a wise and equal administration of law . If you were to put all the rich men into a class , on the plan of Servius Tullius , you would find them divided by the same parties , which in all free Governments divide the people . Besides all this , the indirect influence of wealth is amply sufficient for its own protection , and quite as great as it ought to be . It must be recollected , that as far as the enactment of equal laws and the just administration of them are concerned , the man of frugal property is the ally of his opulent neighbor . The industrious mechanic is quite as much concerned as the rich capitalist , to have property safe , and to see that the laws protect its acquisition and enjoyment . Beyond the promotion of this end , wealth in great masses ought to have no influence ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such , no exclusive interest . We come hack then to our proposition , that with a view , as the King expresses it , to ascertain the sense of the people authentically , it will very soon he found necessary to establish a regular plan of geographical districts . A little study of our Congressional system will show our friends across the water , with what surprising simplicity and ease this may he done ; and they will look at the Gothic complication of burgesscs and knights , and the arithmetical entanglements of schedule A and schedule B , with astonishment bordering on incredulity . . Secondly . Next to a convenient and authentic way of expressing the sense of the people , it will he found necessary to remove all great , organized , and insuperable obstacles to its effective expression ; and this will require a new modification of the House of Lords . The peers , originally and theoreti // cally , were a separate estate in the realm ; that is , we sup* pose , a class of men performing separate functions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally on the tenure of military service . It would be idle to parade the cheap historical lore that belongs to the subject . Our readers know all about it . No one is ignorant , that the four or five hundred individuals , who now compose the House of Peers , have long ceased to be an estate of the realm , in its ancient authentic sense . They sit , we are taught , in a House of Parliament , because they are an estate . But take away their House , and what estate are they then ? They have no functions , no interests peculiar to themselves . They raise and pay no troops , lead no armies ; and are neither wiser , richer , nor better bred than their neighbors . It is the principle of the Reform Bill , that the enjoyment of the parliamentary franchise from the oldest periods of the Consti. * tution , creates no claim to its continuance , unless the requisite qua*/ication is united with it . Now the qualification of the House of Peers , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many generations been wearing out , and is now wholly gone . They remain in theory a separate estate , and so is old Sarum in theory a borough , entitled to send two members to Parliament . But , in fact , the peers are distinguished in nothing but their titles from the rest of the community . We take it for granted , that nobody denies this ; and that no one has a better defence to make for the House of Lords , than that made by Mr. Canning , viz , that the Government is a mixed and limited monarchy , and that a House of Peers is a necessary part of such a monarchy . This , of course , is not reasoning . It merely asserts a hjstorical fact , as to the official character of the House of Lords . But is this defence of the peerage agreeable to the new principle of the British Government ? Is it conformable to the sense of the people , that after their representatives have adopted an important measure , three or four hundred gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no qualifications , from the mass of the population , ) shall say , we do not like this measure , and it shall not become a law ? This is to suppose the people to have , at the same time and on the same subject , a judgment at war with itself to wish that their own will should not be carried into effect . in the Edinburgh Review for July , in estimating the force with which the Reform Bill will go up to the House of Lords , // our learned brother argues , and justly , that from the number of votes against it in the House of Commons , there should be a deduction of all the votes given by the rotten and close borough nominees , because these votes represent merely the opinion of the individual nohlemen , having the nomination of those boroughs . And what but the opinions of the same and three or four hundred other individual noblemen is represented , by the entire vote of the House of Lords ? And why was not the tradition , by which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commons , as good as the tradition by which he holds his own seat in the House of Lords ? The Governments of Europe ( except the French ) rest , if we may so express it , on an historical basis ; they are what time and events have made them , and a great deal of which no reasonable account can now be given , exists and is perpetuated by the force of custom . In countries not despotically governed , this acquiescence in what exists , is the great strength of the Constitution . The English institutions rest , for the most part , on this basis . It is the basis of the common law . It is a basis firm enough for cop*mon times . But when violent times come , and radical changes are projected by ambitious innovators armed with military strength , or when sweeping reforms are undertaken by speculative statesmen , it is then plain , that the historical basis fails . It is avowedly repudiated . The military usurper tramples it under foot ; the speculative reformer professes to disregard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nature of the historjcal basis , as it were , of itself to perish , to rot away . The name remains ,  - -  and scarcely that ,  --  but the thing is gone . The friends of the existing system tell you , that a nobility is a part of the history , nay , of the antiquity of the British monarchy , that there have been barons , and earls , and dukes , from time immemorial ; an integral estate of the realm , of eminent dignity . But when you scrutinize the subject nearly , you find that the name only is ancient , that the substance which it once described , has ceased to exist ; and that the peers of England are in no degree different from the rest of the citizens , nor for any reason more competent or better entitled to form a house of legislation , than many hundreds and thousands of their fellow-citizens . So that even on the historical basis , the House of Peers has no solid foundation . It might stand unshaken so long as the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // and rejected as it is in the House of Commons , we see not how it can stand in the House of Lords . What does the great English revolution of the seventeenth century teach us on this subject ,  --  what is the lesson of the Commonwealth ? We think it entirely safe to ask that question , for we can not doubt , that the revolution now commenced will go , to say the least , as far , not in popular violence , but in giving a popular character to the Government . The revolution of 1640 was a passionate , turnultuary , perhaps we may say fanatical movement , soon running into a military despotism . Great principles were struck out , but not calmly and systematically developed . Qld institutions were rudely torn down , and any thing which the turbulence of the moment permitted was provisionally reared in their place . The various Parliaments assembled during the Commonwealth , were but a bitter and bloody mockery of a representation . The present revolution has begun , and we trust will proceed calmly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to go further than the Commonwealth , because it will proceed on rational grounds , reforming not subverting ; and building anew wherever it is necessary to take down the unsafe and antiquated structures of ancient days . There will be no Straffords impeached , nor Lauds accused of treason , but we should not be surprised should the Commons again vote the Lords to be useless and dangerous , and therefore to be abolished . ' This is rendered as certain as any thing of the kind can be , by what is now going on in France . It is now proposed by the ministry of France , under the auspices of the King , to abolish the hereditary house of peers . It is possible , that the influence of this example may be impaired by the disorders , which perhaps await France . But if any thing like a happy issue is in reserve to reward the dangers and sacrifices of the patriots in France , then it will be just as impossible to retain an hereditary peerage in England , after it has been abolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level at Dover , and another at Calais . In both countries , the natural course of things will lead to an imitation of our senatorial bodies . Practice has seemed thus far , to establish the beneficial operation of two chambers of legislation , to an extent not promised by the theory . It is true , that the Senate of the United States was not organized merely for the sake of having a second chamber of legislation ; but as the basis of a compromise between // the Federal and the State principles , which , when the Constitution was formed , were supposed to be in collision . But the uniform experience of our twenty-four State Governments has been thought to establish the necessity of two houses of legislation . Of that necessity , in a simple Commonwealth , we entertain some doubts . We are not sure , that the plan of two chambers , as it was historically suggested by the division of Parliament into Lords and Commons , is not without any real ground of expediency or convenience . It is not probable , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly . It is far more likely , that the kingdom will be divided into senatorial districts , electing perhaps a hundred senators for a period somewhat longer than that of the House of Commons , and like our Senate invested with a portion of the executive functions of the Government . Thirdly . We can not draw any line between the House of Lords and the crown , in reference to most of the foregoing arguments . It appears to us , on the contrary , that though an hereditary monarchy is by no means the part of the system , where it infringes most directly on the new principle of the Government , it is that part , where the inconsistency of the old and new principles is most apparent to the observer . When the delicacy of the discussion is once overcome , it will perhaps appear , that the original and traditionary foundation of the crown has more effectually disappeared in the lapse of ages , than even that of the peerage . It never was pretended , we believe , that the peers sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this formed the king 's right to his throne . Is there a man now living in England , who entertains that opinion of the royal office ? There can not be one . But it is the ancient constitution of the realm , that there should be a king . It would be more proper , perhaps , to say , that it is the ancient constitution of the realm , that there should be a chief executive officer , clothed with such powers as Parliament may from time to time , by law , ordain , and acceding to the throne , under such modifications of the rule of hereditary succession , as the Parliament may establish . Except the name , there is very little in common between Elizabeth or Henry VIII . and William IV . The kingly office , as administered by the Tudors , is about as different from what it now is , as it is now from the office of President of the United States . The right given by act of Parliament ( 28 Henry VIII . c. 7 ) to Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his successor by testament , a right exercised by other sovereigns , differs almost as much from the present tenure , by which the crown is held ,  --  an hereditary Protestant succession , limited by act of Parliament ,  --  as this last does from popular choice . Now suppose it to he the sense of the people of England , ( whether it be so or not we are really ignorant , ) that an hereditary succession to the chief magistracy is an institution in arrears of the present state of civilization . Suppose the republicans in theory should think it time that what they consider an absurd mode of constituting the executive were reformed . Suppose economical men should think so expensive an establishment , as the crown and its incidents and appendages , ought to be retrenched . Suppose the men of sense of all parties should say , that the question , how the chief executive office should be constituted , is one on which it is as important to ascertain the sense of the people , as the proposed change in the mode of choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under these views , and reflecting that the subject never was fairly and without prejudice put to the people , were to raise and discuss the question , and finally either decide it themselves in favor of an elective chief magistrate , or pass an act providing for the meeting of a conventIon , deputed by the people to consider and settle this question ; could any consistent and satisfactory objection be made to such a course , by the patrons and supporters of the present bill ? We repeat , that we do not assume to know , what would be the decision of such a convention . Captain Hall tells us , that the people of England have a warm loyal feeling , in addition to their respect for the official character of the king ; that they love monarchy . It is perhaps so ; and this may be in England a feeling of a generous and amiable character . But it seems to us a feeling belonging to an earlier day , and a lower stage of civilization . We should rather think , that when Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Deputy Lord Great Chamberlain , the Lord High Constable , and the Earl Marshal , preceded by Garter , ' was employed in going round to the four sides of Westminster Abbey , and making the recognition , four times , at the late coronation , he must have been divided between an inclination to smile and to sigh ; and have perhaps put the question to himself , What the school-master would say of this pageantry ? ' // The opinion of the school-boy would be a matter of less doubt . We should think , that whoever in England should amuse a leisure hour , in reading Sir William Blackstone 's chapter on the royal prerogative , would come to the conclusion , that it was nearly time that the sense of the people was taken on the whole subject . It is of the king 's prerogative , in reference to foreign powers , to send and to receive ambassadors ; to make treaties , leagues , and alliances ; to make peace and war . At home , the king is a branch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its other branches ; he is generalissimo of the army and navy ; he is the fountain of justice and of honor ; the arbiter of commerce , and the supreme governor of the Church . Such , according to Sir William , are the heads of the prerogative of the crown . Should his present majesty die tomorrow , this crown , with all these prerogatives , would descend to a female child eleven years old . We should think , when the people come to put that and that together , it would be their decided sense that , if these vast prerogatives ought to vest even nominally in a girl of eleven years of age , Old Saruni and Gatton might as well be let alone . Sir William speaks of those branches of the royal prerogative , which invest our sovereign lord , thus all perfect and immortal in his kingly capacity , with a number of authorities and powers , in the exertion whereof consists the executive part of the Government . This is wisely placed in a single hand by the British Constitution , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' If Sir William has rightly stated the points , in which the wisdom of this arrangement consists , it would seem a departure from that wisdom , to place upon a baby brow the round And top of sovereignty . ' Among tfie consequences which will flow from adopting the sense of the people ' as the new principle of the British Government , we reckon , in the fourth place , the entire abrogation of the present national Church establishment . This , in fact , would seem to us more likely to happen at an early day , than the suppression of the peerage or the crown . The case of the established Church , we believe to be somewhat as follows . The Church of England is established by law in England and Ireland , with certain great exclusive privileges ; and about one half of the English population are attached to that Church . In // 42 Reform in England . Scotland , the Presbyterian Church is the Church established by law , and a small minority of the people belongs to the Episcopal or English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say four fifths , of the people are of the Catholic Church . Now , in the House of Peers , ( we believe ) thirty bishops and archbishops of the Church of England sit , as spiritual lords , possessing the same privileges , as members of that House , with the other peers . No Catholic bishop or priest is permitted a seat in the House of Lords , although by the late act of emancipation , the lay Catholic nobility are restored to their seats . No dignitary nor teacher of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland is allowed to sit in the House of Lords , although that Church is hy law the established Church of that part of the British empire . No dissenting teacher of any rank is allowed a seat in the House of Peers , although the dissenters are one half of the population of England . Will it be in conformity with the sense of the people of Great Britain , that thirty of the dignitaries of the minority Church should possess this great privilege ? Is it right , that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its functionaries should hold seats in one of the Houses of Parliament , can nay reason be given , why these seats should be monopolized hy one communion , and that the minority ? Here even the great argument of antiquity fails ; the Catholic Church is entitled to the advantage of that argument on this point . The Church of England , as such , dates , at the earliest , from 1532 . Then , too , the property of the Church . Considerable endowments were made in ancient times , and in the days of the Catholic Church , for the support of religion . A part of these were confiscated by Henry VIII. , and by him kestowed on his lay favorites ; a part are still applied to the service of religion , and are appropriated by the State exclusively to the established Church . Is it right , that these endowments of the ancient Catholic land-owner should be monopolized hy one communion of Protestants , and that the minority ? A considerable addition has , we believe , been made to these endowinents since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , on the enclosure of common lands . These funds , like the more ancient ones , are also appropriated exclusively to the support of the minority Church . // The universities may be considered as a part of this Church . A liberal share of the ecclesiastical endowments is in the disposal of these noble establishments . All the dignities , offices , and emoluments of these institutions are monopolized by the minority Church ; and what is harder , their advantages , as places of education , are monopolized in the same way . If we are not misinformed , a subscription to the articles of the Church of England is required at one of the universities on admission , at the other on graduation . So that a young man , who is a conscientious member of the Church established by law in Scotland , can not be graduated at an English university ; nor the son of the Earl Marshal of England , the heir of all the blood of all the Ilowards , receive his education at the college which , perhaps , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not stand under a representative system . The universities , as a matter of course , will at least be thrown open to all comers . Equally , as a matter of course , we apprehend , will the ecclesiastical funds be applied to the support of religious teachers , on some principle of equal distribution . We go thus far , on the assu*mption , that these funds will continue to be raised to the extent to which they are now levied . But whether it will be thought just , by the reformed Parliament , giving effect to the popular sense , to assess on the owner of the land the whole cost of supporting the teachers of religion ,  --  which is the effect of the present system ,  --  we do not pretend to say . That something will be done , and that speedily , with the Church , seems to be understood . It appears to be admitted , even on the present system , that its revenues require a new apportionment between the dignitaries and the laboring clergy . A commencement has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last September , Mr. Hume made a motion in Parliament , that an address should be presented to his Majesty , that he will be graciously pleased not to recommend to fill up the vacant sees of Derry and of Dublin , until the revenues of those sees are regulated in a manner consistent with the best interests of the established Church and the peace of Ireland . ' On occasion of this motion , the Chancellor of the Exchequer said , that in making a disposition of these sees , it was the intention of the Government to make it , not as regarded the see of Derry , but generally as regarded // all the sees . It was his opinion , that no appropriation should be made of the revenues of the established Church to any other object ; hut that a different distribution of those revenues could be made with great advantage . It is plain , that the principle here advanced applies equally to the English sees , and , probably , to some of them in an equal degree . Did the whole population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the revenues of the Church , which should give a fair remuneration to the laboring clergy , would be all that justice requires in this respect . It may be , as we have said , a question of public expediency , how far it is right to raise those funds exclusively from the land . But as the present owner of the lands came into possession of them with this incumbrance , he does not appear to be wronged . That the tenant however , does not , as is alleged , suffer a proportionate share of this burden on the land , we are not prepared to admit . But- this is aside from our purpose , and would plunge us into the whole metaphysics of the subject of rent . But the Church of England being the Church of the minority , it is plain , that the sense of the people ' will go beyond a more equal distribution among the teachers of that Church of the funds consecrated to the purpose of religion . It will require , that by some process or other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether this shall be done , by permitting the tithe-payer to make his payment to the religious teacher of his own election , or whether the whole shall be paid into the exchequer , to be apportioned by the Government among all the Churches of all communions , will be a question for future decision . In France , in consequence of the alienation of Church property in the revolution , the entire religious establishment is supported by the Government . It ought to be borne in mind , to the honor of the French Government , that the Protestant teachers are paid their salaries from the treasury , as well as the priests of the establishment . A similar liberality is extended by the Government of Austria to the dissenting communions in that empire , not excepting the Unitarians of Transylvania . But we can not disguise the conviction , that the sense of the people of Great Britain , equally represented in a free Parliament , will go much farther in the matter of Church reform , than we have yet indicated . If we have not mistaken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has on this subject been ripening toward a grand and general system of independency and religious freedom . If ever there was a truly AngloSaxon idea struck out ,  --  if ever there was a notion suggested in the full spirit of English liberty , it was that of our glorious forefathers , the Puritans or Independents . They developed it , in all its perfection , as far as it concerns the independence of each single religious society ; but even they did not carry it out to the liberty of each and every individual conscience . But the civilization of the age has pretty nearly reached the goal on this subject , and the one principle is as widely admitted as the other . It is an essential ,  --  the most essential ,  --  part of religious liberty to be permitted to join those , who agree with us in opinion , in electing the religious teacher to whose instructions we choose to listen . If we voluntarily attach ourselves to a communion , whose spiritual heads are authorized to designate the subordinate teachers , there is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . But the State , as such , must not interfere . Whether after its interference shall be withdrawn in Great Britain , the spiritual organization of the Episcopal , the Presbyterian , the Methodist , the Catholic , and other Churches will subsist , as it does at present , will depend on themselves . There will , probably , be a great extension of the practice of a choice of the religious teacher , by the society which he is to instruct . What difficulty would there be in adopting , in the Church of England , the constitution of the Protestant Episcopal Church of this country , whose clergy are as respectable as their brethren in England , and are elected by the churches to which they mihister ? The pecuniary interest possessed in advowsons will , of course , if any change should be made in this system , be a proper subject for equitable indemnification . But this we are bold to say , that before a Parliament representing the sense of the people , the present ecclesiastical system can not stand a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Paley , a high dignitary of the established Church , admits that the provision for the support of religion in some parts of America , as he understood it , was the most perfect which had been devised . The provision to which he referred was one , which obliged the citizen to contribute to the support of a religious teacher , leaving to each individual the choice of his teacher . Short of this , the progress of reform will hardly stop in England . // In the fifth place , a considerable modiflcation ,  --  perhaps the dissolution ,  --  of the colonial system will , probably , be among the effects produced by the new principle of the Constitution . Among the incidental , perhaps we may say the unexpected operations of the bill now pending , it has not escaped observation , that by destroying the rotten and close boroughs , that virtual representation of the Colonies , which consisted in the nomination for such boroughs of members competent and disposed to take care of colonial interests , will be destroyed . The colonial interests will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To remedy this evil , Mr. Hume proposed , on the 16th of August , to apportion to the Colonies nineteen out of the thirty-two seats , by which the bill reduces the present numbers of the House . He proposed to give to British India four members , to the crown Colonies , ( those having no legislative assemblies of their own ) eight members , to British America three , to the West India Islands four . Mr. Hume accompanied his motion with an elaborate exposition , showing plainly the reasonableness of th' plan , though the crudity of some parts of it is manifest enough . Thus Malta was to send one member , and all British India only four ! - Mr . Hume 's motion was seconded by the Mar*uis of Chandos , whose own successful proposition to divide the counties seems to have caused no little discontent on the part of the friends of the bill . Mr. Hume 's motion was negatived without a division ; but it was not scouted . How could it be ? Has England learned nothing out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened in vain ? Are the inhabitants of the Colonies free men ? Are they British citizens ? Do they inherit the birthright of British privileges ? Have they the common pride and sensibility of men ? Mr. Labouchere , ( the intelligent member of Parliament , who visited the British American Colonies and the United States a few years since , and with his companions , Mr. Stanley , Mr. Dennison , and Mr. Wortley , carried back the respect and good will of all in America , who had the good fortune to make their acquaintance , ) in replying to Mr. Hume , expressed the opinion , that the colonial members would prove merely an insulated force , at the disposal of the ministers on all other points ; and cited the authority of Mr. Burke in support of the proposition , that Nature herself had placed an insuperable obstacle in the way of the attendance of colonial representatives // in the British Parliament . We do not perceive why a colonial member should be deemed incapable of entering the great and general arena of British statesmanship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As to the natural obstacle , we think it greatly exaggerated . Mexico was represented in the Spanish Cortes . The case of British India is the strongest . But if we suppose the members elected a year beforehand , as half the members of the American Congress are elected ,  --  and suppose the average voyage from India to London to be one hundred and twenty days , where is the difficulty ? As to all the other colonial members , the case is unattended with difficulty . Thirty days may be safely calculated upon as a passage from Quebec or Jamaica . . N'o other objection , that we find , was stated ! The American Revolution is a standing demonstration , that British Colonies must be represented or become independent , whenever the popular feeling is awakened on the subject . England brings up her children to a notion of rights and liberties , which makes them awkward subjects of arbitrary power . There never was gathered together , under the name of a people , a race more kindly disposed to order and manly subordination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonies of Great Britain ; and yet their colonial history is one long series of murmurs , complaints , and struggles , ending in revolution and separation . Are the Englishmen in the present Colonies of baser clay ? We do not believe it . Besides this , the physical difficulty being proved to be imaginary , how can the friends of reform refuse , on principle , to give a representation to the Colonies ? But here comes a great difficulty . When a Colony reaches a state in which it is fit to be represented , and in which it has a free population to represent ; when it ceases to be held by military force and is capable of a Government of laws , then it is fit for independence . The colonial system , with or without representation , never was intended for free , intelligent communities , of the kindred of the mother country . It suits infant plantations , remote and conquered savage or semi-civilized tribes , and military posts like Malta and Gibraltar , which are rather garrisons than Colonies . But the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they understand and are capable of protecting , you must then incorporate them into your body politic , as integral members , or // they will set up for themselves . So that it may be taken as an axiom , that a representative Government can not hold distant Colonies , on any great scale . Such Colonies , if admitted to be entitled to representation , will say , You think us entitled to a voice in the Parliament of the empire . But it is not a voice in your metropolitan councils which we need . Your interests concern not us , and in protecting our own interests , we ought to have more than a voice , we ought to have the exclusive control . We know what is good for ourselves . If you know what is good for us , you can not , and do not profess to make it the rule of your colonial policy . That rule is the interest of the mother country , and the interest of the Colonies only as it coincides with yours . You think we understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to enlighten you upon them . But understanding these interests , we do not see why we should have to come to London to manage them . We can manage them at home . This is a language likely to come from some at least of the Colonies ; not probably from British India . Its Government is a military despotism . Mr. Hume 's idea of granting it a representation , seems to us absurd . How can a military despotism , a country containing one hundred and ten millions of men , kept in awe by twenty thousand foreign , and one hundred and eighty thousand native troops , be represented ? Represent whom ? The native population ? Why , they have no political rights to represent or protect . Represent the army which holds them in submission ? The army wants pay an*l promotion ,  - -  panem et c*rcenses ,  --  and nothing else . If any body in India needs representation , it is the poor natives . Mr. flume 's plan would throw the election of the four members for flindostan into the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House of Commons ? He says , we believe , that the member from Calcutta will be sufficient for all Upper India . Does Mr. flume know how many provinces , kingdoms , and millions of men are contained in all Upper India , which he thinks will be sufficiently represented by one Englishman , chosen by the British residents at Calcutta ? British America is ripe for represei*tation ; but the people who are fit for a representative Government , are , as we have said , fit for independence . Mr. flume proposes to give all British continental America but three representatives , ( because they have assemblies of their own , ) while Malta is to have one , // Gibraltar one , and Newfoundland one . A strange discrimination ! Malta and Gibraltar are mere garrisons , Newfoundland a poor fishing station . The continental provinces are an empire , daily growing in numbers , wealth , and importance . Represented or not , they will soon fail away from the British Government . A liberal Parliament could not well throw obstacles in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that part of his majesty 's people , that they are fit to govern themselves , how could their right to do so be gainsaid ? If this right be peaceably conceded , the British Colonies on the North American continent will probably establish an independent republic of their own . if a compulsory policy be pursued by the mother country , they will as probably , on the breaking out of the first war , join the United States . British India will be held , as long as the British Government will pay the troops necessary to retain it in its present condition . The state of the British West Indies is peculiar . Their question , as to political relations , is affected by the other all-absorbing question of their domestic condition . They would unquestionably be soothed by being admitted to Parliament ; but as their great question will there be decided on grounds , which one , or two , or half a dozen colonial members , however well informed , could not affect ,  - -  on abstract grounds of moral argument ,  --  no permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by allowing them to be represented in the House of Commons . The slavery question is all in all to them . If that be decided in their favor , they will care very little about representation . If decided against them ,  --  a result which Mr. flume 's four members would be able to do nothing to avert ,  --  they will revolt . We have before us extracts from the West India papers , which leave no doubt on this question . There is no part of the landscape , of which we find it so difficult to get a clear view as Ireland . A fatal wall of partition is kept up between her and the English Government . If that wall should be broken down , Ireland is safe ; if not , we see not how , under a popular Parliament , it can be retained . That wall of partition is the legal establishment in ireland of a Church hostile to the faith of the people of Ireland . Turks and Greeks do not differ more in their feelings on this subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outraged by the Church establishment ; and doubly so , on the comparison of herself with Scotland , whose national faith is // established by law . This is the great cause of Irish disaffection . Redundant population and absenteeism are evils ; but it is the Church that lies at the root of the difficulty , and poisons every thing . Unless the feelings of the people are consulted on this head , they must be held in subjection by military power , or not at all . But how are you to hold a people in military subjection , who , by popular election , send one hundred members to Parliament ? The thing is impossible . If that representation do not work out an entire equality of privilege for its constituents , they will swarm off . The concessions already made to the Catholics will avail nothing . Concessions to a discontented party have no effect , but to give the party new strength and confidence . There is no medium between withholding all and granting all . If the Catholic population of Ireland shall , in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Protestant brethren , and every point of distinction be removed , and if Ireland be admitted to a share of the representation proportioned to her numbers , it may be retained in its connexion with England . If this is not done , it can only be kept by military possession . TIe sixth consequence of the new principle will , we think , be a great retrenchment of the public establishments , and of the expenditure by which they are supported . This topic would be more fruitful in comment than any we have touched . It is a subject more immediately and practically important than any other , but we have left ourselves no room to dwell on it . It will be remembered that retrenchment is one of the three principles , to which the present ministry pledged themselves , in coming into office . Another of these principles was non-interference in foreign politics , and we just indicate it , ( without being able to develope the idea , ) as the last of the consequences of the adoption of the new principle , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence , which England has been used to exercise abroad . But with the decline of this foreign influence ,  --  fruitful of strife and trouble ,  --  her substantial strength and inward welfare will be promoted . Like the United States , she will become weak abroad and strong at home . Mighty coalitions , foreign campaigns , great naval expeditions , extravagant subsidies , and chains of colonies stretching round the globe , must be abandoned ; but with them the wars which belong to the same system will cease ; the burdens they impose will be re // lieved ; the swarms of consuming idlers which they nourish , will be scattered or turned into industrious producers ; and the strong powers , with which they make it necessary to fortify the executive arm , will no longer he required . In this way , the march of national improvement will be carried on . It is a process for dispensing with extra Government . As it extends itself from nation to nation , less and less will depend on the personal qualities of those who administer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of a few individuals to embroil Europe and America in war . The capital , the labor , and the talent , that have been employed in the work of destruction , will be directed to the work of production and preservation , and a consequent increase of human happiness will result . This state of things tends powerfully toward a new and greatly improved condition of international politics . The ancient civilization was so feeble in its principle , that it seemed hardly to admit of an extension beyond the sphere of one great political family . A series of States in the west of Asia succeeded each other , each rising on the ruins of its predecessor ; and none of them proving the source of light to be contemporaneously enjoyed by other nations . rJ7he civilization of Europe next arose in Greece ; struggled a. while with that of Persia ; was at one moment on the point of being overwhelmed ; but having escaped in that crisis , obtained a mastery under the auspices of Alexander , which has never since been permanently wrested from Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italy , on any other basis than the ruins of Greece . The diffusion of Christianity was followed with a great extension of the arts congenial to a spiritual religion . In the obscurity of the dark ages , a great work of spreading improvenient was carried on , to which justice is hardly done . The erection throughout Christendom of churches and religious houses , with the organization of a body of men devoted to the service of a faith built on written records , and providing a system of religious instruction , was itself an engine for diffusing intellectual improvement , beyond all which the ancient world possessed . Nor must we forget the new instruments of social intercourse and communication , the compass and the press . In a word , it was found in the formation of the modern political system , that Europe had become capable of supporting more // 52 Reform in England . than one civilized nation ; that a family of States , rivalling each other in the arts of life , could subsist side by side . But then sprang up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wars . These nations , being all organized under forms of Governments , which threw the control of affairs into the hands of a few men , their personal passions and con-. tested titles were a source of eternal wars . A principle of international peace became necessary . We now want to constitute our Governments so that it will be hard to go to war . We wish to put the last hand to the great improvement of modern civilization over that of the ancient world , and put an end to this cruel necessity of waging war every thirty years . It is plain that this can only be done , by giving full developement to the representative principle . This will cut off the great source of wars , the personal passions of those in power . It was the unfortunate prejudice which Mr. Canning had conceived against the United States , which eventually produced the war of 1812 ; neither Lord Castlereagh , nor the Duke of Wellington , nor Lord Grey , would , in Lhe judgment we have formed of these ministers , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war ; certainly a free Parliament would not have allowed it . The revolutionary war of 1775 , was against the sense of the people of England . It has ever appeared to us , that the unnecessary interference of Mr. Pitt in French politics brought on the wars of the French Revolution , with all their consequences . Our whole simple philosophy on this subject is contained in the words of Cowper ; War is a game , which , were their subjects wise , Kings would not play at . ' By kings , we mean , of course , kings and ministers . It is itself a great triumph of modern improvement , that so much less depends on the personal character of the prince in many States of Europe , than formerly . Still , however , his personal character greatly influences the selection of ministers ; and the ministry do but substitute their own personality for that of the king . For personal reasons , from personal views , opinions , passions , they play this dreadful game of war . The sense of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  is against it . Two enlightened countries , freely represented , could scarcely be wrought up to the point of carrying a declara // tion of war against each other , through all the stages of a legislative enactment . If a thorough reform of the British Government shall bring the collective sense of the people of England into the councils of that country , and a like happy issue crown the movement in France ; we should not despair of finding the influence of these two countries , in connexion with that of the United States , prove sufficient to put an end to war among civilized nations , and leave it to barbarous and despotic nations and Governments ,  --  a fit engine to be employed by them for mutual havoc . How long will it be before such a consummation will be brought about ? Let no man , who loves his race and augurs favorably of its destinies , be put out of countenance by this question . How long is it since all Western Europe , now the seat of Christianity and of letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with tribes of painted savages ? Less than eighteen hundred years . Compare the condition of Great Britain , and the entire North of Europe now , with what it was eight or nine centuries ago . The mechanical and industrious arts have added incalculably to the power of social and improving influences in modern times . There is no extravagance in predicting a vastly accelerated progress of civilization . But should it be slower than we wish or hope , it is not the less sure ; and the object is one worthy to be obtained by generations and centuries of effort . No sacrifice is costly ; no time is long . A thousand years are as one day . It is not we who are doing the work ; it is the long line of generations , of which we are but a little part , and which , from the first blow that was struck for liberty in modern Europe , has been struggling toward the same end . We have intimated our opinions as to measures , some of which we think are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the rule of the Government and the principle of the constitution of England . These farther reforms , as far as they depend on the will of the people of England , may be brought about by parliamentary enactment , or by a still more authentic mode of ascertaining the sense of the people ; we mean the adoption , by the people themselves , of a new . Magna Charta , a reformed written constitution . Should the friends of reform in England be disposed to pursue this course , we beg leave to suggest the method of procedure usually adopted in this country , as simple , convenient , and safe . // Several of the States of this Union , and among them the largest and most powerful , have found occasion to revise their constitutions . This was last done in Virginia , two years ago . For this purpose , an act is passed by the State Legislature , authorizing the assembling of a convention , and prescribing the qualifications of its members , and their mode of election , which are usually those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention meets , revises the constitution , and prepares its report . This is submitted to the people , who accept or reject it , and this ends the matter . This has been done over and over again in the United States , and always without embarrassment , difficulty , or commotion . An analogous course in England would be , to provide by act of Parliament for the election of members of a convention , in proportion to the population , ( including or excluding the Colonies , according as it might be intended to incorporate them or not into the State , ) to be chosen in convenient geographical districts , and on some popular principle of suffrage . Let this convention meet , not like the barons at Runnymede , to extort a charter of liberties from a tyrant , but to devise a liberal constitution of Government for the people ; to be accepted or rejected by them ' and containing in itself proper conservative principles , like those embodied in the constitution of the United States . It has been with no small satisfaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republics in general , and the Government of the United States in particular , on the score of fluctuation and instability ,  --  after hearing our constitution reproached on this ground in the present debate , by one of the most respectable members of Parliament , we find our learned colleague of the British Quarterly Review asking of the friends of the Reform Bill , if they are aware of the existence of that powerful conservative principle , so wisely embodied in the original frame of the American constitution , ' and contrasted , by the same writer , with the exposure of the British constitution to the mercy of an omnipotent Legislature . ' We had ourselves drawn this contrast , in our remarks of last July ; but we did not flatter ourselves that we should so soon see it recognized in such a quarter . If a new constitution should be drawn up for England , by such a convention as we have described , conforming to the ascertained sense of the people , and containing a provision that no change shall be made in it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratified by two thirds of the people , the liberties of England , in our humble judgment , will be put upon a basis of security , beyond the reach of all the ordinary causes of political decline . A vast reduction of expenditure would be the consequence of the simplification of the Government , and the change in its foreign policy . This would lead to a proportionate diminution of the burden of taxation , and to an effectual attack on the mountain mass of the public debt . Look at the United States . Behold what these free institutions have done for us ! In fifty-seven years , we have passed through two wars , and great vicissitudes of domestic politics , and have , nevertheless , paid off a public debt of nearly two hundred millions of dollars ,  --  grown up from three millions of inhabitants to thirteen ,  --  and settled the continent for a thousand miles into the interior . Forty millions of pounds sterling of public debt paid off ! - Should we be extravagant , if we said , that , compared to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , as the British debt for Great Britain ? Yet this has our tumultuous democracy achieved . What has the stable monarchy of Great Britain done in the meantime ? Quadrupled her debt . And for what purpose ? To put down the French revolution . Is it down ? Look at its denouement in July , 1830 . To put down the French revolution ? Every dollar spent by Great Britain in that cause tended to assure its success . No , this mighty burden was laid on England , in support of a system of politics , conceived by a great man , but , even on English principles , of doubtful soundness , and so regarded by other English states* men as great as he . Such a policy , under a free representalion of the deliberate and intelligent sense of the people , could not have been persevered in . It has entailed on England her present heritage of embarrassment . It is the load of taxation ,  --  the intolerable weight of each man 's share of that load ,  --  which now gives all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesman , who thinks to give quiet to the country ,  --  dastin g quiet ,  --  by any thing short of a great diminution of taxation , deceives himself . The topic of agitation may vary , but the discontent will continue . They may change the place , but they will keep the pain . Catholic disabilities may be removed , test and corporation acts repealed , parliamentary reform be granted . It is only filing away successively another piece of parchment in the archives of State . And unless the // reform of Parliament is followed by radical changes in the system of Government , in virtue of which it can be administered at half its present expense , nothing will have been gained toward satisfying the public mind . There the great load of taxation remains ; the mighty weight , which runs down , and runs down , and never finds a bottom , but is giving a constantly accelerated motion to the whole madding machinery of opposition , agitation , disaffection , and revolt . But it is probable that the reformed Parliament , containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public voice , will lead to other reforms , productive of diminished expenditure and reduced taxation , and in this probability rests the hope , that it will prove a measure of health and preservation to the State.
