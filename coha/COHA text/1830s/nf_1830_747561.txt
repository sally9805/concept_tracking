Including Instructions for sketching from Nature , " The most consummate master is tied to the observation of every one of these rules , on pain of pleasing none but the ignorant .

Ceacf ) et of 33ratoing an " B etsjjectibet /z/ It is the object of this book to explain the elements of Perspective , together with the art of sketching from nature , in a familiar manner , so as to render them intelligible to the young , and those not skilled in Mathematics and Geometry . There are many learned and elaborate treatises on Perspective , but they are generally unintelligible to those who can not command the assistance of a teacher . The subject is abstract in its nature ; an acquaintance with its principles , and a facility in its practice , can not be gained without attention and labour , but with these , it is believed that any one , having a competent skill in drawing , may gain from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /z/ A straight line is the shortest which can be made between two given points : it is without curve or bend , as A , Plate L Straight lines are horizontal , perpendicular , or oblique . B , is a horizontal line ; C , a perpendicular line ; D , E , h F , are oblique lines . Parallel hues are alike , and keep the same distance from each other . A and B are parallel lines . /z/ An angle is formed by two straight lines which meet at a point . G R is an acute angle ; H , an obtuse angle ; I , a right angle ; J , a triangle . A triangle has three sides , and three corners or angles . An angle is the space included in any of these lines . The size of an angle is measured , not by the length of its lines , but by the space included in them , and is accordingly that portion of a circle which this space contains . /z/ A circle , whether large or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called degrees . A degree , therefore , is not any precise measure , as an inch , a foot , or a mile , but simply the three hundred and sixtieth part of any circle . In a large circle , the parts or degrees are larger than in a small one , but the number is the same ( see Plate 2 , circles A and D. ) A line which passes through the centre of a circle , and divides it in two equal parts , is called a diameter . Thus the half of the small circle A , divided by the diameter B , is 180 degrees , as truly as the half of the larger circle D. Any straight line drawn from the centre of a circle to the circumference , is called a radius . In the circle A are two radii E and F , proceeding from the centre ; one a perpendicular , the other a horizontal line . These two lines include one quarter of the circle or 90 degrees . This is a right angle . If the circle were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one quarter of it . Therefore a right angle is a quarter of a circle , that is , 90 degrees , if It extend a thousand feet , or even to the heavens , for its size is estimated only by the portion of a circle which it includes . This is an idea of proportion , not of actual measured space , and it is important to perceive and maintain the distinction . An angle which includes a portion of a circle less than 90 degrees , is called an acute angle , and may be of any size from to almost nothing . As E G ( circle A , Plate 2 ) which is about 45 degrees , and H F which is not more than 10 degrees . /z/ Planes can not be so well described as lines and angles . Any even flat surface considered without regard to its tliickness , is a plane . A table is a plane , the floor is a plane , the side of the house , &; c . Planes are perpendicular , horizontal , or oblique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The floor is a horizontal plane , and so is the ceiling a horizontal plane , parallel with that of the floor . Any even surface which varies or inclines from the perpendicular , is an inclined plane ; as a writing desk . A perpendicular plane is at right angles with a horizontal plane . Thus , if you place a book upright on a table , the book is a perpendicular plane , and the table a horizontal one , and they make a right angle . An inclined plane makes an angle less than a right angle , with a horizontal or perpendicular one . For a writing desk , which is an inclined plane , does not make a right angle with the table on which it stands , as the book when placed upright does ; but it makes a smaller angle , and this angle is more or less acute ( that is , small ) according to the greater or less inclination of the desk . Two or more similar planes are said to be parallel . Planes may be of any extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor o wall of a house , and some are only imagined to exist , for the purposes of science . If two balls ( M and N Plate 2 ) were suspended from a ceiling by cords of the same length , and were revolving about , they would be said to move in the same plane , though no plane or surface were actually under them ; we know that if one were put under them , they would both touch it . Thus objects are said to be in the same plane , when they are neither higher nor lower than eaicb other . /z/ All objects situate on the earth are , in perspective , said to be on the same plane , called the ground plane . There are three planes especially to be attended to in perspective , viz. The ground plane , the horizontal plane , and the perspective plane . The ground plane is that on which the objects to be drawn stand ; as trees , houses , figures , he . - And when drawing an interior , the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane , is an imaginary plane , supposed to extend from the eye of the spectator , to the verge of the horizon . The perspective plane is also imaginary . It is a transparent plane , like a window or pane of glass , placed between the spectator and the landscape , or object to be drawn , standing perpendicularly . If the appearance of objects seen through this plane , were traced on it , as it might be on a window through which you were looking , it would make a correct draw-ing or picture of the view . The paper on which you draw , in taking a view , is the representative of this perspective plane : - Could you hold it up in a perpendicular position , and see through it , as you do through a window , you would draw the objects beyond it correctly . But as this is impossible , you imagine it to be the case . /z/ All objects are seen by means of rays of light proceeding from them to the eye . These rays proceed in straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from every side of the object , and enter so small a place as the pupil of the eye , it is evident they must converge or draw together , as in figure O , Plate 3 . Having this idea fixed ard familiar in your mind , you will understand that , whether the eye be nearer to or farther from the object , the rays must converge to it ; they therefore form an angle or cone whose apex or point is the eye , and whose base is the size of the object . Now it is plain that the size of this angle wfll depend on the distance of the object from the eye . When near , the angle is larger than when the object is farther off . Thus the rod P makes a smaller angle at Q than at R , and the angle is still smaller at S. For an angle , as has been already explained , ( see Lesson 1 , Plate 2 , ) is a portion of a circle , and if you take one side of the angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle , making the apex of the angle the centre of the circle , it will then be seen how many degrees of this circle the angle occupies , and this shows the size of the angle . To ascertain the size of an angle , it is only necessary to draw a quarter of a circle , that is , a right angle , ( when the angle to be measured does not exceed ninety degrees , or a right angle ) . Take one side of the angle for a radius , as eitherT R , T Q , or T S , ( Plate 3 , ) draw from the corner T a line perpendicular to it . The angle R T P it will be seen , is more than half that quarter , or about 50 ; at Q the rod makes an angle of while at S it makes less than one fifth of a right angle , or 170 . This difference in the size of the angles is caused by a difference of distance . The size of the rod and the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is called the angle under which an object is /z/ seen . It is the angle which the two external rays of light from an object make in coming to the eye . Though somewhat technically expressed , it means nothing more than , that the greater the distance of an object , the smaller it looks . In perspective , a line is always regarded as perpendicular to another , when it is at right angles with it . Thus , u is a line perpendicular to v , or v to w , ( Plate 3 , ) because it makes a right angle , i. e. an angle of 90 degrees with it . a It has been said that we see objects by means of rays of light proceeding from them to the eye , aifd that these rays converge , and form an angle or cone of rays , whose apex is in the eye . The side of a house w , ( Plate 4 , ) is seen by rays coming from it to the eye . The two exterior rays form an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( or other object , ) you may imagine the perspective plane to be situate any where , between the house and the eye , as at x or y . The true drawing- will be where the rays of light coming from the house , enter ( that is , intersect ) the perspective plane in their progress to the eye . This point , where the rays pass through the perspective plane , is called the seat of their representation . 2 in the perspective plane ? / , and 3 in the perspective plane a ; , ( Plate 4 , ) are the seat of representation for the rays abode and / , proceeding from the house w . It will be perceived that when the perspective plane is near the eye , as at y , the object must be drawn smaller , than when it is farther off , as at x . This rule must not be confounded with the one already given , ( see Plate 3 , ) that the angle under which an object is seen , diminishes in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apparent size /z/ of an object , determined by its distance from the eye ; but the other , only the drawing of the object , determined by the situation of the perspective plane . Objects are drawn under their true angles , and preserve their relative proportions , whether the perspective plane is near or more remoie ; . as appears from the figure , ( Plate 4 . ) The house at y , is seen and drawn under the same angle as at je , and the same proportion of the windows and spaces between , is preserved in each . For , take 1 , 2 for a radius , and draw a circle or right angle , and you will perceive that the house is seen under an angle of So take I 3 , or I 4 radius , the circle is larger , but the size of the angle ( that is , the number of degrees ) is the same . * The angle under which an object is seen , determines the size and nearness to the eye . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane from the eye is important ; and having been once fixed , must not be varied in the same view . To illustrate this still more , place a fcard between the eye and an object , a house or tree for instance , if the card is held near , say within a foot of the eye , it will cover or hide the object , and if it were transparent , this object could be traced on the small space of a card of two or three inches size . But hold the same card twice or three times as far off , and it Avill not cover half the former object ; and if you drew on the card at that distance , you could not get all of the object in . This card represents the imaginary perspective plane on which objects are drawn , and by this experiment you can understand , that when it is near you , you can put more on the same space than when it is farther off , though each object in the view will preserve the same relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective , is a plane imagined to extend from the eye of the beholder to the horizon , or farthest verge of the earth which the eye can reach , viz. where the sky appears to touch the earth . Suppose the perspective plane interposed between the eye and the view , ( Hke a window , as has been already described , see Lessons 2 and 3 , ) the horizontal plane would intersect it , or cut it through at right angles , and the line formed on the perspective plane , by this intersection is the horizon line . - What is called the horizon line on the paper or picture , is the representation of this line . For if you suppose the perspective plane set upright on the ground before you , higher than your eye ; then the horizontal plane , to reach from your eye to the verge of the sky , must pass through the perspective plane , and thus make a line exactly parallel with the top and bottom line of your perspective plane . Then draw such a line on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find , when sketching , that some particular point of a tree or window of a house comes just against it . The meeting of the sky with the earth , and the distant hills will also be on this line . It is evident that the height of this line ( viz. how far it is above the bottom line of the picture ) depends on the height of the eye : and this is the case whether the spectator is standing or sitting , - is on the top of a house , or mountain , or on the plain . Could an actual plane extend from the eye to the horizon , lines situate on the ground plane or earth would be under it , and the ground plane would appear to meet it in the horizon , and be inclined to it ; makine : /q/ with it an angle , whose size would be determined by the height of the spectator . This is what is meant by the phrase , " having a high or a low horizon . " The figures A B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same height . Their horizon varies in consequence of the difference in their position . Lines being here necessarily used to express planes , the explanations are less clear than in experimental teaching . Let E be a table , which is a horizontal plane , representing the ground plane on which the spectator and also the objects to be drawn stand , A , a small figure stationed at one side of the table , representing the spectator , - D , another horizontal plane , parallel to the table , placed just as high as the eye of the figure A. Then the plane D , would represent the horizon plane . Now , if you had on the table objects to be drawai , models of houses , trees , &ic.; - and threads attached to the top and bottom of these objects , were brought through the eye of the figure A , after the manner of rays of light ; you would perceive , that the ground plane appears to the eye to rise till it meets the horizon plane in the distance . - As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two planes make , as D E with figure A , or D E with figure B , or with C ( Plate 4 ) depends on the height and position of the figures ABC , viz. the beholder . The more distant the object , the higher up on the perspective plane , and the smaller they appear . If , for instance , the perspective plane were a window , the base of a house or tree near it would be seen through the panes at the bottom ; while that of a similar object a mile or two off , would be seen through the upper panes , or those more nearly on a line with the eye . When you begin to take a view , you first fix your position , which must be stationary , and determine on the height of your eye , and on the distance at which the perspective plane is to be placed or imagined , keeping /z/ in mind that your paper is the representation of the perspective plane . Then draw a line at the bottotn of the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground line , and is the line formed by the intersection of the perspective plane , with the original ground plane ; or in in other words , a line where the perspective plane rests on the earth . This ground line is the boundary of the bottom of the picture ; for the nearest object or point which you design to include in your picture , must be on the ground line . Havins ; drawn your ground line , then draw the horizon line H parallel with it , at the height of your eye ; which line represents the place where the sky meets the earth . The space D between these two lines represents the ground plane , or the earth on which objects stand . The nearer an object is to the spectator , the lower down it will be on the ground plane . I is nearer than J , and J than K. ( Plate 5 . ) Remember that it is only such lines as are nearer the ground plane than the eye , that are drawn under the horizon line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object taller than yourself , you look down to see the base , and you look up to see the top ; consequently the base is below the horizontal plane , and the top is above it . Jf you had three objects to draw at different distances , as I J K , ( Plate 5 , ) the base of each would be situate on the ground plane according to its distance , while the top would come above the horizon hne . The more distant an object is , the smaller it looks . K * It is best not to include in the picture any large object nearer than 100 feet , and even a small object , as a carriage , house , or man at that distance , would occupy a considerable portion of a perspective plane , situate ten or fifteen feet from the eye . Of this you may be easily convinced , by looking out at a window placed at this distance from the eye , and observing how large a portion of it such small objects when very near will occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor so far below the horizon hne as I ; this expresses at once that they are farther off . /z/ There is a point in the horizon hne exactly opposite to the eye ; which is called the point of sight . It is very important in perspective . It is usually placed near the centre of the picture ; but it may be on either side , according to the position of the beholder . You can , if you choose , put the objects on each side of you , into your picture ; and then the point of sight will be in or near the centre ; but if you wish to draw only what is on one side , and omit the other , then the point of sight will be near the extremity of the picture ; because the object , which , in the position you have taken , is opposite your eye , is the one at which you will end your view . The trees ( Plate 5 , L ) are all on the left side of the spectator , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see them as they are drawn here ; and if he choose to omit the objects on the other side , S will be his point of sight , at the extremety of the picture . If he prefer to take in the objects on his right , he will have his point of sight in the centre of his picture . As the picture M , ( Plate 5 , ) where S is the point of sight ; because in this view are included the houses on the right , as well as the trees on the left of the spectator . Thus you perceive that you can have the point of sight wherever you please : provided it be on the horizon line , and opposite the spectator . /z/ The point of sight then is the point in the farthest distance , exactly opposite the eye of the beholder , and is always on the horizon line . Its use may be illustrated by the drawing of a house . This is usually a square or rectangular figure : suppose it to stand exactly before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed by horizontal lines for the top and bottom , and perpendicular lines for the sides or wall . Its place on the ground plane , is determined by its distance from the perspective plane . You will see the front , but nothing of either of the other sides : as N. ( Plate 5 . ) But if the house is placed a little to the right or left of the spectator , one end can be seen as well as the front . - Look at a house from these two different positions . ( Plate 6 ) R. That part a of the end seen , adjoining the front , and next the spectator , is nearer than the part 6 , adjoining the back ; therefore a must look larger than 6 . As this side ( a h ) actually recedes from the eye , it must be drawn diminishing in size , after the following manner . Having drawn the front R , ( Plate 6 ) exactly as in N , ( Plate 5 ) excepting that it is farther removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the top , the other from the bottom of the house , meeting in the point of sight 5 , which is the vanishing point , or that where all the lines on this side , parallel with the top and bottom , would meet . The lines for the doors , windows , Stc. meet , that is , vanish in this point . When a house , or other rectangular object , stands square before you , and not cornerwise or obliquely , two sides , viz. the front and back , are parallel with the ground line , and the other two are exactly at right angles with it . /q/ Lines which in the original object are parallel with the ground line , are drawn parallel. * Lines at right angles with the ground line , vanish or terminate in the point of sight . Perpendicular lines which are parallel with the perspective plane , like the sides of . a house , are drawn perpendicular and parallel . Parallel lines ( whether horizontal like the top and bottom lines of the front of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the sides of the same house ) are shorter than their originals , in proportion to their distance from the perspective plane . Thus the top , bottom , and sides of R , though parallel , like their originals , are shorter ; because they are at some distance from the perspective plane , and the beholder . And if the house were farther off they would be still shorter , in exact proportion to their distance ; which means no more than that the house would look smaller , if it were father off . Still , however , they preserve the same direction , and are parallel like their originals ; but the lines on the side a h are smaller than their originals , and they take a different direction ; instead of being drawn parallel , like their originals , they tend to , and meet in the point of sight . - In parallel perspective therefore , there are but three sorts of lines to be considered . 1st . Those which are parallel with the ground line , and are horizontal lines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perspective plane , and are perpendicular lines in the picture . 3d , Those which are at right angles with the ground line , and when drawn , vanish in the point of sight . The length of all these lines , that 1s , how much smaller they are than their originals , depends on their distance . This is parallel perspective , and these rules comprise /z/ all that is requisite for the sketching of rectangular figures , placed parallel with the spectator . Further instructions for the drawing of circles and curves in parallel perspective , will be found in the lessons on circles , bridges , and interiors , he . In taking a view out of doors , you will be able to determine the apparent size , situation , and relative proportions of objects , with sufficient accuracy , by holding up a pencil or ruler before your eye , in a horizontal and perpendicular position , and comparing the object with this measure . If you nearly close your eyes while looking , it will facihtate the operation ; for if you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be , and see , and hold a pencil before them , you can with your finger mark exactly how much of this measure the house occupies to your eye . By looking in the same way , at a house more distant , you will see how much less of the pencil this occupies than the first ; you have only then to make this difference in their sizes when you draw them . By the same method you can form a correct judgment , how much taller one tree is than another , or than a house or other object ; how much higher one hill rises against the sky than another ; or how large a space a sheet of water occupies on your ground plane . This space for water , fields , or any level surface on the earth or ground plane , will be much less on your picture , than you would believe , till you have made the experiment , and measured it in this way . You may observe , also , that the Hues for the banks of rivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you would be disposed to draw them , if you judged merely from your eye , without comparing them with your measure , or some horizontal line . Observe that your measuring rule or pencil , must be held at the same distance through the whole sketch ; /q/ for an object which would occupy the whole at a distance of three feet , would not be equal to half of it , when held near the eye . It is easy to preserve the same distance for the measure , by means of a cord fastened to its centre and held in the mouth . Novices in sketching , are often at a loss to determine on the place for their horizon line , and think that because they see no such line in the landscape before them , they need not and can not draw one ; but it is difficult , if not impossible , to get a correct likeness without one , and it is easy to determine on its place . Suppose you were out of doors , and looking at the view 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you were on level ground , your horizon would be low ; and the horizon line must be drawn about as far from the ground line , as it is in the sketch , - wherever you draw it , on the paper , would be the place for that part of the picture , where the sky meets the earth . Then observe by holding up a pencil , or other straight stick in a horizontal position , exactly at the height of your eye , what this line passes across . The distant hill 6 , is on the right hand , and there is another hill on the left ; consequently S between them is opposite your eye , and is the place to mark the point of sight on the horizon line . The hill h rises a little above this line , and comes a little below it , - the hill d rises higher and comes farther down on the ground plane : draw them so . Then notice the cedar tree c , - two thirds of it are above the horizoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear above any line held horizontally across your eyCj ) and the root is one third below . The elm tree e being nearer the spectator , its base approaches almost to the ground line , while its top reaches far above the horizon , to the top /z/ of the picture . The horizon Hne passes near the insertion of the lowest branch . Next draw the house / ; observe where the base comes above the foot of the tree , e , the horizon line passes near the middle , just above the lower row of windows ; therefore you must draw these windows below the line , and the other row above it . Thus this line helps you to ascertain the situation of every object you wish to draw , - and the observation of the relative position of these objects enables you to determine the place of the horizon line . After a little practice , and with the help of these rules , no difficulty can be experienced in sketching any common view in parallel perspective . The spectator in this view is placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , to the point of sight , S , determine the drawing of the side m , which is at right angles with the ground line , and vanishes in the point of sight . The side / being parallel with the ground line , must be drawn parallel , according to the rules already given . Throughout the book the following references are invariable : - H , horizon hne ; G , ground line ; S , point of sight ; D , point of distance . /z/ Oblique perspective teaches the drawing of objects situated obliquely to the ground line , as when a house or other object stands with the corner towards you , like W , ( Plate 6 ) . As no side of the object W is parallel with the ground line G , no lines can be drawn parallel with it ; since as /q/ has been said in lesson 5 , original lines parallel with the ground line , are drawn parallel with it , but no others . Each of the sides makes an angle with the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be the point of sight , that being the vanishing point for such lines only as are at right angles with the ground line . They must have another vanishing point or points . These are on the horizon line , and are thus ascertained . Prepare your paper as before with a ground line G , ( Plate 7 , Figure 1 , ) horizon line H , and point of sight S. Rule a perpendicular line through the point of sight : this is called the prime vertical line . Mark on this line the point D , called the point of distance . This space from S to D , represents the distance of the spectator from the perspective plane : in other words , the distance at which you stand when taking a sketch , from the nearest object you intend to put into your picture . It may be arbitrary , but the distance here marked is a good proportion . It is rather more than twice the distance from the ground line to the horizon . If you refer to Lesson 3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the distance point . The distance D ( Plate 7 , Figure 1 ) is set off , or marked on the prime vertical line . In other cases , which will be hereafter explained , it is measured on the horizon line . Having proceeded thus far , look at the building , if you are sketching one , and estimate as well as you can ( by means of your measuring stick held in a horizontal position ) the angle which the bottom line makes with the ground line , and draw this from the ground line to the horizon G V. Where it intersects the horizon at V , is the vanishing point for this side . Draw a line from /z/ the point of distance D , to the vanishing point , making /z/ qwq If you have not the necessary instruments at hand for taking angles , you can easily obtain a right angle , by cutting a bit of card exactly square , place one side on the line D V , letting the corner touch the point D ; then the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from D to the horizon , to find the point W for the vanishing point of the second side of the building . If the object you are drawing is rectangular , the lines to determine its vanishing points must form a right angle . The point W is the vanishing point for the second side of the house , and for all lines , as doors , or windows on it . Determine the nearest point in the base of the house , as A , by your eye , or measure . The line A V for the first side of the house is already drawn . Draw the other side to its vanishing point , making A W. Raise the perpendicular A B I to the height the house appears to be . A little practice will enable you to judge of this height , with sufficient accuracy for all the purposes of sketching . Compare it with the objects in the view , or compare the height with the length . Draw C and F from the point 1 to their vanishing points V and W. Draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eye and the aid of your measuring sticks Observe that windows and other parts , diminish in apparent size as they are drawn nearer the vanishing . /q/ point . This rule applies also to the vanishing side , in ) aralel perspective , viz. the windows , doors , he . of that side which vanishes in the point of sight . The eye is generally sufficiently correct to judge of this proportion ; but the lessons in drawing from a ground plan will very much assist the scholar , who after having studied them , will be in possession of the principle upon which they are diminished , and can apply it with ease to any case , without making all the measurements required in drawing from a ground plan . The point of the roof E , which in the original , is exactly over the centre of that side , must in the drawing be ) laced a little beyond ; because that half which is farthest from the spectator , appears smaller than the other . Further directions for drawing roofs will be given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the roof vanishes at V , because it is parallel with the bottom line of the house ; and so would all the lines for the doors and windows , parallel with the base line . These are omitted , in order that the figure may not be too complicated . If there are several buildings in the view you wish to take , some standing parallel , others oblique , you need not be puzzled by this circumstance , but regard them as so many different sketches . Thus , Plate 7 , Figure 2 , N O P are three houses standing in different positions , O is parallel , N and P oblique . Having drawn the ground line , horizon line , point of ight , prinfie vertical line , through it and the point of distance ; draw the parallel house O , the end q vanishing in the point of sigit , because it is at right angles with the ground line . * The house N must he two vanishing points of its own , ( R and g , on the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found , as already directed . /z/ in the house above , figure 1 , and the lines for the lop , the roof , and the doors or windows , must all be ruled to these vanishing points ; for these lines are in the original , parallel with the base line of the house , and lines which are parallel , if they vanish , have the same vanishing point . Having found the vanishing point for one side , nothing is easier than to draw all parallel lines on that side to this point . You can not fail of getting them right by this rule ; whereas if you trust to your eye alone , it would be scarcely possible that your drawing should be correct . The house P standing obliquely , must also have its own vanishing points , found as already directed , by means of the distance point D on the vertical line , and making the complement of a right angle of both sides . These points are V for the side T , that for the side P extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore the paper must be larger than the picture , and the horizon line extended far enough beyond the boundary of the picture , to receive the vanishing points . The side which makes the smallest angle with the ground line , is that whose vanishing point will be farthest from the point of sight . If it makes a very small angle , that is , stand nearly square , this vanishing point will be very remote , and the lines of that side will be almost parallel . In this case , the vanishing point for the other side will be very near to the point of sight , and vanish more suddenly . You will see less of this side , or rather the representation of it , will take up less space in the drawing than the other . This can be easily proved ty drawing houses with various degrees of obliquity , according to the foregoing rules ; which will be very useful practice . /q/ /z/ If you desire great accuracy in your view , or have occasion to draw from description , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called taking the ichnography of objects . First make a scale or measurement , divided into equal parts , in which inches , or parts of inches are taken for feet or other dimensions . As A , ( Plate 8 ) which is a scale of 40 feet , or other measures . Adhere to your scale in all your measurements for the same picture . Draw the ground line , horizon line , vertical line , and point of sight . Measure the distance at which the spectator is sup posed to stand from the perspective plane , and set it off in this instance , on the horizon line , from S. The point D thus ascertained is the distance point . Its use will presently appear . It is necessary to keep in mind , what has already been explained of the perspective plane , viz. that it is imaginary , and represented by the paper on which you draw , that it is a transparent plane held up before the eye , at some distance , on which you delineate the objects beyond , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each part or point is precisely where the rays of light pass through it , in their passage from the object to the eye . Though not visiible as straight lines , these rays actually move in straight lines , and form an image of the picture in the eye , where , small as this image is , the relative proportions of every part are exactly preserved . It is desirable for one who is learning perspective , to know something of the theory of vision , and a few hours /z/ Study of any treatise on optics , with a plate of the eye , would be sufficient for the acquisition of all the knowledge requisite . The objects to be drawn are always beyond the perspective plane , that is , this plane is between these objects and the eye ; the nearest point coming just up to the plane , and the place where this nearest object comes , is the place for the ground line . All this has been repeatedly said , but it is necessary to call it to mind , and render the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully understood . If the objects to be drawn are beyond the perspective plane , they may be at different distances , and it has been already explained , that the lines of light coming from the object to the eye form an angle , the size of which depends on the size of the object , and its distance from the eye . The drawing of it is also affected by the distance of the perspective plane : see Lesson 3 . Now if you make the object of the same size and distance from the eye , and put the perspective plane in the same place as the original , ( that is , the same proportion , measuring by a scale , ) you will obtain the same angle as the original makes , and this angle will intersect the perspective plane precisely as the original angle would a pane of glass , at the given distance from the eye . The use of a ground plan is to give these proportions and angles , with perfect accuracy , and of course to enable you to obtain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be the case , that you can not place yourself at a convenient distance from the object you wish most to include in your sketch ; but you may imagine yourself there . With a ground plan you can select any distance , which the situation of the objects warrants ; and if you adhere to your points of distance , sight , &ic.; and your /q/ measurements , the drawing will always be in good per spective . Having fixed the distance point on the horizon line D , you proceed to draw a plan of the object . Let B ( Plate 8 ) represent the ground floor of a house , measured accurately by your scale , and placed at the same distance from the ground line as the original . Carry up , or as it is expressed technically , produce the two lines N O and K J , till they intersect the ground line . These lines are at right angles with the ground line , and therefore vanish in the point of sight . From F and I , the points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight , making I S and F S ; I S is the true representation of I O and F S of F J. Measure the distance at which the house stands from the ground line , viz. from K to F , and set this off on the ground line from the point of intersection F to M , and then the actual size of that side , and set it off to L , M L being equal to K J ; fram the paints M and L draw two lines , meeting in the point of distance D , making the angle M D L , which angle is precisely the same that two rays of light would make , proceeding from an object of the same dimensions as that in the plan , and at the same distance from the eye and the perspective plane . The space F K influencing the size of the angle precisely in the same degree , when transferred to the ground line at F M , as it would do in the original . Suppose a perspective plane , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same distance beyond it , that B is now placed before the perspective plane in Plate 8 . Let the eye be stationed in front , just as high above the ground line , as S the point of sight is , and at the same distance from the perspective plane , that D is from S. Two threads from the side K J , carried in straight lines to the eye , as rays of light /z/ come , would form this same angle at M D L , and would pass through , or intersect the perspective plane in their passage to the eye , exactly at the points h and a . These are the points required , and give the apparent size on the perspective plane , of that side which is at right angles with the ground line , and vanishes in the point of sight . h is the point which corresponds to K , rule h d parallel with the ground line , which represents N K. Then from the other point cf , rule a c , which answers to O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b c d being the true drawing of K J N O. From the points d b and a raise perpendicular lines for the sides or walls of the house . In order to ascertain the apparent height , raise a perpendicular from the point I , this is the point at which the line O N , when produced , intersects the ground line ; for could the house be moved up to the perspective plane , it would touch it at I F. Measure on this perpendicular , by means of your scale , the actual height of the house ( of which it is presumed you have on your plan an exact description ) set this off , from I to u , from u rule u S , which intersects the perpendicular d e , at e , this gives the apparent height . - You ascertain by this process precisely how much the house diminishes , in consequence of its distance N I from the perspective plane . Rule ef parallel with d b , because these lines are in the original parallel with the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with b a , has the same vanishing point . The perpendicular from c , which would complete the four walls of the house , is not drawn , because it is not seen . The height of the roof is set off from u to v. Draw w at the true angle , viz. making the same angle with the line e / as in the original . Draw i ; S ; where it intersects at x is the apparent height for the roof . The /q/ point y , which , in the original is the centre of that side , appears a little beyond , in the perspective representation , because the half of this side which is farthest off looks smallest . To ascertain the precise place , divide M L exactly in halves at z , rule a line from z to the distance point D. Where this intersects at g raise a perpendicular till it intersects the line a ? y at y ; this gives the place y for the centre . For h a correspond with M L , and g with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or farther off , you would proceed as above ; only remember to produce the two lines which are at right angles with the ground line , ( as O N and J K , ) till they touch the ground line , and rule them to the point of sight . Set off the distance F K , whatever it mav be on the " - round line , as F M ; and from M set off the true measurement of the side at right angles , viz. K J. This is the side which vanishes in the point of sight , and therefore is next the point of sight . If the plan B were on the other side of the point of sight , then ONI would be laid down or measured off on the ground hne , as F M L are now . This figure is a sufficient rule for the drawing of any rectangular building , placed parallel or square before you , let the dimensions and distance be what they may ; provided these are accurately laid down on the ground plan . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , in oblique perspective , by a ground plan , you first prepare your paper with the ground line , horizon line , point of sight , /z/ and prime vertical line through it , and the distance point , set off on the vertical line from the point of sight , as in Lesson 6 . Leave space enough below the ground line to draw your plan , of the same dimensions , position and distance as the original : see Plate 9 , O. Obtain the vanishing points A and B by means of parallels ruled from the distance point D , on the vertical hne to the horizon , D B being parallel with d b , and D A with d a . Produce the lines which mark the four sides of the house , d b , be , c a , ad , till they intersect the ground line . At the points of Intersection efg h , rule lines to the vanishing points . A is the vanishing point for the line a d g , and therefore for c b h , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind the rule , viz. parallel lines if they vanish , have the same vanishing point , fd b and e a c are parallel and vanish at B ; therefore make e B and/B . The intersection of these lines on the perspective plane , make the figure i j k I , which is the perspective representation of a d b c m the plan : because , these points of intersection on the perspective plane are the same which would be made by the rays of light coming from the points in the original to the eye , provided the dimensions and position correspond to those in the plate , as has been shown in Lesson 7 . From the points kj I , raise perpendiculars for the sides or walls of the house . Ascertain their height by the following method : Rule perpendicular hues from the points of intersection , with the ground line g and / . If you look back to Lesson 7 you will find you did the same thing , and the reason is there given , excepting that there you ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been said in a former lesson , oblique perspective is twice as much /q/ work as parallel , because both sides have a vanishing point . On these perpendiculars raised from g and/ , measure by means of your scale , the actual height from the ground line . Thus if the side a c is thirty feet , and the height of the house forty , make fm and g m one third more than a c . Rule the lines m B and m A ; they intersect on the perpendicular k , giving the top of the wall for each side . " The point of the roof n is exactly over the centre of the house O , in the ground plan ; to fmd which , rule diagonals across the perspective representation of the floor of the house , making i k and i j . These lines cross at the centre o which represents O in the plan. - j-  From raise a perpendicular o n . Produce m to P , which is the height of the roof : rule from this to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n is the point of the roof , rule lines from n to the corners of the house . If the roof is not pointed , rule the lines for the ridge to their vanishing points . In the original , they are parallel with the top and bottom lines of the house , and therefore vanish at A and B. If much accuracy is required , measure the space to be cut off from the peak on the line m P , and by ruling from this to the vanishing point , you get the precise place for the ridge . * The line m g ' 9 not drawn all the way , but only at its commencement , at VI . n is not carried beyond S , as these lines come so near those for the nearest window . t By producing the lines 5 7 and G 8 ( Plate 9 ) to the ground line , and ruling them to their vanishing points , as you have done the outside lines ad , dh , &c.,; you will find the centre as truly as by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last method is more simple . /z/ Divisions for the doors and windows are ascertained , as may be seen from the Plate , by being marked on the ground plan , produced to the ground line , and then ruled to the vanishing point A. From the points at which these lines intersect the base lines of the house , raise perpendiculars , which will give the perspective place for all the windows and doors . For as the sides of the house recede , the farther part looks smaller than the nearer , and you perceive that the method given shows this gradation with exactness . When the ground plan is so large that the lines to be produced to the ground line ( as c h produced to h ) would extend beyond the paper , and thus be inconvenient to draw , the following method of making divisions , or measuring lines may be used ; and perhaps it will be thought preferable in every case where there is a ground plan . If you wish to find J ( the representation of the point b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) which is the point vvhere the house terminates , lay your ruler from the distance point D , on the prime vertical line , to the point h in the plan , making D h , - You perceive that it cuts the line k B ( which is the base line of the house ) at J , precisely as the line from A to A , and answers the purpose of measurement equally well . And if you lay the ruler from D to you get the point Z , previously obtained by ruling a line from e to B. In the same manner places for the v'indows may all be found , by ruling lines from D to 1 2 3 4 , which lines are not drawn on the Plate , to avoid confusion . The angles are the same in the last method as the first , and both correspond exactly with the angles , which rays of light proceeding from the house to the eye ( of the given dimensions and position ) would make : see Lesson 15. /q/ A third method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of the above , but which dispenses with the necessity of a ground plan , will be given in the Lesson on bridges . /z/ In giving the true slant to all the lines of a roof , no two of which are drawn parallel , a knowledge of the rules of perspective is requisite ; and this knowledge can not be acquired without some labour , especially when the pupil is learning from books ; the constant reference to plates , making the process far more tedious than when he has the assistance of a teacher . It is the object of this work to enable those who can not obtain the services of a teacher , to acquire a knowledge of perspective by their own efforts . But it is not pretended , that this mode of learning , can be made as easy , or even as intelhgible , as the instructions of a competent teacher . The rules now to be explained , belong more properly to a future lesson , but their application to the drawing of roofs is here given , because this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Plate 7 , figure I is a house B , standing obliquely 5 V and W are the vanishing points for the two sides . It will be remembered , that a perpendicular line ruled through the point of sight , as D S in this figure , is called the prime vertical line . It represents a ray of light coming straight from the perspective plane through the eye , and marks the point of sight as S , and also the distance of the spectator as D , and it is plain that the /z/ farther off the spectator is placed from the perspective plane , the longer would be this ray . The learner must not be puzzled by the situation of this line in the plate . U a spectator were actually placed before a window , a ray of light coming straight from the object exactly opposite his eye , through the perspective plane or window would be a horizontal line , and not perpendicular , as it is in this figure . But such a line can not be expressed on a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angle under which an object is seen , and the distance of the perspective plane , can be measured with the same accuracy when they are laid down on a flat sheet ; as is done in Plate 7. and this is all that is requisite to obtain a correct perspective representation . This subject , however , will be further illustrated in Lesson 15 . To return to the prime vertical line , figure 1 , Plate 7 . This ray coming straight to the eye , on which the distance D is marked , is sometimes called the visual ray . A similar line drawn through the vanishing points of oblique planes , ( viz. sides of houses , he . standing obliquely , ) as W in this figure , is the vertical line , or visual ray for these points , called also the radial or vanishing line . Therefore the line drawn through W , viz. W X , and through V , figure 2 , Plate 7 , are the radials , or vanishing lines of these same points W and V. The roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a prism , whose base vanishes at W and V , and its sides must vanish at some point on the radial of one or the other of these points , as X. This point is determined by the angle of the slant line with the base , as E I , which being produced , till it intersects the radial , gives the vanishing point X , to which point draw the other line for the roof , as g ; for g being parallel to E I , must if it vanishes , have the same vanishing point . All lines have /q/ a vanishing point , except such as lie on planes , parallel V/ith the perspective plane or the ground line . The wall of a house which stands parallel or square before vou , is a plane parallel with the perspective plane , or the window through which you look ; but the roof is not , it makes an angle more or less large , with the perspective plane , consequently any lines lying on it , ( viz. the outline of the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the directions given above . In figure 2 , Plate 7 , the roof of the house P vanishes at y , ( see figure 1 , ) on the the radial of its own vanishing point V , that is , on the perpendicular drawn through V , and the point y is ascertained by producing the line of the roof r to y . In the house O , standing parallel , the peak of the roof is ascertained , by finding first , the centre of the ground floor of the house . This ground floor is an oblong rectangular figure , the perspective appearance of which may be found without the aid of a ground plan . From the point p , rule a line to the point of sight . which will give the end not seen , parallel with g , and through the upper corner of q rule a horizontal line , and you have the floor of the house , as it would appear if the house were transparent , and you could see it all . To find the centre , rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersection , as you see by the figure , is the apparent centre . Raise a perpendicular from this centre to the height required , and you have the point b for the roof : let the slant lines meet here , and cut them off by ridge poles if required . The roof of the house N ( Plate 7 ) is obtained in the same way , by drawing a radial through R , one of its vanishing points . In Plate 8 the house is parallel , and the vanishing point for the roof is found on the prime vertical line , because the base of this roof , viz. the line /S vanishes in S , the point of sight . /z/ A circle may be circumscribed by a square , and if this square is put into perspective , the circle can be drawn within this perspective representation , or if accuracy is required , the square can be divided , and the corresponding parts in the representation will be a sufficient guide for drawing the circle . The larger the circle is , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be the divisions of the square , put into perspective . All this , however , is only putting into perspective , horizontal , perpendicular , or oblique lines : the rules for doing which , have been fully given . But as some difficulty may be found in applying these rules to new cases , the following illustrations are offered . Plate 10 , figure 1 , represents a circle put into parallel perspective . H , horizon line ; S , point of sight ; D , point of distance ; G , ground line , sometimes in works on perspective , called intersection line , because it is the line formed by the intersection of the perspective plane with the ground plane . The circle C , in the ground plan is circumscribed by a square , diagonals and diameters are ruled . The points at which the diagonals strike the circumference , make equal divisions on the circumference , though not on the square . Through these points are ruled lines , called sines and cosines . Put all these lines into perspective , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case in parallel perspective . The lines A B F E L must be produced till they intersect the ground line : from the points of intersection /q/ rule them to the point of sight , because they are lines at right angles with the ground line . Measure the distance of the circle from the ground line , viz. M L , set it off on the ground line , making M N , then the distances of the points K and I , which are equal to O P ; rule lines from N O P to the point of distance D. The object of these lines is merely to mark the perspective size of the square , by means of the points of their intersection with the line M S , drawn to the point of sight ; therefore at these points of intersection , rule the lines u v t parallel with the ground line , corresponding to A L , V K , W I in the ground plan . Rule diagonals through the points r t u iv , representing the diagonals in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation , which correspond with those in the plan , and draw the circle through them . You perceive that the perspective circle is divided into parts like that in the plan , but in the former they are not equal , although they are so in the latter . The upper half of the circle is smaller than the lower half ; this circumstance gives the figure a peculiar character , which you will , with a little practice , be able to draw with sufficient accuracy for the common purposes of sketching , without all these lines , or even without any , although you never could arrive at this , except by a knowledge of these rules . Portions of circles , as arches , doors standing more or less open , ( which describe portions of circles on the floor , by the movement which opens them , ) are drawn on the same principles , and will be further illustrated . Plate 10 , figure 2 represents two circles in oblique perspective . The ground plan is first made ; then the vanishing points are obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which in obhque perspective is /z/ always set off on the prime vertical line , ) draw D B parallel with c W , and D A parallel with c q . The points of intersection with the horizon line , give A B vanishing points for the sides c W and c q . The lines c K L M W are produced till they intersect the ground line , also c e N / 5 , and from these points of intersection lines are ruled to each vanishing point . O A P c to B , and R T m V to A , and the circle is drawn through the points of intersection as in the original . As the hne W , if produced to the ground line would extend beyond the picture , the rule is laid from D to W , which gives the point y with equal correctness as by , the other method , as has been shown in Plate 9 : see D b and D a. /z/ It is nearly impossible , with the most accurate eye , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arches correctly , without a knowledge of the rules of perspective ; more especially if the bridge stand obliquely . The following method with the figure is given , to to illustrate the application of the rules of perspective to the drawing of bridges ; though somewhat elaborate , it has been made as clear and simple as the subject permits . If this figure be studied faithfully , and the rules appHed to new designs made by the pupil , he will meet /q/ with no difficulty afterwards , in sketching with sufficient accuracy , without the necessity of laying down all the lines and points in these figures . With the principles of perspective familiar to his mind , he will never make any glaring mistakes , even in the most rapid and careless sketching ; while without this , his most laboured productions would be wanting in truth of expression . To this , every one acquainted with perspective , will readily assent . Plate 11 represents abridge in oblique perspective . Having drawn the horizon and ground hues , points of sight and distance , rule the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , which you presume the bridge to make . Of this you will judge by holding up your measuring stick . From F draw F D , F is one vanishing point ; draw also the line D L at right angles with D F , which gives L for the other vanishing point , ( as it is oblique , both sides vanish . ) The angle F D L is a right angle . Select by your eye , with the aid of the measuring stick ( described in Lesson 5 ) the nearest point in the bridge J , raise the perpendicular J i to the height at which the bridge appears to be ; which you can determine , by observing how near it comes to the horizon : then rule i F for the top , because the top and bottom are parallel , and must have the same vanishing point . Draw a line through the point J , parallel with the ground line ; set off on this hne the measurement of the size of each arch . This you may ascertain by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bridge . Perfect accuracy is not requisite , but the spaces for each arch must be equal . You thus get the points J K M N. Measure the space F D , ( with compasses if you have them , ) and lay it on the horizon from F , by describing the arc , making the point R. /z/ This is called the radius* of its own vanishing point , and answers the same purpose as the distance point ( set off on the horizon from the point of sight , in parallel perspective ) for taking measurements . Rule lines from the points K M N to R , they intersect the line for the bottom of the bridge J F , at the points O P Q , and give the apparent size of each arch , viz. the place for the foot of each arch . Then divide the space for each arch , viz. J K , K M , and M N equally , and rule lines from these divisions to R. These lines are not ruled in the figure ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the places for the centre of each arch . Raise perpendiculars from t u v to the top line of the bridge : draw a guide line A F for the tops of the arches , which line being parallel with the top and bottom of the bridge , has the same vanishing point . Draw a straight line from each of the points W X Y , to the points J O P Q , like the dotted lines in the plate . Describe arches on these lines . The arches may be drawn witiiout these straight lines , but you will not probably do them as well . Draw the hne J L , which gives the other side of the bridge , L is the vanishing point for all Hnes parallel to . J L ; therefore rule O L , P L , and Q L , which lines represent the under part of the arch , as it leaves the water , and are , as you will perceive by a little observation , parallel in the original bridge , with the end J L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not their size . Each arch , as you observe in * A radius is the semidiameter of a circle , that is , a straight line drawn any where from the centre to the circumference . If you take F ( Plate 11 ) for a centre , and putting one foot of the compasses in this point , and extending the other to D for the size , and draw a circle ; F R would be a radius of this circle , as well as F D , and it is called the radius of its own vanishing point , because it is the radius of a circle , of which this vanishing point F is the centre , and F D the radius . /z/ I'he figure , shows more of the under part , as it recedes farther from R its distance point . Measure by the scale you have used for your other measurements , on the line J , the space J Z , being the real size for the end of the bridge , then take the radius of the vanishing point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you- did for the other side , ) and lay it on the horizon line to r , making L r . Rule Zr , the point of its intersection at a is the size of this end ; raise a perpendicular at a , rule i L parallel with a J , in the original , therefore , having the same vanishing point ; from b rule b F , the top of the further side parallel with i F , for , as the whole bridge is below the horizon , you see this line , otherwise you could not . Rule a iin6 from a to the vanishing point F , this line represents the base line of the further side of the bridge , parallel in the original with J F , therefore having the same vanishing point . The lines for the under part of the arches , viz. O L , PL , Q L , are already drawn . F intersects these at / j k , giving the perspective finishing of the arches . Observe the dotted lines continued from I m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the bridge were transparent , and they could be seen . Unless you understood the true drawing of the whole of each arch , you could not draw correctly the part which is visible , and is represented by the darker line , for each differs from the other , and to draw them all alike ( as is frequently done , even in sketches otherwise correct , ) is bad perspective . Plate 12 represents a bridge in parallel perspective , which is easier than oblique . The exterior arches are all alike , and are therefore drawn without the aid of any other rule than that of making them equal ; lines ruled from the foot of each arch to the point of sight , give the direction of the lines for the under part of the arch , A B C E. These lines are at right angles with the ground line , and vanish at /z/ the point of sight : draw a line at the foot of the bridge parallel with the ground line , passing through the foot of each arch as it leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each arch , making the points F M N O , from these rule lines to the distance point D , viz. F D , M D , N D , and O D , cutting the base line of the arches at P Q R T. This gives the size for the under part of each arch , and also for the end T. Draw arches like those in the figure . The dotted lines show the true drawing for the arches , on the further side , ( if they could be seen . ) In this way , you get the true appearance of the under part of each arch of a bridge , situate as this is , with regard to the point of sight . As may be seen by the figure , each arch differs from the other in the drawing , although in the original they are ahke. /z/ Interiors are drawn in perspective by the rules already given , for they must consist of lines either parallel , at right angles , or oblique to the ground line. * After having drawn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , observe what lines are parallel with the ground line , and draw them parallel , their place being determined by their distance from the ground line . Note what lines are at right angles with it , whether they are on the walls of a room or any articles of furniture ; the vanishing point for all such lines is the point of sight . * Except lines inclined to the ground plane , for which see Lesson /z/ /q/ If any objects or lines are oblique , you will determine their vanishing points on the horizon line , by their angle of obliquity , that is , by the angle they make with the ground line . To illustrate this , see Plate 13 . Make the requisite lines and points . D S being equal to D S , because you need a distance point for each side . In parallel perspective , you may set off the distance point on the horizon line , on either side of the point of sight . Determine the size of the room by a scale , or your eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. Measure the length of the sides which are at right angles with you , and lay it down on the ground line , making E F for one side and I J for the other 5 draw E S and I S. Draw F D , and also J D , ( not drawn in the Plate . ) These give the points of intersection K and M , which show the apparent length of the sides . Draw N S and O S for the top lines of these sides ; draw the line K M parallel with the ground line ; raise perpendiculars from the points K and M till they strike O S and N S ; draw P Q , thus you get the back wall of the room P Q K M. The lines for the top and bottom of the windows , with the bars which are parallel , go to the point of sight . The dimensions of the windows are marked on the ground line . R T for the first ; U I for the second : rule lines from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at these raise perpendiculars , which gives the space for each window , u v being the smallest , because it is the most distant ; mark the length of the windows on the boundary line of the side N E , and rule the lines X S and y S , also the lines for the window bars , vanishing at the point of sight . Divide the space RT and U I exactly in halves , and rule to D for the middle line of the window : " smaller divisions are made in the /z/ same way , but are not drawn on this figure , lest it should be confused . The same rule also answers for pictures or pannels , on the walls of a room . On the opposite side of the room is a door . Mark its dimensions and place on the ground line a U , and rule to D2 , mark the top at d , and rule to S , getting efg h ; this is the door frame . The door stands open . A door in opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle , of which the hinge is the centre , and the bottom of the door a radius or semidiameter . Open a door quite back to the wall , and you will find that it describes a semicircle ; open it less , and the bottom of the door makes an angle ( more or less large according to the opening ) with the sill of the door , which remains stationary while you are moving the door . When you have ascertained this angle ; in other words , when you have opened the door as wide as you wish , you have only to draw the door in your sketch at the same angle , by drawing a line through the hinge g parallel with the ground line , and letting the line for the door make with it the angle required . Produce this to the horizon line to obtain the vanishing point ; thus g 3 produced , gives 4 for the vanishing point . Draw a line from / to 4 for the top ; that being parallel with the bottom , must have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , is no longer a plane at right angles with the ground line , as it would be if shut , and as the wall of that side of the room is , but it becomes a plane standing obliquely to the ground line , and therefore has its own vanishing point , viz. 4 , as already shown . In order to obtain accurately the point 3 , from which the perpendicular 3 9 is raised to finish the outline of the door , you must keep in mind , that the door in opening , describes a semicircle , g h s the radius . This circle , or a quarter of it , must be put into perspective /q/ which is very easy , since this is only to put a square in perspective . Lines drawn from D , passing through the points g and h to the ground , give the dimensions of the radius ; they are identical with the space for the door , viz. the very radius in question . Draw a line from U to S , which gives one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contained , while g h already drawn , is the other . The figure in which a quarter of a circle may be comprised , is a square , one fourth less than the square by which the whole circle may be circumscribed : see Plate 10 , where each circle is divided into four squares . Having drawn the line U S , draw a line through h , and another through g , both parallel with the ground line , and intersecting U S at 5 and 6 . The square is then complete 6 g . Describe within it the quarter circle from h to 5 , ( which you can do , by inspecting Plate 10 , figure 1 , without making any more lines , ) and where the line for the bottom of the door strikes the edge of the circle , as at 3 , raise the perpendicular till it intersect ( at 9 ) the line for the top of the door . The two doors in the back side of the room are also open . Their vanishing points are found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 , and 2 at 4. /z/ If you wish to put furniture , &; c. into your picture , this also must be drawn according to the rules already given , as will be further illustrated . Keep in mind /z/ what has been taught with regard to the vanishing points for parallel and for oblique objects ; and remember that for every oblique object , whether doors , tables , chairs , he , you must have distinct vanishing points , which are all found on the horizon line , except in cases where the planes are elevated above , or depressed below the parallel of the ground plane , for which instructions will be hereafter given . You must first determine what rule the object you are drawing requires , by observing whether it is parallel or oblique ; elevated or depressed . When this is done , the difficulty vanishes , and you can not fail in applying the rule , if you have become familiar with its use . Very great practice is necessary to insure facility . Accustom yourself to regard the different aspects or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be viewed as composed of planes , perpendicular , horizontal or oblique . The floor on which the four feet rest , is one plane , the seat is another , parallel with the former . The back is another plane at right angles with the seat , or perhaps oblique to it . The four sides reaching from the seat to the floor , where the cross pieces are placed , are four upright planes , at right angles with each other : for if the chair were boxed up from the floor to the seat , this box would form the four planes or sides . Thus in a chair , you have only horizontal , perpendicular , or oblique planes to put into perspective , which , it is presumed , you can now do . It may be well to mention , that in oblique perspective , the distance point is ahvays marked on the prime vertical line , viz. that drawn perpendicularly , through the point of sight ; and it is from this point that angles are taken , and parallels ruled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective . Plate 14 represents several articles of furniture which afford further illustrations of the rules already explained . /q/ The chair A is in parallel perspective , and the lines vanish at S , the point of sight ; as will be seen by laying a ruler from them to this point . The boxes B and C , and also the footstool E , are parallel . The chair F is oblique : vanishing points N and M. It will be found that d and the lines parallel with it , vanish at INI , and that A , and its parallels vanish at N. The table T is oblique , vanishing points V and W. The opening of the lid of the box C , is determined on the same principle as the opening of doors . The lid in opening describes the arc of a circle , of which e a is the radius , the hinge being the centre . Put this " circle into perspective by means of a square . The circle being put into perspective shows w4'iere to draw e i , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not understand the principle , you would be likely to make the line for the lid , e i of the same length as e a , it being so in the original ; but in the perspective representation , you observe , that no radius which may be drawn in this circle is of the exact length of e for even the continuation of that line , as e n must be shorter than e a , because that half of the circle is farther from you , than the half in which the radius e a lies , and consequently must appear smaller . Neither can the line m for the opening of the other end of the lid , be drawn parallel with z , for it is the corresponding radius to e i , of a circle nearer than the circle e , and must therefore look lar2 ; er than that : m must also differ from r , in the same proportion , and for the same reason , as e from e i . The two circles or rather parts of circles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thorough knowledge of the rules of perspective , in order to draw the most common or simple object with truth . Having once understood the principle on which an open box is drawn , you will , without the necessity of /z/ putting circles into perspective , be able to draw the parallel sides of the opening with correctness . You will observe that the two circles partly described on the plate , for the purpose of determining the opening of the box , are circles standing upright on the ground plane , and not laying on it , as are the circles in Plate 10 . They are situate like picture frames on the walls of a room . The wheels of a carriage are drawn in the same way ; each included in a square , put into perspective , according to its position , ( whether parallel or oblique , ) and its distance from the ground line . The spokes are so many radii , not one of which you could draw correctly , without an acquaintance with the rules . As you have learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames , ho. , or lying on the ground plane , as the floor of a house : ( see Plates 8 and 9 , ) you will have no difficulty in drawing the squares in which to describe your circles , whatever may be their position . After having gone through this book , you will , it is presumed , be able to understand more elaborate works on perspective , in which you will find a greater variety of cases . Another method of obtaining the line m , for the second side of the lid of the box C , will be given in the explanation of Plate 16. /z/ Lines and planes which are not parallel with the ground plane , but have an elevation above , or depression below it , find their vanishing points above or below the /q/ horizon line , determined by the angle of their elevation or depression . A book lying flat on a table , and a house on level ground , are parallel with the ground jjJane , whether placed obliquely or parallel with the ground line : but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one end elevated , slanting sides , as roofs of houses , desks , prisms , or lines laying on them are inchned to the ground plane , and their vanishing points are found on the vertical hne of the vanishing point of their base , either above or below the horizon . The directions for drawing roofs in Lesson 9 , contain the rules required for the drawing of planes and lines oblique to the ground plane ; but it is thought that a further illustration of the subject is needful . In Plate 15 , the base hne of the row of houses A makes an angle of with the ground plane . This row also stands obliquely to the ground line , and the angle of its obhquity is 31* . This angle is taken from the distance point D , by the line D V ; V is the vanishing point for a line laying on the ground plane , and inclined to the ground line , at an angle of 3 P. Thus if the row of houses A stood on level ground , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V. Draw the radial or vertical line of the vanishing point V , which is ( as has been shown in the instructions for drawing roofs ) a perpendicular line drawn through this point . Now you may mark on this radial , from V , the degree of elevation you determine on for the houses , as W : or if you would be exact , you can measure it by an angle , after the following manner . Take the space V D and set it off on the horizon line from V , making the point y ; this is the radius of the vanishing point V. From i/ as a centre , make the true angle of elevation which the row has , in this case /z/ 20* . Where It strikes the radial of V , viz. at W , is the vanishing point of the houses A. And all lines parallel with B W , as the roof , windows , and the street , vanish at W. You will seldom find it necessary to take angles . Draw a line from the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliquity , you judge right , and then make a point as W , directly over the vanishing point , at the elevation you choose . Make all parallel lines vanish at W ; this will be sufficient for the common purposes of sketching . The row of houses C is in parallel perspective , and stands at right angles with the ground hne , therefore the vanishing point is on the prime vertical line . The angle of its elevation is The distance S D being laid on the horizon line to X , the angle J X S gives J for the vanishing point . The row M is parallel , and has an angle of depression below the horizon . The distance S D transferred to the horizon line at Z , gives the angle S Z P. P is the vanishing point for all lines parallel with the base line O P. The row K is level and parallel , and vanishes at the point of sight . Plate 16 , figure 4 represents an inclined plane . A is a desk standing parallel . The drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the point of sight S. But as the plane A is elevated at an angle of its vanishing point is at P , and the sides b and c are ruled to P. If you wish to determine the size of the desk by measurement , set the real dimensions of the side a on the line h , and from h rule to the distance point D. * The line from V to W is the tangent of this angle . A tangent is a line drawn from the point where a radius touches the circumference , at right angles with this radius , and measures the angle . W V is the tangent of the angle W yW. /q/ Where this intersects at d is the apparent size of this side , because it is parallel with the ground plane . But in order to measure the inclined plane A , you must take another distance point , because you have another vanishing point . Draw a horizontal line through P , ( not entirely drawn in the figure , to prevent confusion , but should be drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the horizon line for the inclined plane A. On this new horizon set your distance , viz. the space from P to D , making R. P R being equal to P D. R is the distance or measuring point for all lines vanishing at P. Lay a rule from h ( the true measurement , on the ground line for the desk ) to R , it intersects at T. This is the apparent size of the desk at this elevation , and which if laid flat and parallel with the drawer , would be of just the same size as the drawer ; for the space from P to R is the radius of the vanishing point P , set off on its own horizon . Rule the fine T r parallel with i w , to finish the desk . Unless you have a perfect acquaintance with these rules , you perceive that you would be very unlikely to draw the desk correctly , even if it were before your eyes . Were the desk a little more or less open , that is , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , the line T r could not be drawn as it is now ; whereas , with the present elevation , if it were not drawn precisely as it now is , it would not belong to the bottom part of the desk . The measurement h n s the same for the drawer and for the desk : but for the drawer , the distance point is fixed on the horizon line D ; and for the plane A , on a point ( R ) as much above that , as P is above the horizon . Plate 16 , figure 3 is a desk elevated at an angle of 15 , and placed obliquely to the ground line . V and W are the vanishing points for the two sides of the /z/ part which stands level . X is the vanishing point for the sides k and / , which are elevated . S being the point of sight for the desk figure 3 . D above it is the distance point on the prime vertical line , whence angles are taken . Make V u @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of the side o of the desk , which is level ; and the point above it Z , the measuring point for the elevated part of the desk . Lines 12 3 are parallel , and vanish at W ; 4 5 are parallel , and vanish at V ; and k and I are parallel and elevated above the ground plane , and vanish atX ; lines from Q to M give the point 6 , and from Q to Z the point 7 . The open box C , Plate 14 , affords an example of lines depressed below the ground plane . After one side of the lid , as e i is found by means of the circle , the other as m , maybe ascertained by finding the vanishing point of the first . As the box stands parallel , this must be on the prime vertical line helow the point of sight , because it is an example of depression , and not of elevation . Produce i e till it intersect the prime vertical line below the point of siglit , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . Rule a line from the point y through the edge or hinge , till it . intersect the line / , and it will give the line m with the same exactness as the circle does , and with less trouble . For i e and m g are parallel in the original , therefore must have the same vanishing point , which point you ascertain by producing i e to the prime vertical line at y . The lid of the box is a plane not parallel with the ground plane , as the bottom is , nor perpendicular to it as the sides are , nor parallel with the perspective plane , as the front and back are ; but it is inclined to the ground plane , and also to the perspective plane , having an angle of depression below the ground plane . /q/ The base or edge of this inclined plane , ( viz. the line e g , at which it touches the top of the box , where the hinge is , ) is parallel with the ground plane , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 therefore the vanishing point for the inclined lines e i and m g must be sought on the prime vertical line , that being the vanishing line for all planes at right angles with the ground line , as this end of the box is . If the box stood obliquely as the desk , ( in Plate 16 , figure 3 , ) this point would be sought on the radial of the vanishing point of its own plane , and below the horizon line . If you have any doubt whether any plane ( as the lid of the box C , Plate 14 ) is depressed below or elevated above the ground plane , and therefore , whether its vanishing point must be sought above or below the horizon line , you have only to observe whether the bottom or the top of the plane is farthest from you ; if the top , as the upper line of the roof of a house , or of a desk ( like T r and 1 7 , figures 3 and 4 , Plate 16 ) recedes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the receding part which looks smallest , and the lines of course converge to produce this diminution . But if the bottom is the receding part , ( as the line e in the box C , Plate 14 , ) then the vanishing point is below the horizon . /z/ Plate 16 , figure 1 represents a colonade Or row of pillars , on each side the point of sight , that is , on the right andleftof the spectator . The lines which vanish go to the point of sight , therefore , it is parallel perspective . It is /z/ thought that this figure , and an inspection of Plate 11 , where the arches of a bridge , in oblique perspective , are exhibited , will be sufficient to enable the pupil to apply the rules to colonades and arches in oblique perspective . The divisions are made , and the measurements taken for a colonade viewed obliquely , in the same manner as for a bridge or a single arch of a bridge viewed obliquely . The columns appear shorter and narrower as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is divided into squares to represent the figure of a carpet , or a pavement , after the following manner . Draw lines from the divisions on the ground line to S , the point of sight . Draw the diagonal E D from the first square to the distance point . This diagonal intersects each line , showing the size of each row of squares . Draw parallel lines through the points of intersection . By this process , you find ( as appears by figure 1 , Plate 16 ) the exact proportion in which each square diminishes as it recedes from the eye . It will be easy to draw any figure ( a circle for instance ) within the square , as is done in two of the nearest squares on the figure . The diagonals of each square will give the centre , through which centre rule a line for the diameter . If it is parallel perspective , the line for the diameter is parallel with the ground line ; if oblique , it goes to its vanishing point . This diameter will show how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the more remote . If the figures are of an oval shape , you must put parallelograms into perspective , instead of squares , which you can easily accomplish by observing Plates 8 and 9 , or by the help of a ground plan . Figure 2 , Plate 1 6 , shows the manner of drawing steps in perspective . E two steps parallel , F two oblique . It is in fact only putting so many boxes , or /q/ solid rectangular objects placed one on top of another in perspective . You could easily draw one box as c , in true perspective , and why not another as h , immediately below it ? The parts E and a correspond with the tops of the boxes , as they appear seen below the horizon : see also the box B , Plate 14 . If they were above the horizon , you could not seethe tops . By this rule , in looking at an object , you may ascertain at once , whether any part of it is above the horizon , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on level ground , you can not see over the top of a house ; but when you are on a high hill , you can see over the tops of the houses on the plain below . If you are in a room you can not see the top of a piece of furniture which is higher than your head , while those articles which are lower than your eye , as a table , show their upper surfaces , occupying more or less space , ( viz. looking wider or narrower ) as they are nearer to or farther above the floor . Therefore , if in a view , the tops of houses are drawn , the horizon must be a high one , for it would be apparent to any one acquainted with perspective , that your sketch was taken from a height . The steps F , Plate 6 , figure 3 , are , as it regards their drawing , two boxes , one on the other , placed obliquely , and having their vanishing points on the horizon line at V2 and W2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true perspective drawing of objects , may be experimentally proved by the following method . Provide a large table ; this is a horizontal plane , and will represent the ground plane , viz. the earth , on which objects are situate . Station at the edge of one side of this table , a little figure to represent the spectator , or person taking the view . A /z/ Stick of four or six inches in height , with a hole in the top for the eye , vAW answer the purpose , it must be securely fastened to the table . At a suitable distance from the spectator , ( say two or three times , the height of the figure ) set up a frame like a picture frame without a glass , at right angles with the table , that is , standing upright upon it . This is to represent the perspective plane . Put a line across the perspective plane horizontally , at the same height as the eye in your figure . This line represents the horizon . The best way to fasten this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , insert pins into the frame at the proper height , and lay the line across . The weight hanging down over the pins will keep the cord tight . If you wish a higher or lower horizon , elevate or shorten the figure , and alter the pins and line accordingly ; always remembering that the line must be at the same distance from the table or ground plane as the eye . Mark the point in this horizon line directly opposite the eye , whether it be the centre of the frame , or nearer to one side than the other . This is the point of sight . It is convenient to be able to move the figure to the right or left , as this changes the point of sight , and enables you to vary your experiments . Through this point of sight pass another cord perpendicularly , and fasten it . This is the prime vertical line , passing through the point of sight . Plate 14 , H W the horizon line , and D S ? / the prime vertical line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model of a house , box , bridge , or any object , the true drawing of which you wish to ascertain ; place it behind the perspective plane , to the right or left of the point of sight , and at any distance you choose . Attach threads to the corners , and to the top and bottom of the sides next the perspective plane , which /q/ are the only parts that can be seen ; bring all these threads through the perspective plane , converging to the eye of the figure , and fasten them securely at the back . These represent rays of light in their passage from the object to the eye . It will appear that the points , at which the threads enter the perspective plane , in coming to the eye , give the same drawing which the measurements , points and angles do , in a drawing from a ground plan : provided the proportions , size , distances , &:c.; correspond . If you look through the hole designed for the eye , at the same time placing a pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceal the lines in the original object from the eye , you will find that it strikes just where the threads enter the perspective plane . Lay a ground plan of a floor of a house , or of circles , like those in Plates 8 , 9 , and 10 , on a table , behind the perspective plane , so as to have this plane between the eye and the ground plan . Substitute for the vacant frame , one with a plate of glass in it , as a perspective plane ; you can trace with a pencil on this glass , or measure with compasses , the appearance of the figures beyond . By placing your eye in the hole for the eye of the figure , you will see that the drawing is the same as that resulting from the measurements , angles , he , already given in the rules of perspective , the proportion and distances being preserved . Objects may be placed in any position , and be of any shape , and their true perspective dehneation can be ascertained by attaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the eye , after the manner detailed in the above description . - The proportions must be exactly preserved . Your figure or spectator , which is presumed to be about six feet high , affords a good scale . A complete /z/ model of a person taking a sketch , with all the objects in their true situation may thus be made . The threads attached to each , and carried to the eye , will show the angles under which every object is seen , and thus determine the true drawing . The diminishing of figures in a landscape according to their distance from the ground line , may be experimentally proved , by fastening one thread to the head , and another to the foot of each of the figures , placed at different distances on the ground plane . It will then appear how much smaller the angle is ( viz. how much nearer the threads approach each other in passing to the eye ) when the figure is far off , than when it is near . A figure of a man placed at six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be seen under a much larger angle than a similar figure twelve or twenty inches distant . It will also appear that such figures never rise above the horizon line , unless they are on elevated ground . If the spectator is sitting on the level of the ground plane , a figure standing up will rise above the horizon , or if the spectator is on a hill or the top of a building , the figure will appear below his horizon . It is evident that if a plane were extended horizontally from the eye to the verge of the horizon , every object on the ground plane , not higher than the eye , would be under this horizontal plane . /z/ The rules of perspective are not numerous or difficult to comprehend , but as they include ideas which are abstract , they should be practically applied to a variety of cases , by a course of drawing in perspective . /q/ The pupil having once made himself familiar with the principles which these rules involve , will find no difficulty in sketching with truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recourse to many of the elaborate methods described in this book . Let him riot expect , however , to arrive at this facility , by any more expeditious course than that of copying the figures in the plates , and making practical applications of the rules here given . To such it is believed , that the following brief enumeration of the rules and principles of perspective may be acceptable ; although they may be scarcely intelligible to those who have no previous acquaintance with the subject . 1 . Objects are seen by means of rays of light , proceeding from them in straight lines , and converging and entering the pupil of the eye . 2 . These rays form a cone whose apex is the eye . 3 . The true drawing of objects is at the points where these rays would intersect a perpendicular transparent plane , if such were interposed between them and the spectator . 4 . The object , the rays of light , and the eye , form a triangle or cone , whose base is the object . The size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its distance from the beholder . When similar angles are made on a flat surface , a true linear representation is obtained ; this is what perspective teaches . 5 . The distance point represents the distance of the eye from the perspective plane . Lines drawn to it , from dimensions laid down on the ground line , form /z/ the same angle as is made by the rays of light in the original . 6 . Lines parallel with the ground line in the original , are drawn parallel : They have no vanishing point . 7 . Original lines which are parallel , if they vanish , have the same vanishing point . 8 . Original lines at right angles with the ground line , have their vanishing point in the point of sight . 9 . Original lines oblique to the ground line , have their own vanishing and distance points . 10 . These points are ascertained by means of parallels drawn from the point of distance on the prime vertical line to the horizon . The intersection of these parallels with the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanishing points , transferred to the horizon line , give the distance points , or as they are also called , the measuring points . 11 . Circles and arches are drawn by means of squares , sines and cosines put into perspective , by the foregoing rules . 12 . Planes and lines on them , which are inclined to the ground plane , find their vanishing points on the radial of their own vanishing plane . The place for these vanishing points is determined by the angle of their inclination , and their measuring points , are found by the radii of their own vanishing points , and have the same level above or below the horizon as these vanishing points . /q/ /z/ Every one has observed that the higher up the sun gets , the shorter the shadows of objects become . This fact teaches , that in making the shadows of a picture , regard must be had to the position of the light , which must be the same for every object in the same picture . You must not therefore put into your view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun were not more than an hour high , and a tree or a house with a shadow no longer than it would cast , with the sun at three or four hour 's height . As light comes to us in straight lines , it is evident , that when any opaque object is in the way , it will intersect such rays as meet it in their progress . And there will be a space beyond the opaque object , which will receive no light from the luminous body , although it may receive some reflected light from surrounding objects , which will lesson the darkness of the shadow . This space of shade will bear a definite relation to the shape of the object ; but it will not always assume precisely the same shape , because the shadow may be longer or shorter , according to the height of the light , and broader or narrower , according to the position of the beholder . The first thing then to be attended to in projecting shadows , is the position of the light . If the luminous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminish as it recedes from the opaque body which casts it ; but if the opaque body is larger , then the shadow will increase in width as it recedes . There are three different positions of the sun to be attended to in sketching from nature . 1st , When it is /z/ before the perspective plane or picture ; 2d , when it is behind , and 3d , when it is in the plane of the picture . If you imagine a window or perspective plane before you , on which the objects beyond may be drawn , and the sun is beyond the window and the objects , so that its light strikes on that side of them which you do not see , then the light is said to be behind the picture , and the shadows will be thrown towards you , and will appear larger than when cast from you . 2d , If the sun is behind you , and strikes on that side of objects which you see , and the spectator is situate between the sun and the perspective plane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you will see less of the shadow , which will be cast from you , than if the sun were behind the picture . 3d , If the sun is on a line with the perspective plane ; that is , so placed , that were the perspective plane extended till it reached the sun , it would go neither before nor behind , but just through it , then the sun is in the same plane as the picture , and the shadows fall in a line parallel with the ground line . The general remarks already made , may be sufficient for the common purposes of sketching ; but further illustrations of the subject are given , for the use of such as desire to be accurate in the forms of their shadows . To understand these illustrations requires some study and attention ; they are however rendered as clear and simple as the subject permits . To obtain the precise shadow cast by a given opaque object , first determine the position of the sun , whether it is before , behind , or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or altitude , as it is technically called . In order to do this , draw a ground line , horizon line point of sight , and prime vertical line , and the object whose shadow is required , which object must be drawn in true perspective . /z/ The sun appears to be over some point of the horizon , either on your right hand or your left . You can select this point according to your judgment , but if you wish any particular place , as from the point of sight , make an angle of ( Plate 17 ) from D , the distance point on the prime vertical line , obtaining the point C. This is called the angle of the sun 's declination , through this point , C , rule a perpendicular , the sun 's place is somewhere on this perpendicular . You can fix on any height , but if you wish to do it with exactness , take the radius , that is , the distance C D , and set it off on the horizon line from C , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun 's altitude , ( in this case and the point where this angle intersects the sun 's perpendicular , as at F , is the height of the sun . Thus you can determine with precision any given altitude , and position of the sun , by means of angles from the distance and radius points . Having fixed on the point for the light , if you wish to find the exact shadow of any given object , as K , regard must be had to the perpendicular lines , or sides of the object , as a b c . C is a point on the horizon line , perpendicularly under the sun , called the seat of the light . Draw a straight line from C through the bottom of the side a , and another straight line from F the sun himself , through the top of the side a . They intersect each other at d , and thus determine this point . Then draw a line from C , passing through the bottom of the side 6 , and one from F , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives this point . Then take the bottom and top of the side c , after the same manner , which gives g , and join- * It can not be made too familiar to the pupil , that the radius of any point , is the distance of that point , ( as C , ) from the distance point , ( as D on the prime vertical line , ) set off from the vanishing point on the horizon line , as C E Plate 17. /z/ ing these points , viz. d e g , the whole figure of the shadow is determined . Now if the sun were situate lower , that is , nearer the horizon , as at L , the lines from C through the base of the perpendiculars ah c must be produced , and lines from L , the sun 's place , drawn through the tops , making hij . Observe how much farther the shadow extends when the sun is low , and also that the shape is different . This plainly illustrates the necessity of fixing a heio-ht for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced . Mathematical exactness may not always be required , but without a knowledge of these principles , you might be liable to incongruities . In this example , the sun is behind the picture , and the shadows fall towards the spectator . If the sun is before the picture , continue the perpendicular from C , ( the sun 's seat in the horizon , ) below the horizon line . Let M be the sun , ( figure 2 , Plate 17 , ) C his seat on the horizon line . Draw fines through the top and bottom of the perpendicular sides of the solid P , as before . Those from C to the bottom , and those from M to the top . The lines from the light itself always go to the top , and those from the seat of the light , to the bottom of all perpendiculars of which you seek the shadows , C m for the base m of this side , and M n for the top intersecting at O. You must also ascertain the shadow of the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fines . ) The fines for this side intersect at/ . Join p 0 , the shadow is then complete . If the sun is lower than at M , mark its place nearer the horizon line , as at R : if higher , farther from the horizon line . The shadow is obtained correctly by this mode , because the lines or angles drawn , are the same which the rays of light proceeding from the sun , at the given height and position , and arrested by the given object , would make ; and all rays within the two /q/ exterior ones drawn in the figure , are intercepted , and do not reach the ground . When the sun 's place is beyond the picture , it is truly represented by a point above the horizon line ; and when it is before the picture by a point on the other side , that is , below the horizon line . 3d , When the sun is in the plane of the picture , Plate 18 , figure 1 , draw horizontal lines through the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Intersect them by lines touching the top , and making the same angle with the horizon , as the angle of the sun 's elevation . The dotte 'd line b gives a less elevation than the dark lines , consequently a longer shadow . The opaque object A ( figure 1 , Plate 18 ) is oblique both to the horizon and the ground plane . Draw horizontal lines from the base of its perpendicular sides i and / , intersected by lines through the tops of these sides , drawn at the angle of the sun 's elevation . This gives the points g h ; from g draw a line to the lowest point in the object e , and you have the shadow . For the shadow of every other perpendicular line in the object taken in the same way , would fall within this figure . /z/ If the light proceed from a lamp or other luminous body on the earth , situate in a room or out of doors , it must be perpendicularly over some place in the ground plane . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's light by reason of his immense distance , is always supposed to be on the horizon line . Mark this point ( Plate 18 , figure 2 , C ) on the ground /z/ plane of your picture , viz. the floor or earth on which objects stand . Rule a perpendicular through it , and mark the height of the light on this perpendicular . Draw lines from the seat of the light C , on the ground plane , through the foot of the object , as the lines m n o on the solid o ; and lines from the light through the top P r S. The points of their intersection t u v mark the extent of the shadow . The only difference between this light and the light of the sun , is , that the sun is always supposed to have its seat on the horizon line ; but when the light is stationed on the earth , its seat is on the ground plane . In both cases , the seat is always perpendicularly under the luminous body . In the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position is marked below the horizon , as figure 2 , ( Plate 17 . ) This method is resorted to , because all the lines are drawn on a flat surface , as a sheet of paper ; but the sun is nevertheless supposed to be above the horizon line , although on the nearer side of it . Thus in projecting shadows , you have only to mark two points , the one perpendicularly over the other , viz. the seat of the light , either on the horizon or ground plane , and its height . From these points , rule straight lines to the top and bottom of every side of the object , remembering that those to the top of the object , must always proceed from the luminous body ; those through the bottom , from its seat . " If the object which casts the shadow is oblique , as B , figure 2 , ( Plate 18 , ) rule a horizontal line M through the seat of the light , and a line from the height of the light N , passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point where these fines intersect , is the extent * Unless the light be below the object , as when it is suspended in the air , or a room , and strikes the under part of the object , in which case , lines from the light go to the bottom and from its seat , to the top of the object . /q/ of the shadow . From this point , draw a straight hne to its extreme base , or lowest point , and this gives the exact form of the shadow , as W X. Shadows take the form of the objects on which they fall ; thus the shadow of a line on a circular object will be curved . If shadows are intercepted by objects , draw them first , as if nothing were in the way , and then raise perpendiculars from the points of interception to the top of the intercepting object , and continue the shadow across . The reflection of objects from the water is an exact image of the object reversed . Draw this image reversed from the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that part which extends over the water , will be the part reflected . ( See Plate 18 , figure 3 ; 2 being farther from the water than either 4 or 1. ) /z/ Many more illustrations of the rules of perspective might be given , which would be useful to the learner , but they would too much increase the size of this volume . It is hoped that any one , after a faithful study of what is here explained , may be able to understand more scientific treatises , and obtain from them , any additional knowledge he may require . A iew hints are added as to the finishing up of sketches . Linear perspective , which regards the drawing and outline of objects , is scarcely more important than ariel perspective , or their tinting and shading . An object must be drawn smaller and coloured fainter , in proportion to its distance . The lights should be less bright , and the shadows less strong , as they recede from the foreground . The observation and study of nature , is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . Beautiful effects of light and dispositions of shadow , may at times be seen to lend a new and indescribable charm to the landscape . These should , if possible , be secured as soon as they are observed , by sketching the scene , and putting it in the same light and shade . It is also of advantage to consult fine engravings and paintings , and when a happy composition occurs in any of these , imitate it in one of your own sketches as nearly as the difference of the subjects will permit . /q/ Let the shadows be broad and in masses , and the lights sparing , and not scattered indiscriminately . The most common fault with beginners , is to have too many lights , and these equally bright . The brightness of a light depends on the depth of the shade with which it is contrasted . White paper in the distance , shaded by a faint tint , will look remote , biit the same white in the foreground , opposed to very dark touches , will be brilliant and near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfect execution agreeable , but what is elaborate must be skilful to please . As the light comes in one direction , the picture will have a light and a shadow side . Be careful not to disturb the shadow side by introducing into it bright lights , but let the light parts of this side be of a darker tint than some of the shadows on the other . Determine on the disposition of your light and shade before you commence , and pass a tint over that part of your picture designed to be in shadow . This will secure you from leaving bright lights here , and produce breadth of effect . Objects situate between the eye and the light , look dark . The sail of a vessel , so placed , looks darker than the sky or the water . A tree in the foreground , with a similar disposition of light , may receive a deep tint , and contrasts finely with the sky and the lights which catch on the distance or nearer objects . A landscape usually looks best in a morning or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many accounts , India ink is the most suitable medium for a beginner to use in finishing up a sketch . Having disposed the light and shade , as directed above , begin with a light tint ( your pencil being well filled with the colour ) and make out the sky , doing the clouds first , let these assume generally a horizontal character . Next put in the blue sky , leaving out the hghter edges of the clouds . This you will do with more grace /z/ and freedom if the cloud is already designed . With the same light tint , pass over the mountains or any distant parts , leaving out such lights as the sun , striking on the hills , buildings or water , would produce . Cover every other part of the picture with this tint , except the brightest lights of the foreground . Then take a tint somewhat darker , and finish those parts next the most distant ; carry down this tint hke the first , over every other part of the picture , leaving out such parts only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so proceed with as many tints as you have distances . If the distant parts look too strong , pass a sponge wet with pure water , over them ; this will give them softness . When you commence , after having made the outline , wet the paper with a sponge , and press it with a cloth or blotting paper . This gives a little dampness , which makes the ink work favourably . With regard to foliage it may be observed , that the more distant it is , the less distinct and the smaller is the character of its touch . Each tree should have a touch of its own , by which its species is expressed . A hill covered with foliage is represented by a touch which resembles a set of curves with indented edges ; the more distant such foliage is , the nearer the curve approaches a horizontal character , and the closer are the lines or touches .
