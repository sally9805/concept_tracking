txt MAN is by nature an active being . He is made to labor . His whole organization , mental and physical , is that of a hard-working being . Of his mental powers we have no conception , but as certain capacities of intellectual action . His corporeal faculties are contrived for the same end , with astonishing variety of adaptation . Who can look only at the muscles of the hand , and doubt that man was made to work ? Who can be conscious of judgment , memory , and reflection , and doubt that man was made to act ? He requires rest , but it is in prder to invigorate him for new efforts ; to recruit his exhausted powers : and as if to show him , by the very nature of rest , that it is Means , not End , that form of rest , which is most essential and most grateful , sleep , is attended with the temporary suspension of the conscious and active powers . Nature is so ordered as both to require and encourage man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be satisfied without labor ; at the same time , that ample provision is made by Providence , to satisfy them , with labor . The plant springs up and grows on the spot , where the seed was cast by accident . It is fed by the moisture , which saturates the earth or is held suspended in the air ; and it brings with it a sufficient covering to protect its delicate internal structure . It toils not , neither doth it spin , for clothing or food . But man is so created , that , let his wants be as simple as they will , he must labor to supply them . If , as is siiDDpsed to have been the case in primitive Ml SfW ; s ages , he lives upon acorns and water , he must draw the water from the spring ; and in many places he must dig a well in the soil ; and he must gather the acorns from beneath the oak , and lay up a store of them for winter . He must , in most climates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins ; must construct some rude shelter ; prepare some kind of bed , and keep up a fire . In short , it is well known , that those tribes of our race , which are the least advanced in civilization , and whose wants are the fewest , have to labor the hardest for their support ; but at the same time it is equally true , that in the most civilized countries , by far the greatest amount and variety of work are done ; so that the improvement , which takes place in the condition of man , consists , not in diminishing the amount of labor performed , but in enabling men to work more , or more nth , in the same time . A horde of savages will pass a week in the most laborious kinds of hunting ; following the chase day alter day ; their women , if in company with them , their tents and their infant children on their backs ; and all be worn down by fatigue and famine ; and in the end . iaps kill a bullalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably , on an average , have kept more steadily at work , in their various trades and occupations , but with much less exhaustion , and the products of their industry would have- been vastly greater ; or what is the same thing , iwir-ii more work would have been done . in improvement , he would be enabled by li ; irtt awl machinery , to satisfy the primary wants of life , with less labor ; and this may be thought to show , at first glai , ' , iot intended to be a working being ; be- cau- ; : nces in improvement , less work ' ! p'Cju'm-d to get a mere livelihood . But here we see a curious provision of nature . In proportion as our bare natural wants are satisfied , artificial wants , or civilized wants , show tin mselves . And in the very highest state of improvement , it requires as constant an exertion to satisfy the new wants , which grow out of the habits and tastes of civilized life , as rt requires in savage life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing . In other words , the innate desire of improving our condition keeps us all in a state of want . We can not be so well off , that we do not feel obliged to work , either to ensure the continuance of what we now have , or to increase it . The man , whose honest industry just gives him a competence , exerts himself , that he may have something against a rainy day ; and how often do we not hear an affectionate father say , he is determined to spare no pains , to work in season and out of season , in order that his children may enjoy advantages denied to himself . In this way , it is pretty plain , that Man , whether viewed in his primitive and savage state , or in a highly improved condition , is a working being . It is his destiny , the law of his nature , to labor . He is made for it , and he can not live without it ; and the Apostle Paul summed up the matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " if any would not work , neither should he eat . " It is a good test of principles like these , to bring them to the standard of general approbation or disapprobation . There are , in all countries , too many persons , who from mistaken ideas of the nature of happiness , or other less reputable causes , pass their time in idleness , or in indolent pleasures ; but I believe no state of society ever existed , in which the energy and capacity of labor were not commended and admired , or in which a taste for indolent pleasure was commended or admired , by the intelligent part of the community . When we read the lives of distinguished men , in any department , we find them almost always celebrated , for the amount of labor they could perform . Demosthenes , Julius Caesar , Henry the Fourth of France , Lord Bacon , Sir Isaac Newton , Franklin , Washington , Napoleon , different as they were in their intellectual and moral qualities , were all renowned as hard-workers . We read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march ; how early they rose , how late they watched ; how many hours thsy spent in the field , in the cabinet , in the court ; how many secretaries they kept employed ; in short , how hurcl they worked . But who ever heard of its being said of a man in commendation , that he could sleep fifteen hours out of the twenty-four , that he could eat six meals a day , and that he never got tired of his easy-chair ? It would he curious to estimate , by any sale standard , the amount in value of the work of all kinds done in a community . This , of course , can not be done , with any great accuracy . The pursuits of men are so various , and the different kinds of labor performed are so different in the value of their products , that it is scarcely possible to bring the aggregate to any scale of calculation . If we would form a kind of general judgment of the value of the labor of ; i community , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we behold , on the face of the earth ; all the h nil dings of every kind in town and country ; all the vehicles employed on the land and water ; the roads , the canals , the wharlV , the bridges ; all the property of all kinds hich is accumulated throughout the world ; and all that is consumed , from day to day and from hour to hour , to support those who live upon it , all this i the product of labor ; and a proportionate share is the product of the labor of each generation . It is plain that this comprehensive view is one , that would admit of beiuii carried out , into an infinity of details , which would furnish the materials rather for a folio than a lecture . Hut as it is the tate of the present day , to bring every thin : : down lo the standard of liirnre I will HIVM a calculation , which will enable us to judge of the value of the labor rmed in the community , in which we live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of round numbers , at 600,000 souls . I presume it will not he thought extravagant to me , that one in six performs every d ; i day 's work , equivalent . ' we allow nothing for the labor of five out of six , ( ami this certainly will cover the cases of those too ig and loo old to do any work , or who can do only a part of a clay 's work , ) and if we also allow nothing for those whose time is worth more than that of the day-laborer , we may safely assume , that the sixth person performs daily a vigorous efficient day 's work of body or mind , by hand or with tools , or partly with each , and that this day 's work is worth one dollar . This will give us one hundred thousand dollars a day , as the value of the work done in the State of Massachusetts . I have no doubt that it is a good deal more , for this would be very little more , than it costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for accumulation , a good deal of which is constantly taking place . It will , however , show sufficiently the great amount of the labor done in this State , to take it as coming up , at least , to one hundred thousand dollars per day . I have thus far laid down two propositions : First , that man is , by his nature , a working being ; and second , that the daily value of his work , estimated merely in money , is immensely great , in any civilized community . I have made these preliminary remarks , as an introduction to some observations , which I propose to submit in the remainder of this lecture , on the subject of " a working men 's party . " Towards the organization of such a party , steps have been taken in various parts of the country . It is probable , that a great diversity of views exists , among those who have occupied themselves upon the subject , in different places . This circumstance , and the novelty of the subject in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have led me to think , that we might pass an hour profitably , in its contemplation . I will observe upon it , in the first place , then , that if , as I have endeavored to show , man is by nature a working being , it would follow , that a working men 's party is founded , in the very principles of our nature . Most parties may be considered as artificial in their very essence ; many are local , temporary , and personal . What will the Adams , or the Jackson , or the Clay party be , a hundred years hence ? What are they now , in nine-tenths of the habitable globe ? Mere non-entities . But the working men 's party , however organized , is one that must subsist , in every civilized country to the end of time . In other words , its first principles are laid in our natures . It secondly follows , from what I have remarked above , that the working men 's party concerns a vast amount of property , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect it differs from all controversies and parties , which end merely in speculation , or which end in the personal advancement and gratification of a few individuals . The next question , that presents itself , is , what is the general object of a working men 's party ? I do not now mean , what are the immediate steps , which such a party proposes to take ; but what is the main object and end , which it would secure . To this I suppose I may safely answer , that it is not to carry this or that political election ; not to elevate this or that candidate for office , but to promote the prosperity and welfare of working men ; that is , to secure to every man disposed to work , the greatest freedom in the choice of his pursuit , the greatest encouragement ' and aid in pursuing it , the greatest security in enjoying its fruits : in other words to make work , in the greatest possible degree , produce happiness . The next inquiry seems to be , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer here is obvious , nil who do the work ; or are actually willing and desirous to do it , and prevented only by absolute inahilitv , such as sickness or natural infirmity . Let us try the correctness of this view , by seeing , uhoni it would exclude and whom it would include . This rule , in the first place , would exclude all bad men ; that is , those , who may work indeed , but who work for im- ; 1 and unlawful ends . This is a very important distinction , and , if practically applied and vigorously enforced , it would make the working men 's party the purest society , that ever led since the time of the primitive christians . It is grcaily to be feared , that scarce any of tl : , that divide the nliiriently jealous on this point ; and for the natural reason , that it does not lie in the very nature of the parties . Thus , at the polls , the vote of one man is as good as the vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote of the temperate man counts but one . For this rea- son , the mere party politician , if he can secure the vote , is apt not to be very inquisitive about the temperance of the voter . He may even prefer the intemperate to the temperate ; for to persuade the temperate man to vote with him , he must give him a good reason ; the other will do it for a good drink . But the true principles of the working men 's party require , not merely that a man should work , but that he should work in an honest way and for a lawful object . The man , who makes counterfeit money , probably works harder than the honest engraver , who prepares the bills , for those authorized by law to issue them . But he would be repelled with scorn , if he presented himself as a member of the working men 's party . The thief , who passes his life and gains a wretched precarious subsistence , by midnight trespasses on his neighbour 's grounds ; by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile ; by wrenching bars and bolts at night , or picking pockets in a crowd , probably works harder , ( taking uncertainty and anxiety into the calculation , and adding , as the usual consequence , four or five years in the compulsory service of the State , ) than the average of men pursuing honest industry , even of the most laborious kind : but this hard work would not entitle him to be regarded as a member of the working men 's party . If it be inquired , who is to be the judge , what kind of work is not only no title , but an absolute disqualification for admission to the working men 's party , on the score of dishonesty , we answer , that for all practical purposes , this must be left to the law of the land . It is true , that under cover and within the pale of the law , a man may do things morally dishonest , and such as ought to shut him out of the party . But experience has shown , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals ; and so long as a man does nothing , which the law forbids , in a country where the people make the laws , he ought , if not otherwise disqualified , to be admitted as a member of the party . There ought , however , perhaps to be two exceptions to this /z/ principle ; one , the case of those , who pursue habitually a course of life , which , though contrary to law , is not usually punished by the law , such as persons habitually intemperate . It is plain , that these men ought not to be allowed to act with the party , because they would always be liable , by a very slight temptation , to be made to act in a manner hostile to its interests ; and because they are habitually in a state of incapacity to do any intelligent and rational act . The other exception ought to be of men , who take advantage of the law to subserve their own selfish and malignant passions . This is done in various ways , but I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of the creditor , not merely to seize the property of the debtor , in payment of the debt ; but to consider every case of inability as a case of fraudulent concealment , and to punish it as such , by imprisonment . This is often done in a way to inflict the greatest possible pain ; and in cases , in which not only no advantage but additional cost accrues to the creditor . A man who thus takes the advantage of the law , to wreak upon others his malignant passions , ought to be excluded , not merely from the working men 's part , but from the pale of civilized society . : iet question regards idlers . If we exclude from the orking IIMMI 'S party all dishonest and immoral workers , what are . ; the case of the idlers ? In general terms , the ansu ijiirsiinn i plain , they too must be excluded . With what HP f reason can an idler ask to be admitted into the MI of working r , ; en , unless h ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I : . to he an idler . In fact , tin away his time , aets against the la of his nature , as a working being . It must be ob ( 1 , however , thru there are feu eases , where u man i. - merely nn idler . In almost every en . - , - , hr must 1 ' lin.i ; t , ueh as a spendthrift , a gamester , or an intemperate person ; a bad son , a had husband , and a bad father . If there are any persons dependent ou him for support ; if he idles away the time , which he ought to devote to maintaining his wife , or his /z/ children , or his aged parents , he then becomes a robber ; a man that steals the bread out of the mouths of his own family , and the clothes off their backs ; and he is as much more criminal , than the common highway robber , who takes the stranger 's purse on the turnpike , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond those of common justice between man and man . But I suppose it would not require much argument to show , that the person , who leaves to want those whom he ought to support , even if he does not pass his idle hours in any criminal pursuit , has no right to call himself a working man . There is a third class of men , whose case deserves consideration , and who are commonly called busy-bodies . They are as different from real working men , as light is from darkness . They can not be called idlers , for they are never at rest ; nor yet workers , for they pursue no honest creditable employment . So long as they are merely busy-bodies , and are prompted in their officious , fluttering , unproductive activity , by no bad motive and no malignant passion , they can not , perhaps , be excluded from the party , though they have really no claim to be admitted into it . But here , too , the case of a mere busy-body scarce ever occurs . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tattling mischief-maker , a propagator , too frequently an inventor , of slander . He repeats at one fireside , with additions , what he heard at another , under the implied obligation of confidence ; he is commonly in the front rank of all uneasy and inconsiderate movements , safely entrenched behind his neighbor , whom he pushes into trouble ; and he is very fond of writing anonymous libels in the newspapers , on men of whom he knows nothing . Such men , and there are too many of them , ought to be excluded from the party . Shutting out then , all who work dishonestly , and all who do not work at all , and admitting the busy-bodies with great caution , the working men 's party comprehends all those , by whom the work of the community is really done ; all those who , by any kind of honest industry , employ the talent , which their Creator has given them . All these form one great party , one /z/ comprehensive society , and this by the very law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed in the beginning , a working being ; but he is a being formed to work in society ; and if the matter be carefully analysed , it will be found , that civilization , that is , the bringing men out of a savage into a cultivated state , consists in multiplying the number of pursuits and occupations : so that the most perfect society is one , where the largest number of persons are prosperously employed , in the greatest variety of ways . In such a society , men help each other , instead of standing in each other 's way . The farther this division of labor is carried , the more persons must unite harmoniously , to effect the common ends . The larger the number , on which each depends , the larger the number to which each is useful . This union of different kinds of workmen in one harmonious society seems to be laid , in the very structure and organization of man . Man is a being , consisting of a body and a soul . These words are soon uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty truth , which is embraced in them , scarce ever engages our attention . But man is composed of body and soul . What is body ? It is material substance ; it is clay , dust , ashes . Look at it , as you tread it unorganized beneath your feet ; contemplate it , when , after having been organized and animated , it is , by a process of corruption , returning ; to its original Mate . Matter , in its appearances to us , is an unorganized , inanimate , cold , dull , and barren thin : : . What it is in its essence , no one but the Being who created it knows . The human mind can conrrive of it only as the absolute negation of qualities . And e say , that the body of man is formed of the clay or dut ; beeausu these substances seem to us to make tin- nearc-i approach to the total privation of all the properties of intelle.rt . Surh is the body of man . What is his soult Its essence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its qualities are angelic , divine . It is soul , which thinks , reasons , invents , remembers , hopes , and loves . It is the soul which lives ; for when the soul departs from the body , all its vital powers cease ; and it is dead ; and what is the body then ? /z/ Now the fact , to which I wish to call your attention , is , that these two elements , one of which is akin to the poorest dust on which we tread , and the other of which is of the nature of angelic and even of divine intelligence , are , in every human being , without exception , brought into a most intimate and perfect union . We can conceive , that it might have been different . God could have created matter by itself and mind by itself . We believe in the existence of incorporeal beings of a nature higher than man ; and we behold beneath us in brutes , plants , and stones , various orders of material nature , rising , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as we suppose ) possessing mind . We can imagine a world so constituted , that all the intellect would have been by itself , pure and disembodied ; and all the material substance by itself unmixed with mind ; and acted upon by mind , as inferior beings are supposed to be acted upon by angels . But in constituting our race , it pleased the Creator to bring the two elements into the closest union ; to take the body from the dust ; the soul from the highest heaven ; and mould them into one . The consequence is , that the humblest laborer , who works with his hands , possesses within him a soul , endowed with precisely the same faculties , as those which in Franklin , in Newton , or Shakspeare , have been the light and the wonder of the world ; and on the other hand , the most gifted and etherial genius , whose mind has fathomed the depths of the heavens and comprehended the whole circle of truth , is enclosed in a body , subject to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose life knows no alternation but labor and rest , appetite and indulgence . Did it stop here , it would be merely an astonishing fact in the constitution of our natures ; but it does not stop here . In consequence of the union of the two principles in the human frame , every act , that a man performs , requires the agency both of body and mind . His mind can not see , but thrqugh the optic eye-glass ; nor hear till the drum of his ear is affected by the vibrations of the air . If he would speak , he puts in action /z/ the complex machinery of the vocal organs ; if he writes he employs the muscular system of the hands ; nor can he even perform the operations of pure thought , except in a healthy state of the body . A fit of the tooth-ache , proceeding from the irritation of a nerve , about as big as a cambric-thread , is enough to drive an understanding , capable of instructing the world , to the verge of insanity . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor so simple , so mechanical , which does not require the exercise of perception , reflection , memory , and judgment ; the same intellectual powers , by which the highest truths of science have been discovered and illustrated . The degree to which any particular action , ( or series of actions united into a pursuit ) shall exercise the intellectual powers , on the one hand , or the mechanical powers on the other , of course , depends on the nature of that action . The slave whose life from childhood to the grave is passed in the field ; the New Zealander who goes to war , when he is hungry , devours his prisoners , and leads a life of cannibal debauch till he has consumed them all , and then goes to war again ; the Greenlander , who warms himself with the fragments of wrecks and drift-wood thrown upon the glaciers , and feeds himself with blubber ; seem all , to lead lives , requiring but little intellectual action ; and yet , as I have remarked , a careful reflection would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who does not , every moment of his lifo , call into exercise , though in an humble degree , all the powers of the mind . In like manner , the philosopher who shuts himself up in his cell and leads a contemplative existence , among books or instruments of science , seems to have no occasion to employ , in their ordinary exercise , many of the rnparitics of his nature for physical action ; although h- : ils ' , ns I hnvr observed , can not act or even think , but with tin- nid of his body . This is unquestionably true . The same Creator who made man a mixed being , composed of body and soul ; having designed him for such a world as that in which we live ; has so constituted the world and man who inhabits it , as to afford /z/ scope for great variety of occupations , pursuits , and conditions , arising from the tastes , characters , habits , virtues and even vices of men and communities . For the same reason , that though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet no two men probably are exactly the same in respect to either ; so provision has been made , by the author of our being , for an infinity of pursuits and employments , calling out , in degrees as various , the peculiar powers of both principles . But I have already endeavored to show , that there is no pursuit and no action that does not require the united operation of both ; and this of itself is a broad natural foundation for the union into one interest of all , in the same community , who are employed in honest work of any kind ; viz. that , however various their occupations , they are all working with the same instruments ; the organs of the body and the powers of the mind . But we may go a step farther , to remark the beautiful process , by which Providence has so interlaced and wrought up together the pursuits , interests , and wants of our nature , that the philosopher , whose home seems less on earth than among the stars , requires for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various branches of mechanical industry ; and in return , furnishes the most important facilities to the humblest branches of manual labor . Let us take as a single instance , that of astronomical science . It may be safely said , that the wonderful discoveries of modern astronomy and the philosophical system depending upon them , could not have existed , but for the telescope . The want of the telescope kept astronomical science in its infancy among the ancients . Although Pythagoras , one of the earliest Greek philosophers , by a fortunate exercise of sagacity , conceived the elements of the Copernican system , yet we find no general and practical improvement resulting from it . It was only from the period of the discoveries , made by the telescope , that the science advanced , with sure and rapid progress . Now the astronomer does not make telescopes . I presume it would be impossible for a person , who employed in the abstract study of astronomical /z/ science time enough to comprehend its profound investigations , to learn and practise the trade of making glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one or two eminent observers , that they have superintended the cutting and polishing of the glasses of their own telescopes . But I presume if there never had been a telescope , till some , scientific astronomer had learned to mix , melt , and mould glass , such a thing would never have been heard of . It is not less true , that those employed in making the glass could not , in the nature of things , be expected to acquire the scientific knowledge , requisite for carrying on those arduous calculations , applied to bring into a system , the discoveries made by the magnifying power of the telescope . I might extend the same remark to the other materials , of which a telescope consists . It can not be used to any purpose of nice observation , without being very carefully mounted , on a frame of strong metal ; which demands the united labors of the mathematical instrument-maker , and the brass-founder . Here then , in taking but one single step out of the philosopher 's observatory , we find he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors of the mathematical instrument-maker ; the brass-founder ; the glass-polisher ; a : : d . Maker of glass , four trades . * He must also have an astronomical clock , and it would be easy to count up half a dozen trades , which directlv or indirectly are connected in making a lock . But let us iro bark to the olijcct glass of the telescope . A glass factory requires a building and furnaces . The man who makes the glass , does not make the building . But the stone and brick ma-on. the carpenter , and the blacksmith must furnish th- greater part of the labor and skill , required to construct the building . When it is built , a large quantity of fuel , wood and wood-coal , or mineral coal of various kinds , or all together mu ' -t be jnoviderl ; and thru the materials of which the glass is made and with which it is colored , some of which are furnished by commerce from different and distant regions , /z/ and must be brought in ships across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these trades , without immediately finding that it connects itself with numerous others . Take for instance , the mason who builds the furnace . He does not make his own bricks , nor burn his own lime ; in common cases , the . bricks come from one place , the lime from another , the sand from another . The brick-maker does not cut down his own wood . It is carted or brought in boats to his yard . The man , who carts it does not make his own wagon ; nor does the person who brings it in boats , build his own boat . The man , who makes the wagon , does not make its tire . The blacksmith , who makes the tire , does not smelt the ore ; and the forgeman who smelts the ore , does not build his own furnace , ( and there we get back to the point whence we started , ) nor dig his own mine . The man who digs the mine , does not make the pickaxe with which he digs it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man who makes the pump , did not discover the principle of atmospheric pressure , which led to purnp-making : that was done by a mathematician at Florence , experimenting in his chamber , on a glass tube . And here we come back again to our glass ; and to an instance of the close connexion of scientific research with practical art . It is plain , that this enumeration might be pursued till every art and every science were shown to run into every other . No one can doubt this , who will go over the subject in his own mind , beginning with any one of the processes of mining and working metals , of ship-building , and navigation , and the other branches of art and industry , pursued in civilized communities . If then , on the one hand , the astronomer depends for his telescope on the ultimate product of so many arts ; in return , his observations are the basis of an astronomical system and of calculations of the movements of the heavenly bodies , which furnish the mariner with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would no more think of sailing for India , without his Bowditch 's Practical Navigator , than he would without his compass ; and this Navigator contains tables , drawn /z/ from the highest walks of astronomical science . Every first mate of a vessel , who works a lunar observation , to ascertain the ship 's longitude , employs tables , in which the most wonderful discoveries and calculations of La Place and Newton , and Bowditch are interwoven . I mention this as but one of the cases , in which astronomical science promotes the service and convenience of common life ; and perhaps , when we consider the degree , to which the modern extension of navigation connects itself with industry in all its branches , this may be thought sufficient . I will only add , that the cheap convenience of an almanac , which enters into the comforts of every fireside in the country , could not be enjoyed , but for the labors and studies of the profoundest philosophers . Not that great learning or talent is now required to execute the astronomical calculations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for this purpose ; but because , even to perform these calculations requires the aid of tables , which have been gradually formed on the basis of the profoundest investigations of the long line of philosophers , who have devoted themselves to this branch of science . For , as we observed on the mechanical side of the illustration , it was not one trade alone , which was required to furnish the philosopher with his instrument , but a great variety ; so , on the other hand , it is not the philosopher in one department , who creates a science out of nothing . The observi : : iomer furnHies man-rials to the calculating as- tronomer , and iho calculator derives methods from the purr mathematician ; and a long succession of each for ages mut unite their labors , in a irreat result . Without the geometry of the Greeks , and tin : algebra of the Arabs , the infinitesimal analysis of Newton and Leibniiy , would never have been invented . Examples and illustrations equally instructive niiirht b ( j found in every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a cotton-mill , and contemplate it from the great water-wheel , that gives the first movement , ( and still more /z/ from the steam engine , should that be the moving power , ) who will observe the parts of the machinery , and the various processes of the fabric , till he reaches the hydrostatic press , with which it is made into a bale , and the canal or rail-road by which it is sent to market , may find every branch of trade and every department of science literally crossed , intertwined , interwoven with every other , like the woof and the warp of the article manufactured . Not a little of the spinning machinery is constructed on principles , drawn from the demonstrations of transcendental mathematics ; and the processes of bleaching and dying , now practised , are the results of the most profound researches of modern chemistry . And if this does not satisfy the inquirer , let him trace the cotton to the plantation , where it grew , in Georgia or Alabama ; the indigo to Bengal ; the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pacific Ocean ; let him consider Whitney 's cotton-gin ; Whittemore 's carding-machine ; the power-loom ; and the spinning apparatus ; and all the arts , trades , and sciences , directly or indirectly connected with these ; and I believe he will soon agree , that one might start from a yard of coarse printed cotton , which costs ten cents , and prove out of it , as out of a text , that every art and science under heaven had been concerned in its fabric . I ought here to allude also , to some of those pursuits , which require the ability to exercise , at the same time , on the part of the same individual the faculties both of the intellectual and physical nature , or which unite very high and low degrees of mental power . I have no doubt , that the talent for drawing and painting , possessed by some men to such an admirable degree , depends partly on a peculiar organic structure of the eye , and of the muscles of the hand , which gives them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in delineation . These no doubt are possessed by many individuals , who want the intellectual talent , the poetic fire , required for a great painter . On the other hand , I can conceive of a man 's possessing the invention and imagination of a painter , without the eye and the hand required to embody on the canvass the /z/ ideas and images in his mind . When the two unite , they make a Raphael or a Titian ; a Martin or an Allston . An accomplished statuary , such as Canova or Chantrey , must , on the one hand , possess a soul filled with all grand and lovely images , and have a Jiving conception of ideal beauty ; and on the other hand , he must be a good stone-cutter , and able to take a hammer and a chisel in his hand , and go to work on a block of marble , and chip it down to the lip of Apollo or the eye-lid of Venus . The architect must be practically acquainted with all the materials of building , wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the courage and skill to plant his moles against the heaving ocean , and to hang his ponderous domes and gigantic arches in the air ; while he must have taste to combine the rough and scattered blocks of the quarry into beautiful and majestic structures ; and discern clearly in his mind 's eye , before a sledge-hammer has been lifted , the elevation and proportions of the temple . The poet must know , with a schoolmaster 's precision , the weight of every word , and what vowel follows most smoothly , on what consonant ; at the same time , that his soul must be stored with images , feelings , and thoughts , beyond the power of the boldest and most glowing language , to do more than faintly shadow out . The surgeon must , at once , have a mind naturally gifted and diligently trained , to penetrate the dark recessess of organic life ; and a nerve and tact , which will enable him to piidc his knife among veins and arteries , out of sight , in the living body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lancet in his left hand , and cut into the apple of the eye . The lawyer must be able to reason from the noblest principles of human duty and the most generous feelings of human nature ; he must fully comprehend the mighty maze of the social relations ; he must carry about with him a stock of learning almost boundless ; he must be a sort of god to men and communities , who look up to him , in the hour of the dearest peril of their lives and fortunes ; and he must at the same time be conversant with a tissue of the most senseless fictions and arbitrary technology , that ever disgraced /z/ a liberal science . The merchant must be able to look at the same moment , at the markets and exchanges of distant countries and other hemispheres , and combine considerations of the political condition , the natural wants , the tastes and habits of different parts of the world ; and he must be expert at figures , understand book-keeping by double entry , and know as well how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo of specie . The general-in-chief must be capable of calculating for a twelvemonth in advance the result of a contest , in which all the power , resource , and spirit of two great empires enter and struggle , on land and by sea ; and he must have an eye , that can tell at a glance , and on the responsibility of his life , how the stone walls , and trenched meadows , the barns , and the woods , and the cross-roads of a neighborhood , will favor or resist the motions of a hundred thousand men , scattered over a space of five miles , in the fury of the advance , the storm of battle , the agony of flight , covered with smoke , dust , and blood. * It was my intention to subject the art of printing to an analysis of the trades , arts and sciences connected with it ; but 1 have not time to do it full justice , and the bare general idea need not be repeated . I will only say that , beginning with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cadmus , I mean the invention of alphabetical signs to express sounds , and proceeding to the discovery of convenient materials for writing , and the idea of written discourse ; thence to the preparation of manuscript books ; and thence to the fabric , on a large scale , of linen and cotton paper , the invention of moveable types , and the printing press , the art of engraving on metal , of stereotype printing , and of the power press , we have a series of discoveries , branching out into others in every department of human pursuit ; connecting the highest philosophical principles with the results of mere manual labor , and producing in the end , that system of diffusing and multi- /z/ plying the expression of thought , which is , perhaps , the glory of our human nature . Pliny said , that the Egyptian reed was the support , on which the immortal fame of man rested . He referred to its use , in the manufacture of paper . We may with greater justice say as much of the manufacture of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which was known to Pliny . But with all the splendor of modern discoveries and improvements in science and art , I can not but think that he , who in the morning of the world , first conceived the idea of representing sounds , by visible signs , took the most important step , in the march of improvement . This sublime conception was struck out in the infancy of mankind . The name of its author , his native country , and the time when he lived , are known only , by very uncertain tradition ; but though all the intelligence of ancient and modern times , and in the most improved countries , has been concentered into a focus , burning and blazing upon this one spot , it has never been able to reduce it to any simpler elements , nor to improve , in the slightest degree , upon the original suggestion of Cadmus . In what , I have thus far submitted to you , you will probably have remarked , that I have illustrated chiefly the connexion with each oilier of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physical principles . I have not distinctly shown the connexion of the moral principle , in all its great hranehes , with hoili . Tliis subject would well form the matter of a v , . p ; irate i ay . Bui its elementary ideas are few and plain . Tin- arts and sciences , whose connexion we have pointed out , it is plain , require for their cultivation a civilized state of society . They can not thrive in a community , which is not in a state of regular political organization , under an orderly . eminent , uniform administration of Jaws , and a general observance of the dictates of public and social morality . Farther , Mich a community can not CMM , without institutions of various kinds for elementary , professional , and moral education ; and connected with these , are required the services of a large class of individuals , employed in various ways , in the /z/ business of instruction ; from the meritorious schoolmaster , who teaches the little child its A , B , C , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty for men and nations , and the minister of divine truth , who inculcates those sanctions , by which God himself enforces the laws of reason . There must also be a class of men competent by their ability , education , and experience to engage in the duty of making and administering the law , for in a lawless society it is impossible that any improvement should be permanent . There must be another class competent to afford relief to the sick , and thus protect our frail natures , from the power of the numerous foes that assail them . It needs no words to show , that all these pursuits are in reality connected with the ordinary work of society , as directly as the mechanical trades , by which it is carried on . For instance , nothing would so seriously impair the prosperity of a community , as an unsound and uncertain administration of justice . This is the last and most fatal symptom of decline in a state . A community can bear a very considerable degree of political despotism , if justice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has no security , that the law will protect him in the enjoyment of his property ; where he can not promise himself a righteous judgment in the event of a controversy with his neighbor ; where he is not sure when he lays down at night that his slumbers are safe , there he loses the great motives to industry and probity ; credit is shaken ; enterprize disheartened , and the State declines . The profession , therefore , which is devoted to the administration of justice , renders a service to every citizen of the community , as important as to those whose immediate affairs require the aid of counsel . In a very improved and civilized community , there are also numerous individuals , who , without being employed in any of the common branches of industry or of professional pursuit , connect themselves , nevertheless , with the prosperity and happiness of the public , and fill a useful and honorable place in its /z/ service . Take for instance , a man like Sir Walter Scott , who probably never did a day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term , and who has for some years retired from the subordinate station he filled in the profession of the law , as sheriff of the county and clerk of the Court . He has written and published at least two hundred volumes of wide circulation . What a vast amount of the industry of the community is thereby put in motion ! The booksellers , printers , paper-makers , press-makers , type-makers , book-binders , leather-dressers , ink-makers , and various other artisans required to print , publish , and circulate the hundreds and thousands of volumes , of the different works , which he has written , must be almost numberless . I have not the least doubt , that , since the series of his publications began , if all whose industry , directly or remotely , has been concerned in them , not only in Great Britain , but in America , and on the Continent of Europe , could be brought together and stationed side by side , as the inhabitants of the same place , they would form a very considerahlrtmrn . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet 1 t ; ike this to bo the least of Sir Walter Scott 's de*erts . I have nothing ; of the service rendered to every - and to every individual in every class , by the writer , who beguiles of their tedioiMie*s the dull hours of life. ; who animates the principle of goodness within us , by glowing pictures of struggling virtue ; who furnishes our young men Arid women with Uu:k- , which they may rend with interest , and not their mornls poisoned : is they rend thorn . Our habits , our prineiph-N , our elinneiers , whatever may be our pursuit in life , depend very ni'irh on the nnture of our youthful pleasures , and on the modi 1 in which we lenrn to pass our leisure hoar . ho . with the blessing of Providence , has been ; ille by hi- inentid etinrt-. to present virtue in her . mid vice in her native deformity , to the rising generation , lias rendered a service to the public , greater even than his , who invented the steam engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lo . show , in a plain manner , that there is a dose and cordial union between the various pursuits and occupations , which receive the attention of men in a civilised comnumitv : That they are links of the same chain , every one of which is essential to its strength . It will follow , as a necessary consequence ; as the dictate of reason and as the law of nature ; that every man in society , whatever his pursuit , who devotes himself to it , with an honest purpose , and in the fulfilment of the social duty which Providence devolves upon him , is entitled to the good fellowship of each and every other member of the community . That all are the parts of one whole ; and that between those parts , as there is but one interest , so there should be but one feeling . Before 1 close this lecture , permit me to dwell for a short time on the principle , which I have had occasion to advance above , that the immortal element in our nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . As it is this , which makes man superior to the beasts that perish ; so it is this , which , in its moral and intellectual endowments , is the sole foundation for the only distinctions between man and man , which have any real value . This consideration shows the value of institutions for education and for the diffusion of knowledge . Jt was no magic , no miracle , which made Newton , and Franklin , and Fulton . It was the patient , judicious , long continued cultivation of powers of the understanding , eminent no doubt in degree , but not differing in kind , from those which are possessed by every individual in this assembly . Let every one then reflect , especially every person not yet passed the forming period of his life , that he carries about in his frame as in a casket , the most glorious thing , which , this side heaven , God has been pleased to create , an intelligent spirit . To describe its nature , to enumerate its faculties , to set forth what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would require the labor of a life devoted to the history of Man . It would be vain , on this occasion and in these limits , to attempt it . But let any man compare his own nature with that of a /z/ plant , of a brute beast , of an idiot , of a savage ; and then consider that it is in mind alone , and the degree to which he improves it , that he differs essentially from any of them . And let no one think he wants opportunity , encouragement , or means . I would not undervalue these , any or all of them , but compared with what the man does for himself , they are of little account . Industry , temperance , and perseverance are worth more than all the patrons , that ever lived in all the Augustan ages . It is these , that create patronage and opportunity . The cases of our Franklin and Fulton are too familiar to bear repetition . Consider diat of Sir Humphrey Davy , who died last year , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the age. * He was born at Penzance in Cornwall , one of the darkest corners of England ; his lather was a carver of wooden images for signs , and figure-heads , and chimney pieces . He himself was apprenticed to an apothecary , and made his first experiments in chemistry with his master 's phials and gallipots , aided by an old syringe , which had been r ien him , by the surgeon of a French vessel , wrecked on the LandV Knd . From the shop of the apothecary , he was transferred to the ofiiee of a surgeon ; and never appears to have had any other education , than that of a Cornish school , in his boyhood . Such was the beginning of the career of the man , who at the age of twenty-two , u ; : - N lecied , by our own countryman . Count Rmniord , ( hiin-clt a self-limirht benefactor of mankind , ) to fill the elnir of ( ' hetnistry at the Royal Institution , in London ; such wa tin- origin and cdiu ation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the earths ; in- lety lamp ; and placed himself , in a ; 3 , in the chair of the Hoyal Society of London , and at the hi ad of nf Europe . Sir Humphrey Davy 's most brilliant ditcoreriea en- etli - ted , by bi skilful application of the ( Jal- vanic Electricity , a principle , v. hoe existence had been delected , a few years before , by an Italian philosopher , from T ; . b i'Sir Himiplirry Davy vlurh follows , to tin- . - ml oftli , - lec- : ; oil I'lomthr article in the Annual Biography lor 1 : ! " /z/ noticing the contractions of a frog 's limb suspended on an iron hook , a fact which shows how near us in every direction , the most curious facts lie scattered by nature . With an apparatus , contrived by himself to collect and condense this powerful agent , Sir Humphrey succeeded in decomposing the earths and the alkalis ; and in extracting from common potash , the metal ( before unknown ) of which it consists ; possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mercury , at 50 , the appearance of polished silver and the softness of wax ; so light that it swims in water ; and so inflammable that it takes fire , when thrown on ice . These are perhaps but brilliant novelties ; though connected , no doubt , in the great chain of cause and effect , with principles of art and science , conducive to the service of man . But the invention of the safety lamp , which enables the miner to walk unharmed through an atmosphere of explosive gas , and has already saved the lives of hundreds of human beings , is a title to glory and the gratitude of his fellow men , which the most renowned destroyer of his race might envy . The counsels of such a man , in his retirement and meditation are worth listening to . I am sure you will think I bring this lecture to the best conclusion , by repeating a sentence from one of his moral works : " I envy , says he , no quality of the mind or intellect in others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if I could choose what would be most delightful , and I believe most useful to me , I should prefer A FIRM RELIGIOUS BELIEF to every other blessing .
