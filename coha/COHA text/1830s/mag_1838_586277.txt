txt To a resident in New England the very name of Indian Summer calls up so many essentially poetic images , that it is difficult to approach the subject without permitting the thoughts to run riot over the fairy scenes which that season presents ; and we marvel not that it has suggested to the muse of America some of her most brilliant effusions : for it would require no great effort of the imagination to perceive in its balmy and buoyant air a portion of that divinus ajjlatus of which the old poets spake . But it is our object at present to describe the Indian Summer in sober prose , for the benefit of those readers , both in the Old World and the New , whose good fortune it has never been to become eyewitnesses of its beauties ; and we must therefore strive , like the Cum*ean Sybil , - Magnum pectore excussisse deum- and confine ourselves as far as may be to plain matters of fact . The temperature of the last two years , owing to the proximity of Halley 's Comet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differed so materially from the average of previous observations , that the meteorological tables published during that time , supply us with no accurate data for our present investigation . It will be sufficient therefore to state in general terms , that from the end of August to the end of September , the thermometer announces a gradual and constant diminution of heat ; but that in the early part of October a strange interruption occurs to the progressive fall of the mercury , and when in the natural course of events we should be led to anticipate a still farther increase of cold , we are surprised to perceive , . that for two or three weeks successively , with a few slight exceptions , an elevation of temperature is experienced , to a degree greater in many cases than the average of the first week of September ,  - -  sometimes as great as the mean of the month of August . This seeming anomaly of Nature is not peculiar to the American continent . A brief season of heat immediately preceding the rigors of winter is observed in all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia , variously designated as " the latter " or " second summer , " the " after-heat , " the " summer-close , " and many other like terms in which the same idea is embodied , differing only with the idioms of the various languages in which they occur . In America , however , that season is marked with features so distinct from those which characterize it in other countries , as to entitle it to a separate consideration . In the Old World indeed it is accompanied // with few distinguishing phenomena , beyond the mildness and softness of the air , which from the gradually increasing obliquity of the sun 's rays at that period of the year we should so little expect to occur . But with us the " after-heat " is attended with circumstances of no common interest and beauty . In New England especially it is a rich and glorious season , in which Nature would seem struggling to withdraw attention from the decay which is stealing upon her , by the increased gorgeousness of her apparel , and the spring-like youthfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she can not otherwise conceal , by a thin veil of mild and smoky haze , which " - Softens down the hoar austerity Of rugged desolation , and fills up Anew the gaps- " which increasing infirmity has begun to reveal upon her countenance . The most peculiar characteristic of this Second Summer consists in the wonderful and beautiful change which takes place in the forest . This feature , however , though it continues throughout the whole of the Indian Summer 's brief reign , begins , strictly speaking , to develope itself at an earlier period . The first sharp frosts which occur about the latter end of September , or the beginning of October , are the agents by which this change is effected , and it is not uncommon to behold the leaves of a whole forest , with the exception of the Evergreens , passing in a single night from their natural color to every possible shade of yellow , brown and crimson . The sap becomes frozen during the night , generally by a deposite of hoar frost on the leaves , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , when , as the sun rises , the frozen sap is melted . The dense white vapor which rolls lazily away from the forest , as the morning advances , reveals the sudden change . At the withdrawing of that curtain the Oak shows its deeply lobed leaves transmuted to a pale brown , a chocolate brown , or a deep crimson , inclining to what painters term Indian red . The Birch and the Willow appear of a pale straw color , sometimes mingled with a slight tinge of brown , and sometimes retaining a mixture of the original green . The Wild Poplar  --  the Aspen-exhibits its unquiet leaves of a yellow tint , approaching occasionally to orange , and fawn color . The Elm , bright yellow , or pale brown . The Sycamore changes to a clear , bright brown . But perhaps the Maple contributes more largely to the dying glories of the forest , than any other of its children . Its broad leaves flash forth upon the sight robed in every intermediate hue , from bright orange to the deepest scarlet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paler shade of red , and the crimson leaves of the Shumach and some other trees , blend , with a fine middle tint , the Oak 's more sombre pink , and the Maple 's brilliant hues . These many colors , mixed up with the dif // ferent shades of green which the extensive family of Evergreens display , present a coup-dkeil which must be seen to be fully appreciated . On canvass it is impossible , though the attempt has frequently been made , to convey a correct idea of such a scene ; and the most glowing verbal description does not , and can not , succeed in placing it , in all its strange beauty , before the mental eye of one who has not looked upon the reality . Where the forest occupies a gently ascending slope , revealing to the eye the tops of the various trees rising above each other in almost imperceptible gradation , this display of Nature 's handy-work is beheld in the greatest perfection . The effect is still further heightened if the sun is just beginning to sink behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblique rays , passing through the differently tinted leaves , wonderfully enhance their brilliancy , and the spectator is startled at times , as the more gaudily colored trees rustle and quiver in the light wind , with the idea that the forest is on fire . This change of the leaf occurs , as we have already stated , about the latter end of September or the beginning of October . The consequent beauty of the forest continues , however , until the early part of November , though the leaves are liable to fall from the first moment that the frost has affected them , and many do indeed fall daily , especially from the more isolated trees . Where the forest is dense they are more protected from the wind , and the progress of destruction is consequently slower , but by the middle of November almost all the deciduous trees are dismantled , and stand , if we may misquote the poet , With all their fading honors thick around them . The Oak , however , is an exception . Sturdily does he resist the spoliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter is far advanced . In fact , it is not unusual to behold " the monarch of the woods " respectably clothed in a suit of sober brown as late as March or April ,  --  emblem of the decayed gentleman struggling against the blasts of adverse fortune , and supporting , almost to the last , a decent exterior . It is generally admitted that this beautiful feature of the autumn landscape is peculiar to the American continent , and several reasons are given to account for the fact . rrhe frost undoubtedly acts upon the forests in other northern countries as it does in this , inasmuch as those forests , like our own , undergo " the change of leaf . " But the European trees do not exhibit , in their change , that almost infinite and gaudy variety of tint which is so remarkable in America . In England , and probably throughout the continent of Europe , a sombre brown and yellow are the prevailing colors ; the Oak , the Chesnut , and the Beech , assuming the former tinge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a brownish yellow , after // the frost has attacked their leaves . The American forest is princi* pally indebted to the presence of the Oak and the Maple for its distinctive feature , and it is probable that these two children of the woods are of a different species from the European . The English poet who so minutely describes every change and characteristic of the varied year , makes no allusion to any other than a gloomy and sombre change of the leaf , and thus speaks of the universal brownness of the autumn in England : " But see , the fading , many-coloured woods , Shade deep'ning over shade , the country round Imbrown , a crowded umbrage , dusk and dun , Of every hue , from wan-declining green To sooty dark . It is evident that such a description would present a very incorrect idea of the American forests during the continuance of the Indian Summer . With us the brighter hues predominate ; yellow , orange , crimson , and scarlet , blend beautifully into each other , the brown merely serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harmony of color complete . Scarcely has nature become enveloped in this gorgeous winding sheet , when the other characteristics of the Indian Summer begin to develope themselves . The temperature of the atmosphere during the hours of sunshine becomes milder than it has been for weeks before . There is a balmy and voluptuous softness and stillness in the air , resembling the early days of June . There is not wind enough to shake from the trees the leaves which hang from their branches by so feeble a tenure . A thin , smoky haze floats over the whole face of nature , softening and blending distant objects , and , combined with the tints of the neighbouring forests , giv inga warmth of tone and coloring to the whole landscape . The surface of the ground also partakes of the hues of the woods . The fallen leaves , scattered about in rich profusion , as thickly as those " which strew the brooks in Valombrosa , " form , in spots where the wind which showered them down was thrown into eddies , a variegated robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun , though pale in the meridian height , at his setting is tinged with a ruby gleam , which is reflected from the windows , and which suffuses every object on which it is thrown . The moon also wears a blush as she rises , and the planets which hang in the flushing west wear a more golden aspect than is their wont . During this brief return of a genial and serene atmosphere , if a few mild nights successively occur , it is not unusual to behold the young Birch trees , which are amongst the first to yield up their leafy treasures , bursting their newly formed buds , and making a second , though fruitless , effort to clothe themselves with green . It // rarely happens , however , that more than three or four nights pass consecutively without frost , so that the young and tender leaves can only just unfold themselves and die . The first cold night breeze nips the untimely birth , and they fall upon the decaying remains of their predecessors . It would seem that the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Summer , is not altogether unknown in Europe . Thompson , in describing those phenomena which , as he says , " give the season in its latest view , " seems to allude to such a feature in the English autumn : Meantime , light shadowing all , a sober calm Fleeces unbounded ether , whose least wave Stands tremulous , uncertain where to turn The gentle current , while illumined wide The dewy skirted clouds imbibe the sun , And through their lucid veil his softened force Shed o'er the peaceful world . " From the description of the season we turn to the question , what are the causes which produce this phenomenon ? We believe that no satisfactory reason has ever been advanced to account for the existence of the Indian Summer , and until we have made further advances in Natural Science , it is to be feared that the subject must remain amongst the " res incognitm . " The most probable hypothesis which has yet been hazarded is to the following effect . It is well known that water , when passing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its latent heat . In the high northern latitudes visited by Parry and Ross it appears that the winter commences in the beginning of September , and that throughout the whole of that month the process of congelation proceeds with great activity . It is reasonable to suppose , therefore , from the immense amount of ice formed during that period , that the quantity of heat thrown into the atmosphere during the month of September must be sufficient to exert a very powerful and perceptible effect upon the temperature of the air in countries lying south of the Arctic Circle , especially as the northerly winds prevail at that season . The only objection which can be argued against such an hypothesis is drawn from the fact that heated air always has a tendency to ascend , whilst the colder and heavier air rushes in to supply its place . It is argued , therefore , that the heat arising from the forma. tion of northern ice would rise to the upper regions of the atmosphere , before it could reach the latitude of the United States . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first sight appear . Even supposing that the heat given out in the process of congelation in the north frigid zone does rise , still it is not lost , nor can it rise to any great height , because the more elevated strata of the atmo*. phere are always intensely cold ; and ere the warm air which rises // from the surface of the earth can mingle with that above it , it must part with its heat to the lower strata of air through which it passes , so that the greatest degree of heat must always remain in the middle or under currents of the atmosphere , and must therefore be capable of affecting the temperature of the countries over which it floats . But besides this there is always a tide of heated air rising from the equatorial regions , and flowing North and South . If , then , during the month of September there be a similar tide rising from the North Polar Sea , and flowing towards the equator , these tides must meet somewhere near the forty-fifth parallel of latitude ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the air above , which must cause a part at least of the heat to descend ; and this pressure of the upper strata of the atmosphere , whilst it would afford a partial solution to the increase of heat during the Indian Summer , would also account for the calmness , the softness , and the dryness of the air so prevalent at that season . In connection with the hypothesis above referred to , we may adduce another fact which will perhaps aid us in investigating the causes which produce the Indian Summer . From observations made on the thermometer in mines , it appears that there is a periodical revolution of temperature at a depth of thirty or forty feet beneath the surface of the earth ; the maximum of heat occurring about the middle of October , and the minimum about the middle of April . Earth being a bad conductor of heat , especially when it is dry , the process by which the maximum is attained at that depth must necessarily be very slow . The direct action of the sun 's rays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than four or five feet ; but the upper stratum being once warmed communicates its temperature slowly to that which lies immediately beneath it , and that to the next , and so on progressively . The upper surface of the soil is kept at a high temperature by the immediate influence of the sun , probably until the end of August , though the process of transmitting the heat from the higher to the lower strata is still going on below , and continues until the middle of October , even after the surface of the ground has become quite cool to the depth of a foot or more . During the month of September it is probable that the temperature of the soil at the surface remains stationary , or nearly so ; but after that period-that is , when the air becomes colder than the ground-there must be a gradual giving out of this accumulated heat into the atmosphere , during the month of October , and in fact until the snow and the ice prevent its further disengagement . This must , to a certain degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of the year warmer than it would be without such a counterbalancing provision of nature ; and although it is avowedly insufficient to produce all the elevation of // temperature experienced during the Indian Summer , it may still be a powerful auxiliary with other causes in producing that phenomenon . Other causes doubtless exist ; but those to which we have adverted in this paper are the most probable that we are yet acquainted with . The subject does not admit of demonstration , and in this case , perhaps , he is the most scientific who can give the keenest guess . The true origin of the season which we have attempted to describe , like that of the aboriginal race whose name it bears , will , In all likelihood , ever remain in obscurity.
