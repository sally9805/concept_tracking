txt THIs work is the report of the gentlemen named in the title page , who , it will be generally recollected , were sent by the French Government , two or three years ago , as commissioners to examine the penitentiaries of the United States . In calling it , however , their report , we do not use that term in its strictly technical sense . We do not understand the work before us to be the official report , formally made by these gentlemen to the authorities , from whom they received their commission ;  --  but a general statement , relative to their researches , addressed // to the public in Europe and America , as on a matter of great concernment to society . We regard it as an interesting and an instructive publication . It contains a great deal of information , relative to the penitentiaries of the United States , in a condensed form . This information must be new to most European readers ; and to a considerable degree not less so to all in this country but those , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this subject , have devoted their attention particularly to it . We trust that it will find a translator ; for though it was designed to he of use on the other side of the water , it deserves to be circulated here . But perhaps we have not a relish in America for any foreign commentary on our institutions , not seasoned with paltry gossip or vile scandal . Those who form their ideas of what prisons were in former times , from what they now are ,  --  even where the last reforms have not been introduced ,  --  are unacquainted with one horri. * ble chapter in the book of humanity . They do not know the images , that arose in the mind of the great poet of truth , when he spoke of the secrets of the prison house . ' Downright torture , avowedly inflicted , and ignominious and painful death , were certainly not the most terrible forms in which penal justice visited the victim of the law , in times not very remote . The attention of the philanthropist Howard was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his own notice as Sheriff of Bedford in 17*73 . The circumstance which first excited him to activity in their behalf , was seeing ,  --  some who by the verdict of juries were declared not guilty ; - some on whom the grand jury did not find such an appearance of guilt as subjected them to trial ;  --  and some whose prosecutors did not appear against them ; - after having been confined for months , dragged back to gaol and locked up again , till they should pay the fees of the gaoler and the clerk of the assize . In extending his enquiries , he not only found that these abuses existed in other countries ; but he became acquainted with other scenes of calamity of the most painful character . From the prisons he extended his observation to houses of correction , and found that both the former and the latter were full of the most crying abuses , and the most shocking evils . Of these the goal-fever and the small pox first arrested his attention , as prevailing to the destruction of multitudes , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which prisons were // kept , made them the seats of a distemper deriving its name , as it did its origin , from these retreats of vice , misery , and legal revenge miscalled justice . When Howard began his visits to the prisons , he guarded himself by keeping vinegar to his nostrils , while within their walls , and changing his clothes when he left them . In proceeding to present a general view of the distress in prisons , ' he says , there are some prisons that one can not look into , without perceiving , at the first glance at their inmates , that there is some great error in the management of them . Many , who go in healthy , are in a few months changed to emaciated dejected objects . Some are seen pining under diseases , sick and in prison , ' expiring on the floors of loathsome cells , of pestilential fevers and the confluent small pox . ' The cause of this distress was declared by Howard to be , that many prisons were scantily supplied and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were several bridewells , in which prisoners had no allowance of food at all ! In some the keeper farmed what little was allowed them , and where he engaged to supply each prisoner with one or two pennywortli of bread a day , it was sometimes reduced one half and more than one half in quantity . Although the inmates of the bridewells were nominally condemned to hard labor , out of the avails of which it was intended they should be supported , there were few of these establishments , in which any work was done or could he done . The prisoners had neither tools nor stock of any kind furnished to them ; and accordingly spent their time in sloth and debauchery . Some keepers of these houses , ' says Howard , who is our authority for these statements , who have represented to the magistrates the wants of their prisoners , and desired for them necessary food , have been silenced with these inconsiderate words , let them work or starve . When those gentlemen know the former is impossible , do they not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? * Felons were allowed in some prisons two pennyworth of bread a day , in some three halfpennyworth , in some a pennyworth , and in some none . No regard was l ) aid to the dearness of bread , and the pennyloaf sometimes weighed but seven or eight ounces . This miserable allowance was sometimes dealt out once in two days , and would be consumed // 120 Dc Beaumont and De Tocqueville at a single meal , leaving the poor wretches to starve for the residue of the two days . By the cruel system of farming , this wretched pittance was still farther reduced by the cupidity of gaolers . Many prisons had no supply of water within their walls . The prisoners , locked up in their cells , were dependent on the mercy of the gaolers , and got no more than the keeper and his servauts thought fit to hring them . In one place they were limited to three pints a day ; a scanty provision , ' exclaims Howard , for drink and cleanliness V Nor was the supply of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the degree to which the air of the English p risons was corrupted by want of ventilation , the accumulation of filth , and the existence of disease , that the clothes of Howard in his first journeys , became so offensive , by going into prisons , that he could not travel in a post-chaise , with the windows closed , and had to make his visits of mercy on horseback . The leaves of his memorandum book were so tainted , that he could not use it , without spreading it an hour or two before the fire ; and the vial of vinegar which he employed as an antidote , would become itself intolerable in a few hours . In some subterraneous dungeons , in which prisoners were confined , the floor was always very damp ; in some there was an inch or two of water ; and the straw for bedding was generally laid on the floor , without bedsteads . Some goals had neither sewers nor vaults , and in those that had them , they were frequently so neglected , as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window tax , they often stopped up the windows to escape this imposition . In many gaols and most bridewells , no allowance was made by the public for bedding , or straw . When a little was furnished , it remained unchanged for months , till corrupted and worn to dust . When , ' says Howard , 1 have complained of this to the keepers , their justification has been , the county allows no straw ; the prisoners have none but at my cost . ' What the moral condition of the gaols , at this period , was , may be estimated from the fact , that prisoners of all sorts were confined together ; debtors and felons , men and women , the novice and the vetdran . With all these , many were sentenced to the county gaols , for slight rriisdemeanors , who would have been sent to bridewell : - hut in consequence of the want of food in these houses of correction , were in pity sent to county gaols , where an allowance was made for the support of prisoners . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were confined in some of the gaols . These , says Howard , serve as sport to idle visit ants at assizes . No care is taken of them , though it is probable that , by medicines and proper regimen , some of them might be restored to their senses and usefulness in life . ' In consequence of these causes of suffering and disease , this great philanthropist came to the conclusion , that many more prisoners died of goal-fever , than by the executioner . He learned , he says , the emphatical meaning of the curse of the severe creditor , who pronounces his debtor 's doom , to rot in gaol . It seemed a kind of retributive justice that the ravages of this disease sometimes extended beyond the walls of prisons , to those whose official influence should have been successfully exerted to remove its causes . At the black assize in Oxford castle , in 1577 , ( so called from its fatal consequences ) , all who were present died within forty-eight hours ; the lord chief Baron , the Sheriff , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascribe this mortality to a disease brought into court by the prisoners . Lord Bacon says , that twice or thrice within his time , it had happened that the judges and others in attendance had been infected with diseases brought into court , by the prisoners , and had died . At the lent assizes at Taunton in 1730 , some prisoners brought the gaol disteInper into court , of which the lord chief baron Pengelly , Sir James Sheppard , sergeant , John Pigott , Esq. , sheriff , and some hundreds besides , died . In most of the English prisons ; at this period , the cruel custom prevailed , on the part of the prisoners , of extorting a gratuity from each new comer , under the name of garnish . Pay , or strip , ' says Howard , were the fatal words : ' fatal , in the literal sense of the term , for most of the poor wretches , having no money , were obliged to give up a part of their clothing , for want of which , when they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal . In 1730 , this abuse had gone to such a length , that , in order to check it , and particularly when it was carried so far as stripping those who had no Inoney , four prisoners were indicted for assault and robbery , upon a fellow-prisoner in Newgate , condemned , and executed . But the practice was not suppressed . This practice , instead of being discountenanced , was encouraged by the gaolers , who were in the habit of keeping a tap in the prison ; and found their account in the expenditure which took // place . Gaming of all kinds was carried to excess in the prisons . It was a common thing to keep the prisoners in irons , both by day and by night . This was often done from mere cruelty , often in consequence of the insecurity of the gaols , and sometimes , on purpose to extort money from the prisoners , in order to a dispensation . Prisoners were frequently obliged to walk ten or fifteen miles in irons , to their places of trial , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that numbers of both sexes would b'e shut up together for many days and nights , in one room , awaiting trial . Gaol-delivery in some counties was but once a year . What reparation , ' says Howard , can be made to a poor creature for the misery he has sufThred and the corruption of his morals by confinement in prison , near twelve months before trial , in which , perhaps , he is declared by his country , not guilty ? ' One cause why gaol-delivery took place so seldom was , in ' some places , the expense of entertaining the judges and their train ; - which in England is always done with great festivity and profusion . At hull they used to have the assize but once in seven years . Peacock , a murderer , was in prison there near three years . Before his trial , the principal witness died , and he was acquitted . Some of the gaols were private property . One of these was so much out of repair , as to render it unsafe ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the habit of securing the prisoners , by chaining them down on their hacks , to the floor , ( across which iron bars were laid , ) hy means of iron collars , with spikes around their necks , and a heavy iron bar over their legs . A benevolent magistrate made a representation of the case , illustrated with a drawing , to King George III. , who was so much affected by it , that he gave ' immediate orders for enquiry and relief . Wonien with infant children , were frequently imprisoned for debt . For want of fires in winter , the children were sometimes frozen to death . The want of firing , united with want of food , was a cause of great mortality in the winter season , in the English prisons , and in one case three prisoners were found frozen to death in one room . The coroner , who held the jury of inquest , informed Howard , that the verdict was by the visit ation of God , intentionally rendered , to save the gaoler from prosecution for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , * who had ordered an allowance not sufficient to support na* ture. // 123 These few statements will be sufficient to give the reader an idea of the state of the prisons in Great Britain , before the improvements , suggested by Howard , were commenced . In gent*ral , the condition of the prisons upon the continent of Europe , ( which were also explored by this intrepid philanthropist , ) was somewhat better than that of those in England ; but abuses similar to those which we have specified were of too frequent occurrence in them . Some of the houses of correction in Holland formed an honorable exception , and made a near approach to the wise discipline and humane strictness of the penitentiary system , as now practised . There is no reason to believe , that the prisons in America , at that time , were in a better condition than those in Europe . It is at this point , that Messrs . de Beaumont and de Toc q ueyule take up the interesting subject of their work . It was a necessary consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were little thought of , as places of protracted penal discipline . They were rather the appendages , than the instruments or justice . The halter , Botany-Bay , the pillory , the branding iron , and the lash were the enginery of justice ; and the prison was the place in which its victims were confined , till they could be brought to trial and sentenced . The prejudices of the society of Friends against capital punishment first suggested at Philadelphia , at the close of the revolutionary war , the idea of a prison so administered , that confinement might be substituted for death . The growing civilization of the age having extended its disapprobation to those barbarous corporal punishments , which partake of the character of torture , new reasons presented themselves for the reformation . It was attempted in 1786 . Laws were enacted in Pennsylvania , authorizing the substitution of solitary confinement , for some of the punishments alluded to ; and confinement with hard labor for others . There were several imperfections in the plan as first struck out . The Walnut-street prison ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal legislation of the State ,  --  was soon crowded to overflowing ; the attempted classification of criminals was found to be attended with great practical difficulties ; and the number of solitary cells , ( thirty , ) altogether insufficient . The inmates of the solitary cells were confined in idleness ; and those at labor in the work-shops were exposed to all the evils of corrupt communication . But notwithstanding // these defects , the plan of the Walnut-street prison was imitated by New-York in 1797 , and subsequently by several other States of the Union ; and acquired a reputation both in this country and Europe , arising rather from the enormity of the pre-existing abuses of which it was supposed to be a complete remedy , than from its own merit . It may be observed here , that the word Penitentiary , as applied to prisons , is not , as Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville appear to intimate , ( page 7 , ) of American origin , but was applied in England to the new establishments , erected in consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' says he , directed by a late Act of Parliament , may , under proper management , be made to answer very useful purposes. * In 1816 , the commencement of the effective and radical reform was made at Auburn in New-York ; but still with great defects in the plan . A new prison was constructed at that place , providing ampler means of seclusion , but not carrying out , to its full extent , the principle of solitary confinement , during the night . Sixty-one cells were constructed , but it was designed that each should contain two convicts , and twenty-eight lacger apartments , intended to receive from eight to twelve convicts each . Some classifications also were attempted among the prisoners . The inconveniences of this arrangement were partly felt ; and in 1819 , a new edifice was authorized to be built at Auburn , containing an additional number of cells ; but still not proceeding on the principle of perfect solitude . TWo years earlier , the State of Pennsylvania ordered the construction of two great Penitentiaries , one at Pittsburgh for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Eastern . These edifices were afterwards constructed at enormous expense , wearing the appearance of palaces rather than prisons . The former of them , from some defects in the plan of construction , has proved , according to the modern improved notions on this subject , almost an entire failure . Great delay attended the completion of the Eastern Penitentiary near Philadelphia , which is not even yet finished , according to its original plan . It went into operation , however , with a small number of convicts , in 1829 . It is organized on the principle of entire seclusion , by day and by night ; but the cells are so contrived , as to admit of the performance of labor by those confined in them . Of this peculiarity of the Phila-. delphia prison , we shall say a word or two , in the sequel . // Before the laws authorizing the erection of the Pennsylvania prisons were carried into effect , the northern wing of the Auburn prison was completed , containing eighty cells for solitary imprisonment , in which the convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . This experiment , from which much was expected by the friends of penitentiary discipline , proved fatal to many who were subjected to it . The convicts confined in these cells dropped into an evident decline , and five of them perished in the course of the year . Another became insane ; and another , at the almost certain risk of his life in falling , made an attempt to escape by rushing out of his cell , when opened to deliver his food . This experiment was considered decisive . Although the convicts , on whom it had been made , were selected by law from the most hardened criminals , twenty-six of them were pardoned , and the remainder were released from their cells during the day . Of the twenty-six pardoned , fourteen soon found their way back to the prison on new convictions . From this period , the plan of entire seclusion has been abandoned , in the prisons of New York , and that of solitary confinement by night and hard labor in the work-shops by day , has been substituted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last combination , Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville consider as an unsettled point . The commissioners of the New York Legislature , who inspected the Auburn prison in 1824 , found it in full operation . Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville appear to hesitate , whether to ascribe it to De Witt Clinton , then Governor of New York ; to Mr. Cray , at that time one of the directors of the Auburn prison , ( to whom , they observe , Judge Powars , then the superintendent of this prison ,  --  afterwards a highly respected member of Congress ,  - -  appears disposed to ascribe it , ) or to Captain Elam Lynds , whose successful administration has contributed much to the establishment of this principle ; and who is generally regarded as its author in the United States . Whoever was the contriver of the discipline , its success was immediate and complete . Being applied to all the convicts in the State of New York , the five hundred cells at Auburn were inadequate to their reception , and the prison at Sing Sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Beaumont and de Tocqueville justly remark , that the manner in which this new prison was erected , deserves to be related ; - // it seems to imply something more than mere power , or ascendency founded on physical force , or moral influence ; and would almost lead us to believe in some kind of mysterious fascination , by which guilty and conscious natures are controlled by a superior mind . Capt . Lynds , the superintendent of the Aubum prison , left that establishment in company with one hundred convicts , with whom he proceeded to the spot where the new prison was to be constructed ; and where , at that time , nothing had been done toward its erection . They were put on shore , to commence the work , before the ground had been broken , a cell of any kind built , or a wall begun . They built the first day a temporary covering of wood , which served as their place of lodging during the season . From the time of their landing in May , tilllate in the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confine the prisoners at night , there was no escape . For several years , beginning in this way , the convicts were employed at Sing Sing in building their prison , which has been constructed on the largest scale , for the reception of one thousand convicts . It is stated in the report of the Prison Discipline Society for 1827 , that at that time there had been but one attempt at revolt , in which two prisoners only were concerned , one of whom was killed . The whole building was constructed , without any other means of confinement , than the authority and system of discipline introduced by Capt . Lynds . In maintaining this authority , he was assisted by a few trusty keepers , who went with him from Auburn . With their assistance all was order , industry , silence and activity. * We can not here abstain from repeating a well known anecdote , illustrating the fearlessness of Capt . Lynds , in the discharge of his duty . One of the convicts at Sing Sing , having been subjected to punishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first opportunity . This threat coining to Capt . Lynds 's ears , he sent for this convict , received him alone in his bed chamber , and without appearing to notice any thing peculiar in his manner , directed the convict to shave him . The convict performed the operation , without any attempt at violence . When it was over , Capt . Lynds dismissed him , telling him that he had heard he had threatened his life , but that he knew he would not dare to attempt it ; and that he had sent // 1*1 for him alone and without arms , to let him see how little he feared him . Notwithstanding the experiments made at Auburn , which were considered decisive of the inexpediency of solitary confinement day and night , without labor ; and notwithstanding the success of the plan of solitary confinement by night and labor by day , the former discipline was introduced at Pittsburg in 1827 , when that great establishment was open for the reception of convicts . Owing to the defective plan of the prison , the convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their cells . The attempt at solitude of course failed ; - while the absence of labor was productive of great evils ; not the least of which was that of throwing the entire expense of the establishment on the State . The failure of this expensive prison to answer the purposes for which it was erected , somewhat chilled the public feeling in Pennsylvania with regard to penitentiary discipline . The whole subject was referred to Messrs . Charles Shaler , Edward King , and T. I. Wharton , who made their report in December , 1827 . Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville speak of this report , as one of the most important legislative documents on the prisons of America . They remark , that it has received particular attention from several publicists in Europe . In this report , the Auburn plan receives the preference over that which had been attempted at Pittsburg . This report had a powerful effect on public opinion , but was not , however , without highly respectable dissentients ,  --  and especially Mr. Roberts Vaux and Mr. Livingston , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan of entire seclusion . Mr. Livingston admits , as a general rule , the propriety of com* ) elling convicts to labor , but demands that it should be done in solitude , and that the use of the whip should be interdicted . The severity of the Auburn discipline , in this respect , has not passed without censure , among those who admit the general merits of the system . But the prosperity of this system appeared to establish its character in a practical way , against the theory of solitary labor , which had not , in 1827 , been put to the test of experiment . The public mind seemed generally satisfied with the results attained in New York , and the Auburn plan received the de . ' cided commendations of the Prison Discipline Society , in their successive annual reports . // To this society Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville justly attribute a very high degree of merit , for its persevering efforts to enlighten the public mind , on the subject of the prisons of the country . They speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of richly merited eulogy , which we take great pleasure in transcribing , as a well deserved tribute from these intelligent foreigners , to the value of labors , as unattractive and painful , as they have been zealous and persevering . After stating the amount of the funds , which have been collected and disbursed by the society , they add , one of its greatest treasures consists in the zeal of Mr. Louis Dwight , its Secretary , who , with untiring ardor , has collected all the documents , proper to enlighten the public mind on this subject ; - neglecting no journey , however laborious , in pursuit of truth ; -. - visiting prisons , whether bad or good ; - proclaiming the defects of the one and the merits of others ; - indicating reforms , that have been accomplished and those which are yet to be made . ' We are decidedly of opinion , that nothing has contributed more toward the wonderful improvement , which has taken place and is going on in the prison system of the country , than the publication of the reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Auburn plan , and its imitation in several States , the friends of entire seclusion persevered in Pennsylvania , and as we have observed above , procured the introduction , at the eastern Penitentiary , near the city of Philadelphia , of the system of solitary confinement day and night , with labor by day . The experiment made on fifty or sixty convicts , who were at first subjected to this system , proved entirely successful ; and since that period , the Legislature of Pennsylvania has ordered the erection of a large number of additional cells , within the spacious enclosure of Cherry-hill , and the removal of the Walnutstreet prison from the beautiful neighborhood in Philadelphia , in which it has long stood , an encumbrance and deformity . The other States of the Union , have generally followed the Auburn plan . The prison at Wethersfield , in Connecticut , was constructed in 1856 . This prison has been deemed , and we believe deservedly , one of the very best in the country . It has been repeatedly proposed as a model , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaumont and de Tocqueville mention it as a successful example of a prison . // administered without the rigor , prevailing in other establishments . The economy of its construction has been particularly celebrated , the expense not amounting to more than thirty thousand dollars , for a building one hundred and seventyseven feet long , forty-eight feet wide , and thirty-six feet high , and containing one hundred and thirty-six cells . The recent attempt at escape , however , seems to indicate the necessity of iron doors to the cells . A convict , it is stated in the public prints , succeeded in opening the door of his cell , by boring a hole with a hit , through the door , and applying a wire through this hole to the lock on the outside . It would seem , however , that this attempt would not have met with its partial success , but for the deafness of th' guard on duty at the time , who unhappily perished on the occasion . We presume also , that the existing unfortunate controversy , relative to the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its discipline . If so , the late disastrous occurrence will teach a salutary lesson ; as it will also establish the necessity of iron doors to the cells ; of a most vigorous enforcement of silence among the convicts , ( who , in this instance , are alleged to have had a plan of escape in agitation for two years , and who had succeeded in making pick-locks and false keys , ) and of employing none hut the most alert and active , as guards of the prisoners . It would seem to us also an easy precaution against attempts like that alluded to , to change , at short intervals , not only the station of criminals in the workshops , hut in the cells at night ; - so that the same individuals should he hut a very short time , in the immediate vicinity of each other . It must he remembered that while the vigilance of the keeper has a natural tendency to relax , by the daily strengthening sense of security ; the vigilance of the convict is an ever active principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement . Prisons on the Auburn principle , in addition to that at Wethersfield , have been constructed in Massachusetts , Maryland , Tennessee , Kentucky , Maine , Vermont , and Washington . The first of these , at Charlestown , is the only one which has fallen under our immediate inspection . It is believed to afford as favorable a specimen of the system , as any establishment of the kind in the United States . The new prison leaves scarce any thing to desire in its construction ; but better buildings for work-shops and a better enclosure are yet needed . // Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville justly comment on the happy effect , in the introduction of reforms of this kind , . of the division of the country into separate states , acting as guides or rivals to each other in improvement . The generous competition thus excited , aided by the prompt publicity , which awaits alike the merits and defects of every thing , existing or attempted , has a tendency to correct errors and propagate improvements , much more rapidly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this cause , we may reasonably look for the extension of the reformed system of prison discipline7 from the nine States , which have adopted it , to the fifteen which have not ; and lest it should be thought that tardy progress is making in the work , it must be borne in mind , that iI* is but just nine years , since the Auburn plan was definitively settled ; and that even now , the relative merits of this plan and that of solitary labor form a question not fully decided* Meantime , New Jersey , which is mentioned by Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville , as retaining all the vices of the ' ancient system , is taking measures for the construction of a new prison . New-hampshire , which , when visited by these gentlemen , had not adopted the plan of solitary confinement , has since that period made an appropriation for an additional prison building , in which that all-important end will be attained . The legislature of Georgia , probably in some state of temporary excitement , at the want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed a law to abolish it , and to restore the old punishments . This is to be regretted , as a retrograde movement in the march of reform . It is a striking instance , and perhaps we may say a natural effect , of the deranged state of public sentiment , in that great and growing State . The step will no doubt be speedily retraced ; and it will soon be a matter of equal astonishment in Georgi* , as elsewhere , that the precise period , when the penitentiary system of the other States was in the most successful operation , and attracting the admiration of the world , . should have been chosen by Georgia for its abolition ; and that some of the last convicts there sentenced , should have been Christian ministers7 exercising their sacred calling , under the authority of the Gov .. * eminent of the United States , and the protection of treaties* negociated at the instance and with the co-operation of Georgia . All the metaphysical subtleties about state-rights , by which a measure like this is vindicated in theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we believe them fallacious , ) are refuted // at the bar of enlightened public opinion , by the hideous iniquity of the practice . In the preceding pages , we have given little else than an analysis of a portion of the first chapter of the work of Messrs* de Beaumont and de Tocqueville , omitting of necessity their account of the Houses of Reformation and Refuge for Juvenile Offenders , on which , and particularly on that of New-York , they bestow the warmest commendation . In resuming the general account of the reformation , which has been effected in the prisons in this country , they have made the just remark , that much is yet to be done , before the system is complete . In many of the county gaols and houses of correction , the evils of the former system exist in all their deformity . Much is yet to be done , in regulating the imprisonment of females . Excellent examples have been set in Baltimore , New-York and Connecticut , in establishing female penitentiaries ; hut more must be done , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State penitentiaries . The gross abuses connected with imprisonment for debt , which now serves the purpose in too many cases of training up , in the county gaols , candidates for admission to the States ' prisons , require to be reformed ; and much also is needed for the improvement of the discipline of our alms-houses . As far as Massachusetts is concerned , we anticipate great good , from the labors of the commissioners on the pauper system , whose valuable report was submitted to the Legislature , at its last session ; and not less from the researches of the commissioners , who were appointed to examine , during the present recess of the General Court , the condition of the county gaols , throughout the Commonwealth . We speak of what remains to be done , by no means in the language of discontent . The progress of reform has been wonderfully rapid . Miracles almost have been accomplished ; and there are dangers in too rapid a course of amelioration , which must be shunned . In great public establishments , requiring a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed with such deliberation , that the resources of the public may not be bestowed on objects* which farther know* ledge and experience shall prove to have been ill conceived . Thus the vast prison at Pittsburgh is an almost total waste of money ; and nearly the same may be said of the building first erected , about twenty-five years ago , as a State 's prison in Massachusetts . In their second chapter , Messrs , do Beaumont amid do // Tocqueville discuss the fundamental principles of the peniten. * tiary system of the United States , and enter into a comparison of the Auburn and Philadelphia plans . They do not appear to pronounce a positive opinion between them , but manifest a leaning toward the former ; viz , solitary confinement at night and at meals , and labor by day in the work-shops in silence* It seems also to us premature to pronounce decisively between the two plans . The experiment made in the Eastern Penitentiary at Philadelphia is as yet the only experiment ; and that has not been conducted on a very large scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the year 1831 , the last we have seen , * ) speaks in the most encouraging manner of the state of the establishment . Eighty-seven convicts were then confined in it . Of twenty-one who had been imprisoned and discharged , unfavorable accounts had been received but from one . The health of the prisoners is stated not to suffer by their unbroken solitude ; in this respect , showing the totally different operation upon the human frame of solitude with and without labor . The convicts , with the exception of one infirm from age , and of two idiots , ( which last unhappy class of beings are surely no fit subjects for such a place , ) are able to support themselves by the product of their labor . We presume that this statement must intend the cost of support , exclusive of the salary of the keepers , and interest on the cost of the establishment . The occupations of the eighty-seven convicts were as follows . Forty-three were employed in weaving and dyeing , eighteen in shoe-making ; two in carving ; four in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in carriagemaking ; two in the locksmiths ' work ; one in tailors ' work ; two in wool-picking ; one in cooking ; one in washing . Three were indisposed , two idiots ; one aged and too infirm to work ; and three just received were not employed . We have abstracted this statement from the report of the Warden , because we believe some difficulty has been supposed to exist , in finding employment , at which convicts could be kept at work , in solitary cells . The range , as it is , appears by no means limited , and might easily be extended . Our apprehension is , that this plan of imprisonment will be found too expensive . If this objection shall prove to be unfounded , and the health of the prisoners shall appear not to suffer , our pre // possessions , in other respects , would be in favor of the plan . We own we have apprehensions , as to the effect of the plan on the health of the convicts , when they shall be collected in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells built over and very near each other . Without intending to pronounce an opinion , we will briefly indicate the arguments , in favor of the Philadelphia plan , as xve understand them to be advanced by its friends . Silence is admitted to be absolutely essential to the Auburn plan , or rather the absence of all communication between the convicts . Now it is plain , that , even if silence could be strictly enforced , it would leave remaining some intercourse of looks , gestures , and touch , exceedingly restrained it is true , but still sufficient for the accomplishment of mischief . But it is impossible to enforce strict silence . Some talking is allowed , as necessary to carry on work , where several ,  --  as in stone-cutting ,  --  are employed together . This permitted use of speech leads to some abuse ; and nothing but the scourge is found adequate to keep up the discipline of the prison in this respect . The free resort to this instrument of discipline , in some of the penitentiaries , has been complained of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it . On the Philadelphia plan , alniost all occasion for discipline is taken away , and when any punishment is needed , a milder one has been found effectual . The solitude with labor is more favorable , in its moral effect on the character , than compulsory labor , in the public work-shops . In stating the comparative advantages of the two systems , Captain Lynds expressly puts the preference of the Auburn plan over that of Philadelphia , in this , that the convict at Auburn considers labor as a hardship and a task ; and that it is beneficial to him , to form the habit of submitting to the necessity of performing a task in obedience to law ; whereas , to the convict in solitary confinement , labor is a solace . He is willing to labor in the cell , to escape the ennui of his confinement ; but when he leaves the prison , this motive ceasing to operate , lie will cease from work . The force of this reasoning is denied . It is assumed , in both cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any love of industry ; but in one case he works under the compulsion of the lash ; in the other , voluntarily , as a refuge from the torments of idle solitude . In either case , he works all the time . Now the comparative efficacy of these two modes of enforcing labor , in forming industrious habits , must be , d priori , a matter of // doubtful speculation . Both motives will cease when the convict is discharged . Which is most likely , while it is in operation , to produce a *alutary change in the temper , which will operate after the motive ceases , is a matter to be decided by experience . Another great advantage claimed for the plan of total seclusion is , its efficacy in removing a great obstacle in the way of the successful reformation of convicts . Experience has shown , that convicts disposed , on their discharge from prison , to persevere in virtuous habits , are frequently prevented from doing so , by their worthless associates , who , for the cruel purpose of compelling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the employers , in whose service they may have found occupation . A very affecting case of this kind is related in the work of Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville. * The natural prejudice against employing persons , who have been found guilty of crimes punished by the laws of the country with confinement in the States ' prisons , is so*great , that this mutual delation by comrades opposes a very formidable obstacle to reform . It is , of course , wholly obviated by the system of entire seclusion . From the moment he comes into the prison , till he leaves it , the convict never sees the face nor hears the voice of a fellow convict ; and quits its walls as much a stranger to every other inmate of them as he entered . It ought to be observed of both plans of prison discipline , that they require for their successful operation , qualifications of no ordinary kind , on the part of the wardens , superintendants , or by whatever other name the officer in immediate control of the prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform has accordingly been , to make this office one of respectability and consequence , which individuals of character and standing are willing to assume , and which carries with it no disparagement or degradation . The American reader can scarce repress a smile , at finding , in the Minutes of Evidence appended to the late report of the Committee of the House of Commons , on secondary punishments , this question , among others , put to Captain Basil Hall : Is the superintendant a convict ? ' Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville repeat , with proper terms of respect , the names of Captain * Appendix No. 10. p. 330 . This appendix contains the result of the examination by Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville of each of the inmates of the Cherry-Hill Penitentiary. // Lynds and Judge Powars , of New-York ; of Mr. Pillsbury , at Wethersfield ; of Mr. Robert Wiltsie , at Sing Sing ; of Captain Austin , at Charlestown ; and of Mr. Wood , of Philadelphia . As the number of persons possessing the re* quisite qualifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , it is regarded as a recommendation of the Philadelphia system , that its administration appears somewhat easier , than that of the other plai . The entire isolation of the convicts facilitates the discipline of the plan ; and renders less necessary the pQssession of the high moral qualities , which may occasionally he called into action , in prisons otherwise organized . The third chapter of the work before us treats of the subject of the moral reform of the convicts , and the effects of the sys-. tem in diminishing the amount of crime in the community . The fourth chapter is devoted to the financial aspect of the question , and closes the first part of the work . The first chapter of the second part commences with the imperfections of the French prisons ;  --  the cost of their support , and the evil effects of their organization and management , on the morals and lives of the convicts . In the second chapter , is discussed the practicability of introducing the American penitentiary system into France . Several obstacles to such a step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adapta-* tion of the buildings now used as prisons ;  --  the general aversion to corporal punishments , and the want of that co-operation of the religious sense of the public , which exists in America , and to which great efficacy is justly ascribed by Messrs . deBeaumnont and de Tocqueville :  --  and the character of i**famy , which the laws of France impose on various crimes ; a character which would be at variance with penitentiary discipline , which leaves a locus penitentiae , and a hope of restoration to all its subjects . If these difficulties were overcome , ( and our authors do not state them to be insuperable ) , they express the opinion that the system might not be productive of all the good effects , which have flowed from it in this country . They doubt whether the labor of the convicts could be made to bear so important a part of thc cost of their maintenance , as it does with us . They suppose that the products of the labor of the prisoners would find less ready sale in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own we do not perceive the force of this objection . We suppose , that the productiveness of the labor of convicts must bear about the same proportion to that of free labor , in the tvo countries . The principle , on which the labor // of convicts is made adequate to their support is , that of supe* riority over a good part of the free labor of the community , in management , thrift , an ample supply of stock , and free* dom from waste , hut especially the latter . We do not perceive why all these causes should not operate in France as well as in America . In fact , in reading this chapter , especially in remarking that our authors close it with the expression of a decided wish that an experiment should he made in France , on a fair scale , of the American system , we have been inclined to think that they are themselves well disposed toward its introduction into France ; and that they wish by their own anticipation and discussion of the difficulties that might arise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to prevent the discouragement that would spring from unforeseen embarrassments . The third chapter of the second part is devoted to a description of the establishments usually denominated houses of refuge or reformation , and those of New York , Philadelphia , and Boston are particularly described and commended . But we must reserve our remarks on these interesting establishments for some future opportunity . The Appendix contains , in three chapters , an interesting discussion of the merits of penal colonies ; - and an ample collection of interesting documents , illustrative of the various subjects of the work , closes the volume . We have been particularly gratified with the perusal of this work , which we regard as well calculated to be useful even to the citizens of the United States , though destined of course more particularly for information in Europe . The introductory note of the authors expresses , in gratifying terms , their sense of obligation to the magistrates and functionaries in this country , by whom their researches were facilitated . We can not forbear a brief quotation . CJf our researches shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the generous hospitality of the people of the United States . The establishments of every kind , in all parts of the country , were thrown open to us ; and every species of information furnished with a zeal , of which we are truly sensible . The importance of our errand was understood in America ; and the public functionaries of the most elevated character , not less than private individuals , spar , ed no pains to aid us in accomplishing it . ' We ought not to withhold a tribute of acknowledgment to the late government of France , for its enlightened policy in instituting this mission . Amidst the grave polkical delinquencies , under which it sunk , it is but generous to preserve from obli // vion these proofs of a liberality and wisdom , above the standard of its own policy . We may reasonably expect from those now entrusted with the control of the destinies of that great and powerful nation , that they will at least not fall behind their predecessors , in this important branch of reform . With the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Tocquevilfe , we may reasonably expect that prompt and vigorous measures will be taken to reduce to the test of experiment , the practicability of applying the American penitentiary system to the prisons of France . While we write these sentences , we understand that commissioners have been appointed in England , to proceed to this country on the same errand . We can wish them nothing better than that they may bring to their honorable task the intelligence , industry , and enlightened spirit of observation , which secured to Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville the respect and co-operation of the authorities and people of the United States . For ourselves , we wish no better answer to the gossipping trash against this country , which is pouring , in one broad unceasing stream , from the British press , than the institution of these missions . The question , how crime is to be dealt with in a community , is one of the most embarrassing to the philanthropic statesman . The humane feeling of the age does not permit that the laws shall continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer , to take the life of a fellow creature , for stealing to the value of fi*e and sixpence . Deportation to the other side of the globe is enormously expensive ; is iniquitous in its effect upon the character of the community , whose foundations are thus laid in penal justice ; and is nearly useless as a punishment . It is , besides , a mode of disposing of crime , which , for political reasons , very few governments have at their command . The pillory , stripes , and branding irons are now regarded in a light almost as unfavorable as the rack , the boots , or the thumb-screws . It has become , then , absolutely necessary , that imprisonment should be made an effective , safe , and humane punishment , compatible with the health and physical comfort of its subjects , without ceasing to be an object of terror , and capable of indefinite extension , without creating an enormous burden on the State . We believe we are fully warranted in affirming , that this great problem has been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard the solution of it as one of the greatest triumphs of humanity ever achiev // ed . That Europe may be enabled to introduce the system is our ardent wish ; and we deem it truly auspicious that the task of making the preliminary inquiries has devolved on persons so well qualified for that object , as Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville . Since this article was written and sent to the press , we have had an opportunity of looking at the eighth report of the Committee of the Society for the Improvement of Prison Dis-* cipline in Great Britain , and also at the Report of the Select Committee on Secondary Punishments , made to the House of Commons , June 22d , 1832 . We perceive , from these documents , that while enormous abuses still exist in many of the British prisons , reform is advancing with rapid strides . It is highly gratifying to witness the respect with which the Penitentiary System of the United States is referred to . The reports of the Boston Prison Discipline Society are commended in the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , since these remarks were written , been pulilicly submitted to the society . Its contents are of the most gratifying and auspicious character . They confirm the claims of the society ,  - -  already well established ,  --  to be regarded as one of the most admirable institutions of the age . It is not easy to speak , in exaggerated terms , of the good which it has effected . We learn , with great satisfaction , from this report , that the work of Messrs . de Beaumont and de Tocqueville , is to be translated by Dr. Lieber.
