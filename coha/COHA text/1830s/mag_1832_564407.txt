txt " Stiiltor m plena sunt omuia . " Cic . EVEN as the noble and renowned Don Quixote de la Mancha went forth to do battle against the wickedness and injustice of this world , so I , SOLOMON F. SIMPLE , in singleness of heart and strength , am about to gird on mine armor against its wisdom . It has long been a firm conviction of my mind that " the wisdom of this world is foolishness ; " but lacking that moral resolution which enables men to advance and attack fearlessly long-cherished opinions , I have hesitated to publish my " impressions " to the world . Even now , when I have " screwed my courage to the sticking place , " when all the brilliant honor of exploding a false doctrine and introducing another infinitely better suited to the wants and capacities of the human race , shines before the eye of my imagination , I must acknowledge a fearful misgiving of heart . I tremble lest the instrument of destruction I am about to wield may recoil , and overthrow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is worse , like the enchanted ball in the German legend , my charge may return against my own poor body ; and , instead of " shooting wisdom as it flies , " I may shoot my immaculate self . But " thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just ; " and , in the triple armor of good intent , a good quill , and a good cause , with a firm front if not a bold heart , I address myself to the onset . I hold that the whole army of would-be wise men are " fools ; " and , although entrenched behind a mass of nonsense more extensive than the wall of China , I shall strive to break through , and hold them up for observation . Behold the castle of wisdom ! How sternly and imposingly its time-worn battlements frown on my humble array ! how proudly it lifts its Babel towers to the skies ; and how fiercely its defenders , in their // confusion of tongues , shout the word of defiance ! How strongly is it fortified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploded doctrines ; of massive volumes prepared to be hurled against all fool-hardy opponents ! I intend to carry the outworks " vi et pennis ; " to wade through or leap over its ditches of stupidity , and boldly to assail the walls . Against these I shall use my grand argumentative battering-ram  --  the " Reductio ad absurdum ; " and , having effected a breach , attack , quill in hand , the " rabble rout " within . So much for the plan of the campaign . The outworks consist merely of line laid loosely upon line , and precept upon precept , and may be easily overthrown . These intimate the material and solidity of the main structure ; and , in apparent strength and real frailness , bear to it no slight resemblance . They are ,  --  " IItisdom is the principal thing ; " " VVisdom is more precious than rubies ; " " Get wisdom , get understanding ; " &amp;c. &amp;c . These " beginnings of wisdom " are nullified and overthrown by a sentence longer , and of course stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it favors my side of the question . " If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise . " Hence the first step in true wisdom is to play the fool ; and in this light the world is , indeed-wise . The first words of an erudite work which fell into my hands lately were- " Reader , I am a fool . " Struck with the sense and discernment evinced by the author in his first sentence , I conceived him to have taken the first qualifying step in knowledge . Upon examining the work , I was staggered with the abundant proof he gave of having attended to the command , " Nosci te ipsum ; " and I was the more convinced of the correctness of his assertion , as he had the hardihood and folly to brand " Fool " on his own forehead , to be stared and laughed at . There are fools enough in the world , Heaven knows ; for Fools are the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man , she loses by it ; t is too expensive ; T would make ten fools . Nature , it seems , is ever an economist in the expenditure of strength ; and forms ten fools to one man ; but they , with a sagacity not incompatible with folly , supply the deficiency by high-sounding and impressive names . Thus , madness , double-distilled , is " genius ; " folly on stiltspoetic fire ; " ingenious thieving- " originality ; " supreme silliness " delicate fancy , " and so on . By means of these large words men have concluded themselves to be a wondrously improved generation . They are only fools , and as ridiculous as asses in lions ' skins . Now to the walls . I see one point particularly ruinous , inlaid with massive treatises on " Entities " and " Quidities ; " " Ghosts and Familiar Spirits ; " Baxter 's , Mandesville 's , and Hobbes 's , and innumerable unphilosophical folios on the " Philosophy of Mind . " T is a noble array of nonsense , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage ; " from minds that , like Butler 's hero , could distinguish and divide A hair , twixt south and south-west side . Through these a passage must be effected in order to examine the interior . With words as potent as the robber 's " sesame , " I test their // stability . They are utter foolishness ; useless to the writers and worse than useless to mankind ! Heavens ! what a dust ! what a breach is made , and the massive structure rocks to the foundation ! Now , like Priain 's palace , " ADparet domus intus , et atria longa patescunt . " The multitude throng before us , and we have a clear view of the motley assemblage . Men of all nations and tongues under heaven ; with long hair and short hair ; with long beards and short beards and no beards at all ; in every guise that mortal oddity ever invented or wore . How shall we discriminate ? We must first observe ; they are all fools . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thersites is a fool , and , as aforesaid , Patroclus is a fool ; " in fine , all are fools . Being a schoolmaster , I shall consider them grammatically ; that is , as divided into three grades ; Fools positive , comparative , and superlative . FooLs PosITIvE . I much admire the discernment of those nations which pay peculiar honor to this order of fools , and regard them as especially favored of Heaven . They are very properly imitated by most European nations , who not only render special regard to one fool above all others , but also suffer him to lead them by the nose wherever his freaks of folly may incline him . rrhe French have been so especially used to this , that their face-handles are in pain till they have some one to pull them ; and the harder the better ; for ( like snuff to an old lady ) the more they take , the more it requires to tickle . I-low well did Napoleon satisfy this longing of the " grand nation ! " He led them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a winter campaign and of constant war , and they shouted all the time , with the wildness of a pleased school-boy , " Vive 1 ' empereur ! " But , peace to his manes . He was what Shakspeare calls " a noble fool . " T is an ill wind that blows no one any good , and I am inclined to think experience has taught the French people-little or nothing . Time was when " fools positive " held high rank in the world . Every king had his fool-companion , to tickle his pride occasionally , be a butt for his blows or his jokes , or a trusty counsellor when wise counsel was needed . Their places are at present supplied by prime ministers ; not a whit the less silly because differently entitled , but a little more pompous , and esteemed a little wiser , because they have wit enough to hold their tongues . They are adorned , with the fool 's coat Of rich embroidered silks which well supplies the place of the " cap and bells " at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly , they act the fool much more mischievously than their predecessors ; for they begin to tip their masters off the thrones . Poor fools ! they must be forgiven , because they know no better ; teaching them any thing is entirely out of the question . I once took a little " fool positive " under my special instruction . Like John Shelton 's " Sparrow , " " It was so prety a foole T wold sit on a stoole And learned after my scoole . " T was the best scholar I ever had ! there was no trouble about understanding . Such short , comprehensive recitations were delightful . Just so are the prime fools . They are apt scholars , but never learn any // thing . The ex-minister of Charles X. has at present a fine retired place for study , and , what must be very pleasant , he has labored hard to attain it . But of all writers on fools , Joe Miller best expressed the delights of foolishness and the folly of wisdom " A fool enjoys the sweets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never are at strife ; He hopes not he , nor fears . " When knaves o'erreach and friends betray , Whilst men of sense run mad , Fools , careless , whistle on , and say T is silly to be sad . " Since , free from sorrow , fear , or shame , A fool thus fate defies , The greatest folly I can name Is  --  to be over-wise . " Conclusion ,  --  fools are truly wise ; all that have dabbled in wisdom are over-wise , therefore , all wise men are great fools . Of these we shall have occasion to speak hereafter . At present we must attend to the second class ; or " FooLs COMPARATIVE . Among these , lovers hold the first rank . " Semel insaniviinus omnes ; " Every man has played the fool once ; and I reckon myself among the highest of this order , since I have done so twice ; once , when I fell in love with Maria D- , and was jilted ; next , when I made love to Mary F- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars and forty-three cents worth of rings , chains , and other trifles , and lost her ladyship besides . Shakspeare says , " The lunatic , the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact . " Here we have a proof of that great writer 's tact in grouping ; a particular unnoticed by his commentators . Lunatics and lovers come well in the same line , and are , in fact , very proper company for each other . Indeed , love is lunacy . This may be proved by reference to the order of knight-errants . They made most egregious fools of themselves , and " all for pure love . " They went about like roaring lions , seeking whom they might devour ; and their chief delight was in knocking out each other 's brains , ( if they had any , ) or knocking in their ribs , or knocking off any superfluous parts of their precious bodies . However , as their hard blows fell for the most part among themselves , they may be convicted , as the jurors say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , Pierre Vidal , immortalized himself and the rest of the Troubadours by so signal an act of folly or madness , that I can not refrain from quoting it for the eternal honor of the order . He conceited himself to be enamored of a damsel , named Louve de Penantiers ; and assumed the name of Loup , or Wolf , in her honor . He then clothed himself in a wolf 's hide , and exposed himself to be hunted by hounds , that he might be worried into a state worthy of his mistress 's affections . The dogs had glorious sport , and pursued him into the mountains , where they almost tore him to pieces . Luckily for him , the shepherds did not cut his throat ; ( the usualfnaie ; ) but , discovering him to be an // ass in disguise , packed him up warm in a hamper , and sent him to his Dulcinea to receive a proper reward for his devotion . This was reversing the fable , of the " wolf in sheep 's clothing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others who deserve a place in this grade , but must hasten on to the next ,  - -  THE SUPERLATIVES . Here I must acknowledge myself fairly puzzled . I do not wish to neglect any one ; and I have already so far exceeded my proper limits , that I can but touch on a few prominent points in this " very numerous and respectable " class . A prophecy was once made concerning a certain land , that when , on a day designated , a shower should fall , the people would be deprived of their senses , and run stark mad . The shower came , and with it came the madness . One would imagine that the prophecy might be well applied at the present day ; and that every shower , which has fallen , has brought increased folly and distraction on the heads *f men . What man in his senses , for instance , would labor day and night , exhaust his body and rack his mind , to serve up a few jingling lines , to be hawked at and picked to pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if favored , to enjoy " an immortality of scarce a week ? " The old soldier , in Roman story , whose eyes were picked out by a crow , that lit on his helmet , was to be pitied ; but he who voluntarily runs his face and eyes before the beak and talons of a literary owl , and has the one well cut up and the other torn out , is , to say the least of him , a " superlative fool , " and meets with his deserts . Again , is it not supreme folly , for men who might " live quiet and peaceable lives , in all godliness and honesty ; " knowingly , and with their eyes open , to thrust their fingers into the fire of political , religious , or literary dissension ? The monkey in the fable had more sense than most mortals , for he used a cat's-paw ; but the majority of mankind , in their great itch for mischief would rather burn their own fingers , than not have a hand in the transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest fools in existence . Utopian schemes run away with the imagination of one ; plans for the abolishment of taxes are the hobby of another ; this one has a " new way to pay the old " public " debt ; " and that one a project for emancipating and transporting " en masse , " the slaves of the south . All are in a ferment . They are " like the troubled sea , when it can not rest ; whose waters cast up mire and dirt . " And what is the object of all this ' ? Either present honor , or " Praised to be when they can hear no more , And much enriched with fame when useless worldly store . ' For fools , such as these , I have no bowels of compassion ; and rank them without hesitation among those of the superlative degree . Finally , I declare , with Joe Miller , the greatest folly I can name is , to be over-wise . My learned progenitor , Solomon , from whom I am , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has been called a very wise man . I confess I have family reasons for not speakingfully on this point . I will only observe that , with all his boasted wisdom , the old gentleman could not keep himself out of mischief or avoid playing the fool ; and as great an adept as he was , at making proverbs and preaching sermons , he found it as difficult to stick to his text as any other fool . His xvise imitators , whose " follies are the best part of their // Gonversation with a Lizard. fortunes , " or more properly their only fortunes , squander them with such reckless profusion , and spread them abroad so industriously , that they infect many an honest soul , who would otherwise have been contented with the bliss of ignorance . I pray the Lord to preserve these latter from evil , to restore the former to their senses , and make them in due time as wise as SOLOMON.                    @
