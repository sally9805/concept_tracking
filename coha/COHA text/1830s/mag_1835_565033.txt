txt WERE we seriously convinced , that every word of the work , purporting to be written by Rebecca Theresa Reed , under the the general title of Six MONTHS IN A CONVENT , ' were true , we should not , for one moment , hesitate to declare ourselves for the Ursulines - to defend the persecuted party . Before entering , however , upon the exposition , which we propose to make , of our own views , concerning the recent persecution , which has been leveled against the unoffending and harmless society of women - known under the name of the lJrsuline Community , for some years past conducting a seminary , for the education of young ladies , on i*vJount Benedict , in the town of Charlestown - we will , by the leave of the sovereign mob , make a few preliminary remarks . We would be distinctly understood to assert the right , enjoyed by any number of individuals in this free country , to form themselves into an association or community , governed by any bylaws and rules they may see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not repugnant to the laws of the land , and provided also , that their practices are not treasonable , and no infractions of the well-regulated order of society . I have an undeniable right , with as many persons as IL can persuade to join me - with * Six Months in a Convent ; or , the Narrative of Rebecca Theresa Reed , who was under the influence of the Roman Catholics about two years , and an inmate of the Ursuline Convent , on Mount Benedict , Charlestown , Mass. , aearly six mouths , in the years 1831 , 32 ; with some Preliminary Suggestions , by the Committee of Publication : Russell , Odiorne and Co . ' An Answer to Six Months in a Convent ; ' exposing its falsehoods and manifold absurdities . By the Lady Superior ; with some Preliminary Remarks : Printed and Published by . T. H. Eastburn. ' // them to immure myself from all intercourse with the world ; yea , even from the blessed light of the sun ; and , as long as my conduct is decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proved against myself and my companions , as a community , no tongue can gainsay that right . Should one of our number offend against the laws , so as to be amenable to punishment , that individual could he made to undergo the penalty of his offence but , no harm should , on that account , befall the community , of which he was a member . As a society , we should have a perfect right to be strangely absurd in our manners , peculiar in our dress , and surperlatively ridiculous in everything else . We might , could we so agree , salute one another by touching noses , instead of shaking hands - button our coats behind our backs , and cut a pigeon-wing or a pirouette whenever President Jackson 's name was mentioned , or any other popular saint 's or devil 's ; if we chose to do so . We might determine never to marry , to be honest in politics , to make or not to make a*y queer mana*uvres , that entered into our thoughts . So long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and violated neither the laws of God or of man , so long should we have a right to preserve our retirement , unmolested . The Ursuline Community , as a community , in that part of Six Months in a Convent , ' peculiarly the production of Miss Reed , are blamed chiefly for a set of foolish ceremonies , connected with their religion , or imposed by the rules of their order . Nobody is found fault with , during her residence at the Convent , except the Bishop and the Superior . Now , the Bishop 's improper questions can not be called criminal , as the amiable Rebecca Theresa did not understand them ; ( qua3-re : how did she conjecture their impropriety ? ) and , if they had been made comprehensible by her intellect - with the assistance of Nods and becks and wreathed smiles , ' it is not improbable that a young woman , of her romantic name and disposition , may have heard improper questions before , for which she did not so severely blame the youth who asked them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , if carried into effect , have subjected that lady ( not the Community ) to an action for forcible imprisonment , which probably would not have been sustained , for want of sufficient evidence . Now this is the sum and substance of all the bitter accusations of Miss Reed ; the embellishment of her imagination , and the flourishes of her advocates - supposing the Committee of Publication , under whose fatherly care this modest volume has been issued , to stand in that interesting regard - would go for nothing . Their breath would only serve to cool the porridge of their own wrath . But , supposing all were proved , beyond the remotest possibility // of a doubt , what would be the sentence of the law ? The court would probably fine the Lady Superior one dollar , and admonish her not to seduce interesting young ladies into her Convent any longer . But , suppose We , the all-glorified people , take the law into our own hands , and proceed to execute our united vengeance - being fully convinced that the Ursulines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? What farther steps shall we take ? In school-hoy phrase , what are we agoing to do ahout it ? In Heaven 's name , what are we making all this fuss about ? Shall we go and burn the house , lately the country-seat of one of our most respectable citizens , where these few women and the pupils have taken refuge , as we did their own fair dwelling on Mount Benedict ? I am afraid the loyal citizens of P*oxhury would give us a warm reception . I have it ! Yes - we will burn the women themselves - all five of them , if there be so many . Let us accuse them of witch-craft . Let some young woman - Miss Reed , for instance - swear before several respectable gentlemen - as respectable as the Committee of Publication - that she was ridden through the air on a broomstick all night , pinched black and blue , and fainted through excess of fear , one Sunday , in church , because , in the midst of her devotions , the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man . ' This will be evidence enough . XVe can then hum them incontinently . But will this answer ? No - we might be laughed at ; and though , like Maxvxvorm , we likes to he ahused , ' we wo n't he laughed at . ' All that remains to do , then , is to kick up such a row as to send every mother 's soul of them packing into Canada . This xvould he a glorious victory . We should then have time to cool , to remove the graceful ruins on Mount Benedict , and be all ready to put ourselves into another furious passion not with the anti-slavery people - we have fixed them ; not with the nest of hornets at the Federal-street theatre - they will die a natural death , if let alone ; hut with the Methodists Yes - the anti-Catholics ! Having destroyed their antagonists , we can set about demolishing these whining , hypocritical rascals , ' as the mob delights to call the most extended sect of Christians in the United States . One word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populace - before we take it upon ourselves to say , whether we seriously trust in the production of Miss Rehecca Theresa Reed sustained , as it is , and promised and vowed for , by such godfathers as the Committee of Publication . We are about to announce to the world , a solemn which - when exploded and blown sky-high , by the train along which we are now sprinkling our small grains of powder , and to which we shall // directly apply our match-light- will cause a sudden start and sensation through the body-politic . We shudder to announce it ; but our duty compels us to state that there is about to be established in the city of Boston - in the very heart of this Pilgrim city- a MONASTERY ! The community will be composed of men who lead a monastic life , have taken a sort of voluntary vow of celibacy ( for a season at least ) ; and no married man is to be permitted to reside within its xvalls . What its rules and observances are to be , we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the subject , with our usual spirit of investigation , it will tend , however , more than any Convent , to discourage that glorious institution - Matrimony . And , that we may get torches in readiness to set it a-blaze , as soon as it shall be built , we would state that it is about to be established at the corner of Beacon and Tremont streets - and , though no name has been determined on by the monks themselves , it will generally be designated BACHELORS ' HALL . ' ! ! We have made these preliminary remarks , because , in spite of all assertions to the contrary , we believe the first excitement , against the Ursuline Community , to have commenced with the propagation of stories , attributed ( perhaps falsely ) to Miss Reed , concerning her residence in the Convent , and the horrible things she saw there . The fact was generally known , that she bad written an account of her sufferings . Had her book been published immediately after her escape from the Convent , it would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of absurd ceremonies and severe regulations , affecting no one but themselves , are the snbstance of the charges against the nuns . She but conjectures , from what she overheard , that she was to be abducted , against her will . The idea of founding any serious accusations , on the positive statements in her book , is too egregiously absurd to be treated in a serious light . No ! let it not be believed , that such charges , as those which are related in Six Months in a Convent , ' instigated the brutal outrage , which was perpetrated against the laws and humanity , in the burning of the Convent buildings , on Mount Benedict . Miss Reed may be as guiltless of having told anything beyond the statements now published in her name , as her Committee of Publication would have us believe ; but , with her running away or walking away from the nunnery , as it is called , commenced the circulation of certain rumors , which she , perhaps , did not originate - but which were freely bandied about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to startle even the cool and reflecting . People abroad may be deceived ; but those who are near the scene have heard too much to credit , for a moment , the assertions of those who would maintain , that the little anecdotes of Miss Reed were the cause , the sufficient and efficient cause // of the outraged feelings of the mob . Others have asserted , that the stories , concerning Miss Harrison , superadded to facts told by Miss Reed , formed the cause . Miss Harrison 's affair was discredited by many ; it was entirely disproved . She was said either to have been incarcerated by the nuns , or spirited away but the selectmen of Charlestoxvn knew better , and judgmatically declared their knowledge , when it was too late . We all know better - cloak our knowledge as we will . The most opprobrious epithets , the most vile accusations are constantly applied to the Community of Ursulines . All the monstrous calumnies , which have ever been inflicted , in former times , on Convents , were heaped up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic women ; and one new lie applied the firebrand to popular fury . Yes ! and the flames are not yet quenched . The smoldering embers are still hurled against the nuns and novices , in their retreat ; and the presence of some of the most respectable daughters of Protestant parents , have not deterred many wretches from shouting , as they rushed by their house of refuge in Roxhury , the vilest terms of a blackguard vocabulary . On the last Fast-day , a host of these rioters , in gigs , drove by the dwelling , and belloxved forth volleys of abuse , shouting names too vile to be repeated - applicable , doubtless , to their own female associates . But , we will not Leap our light courser o'er the bounds of taste ; ' though the indignation , which such devilish conduct inspires , can hardly be restrained within the goal of calm reason . Having thus expressed our conviction that , on the hypothesis that the little work of Rebecca Theresa Reed were strictly true , no very heinous offence could be proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not , if fully known at the time , have instigated the Mount Benedict conflagration , * - unaided by the mlisgraceful falsehoods , which were industriously disseminated 14 the enemies of good order - we come now , seriously , to ask ourselves the question , whether we believe , or not , in her published narrative . We answer unhesitatingly - No ! We believe , in common with the most respectable portion of our fellow-citizens , that Miss Reed is a weak , silly person , of a very romantic turn of mind , and 5We must act fail to express the gratification , which we have received in the perusal of the very convincing and eloquent argument before the Committee of the House of Representatives , by Richard S. Fay , Counsellor at Law , upon the petition of Benedict Fenwick and others , for restitution for the wanton destruction of their property , on Mount Benedict . I7be Resolutions passed by the Legislature , disapproving , in set terms , of the crime of burning the Convent , were , in our opinion , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable deficiency of the laws . // given to acting and speaking deceitfully . Her own book would prove this , were not the answer of the Lady Superior so entirely satisfactory . This answer is written in a style , which shews its author a woman of an excellent education , fully adequate to the important task of presiding over a seminary of young ladies , and eminently worthy of the praises which are bestowed upon her by the intelligent parents who have placed their daughters under her care . We have been told , hy ladies who have conversed with her - in confirmation of her own denial of the vulgar phrases attributed to her hy us5 Reed - that her conversation is elegant and her manners reflned . To our view , one of the strongest arguments against Miss Reed 's veracity , may be derived from the low-lived expressions , which she attributes to the Lady Superior and the Bishop . No person , acquainted with people in their situation , would believe that they could talk about pancake , ' and Old Scratch . ' These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She may , for instance , have been so often told , that her fair hand was as soft as a pancake - that , desirous of advisin the world of such an enviable possession , she attributed the compliment to the Lady Superior . Old Scratch ' is an expression made use of so frequently by maid-servants , that she probably considered it the most familiar way in which she could make the reverend Bishop speak of his Satanic Majesty . The story of the Bishop 's requesting the dying nun to implore the Almighty to send him a bushel of gold , when she had got to Heaven , is another strong argument against the veracity of her narrative ; for , in the language of the Lady Superior , if this story be true , they not only imposed upon others , but suffered themselves to be imposed upon . Such an egregiously absurd and improbable story , as this , is enough , without her own silly confessions , to render her statements perfectly ridiculous . That the Young woman is capable of the meanest acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing but the extreme gullibility of the mob would prevent the immediate exposure of the Committee of Puhlication . Their prefatory suggestions show them to be too wise to have been ulled themselves . The blame of the matter is not with *iiss Reed . Let us wait cooly a little , till the present unwarrantable excitement shall subside , and see what will be the result . Meanwhile , we have two or three questions to put , which must be answered . There is a general determination to know the names of the wire-pullers of this grand puppet show . A. word or two , however , in explanation of our manner of treating this subject - a subject which , by so manv* is deemed of the most vital importance . A very respec table portion of our fcllow-citzens have , since the burning of // the Ursuline Convent , expressed very little interest in the matter they look upon the excitcment prevalent , with regard to the publications , to which we have referred , as a temporary gust which will blow over ; - nd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better . Our own view of the affair , is different . We think that the people should persuaded to look on this matter in its proper light . The infinite absurdity of Miss Reed 's book should be exposed . The Lady Superior 's answer will probably make some converts to her cause ; but all that she can oppose to assertions , are assertions . Her reply , we consider very good ; but it is , nevertheless , colored by her own feelings , and she is betrayed into expressions which are injudicious. * The keen shafts of her satire fall harmlessly from such bull-hides as those of Miss Reed 's Committee of Publication . All that can be hoped from her answer , is that people will set off her character against Miss Reed 's , and judge between them . But what what would she gain by that ? She will be answered , and answered again . Forty thousand works would do no good . What if she could disprove every word that has been published What would be the effect ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regard to the threatened abduction , are true or not ? They amount to nothing . The trouble does not lie there . Should Miss Reed herself be entirely exonerated from the charge of falsehood , or most darkly implicated , we do not believe that it would be effective of any important result , one way or the other . No ; the evil lies elsewhere . Six Months in a Convent , ' would have been bought and read and forgotten . - and the Convent mi 6ht have been rebuilt without molestation ; for nobody , as xve have shown , can have a right to interfere with any number of individuals , in acting and living as they please . The Ursuline Community have little to fear from the statements of Miss Reed . r10 sensible persons , they appear ridiculous ; and they would appear ridiculous to every body , were not such importance imparted to them by the Committee of Publication , who are generally thought to be responsible persons . The friends , whom this persecution of the Ursulines will raise up among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frown upon the Committee of Publication . Such questions as these , must be asked - yes , and they must be answered , too . Sneer at this demand as they will , the public will insist upon being elucidated as to certain points , like the following . The * We would reprehend , in the strongest manner , the abusive language used by the Catholic presses , with regard to the reverend gentleman , who gave a certificate concerning Miss Reed 's disposition to tell truth . Such lying accusations can only tarnish those froni whom they proceed ; and will fade away from his undimmed and irreproachable character , like vapor from a diamond . // names of this Committee - who are they ? By whom were they constituted a Committee ? Were they self-constituted ? Who of their number wrote the preliminary remarks to Six Months in a Convent ? Who , hesidus the publishers , receive the immense profits arisiag from the sale of this book ? These questions may appear unimportant ; hut , if answered , the public will know where to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in print , or be industriously circulated , for the purpose of inflaming the mob to new acts of persecution and outrage , on this small Community of women ; who , from the industrious malice with which they are pursued , would seem to be the very hand-maids of the Romish church , in the plentitude of her wickedness and power.
