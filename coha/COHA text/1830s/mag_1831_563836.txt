txt THE leading events of the War of Independence are familiar to every American ; but many incidents , full of interest and adventure , yet remain to be disclosed . There are those yet living who remember the following story : The American authorities found much difficulty in disposing of their prisoners . They had no posts regularly fitted for the purpose ; and they could suggest no better means for securing them , than to place them under guard in a thickly settled part of the country , where the inhabitants were most decidedly hostile to the English . The town of Lancaster , in Pennsylvania , was of those selected for this purpose . The prisoners were confined in barracks , enclosed with a stockade and vigilantly guarded . But in spite of all precautions , they often disappeared in an unaccountable manner , and nothing was heard of them till they had resumed their place in the British army . Many and various were the conjectures as to the means of their escape ; the officers inquired and investigated in vain ; the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , and told of fortune-tellers , pedlers and such characters , who had been seen at intervals ; and sundry of the more credulous could think of nothing but supernatural agency ; but whether man or spirit was the conspirator , the mystery was unbroken . When this became known to Washington , he sent General Hazen to take this responsible charge . This energetic officer , after exhausting all resources , resorted to stratagem . He was convinced that , as the nearest British post was more than a hundred miles distant , the prisoners must be aided by Americans , but where the suspicion should fall he could not even conjecture ; the reproach of Toryism being almost unknown in that region . Having been trained to meet exigencies of this kind in a distinguished career , as colonel in the British army , his plan was formed at once , and communicated to an officer of his own , upon whose talent he relied for its successful execution . This was Captain Lee , whose courage and ability fully justified the selection . // The secret plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given out that Lee was absent on furlough or command . He , meantime , was to assume the dress of a British prisoner , and , having provided himself with information and a story of his capture , was to be thrown into the barracks , where he might gain the confidence of the soldiers , and join them in a plan of escape . How well Captain Lee sustained his part may be inferred from the fact that when he had disappeared and placed himself among the prisoners , his own officers and soldiers saw him every day without the least suspicion . The person to whom I am indebted for most of these particulars was the Intendant of the prisoners , and familiar with Lee ; but , though compelled to see him often in the discharge of his duty , he never penetrated the disguise . Well it was for Lee that his disguise was so complete . Iiad his associates suspected his purpose to betray them , his history would have been embraced in the proverb , " dead men tell no tales . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no discoveries whatever . He thought he perceived at times signs of intelligence between the prisoners and an old woman , who was allowed to bring fruit for sale within the enclosure . She was known to be deaf and half-witted , and was therefore no object of suspicion . It was known that her son had been disgraced and punished in the American army , but she had never betrayed any malice on that account , and no one dreamed that she could have had the power to do injury if she possessed the will . Lee watched her closely , but saw nothing to confirm his suspicions . Her dwelling was about a mile distant , in a wild re* treat , where she shared her miserable quarters with a dog and cat , the former of which mounted guard over her mansion , while the latter encouraged superstitious fears which were equally effectual in keeping visiters away . One dark stormy night in autumn , he was lying awake at midnight , meditating on the enterprise he had undertaken , which , though in the beginning it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its charms . It was one of those tempests , which in our climate so often hang upon the path of the departing year . His companions slept soundly , but the wind , which shook the building to its foundation and threw heavy splashes of rain against the window , conspired with the state of his mind to keep him wakeful . All at once the door was gently opened , and a figure moved silently into the room . It was too dark to observe its motions narrowly , but he could see that it stooped towards one of the sleepers who immediately rose ; next it approached him and touched him on the shoulder . Lee immediately started up ; the figure then allowed a slight gleam from a dark lantern to pass over his face , and as it did so , whispered impatiently , not the man  --  but come ! " It then occurred to Lee that this was the opportunity he desired . The unknown whispered to him to keep his place till another man was called ; but just at that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lee to follow , he moved silently out of the room . They found the door of the house unbarred , and a small part of the fence removed , where they passed out without molestation ; the sentry had retired to a shelter where he thought he could guard his post without suffering from the rain ; but Lee saw that his conductors put them // selves in preparation to silence him if he should happen to address them . Just without the fence appeared a stooping figure , wrapped in a red cloak , and supporting itself with a large stick , which Lee at once perceived could be no other than the old fruit woman . But the most profound silence was observed ; a man came out from a thicket at a little distance and joined them , and the whole party moved onward under the guidance of the old woman . At first they frequently stopped to listen , but having heard the sentinel 's cry , " all 's well , " they seemed re-assured and moved with more confidence than before . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where a bright light was shining out from a little window upon the wet and drooping boughs that hung near it . The dog received them graciously , and they entered . A table was spread with some coarse provisions upon it , and a large jug , which one of the soldiers was about to seize , when the man who conducted them withheld him . " No , " said he , " we must first proceed to business . " He then went to a small closet , from which he returned with what seemed to have been originally a Bible , though now it was worn to a mahogany color and a spherical form . While they were doing this , Lee had time to examine his companions ; one of whom was a large quiet looking soldier , the other a short stout man with much the aspect of a villain . They examined him in turn , and as Lee had been obliged formerly to punish the shorter soldier severely , he felt some misgivings when the fellow 's eye rested upon him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen before . As no time was to be lost , their guide explained to them in few words , that , before he should undertake his dangerous enterprise , he should require of them to swear upon the Scriptures , not to make the least attempt to escape , and never to reveal the circumstances or agents in the proceeding , whatever might befal them . The soldiers , however , insisted on deferring this measure till they had formed some slight acquaintance with the contents of the jug , and expressed their sentiments on the subject rather by actions than words . In this they were joined by Lee , who by this time had begun to contemplate the danger of his enterprise in a new and unpleasant point of view . If he were to be compelled to accompany his party to New-York , his disguise would at once be detected , and it was certain that he would be hanged as a spy . He had supposed , beforehand , that he should find no difficulty in escaping at any moment ; but he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were to use in taking the life of any one who should attempt to leave them  --  and then the oath . He might possibly have released himself from its obligations , when it became necessary for the interests of his country ; but no honorable man can well bear to be driven to an emergency , in which he must violate an oath , however reluctantly it was taken . He felt that there was no retreating , when there came a heavy shock , as of something falling against the sides of the house ; their practised ears at once detected the alarm gun ; and their conductor , throwing down the old Bible , which he had held all the while impatiently in his hand , directed the party to follow him in close order , and immediately quitted the house , taking with him his dark lantern . They went on with great despatch , but not without difficulty . // Sometimes their footing would give way on some sandy bank or slippery field ; and when their path led through the woods , the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have deserted his precious companions while they were in this hurry and alarm ; but he felt , that , as yet , he had made no discoveries ; and however dangerous his situation was , he could not bear to confess that he had not nerve to carry it through . On he went , therefore , for two or three hours , and was beginning to sink with fatigue , when the barking of a dog brought the party to a stand . Their conductor gave a low whistle , which was answered at no great distance , and a figure came forward in the darkness , who whispered to their guide , and then led the way up to a building , which seemed , by the shadowy outline , to be a large stone barn . They entered it , and were severally placed in small nooks where they could feel that the hay was all around them , except on the side of the wall . Shortly after , some provisions were brought to them with the same silence , and it was signified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of the coming day . Through a crevice in the wall Lee could discover , as the day came on , that the barn was attached to a small farm-house . He was so near the house that he could overhear the conversation which was carried on about the door . The morning rose clear , and it was evident from the inquiries of horsemen , who occasionally galloped up to the door , that the country was alarmed . The farmer gave short and surly replies , as if unwilling to be taken off from his labor ; but the other in-. mates of the house were eager in their questions , and , from the answers Lee gathered that the means by which he and his companions had escaped were as mysterious as ever . The next night , when all was quiet , they resumed their march , and explained to Lee that , as he was not with them in their conspiracy and was accidentally associated with them in their escape , they should take the precaution to keep him before them , just behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably lessened the chances in favor of his escape . He observed , from the direction of the stars , that they did not move in a direct line toward the Delaware , but they changed their course so often that he could not conjecture at what point they intended to strike the river . He endeavored , whenever any peculiar object appeared , to fix it in his memory as well as the darkness would permit , and succeeded better than could have been expected , considering the agitated state in which he traveled . For several nights they went on in this manner , being delivered over to different persons , from time to time ; and as Lee could gather from their whispering conversation , they were regularly employed on occasions like the present , and well rewarded by the British for their services . Their employment was full of danger ; and though they seemed like desperate men , he could observe that they never remitted their precautions . They were concealed by day in barns-cellarscaves made for the purpose , and similar retreats , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been enlarged , and the inmates , if there had been any , banished to make room for the living . The burying grounds were a favorite retreat , and on more occasions than one they were obliged to resort to superstitious alarms to // remove intruders upon their path ; their success fully justified the experiment , and , unpleasantly situated as he was , in the prospect of soon being a ghost himself , he could not avoid laughing at the expedition with which old and young fled from the fancied apparitions under clouds of night , wishing to meet such enemies , like Ajax , in the face of day . Though the distance to the Dela*vare was not great , they had now been twelve days on the road , and such was the vigilance and suspicion prevailing throughout the country , that they almost despaired of effecting their object . The conductor grew impatient , and Lee 's companions , at least one of them , became ferocious . There was , as we have said something unpleasant to him in the glances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce as they went on ; but it did not appear whether it were owing to circumstances or actual suspicion . It so happened that , on the twelfth night , Lee was placed in a barn , while the rest of the party sheltered themselves in the cellar of a little stone church , where they could talk and act with more freedom , both because the solitude of the church was not often disturbed even on the sabbath  --  and because even the proprietors did not know that illegal hands had . added a cellar to the conveniences of the building . The party were seated here as the day broke , and the light , which struggled in through crevices opened for the purpose , showed a low room about twelve feet square , with a damp floor and large patches of white mould upon the walls . Finding , probably , that the pavement afforded no accommodations for sleeping , the worthies were seated each upon a little cask , which seemed like those used for gunpowder . Here they were smoking pipes with great diligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canteen to their mouths , from which they drank with upturned faces expressive of solemn satisfaction . While they were thus engaged , the short soldier asked them in a careless way , if they knew whom they had in their party . The others started , and took their pipes from their mouths to ask him what he meant . " I mean , " said he , " that we are honored with the company of Captain Lee , of the rebel army . The rascal once punished me , and I never mistook my man when I had a debt of that kind to pay . Now I shall have my revenge. ** The others hastened to express their disgust at his ferocity , saying , that if , as he said , their companion was an American officer , all they had to do was to watch him closely . They said that , as he had come among them uninvited , he must go with them to New-York and take the consequences ; but meantime , it was their interest not to seem to suspect him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evidently his intention to go with them till they were ready to embark for New-York . The other persisted in saying that he would have his revenge with his own hand , upon which the conductor , drawing a pistol declared to him that if he saw the least attempt to injure Captain Lee , or any conduct which would lead him to suspect that his disguise was discovered , he would that moment shoot him through the head . The soldier put his hand upon his knife with an ominous scowl upon his conductor , but seeing that he had to do with one who was likely to be as good as his word , he restrained himself , and began to arrange // some rubbish to serve him for a bed . The other soldier followed his example , and their guide withdrew , locking the door after him . The next night they went on as usual , but the manner of their conductor showed that there was more danger than before ; in fact , he explained to the party , that they were now not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before midnight . They occasionally heard the report of a musket , which seemed to indicate that some movement was going on in the country . Thus warned , they quickened their steps , and it was not long before they saw a gleam of broad clear light before them , such as is reflected from calm waters even in the darkest night . They moved up to it with deep silence ; there were various emotions in their breasts ; Lee was hoping for an opportunity to escape from an enterprise which was growing too serious , and the principal objects of which were already answered ; the others were *Lnxious lest some accident might have happened to the boat on which they depended for crossing the stream . When they came to the bank there were no traces of a boat on the waters . Their conductor stood still for a moment in dismay ; but , recollecting himself ; he said it was possible it might have been secured lower down the stream , and , forgetting every thing else , he directed the larger soldier to accompany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he whispered , " if the rebel officer attempts to betray us , shoot him ; if not , you will not , for your own sake , make any noise to show where we are . " In the same instant they departed and Lee was left alone with the ruffian . He had before suspected that the fellow knew him , and now doubts were changed to certainty at once . Dark as it was , it seemed as if ' fire flashed from his eye , now he felt that revenge was in his power . Lee was as brave as any officer in the army ; but he was unarmed , and though he was strong , his adversary was still more powerful . While he stood , uncertain what to do , the fellow seemed enjoying the prospect of revenge , as he looked upon him with a steady eye . Though the officer stood to appearance unmoved , the sweat rolled in heavy drops . from his brow . lie soon took his resolution , and sprang upon his ad-* versary with the intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other was upon his guard , and aimed with such precision , that , had the pistol been charged with a bullet , that moment would have been his last . But it seemed that the conductor had trusted to the sight of his weapons to render the use of them unnecessary , and had therefore loaded them only with powder ; as it was , the shock threw Lee to the ground ; but fortunately , as the fellow dropped the pistol , it fell where Lee could reach it , and as his adversary stooped , and was drawing his knife from his bosom , Lee was able to give him a stunning blow . He immediately threw himself upon the assassin7 and a long and bloody struggle began ; they were so nearly matched in strength and advantage , that neither dared unclench his hold for the sake of grasping the knife ; the blood gushed from their mouths , and the combat would have probably ended in favor of the assassin , when steps and voices were heard advancing , and they found themselves in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion , and were scouring the banks of the river . They were forcibly torn apart , but so exhausted and breathless , that neither could make any explanation , and they submitted quietly to the disposal of their captors . // The party of armed countrymen , though they had succeeded in their attempt , and were sufficiently triumphant on the occasion , were sorely perplexed to determine how to dispose of their prisoners . After some discussion , one of them proposed to throw the decision upon the wisdom of the nearest magistrate . They accordingly proceeded with their prisoners to his mansion , about two miles distant , and called on him to rise and attend to business . . A window was hastily thrown up , and the justice put forth his night-capped head , and , with more wrath than became his dignity , ordered them off ; and , in requital for their calling him out of bed in the cold , generously *vished them in the warmest place which then occurred to his imagination . However , resistance was vain ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners were brought before him , he ordered them to be taken in irons to the prison at Philadelphia . Lee improved the opportunity to take the old gentleman aside , and told him who he was , and why he was thus disguised ; the justice only interrupted him with the occasional inquiry , " Most done ? " When he had finished , the magistrate told him that his story was very well made , and told in a manner very creditable to his address , and that he should give it all the weight which it seemed to require . All Lee 's remonstrances were unavailing . As soon as they were fairly lodged in prison , Lee prevailed on the jailer to carry a note to Gen. Lincoln , informing him of his condition . The General received it as he was dressing in the morning , and immediately sent one of his aids to the jail . That officer could not believe his eyes when he saw Captain Lee . His uniform , worn out when he assumed it , was now hanging in rags about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortnight ; he wished , very naturally , to improve his appearance before presenting himself before the Secretary of War ; but the orders were peremptory to bring him as he was . The General loved a joke full well ; his laughter was hardly exceeded by the report of his own cannon ; and long and loud did he laugh that day . When Captain Lee returned to Lancaster , he immediately attempted to retrace the ground ; and so accurate , under all the unfavorable cir cumstances , had been his investigation , that he brcinght to justice fifteen persons , who had aided the escape of British prisoners . It is hardly necessary to say to those who know the fate of revolutionary officers , that he received , for this ha*ardous and effectual service , no reward whatever P. //
