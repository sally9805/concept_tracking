txt THE biography of individuals , who have passed from the stage of life , distinguished by their actions and virtues , is not only a proper tribute to their memories , but the best lesson for imitation to those they leave behind . But the biography of the living , alike distinguished , has additional advantages . If it is just , it is a higher reward to a virtuous life than posthumous biography . It is a living , and therefore a more impressive , example for imitation ; and it enables society more fully to appreciate , and apply to the most beneficial purposes , those talents and virtues , which , without such publication , would be known in a sphere almost infinitely smaller . These remarks naturally occur to the mind in presenting to the public a sketch of the life of the Hon. Edward Everett . Mr. Everett was born in Dorchester , Norfolk County , Massachusetts , in 1794 . He descended from one of the earliest settlers of that state , who , near two centuries since , established himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers . The grandfather of Mr. Everett was a farmer in that town . his father , Oliver Everett , was apprenticed to a carpenter . After coming of age , he prepared himself for college , which he entered , somewhat late in life . In 1782 , he was settled as the pastor of the New South Church , in Boston . In the Biographical Dictionary of President Allen , it is stated " that after a ministry of ten years , and after having acquired a high reputation for the very extraordinary powers of his mind , the state of his health induced him to ask a dismission from his people , in 1792. " - President Kirkland was hi* successor in that church . After retiring from the VOL X* 24 // *ninistry , he purchased an estate in Dorchester , where he resided until his death , in 1802 . In 1799 , he was appointed a Judge of the Common Pleas ,  --  this office he held until his death . He left eight children , of whom the subject of this sketch was the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town schools of Dorchester and Boston , with the exception of a few months at Exeter Academy , and at a private school under the charge of the late Ezekiel Webster , of New-Hampshire . At thirteen years old Mr. Everett entered the University . He was the youngest member of his class . lie graduated in 1811 , having sustained , through his collegiate course , the highest reputation as a scholar . The law was the profession of his choice ,  --  a profession in which he must have attained a most distinguished rank . But , at that early period of his life , being only seventeen , he yielded his own opinion to the persuasion of his friends , particularly to the influence of his pastor , the late Rev. J. S. Buckminster . He pursued the study of divinity two years , at Cambridge , during one of which he filled the office of Latin tutor . In 1813 , at nineteen years old , he succeeded his friend , Mr. Bnckminster , as pastor of the church in Brattle-street , in Boston . His labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much so as to impair his health . During the first eight months of his ministry , in addition to his pulpit and pastoral duties , he wrote a most able defence of Christianity in reply to the work of Mr. English . In 1815 , the professorship of Greek Literature was founded , in Cambridge , by Mr. Elliot . Mr. Everett was invited to accept this office , receiving , with the invitation , permission to visit Europe to recruit his health . He asked and received a dismission from his church , and was inducted into the professorship before he was twenty-one years old . In the spring of 1815 , Mr. Everett embarked at Boston , for Liverpool , in one of the first ships that sailed after the peace , intending immediately to visit the Continent . But , on his arrival at Liverpool , he learned the escape of Napoleon from Elba , and was detained in London untU after the battle of Waterloo . From London he went , by the way of Holland , to Gottingen , which was , at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remained there more than , two years , to acquire the German language  --  to ascertain the state of learning and the mode of instruction in the German universities  --  and to study those branches of ancient literature appropriate to his professor* ship . During this residence , he visited Prussia , Holland , and many of the German cities ; and , during his residence abroad , made the ac. * quaintance of a large portion of the men of letters in Europe . The winter of 1817-18 , he spent in Paris , devoted to studies subsidiary to // isv his professorship . He there formed the acquaintance of Koray , whose writings have so powerfully contributed to the regeneration of modern Greece , and from him Mr. Everett derived no small share of the great interest he has uniformly evinced in the cause of that country . In the spring of 1818 he went to London , and was for several weeks in daily attendance in Parliament . He also spent a few weeks at Oxford and Cambridge , and visited Wales and Scotland . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of France , Switzerland , and Italy . He spent the winter in Rome , occupied in the study of ancient literature and antiquities , enjoying constant access to the library of the Vatican . At this period , he made the acquaintance of Canova , then employed on the Statue of Washiftgton . General Lyman was his fellow-traveler during most of the tour after leaving Germany . They went in company to the lonian Islands and Greece , and were , at Yanina , treated with great kindness by Ali Pacha , to whom they carried letters of introduction from Lord Byron . After visiting all that was intcresting inGreece , they proceeded to Troy , Constantinople , and Adrianople , and crossed the Balkan near the road taken by the Russian army . They then procaeded through Vienna to Paris and London , and returned home to the United States in 1819-Mr . Everett having been absent more than four years and a half . Soon after his return , he was invited by the proprietors of the NorthAmerican Review to join them and assume the editorship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published once in two months , and the subscription did not exceed six hundred . Under the auspices of Mr. Everett it was changed into a quarterly publicatien , a new series was commenced , and so rapid was the increase of the cir* culation , that it became necessary to republish a second and even a third edition of some of the numbers . This was the first instance of tt critical journal that succeeded in establishing itself firmly in this country . Mr. Everett , in this undertaking , received not only the aid of the former contributors , but that of many new ones , and was particularly indebted to his distinguished brother , A. H. Everett , late minister to Spain . In 18*23 , the editorship passed into the hands of Mr. Sparks , and afterwards into those of Mr. A. II . Everett . During all this period , however , Mr. Edward Everett has regularly contributed to this journal , especially since his brother assumed the editorial tonduct of it . From the first moment of his connexion with the Review , he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country against the slanders of British tourists and essayists . He had discovered , whilst abroad , that the war kept up against us was a war against liberal // principles , and that America was vilified in order that free institutions might he disparaged . This unbroken tide of detraction was producing an unfavorable influence on the minds of our young men . In the second number of the new series , in commenting on Mr. Walsh 's " Appeal from the Judgements of Great-Britain , " Mr. Everett commenced a systematic vindication of our country . This called forth a flippant commentary from one of the contributors to the New Monthly Magazine , then edited by Thomas Campbell . To this Mr. Everett rejoined . Mr. Campbell , in a subsequent number , bestowed his approbation on this reply . These articles have been approved by the candid presses in England , and been well received here , and have had great influence in changing the character of the English press to a more respectful tone towards this country . After Mr. Everett 's return from Europe , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of his professorship . He prepared and delivered a complete course of lectures on the history of Greek literature , containing an account of the lives and works of every Greek classic author , besides several shorter courses , amongst them one on Antiquities , and another on Ancient Art . He also prepared a translation of Buttman 's German Greek Grammar , and a class-book on the basis of Jacob 's Greek Reader . The situation of Greece had ever excited the deepest sympathies of Mr. Everett ; and the " restoration of Greece " had formed the subject of his Oration so early as 1814 , when he took his second degree at the University . This interest had been greatly increased by his personal intercourse with Greeks , his personal observation of their capacity for improvement , and their oppressions . In 1822 , he received from Koray the address of the first revolutionary body assembled in Greece , to the people of the United States , with a request to translate and publish it . This failed , however , to attract much notice . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Everett published a most animated appeal to the people of America , containing an entire translation of the Constitution of Epidaurus . A great interest in behalf of Greece soon manifested itself in various parts of the Union , and liberal subscriptions were made in aid of the cause ; and , at the next session of Congress , Mr. Webster took up the subject , and urged it upon the American people . In 1824 , when La Fayette visited Cambridge , Mr. Everett , who had formed his acquaintance at Paris , was selected as the Orator of the Phi Beta Kappa Society . The subject of his Oration , was the peculiar motives to intellectual ezertion in America . In discussing the various topics thus presented , Mr. Everett dwelt largely on the new form of // civil society , which has been here devised and established  --  the extension of one language , government and character , over so vast a space as the United States of America  --  and the growth of the country , with a rapidity entirely without example in the old world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of which this memoir is chiefly composed , ) will be relieved by an extract from this Oration , taken almost without choice in selection . " This march of our population westward has been attended with consequences in some degree novel , in the history of the human mind . It is a fact , somewhat difficult of explanation , that the refinement of the ancient nations seemed almost wholly devoid of an elastic and expansive principle . The arts of Greece were enchained to her islands and her coasts ; they did not penetrate the interior . The language and literature of Athens were as unknown , to the north of Pindus , at a distance of two hundred miles from the capital of Grecian refinement , as they were in Scythia . Thrace , whose mountain tops may almost be seen from the porch of the temple of Minerva at Sunium , was thc proverbial abode of barbarism . Though the colonies of Greece were scattered on the coasts of Italy , of France , of Spain , and of Africa , no extension of their population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not penetrate beyond the walls of the cities , where they were cultivated . How different is the picture of the diffusion ofthe arts and improvements of civilization , from the coast to the interior of America ! Population advances westward with a rapidity , which numbers may describe , indeed , but can not represent , with any vivacity to the mind . The wilderness , which one year is impassable , is trav* ersed the next by the caravans of the industrious emigrants , who go to follow the setting sun , with the language , the institutions , and the arts of civilized life . It is not the irruption of wild barbarians , come to visit the wrath of God on a degenerate empire ; it is not the inroad of disciplined banditti , marshaled by the intrigues of ministers and kings . It is the human family led out to possess its broad patrimony . The states and nations , which are springing up in the valley of the Missouri , are bound to us by the dearest ties of a common language , a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look with coldness on their rising myriads , she must forget that some of the best of her own blood is beating in their veins ; that her hardy children , with their axes on their shoulders , have been literally among the pioneers in this march of humanity ; that , young as she is , she has become the mother of populous states . What generous mind would sacrifice to a selfish preservation of local preponderance , the delight of beholding civilized nations rising up in the desert ; and the language , the manners , the institutions , to which he has been reared , carried with his household gods to the foot of the Rocky Mountains ? Who can forget that this extension of our territorial limits is the extension of the empire of all we hold dear ; of our laws , of our character , of the memory of our ancestors , of the great achievements in our history ? Whitbersoever the sons of the thirteen states shall wander , to southern or western climes , they will send back their hearts to the rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Atlantic // coast . These are placed beyond the reach of vicissitude . They have become already matter of history , of poetry , of eloquence : The love , where death has set his seal , Nor age can chill , nor rival steal , Nor falsehood disavow . " Divisions may spring up , ill blood may burn , parties be formed , and interests may seem to clash ; but the great bonds of the nation are linked to what is passed . The deeds of the great men , to whom this country owes its origin and growth , are a patrimony , I know , of which its children will never deprive themselves . As long as the Mississippi and the Missouri shall flow , those men and those deeds will be remembered on their banks . The sceptre of government may go where it will ; but that of patriotic feeling can never depart from Judah . In all that mighty region , which is drained by the Missouri and its tributary streams  --  the valley co-extensive with the temperate zone-will there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a father , that will not take his children on his knee and recount to them the events of the twenty-second of December , the nineteenth of April , the seventeenth of June , and the fourth of July ? " This then is the theatre , on which the intellect of America is to appear , and such the motives to its exertion ; such the mass to be influenced by its energies , such the crowd to witness its efforts , such the glory to crown its success . If I err , in this happy vision of my country 's fortunes , I thank God for an error so animating . If this be faise* may I never know the truth . Never may you , my friends , be under any other feeling , than that a great , a growing , an immeasurably expanding country is calling upon you for your best services . The name and character of our Alma Mater have already been carried by some of our brethren thousands of miles from her venerable walls ; and thousands of miles , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering , whose minds and hearts will act in sympathy with yours . " The most powerful motives call on us , as scholars , for those efforts , which our common country demands of all her children . Most of us are of that class , who owe whatever of knowledge has shone into our minds , to the free and popular institutions of our native land . There are few of us , who may not be permitted to boast , that we have been reared in an honest poverty or a frugal competence , and owe every thing to those means of education , which are equally open to all . We are summoned to new energy and zeal by the high nature of the experiment we are appointed in Providence to make , and the grandeur of the theatre on which it is to be performed . When the old world afforded no longer any hope , it pleased Heaven to open this lmmt refuge of humanity . The attempt has begun , and is going on , far from foreign corruption , on the broadest scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly rests with us to solve the great problem in human society , to settle , and that forever , the momentous questionWhether mankind can be trusted with a purely popular system ? One might almost think , without extravagance , that the departed wise and good of all places and times , are looking down from their happy seats , 4o witness what shall now be done by us ; that they who lavished their // treasures and their blood , of old , who labored and suffered , who spake and wrote , who fought and perished , in the one great cause of Freedom and Truth , are now hanging from thQir orbs on high , over the last solemn experiment of humanity . As I have wandered over the spots , once the scene of their labors , and mused among the prostrate columns of their Senate Houses and Forums , I have seemed almost to hear a voice from the tombs of departed ages-from the sepulchres of the nations , which died before the sight . They exhort us , they adjure us to be faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long trials of struggling humanity , by the blessed memory of the departed ; by the dear faith , which has been plighted by pure hands , to the holy cause of truth and man ; by the awful secrets of the prison-houses , where the sons of freedom have been immured ; by the noble heads which have been brought to the block ; by the wrecks of time , by the eloquent ruins of nations ,  --  they conjure us not to quench the light which is rising on the world . Greece cries to us , by the convulsed lips of her poisoned , dying Demosthenes ; and Rome pleads with us , in the mute persuasion of her mangled Tully . " Until 1824 , Mr. Everett had taken no part in politics . The representative of Middlesex district to Congress had declined a re-election , and another candidate had been regularly nominated . Without being consulted , Mr. Everett was nominated by a volunteer convention . Not intending to relinquish his professorship , before he consented to become a candidate , he consulted his friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gave it as their opinion , that he would be allowed to retain his professorship , as Mr. Adams had , whilst in the Senate of the United States . Unexpectedly to himself , he was elected by a handsome majority ; and equally unexpected was the decision of the Corporation of the University , that , by accepting a seat in Congress , he had vacated his professorship , as he had not the slightest idea of retiring from Academic life . But his final separation from the University was amicable , and he was shortly after elected , by the overseers , a permanent member of that body . In December , 1824 , he delivered the anniversary oration at Plymouth ; and , on the April following , the half-century oration at Concord , on the battle which commenced the war of the revolution . These orations are rich repasts to those who would study the feelings and principles of our fathers . In December , 1825 , he took his seat in Congress . His reputation had preceded him , and he was placed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Foreign Affairs being opposed to the mission at Panama , Mr. Everett drew the report of the committee on that subject , in which he fully sustained the policy of our government towards the American governments , and the propriety of the mission . He also made the report , from that Committee , on the // spoliations , by foreign powers , on our commerce . He had previously urged the validity of our claims in the North-American Review . His papers on that subject have since been collected in a volume . At this session , he took part in the debate on Mr. McDuffie 's proposed amendment of the Constitution . On the fourth of July , 1826 , a day signalized by the simultaneous deaths of Adams and Jefferson , he delivered a most popular oration before the citizens of Cambridge , and , on the first day of August subsequent , a eulogy on the characters of those deceased patriots . In the autumn of that year he was re-elected , by a vote nearly unanimous , and has continued to be , with but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this . At the second session of the nineteenth Congress , he was chairman of the Committee to whom was referred the controversy between Georgia and the General Government , in relation to the Creek Indians , and from the immense mass of documents submitted to this Committee , he made an elaborate report on the principles which had regulated our relations with the Indian tribes , and the history of the troubles in Georgia . In the recess between the sessions of Congress , he wrote a series of letters addressed to Mr. Canning , to disabuse the public mind in Europe and America , in relation to the misrepresentations , by Mr. Canning , of the course pursued by our government in this controversy . He also delivered the introductory lecture before the Mechanic Institute , then just formed in Boston , with Dr. Bowditch as President . At the first session of the twentieth Congress , he was in the minority . He was , however , notwithstanding , placed by Mr. Speaker Stevenson , at the head of the Committee of Foreign Affairs , and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of great labor and detail . At this session , the preposterous clamor about retrenchment was got up , and Mr. Everett defended the President , Mr. Adams , in the most able manner , against the unjust imputations that were cast on him durino this electioneering movement . In his speech on this occasion , Mr. Everett predicted the dissolution of the unnatural combination formed to overthrow the existing administration  --  a prediction which has been since so fully verified. * Mr. Sergeant and Mr. Everett * Before I sit down , Sir , I must ask leave to say , that if every member had spoken in the tone of the gentleman lions Tennessee , Mr. BELL , I should probably not have troubled the house . Jo almost every remark that fell from him , I yielded a hearty assent . I feel , not less strongly than he , though I misay be unable to express it with that manly force which enchained the atten* tion of the liotise , that tisis warfare is mali c*cmpli , without our even being able to plead , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The gentleman , with a liberality which I could not but admire , however little I might be willing to sanction the consciousness of political strength with which he spoke , told us Ihat She joy of the huutsman is in the chase , and that when the game is ron down , lie calls oil the *aek , ansi will not let thesis niangle tile carcass The genti man can not expect inc to neree with hini that the game is run down , but he will agree with me , that , of the // formed the minority of the Retrenchment Committee , and the masterly report from the minority was their joint production . Before the expiration of the first year of General Jackson 's administration , the mover of this project , the Chairman of this Committee , and two other members , four ardent friends , at that time , of General Jackson , became his decided opponents . In the summer of 1828 , Mr. Everett delivered an oration on the Fourth of July , before the citizens of Charlestown . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address on the erection of an Obelisk , to the memory of Harvard , the founder of our University , in the Grave-Yard at Charlestown . This monument was erected at the expense of the Graduates , and was done at the suggestion of Mr. Everett . He also5 in the North-American Review for October , exposed the gross misrepresentations of the Quarterly Review , in relation to our diplomatic intercourse . This article contained a minute account of the diplomatic controversy between this country and Great-Britain , for thirty years , particularly in relation to the North-Eastern Boundary , and the Mouth of the Columbia River . During the recess of Congress , he devoted three months to visit the western states , and proceeded as far south as New-Orleans . Public dinners were given to him at Nashville and Lexington , and in other places he was invited to public entertainments , which his engagements compelled him to decline . He was every where received with the utmost kindness , and has uniformly expressed the highest sense of the kindness and hospitality of the people of that section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . In the autumn of this year , he reviewed Captain Hall 's travels , and , by contrasting his remarks on Canada with those on the United States , pack which sprang at the throats of this administration , there were some , whose fangs were already fleshed in other game . And is the law of the chase altered ? Will not what has been , again be ? Believe me , Sir , it will ; the fate of Act on is no fable here : and scarcely will the gentleman 's gallant hontsman- ( unless some rare felicity of fortune shall elevate him above the lot of his predecessors , ) scarcely will he have wound his horn in triumph , when he will find , to his amazement , that he is the game , and some of those who have shared in the triumph of the chase will torn and spring upon him .

This even-handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalic To our own lips . // showed the absurd lengths to which Captain Hall had allowed his national prejudices to carry him . At the ensuing session of Congress , he a gain served on the Committee of Foreign Affairs , but not as Chairman . He closed the debate on the part of the opponents of the Indian Bill , which passed at this session , and also took an active part in the debate on the bill in relation to the frauds in the Custom-House . In the course of this winter , he delivered the annual address before the Columbian Institute in the House of Representatives . In the recess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the completion of the second century from the arrival of Governor Winthrop at that place , and the foundation of the colony of Massachusetts proper . He also delivered the Fourth of July Oration at Lowell . In the October number of the North-American Review , he wrote an elaborate article on the public land system of the United States and nullification ; and , in this article , introduced a letter he had received on that subject , from the venerable Madison . He also delivered an admirable address upon the Workiugmen 's party ,  --  and the introductory Franklin lecture at Boston . At the next session of Congress , on presenting some petitions , he gave a complete review of the points in which the rights of the Indians had been invaded by Georgia . In the spring of 1831 , he delivered a lecture before the Salem Lyceum on the subject of Reform , then agitated in England . This was afterwards enlarged , and published , in the form of a review , in the North-American Review . It attracted great attention here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited ( as a text ) by both parties in Parliament ; and few , if any , articles from a foreign source , have ever attracted so much attention . The next year , he further treated on this subject in the same Review . The past and passing events in England have stamped his views on this subject as prophetic , sound in principle , and profoundly imbued with a knowledge of the subject . Mr. Everett had for several years been President of the Phi Beta Kappa Society . The mysterious name , oaths , and injunctions of secrecy , hieroglyphical characters , grips , medals , and ribbons , appeared to him so exceedingly useless , that , at his instance , a special meeting was called , at which the secret character of the society was changed , and the door of mystery unclosed . In October , 1831 , he delivered the annual address before the American Institute at New-York . In this address , he proved that the great inducement to the adoption of our Constitution , was the prospect it // held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address which had peculiar reference to this topic , we make the following ex-tract " The present manufacturing system of the United States may be considered , partly as the result of the revenue laws of 1789 , which remained without essential changes till the embargo of 1807 , and partly as the effect of that and the other restrictive measures , and of the war which followed them . Those branches of industry , which are commonly called the mechanic arts , received , for the most part , though not without exception , an ample protection under the former laws - manufactures on a large scale , requirin* , great capital and skill , owed their existence to the total interruption of commerce . In the combined result , a very large amount of American capital was , at the peace of 1815 , found invested in manufactures . It was the prevalent opinion of the statesmen of that day , and those of the South among the foremost , that this capital ought to he protected ; and the success which had attended some of the manufactures , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion , as to the capacity of the country to support them . At this period , however , and for several years after , it is well known , that the current of opinion ran strongly against the protection of manufactures , by high duties , in the commercial parts of the Union . By slow degrees , the manufacturing system has won its way to greatly increased favor , even in those parts of the country where our commerce principally centres . The question , both as one of principle and fact , is better understood by the lights of experience . It is now recollected , that our navigation at the moment of its extreme depression was raised up under a system of protecting duties . The obligation of protecting capital invested under the pledge of the public faith , against foreign legislation and the ruinous fluctuations of the foreign market , is felt . Every evil predicted as likely or certain to fob low from the manufacturing system , has failed to arrive . High prices were foretold . The acquisition of skill and the perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at greatly reduced but not unprofitable prices . A defalcation of the revenue was predicted . The revenue , instead of falling off , has steadily sustained itself ; and instead of being obliged to resort to direct taxes , which it was supposed as late as 18*4 , both by friend and foe , we should have to do , we are now threatened with a national crisis proceeding from an overflowing treasury . Our manufacturing establishments , instead of proving seminaries of vice , as was apprehended , are honorably distinguished for order and morality , as I know from my own observation of the largest in the United States . It was said that the grass would grow up between the paving-stones of our principal commercial cities . It is not so in Boston . You best know how it is in Pearl Street , Wall Street , and Broadway . Our commerce and navigation have suffered no diminution . Our ship-yards are in a state of the most profitable activity ; our coasting trade and internal commerce have greatly increased , and a general prosperity pervades the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be regretted , exists to the general satisfaction , which this state of things is calculated to inspire ; // -I allude , of course , to the dissatisfaction pervading a portion of the Planting states , by whom the laws passed for the protection of American industry , are deemed unconstitutional , and severely oppressive upon their interests . I certainly shall not , at this hour , engage in a constitutional argument ; but I may observe that under a government organized upon a written constitution , almost every measure is likely to be represented , by its opponents , as unconstitutional . Few prominent measures of the government , from its organization , have failed to be considered as unconstitutional , by those opposed to them . The funding system and the assumption of the state debts ,  --  the Bank of the United States ,  --  the British Treaty ,  --  the Alien and Sedition laws ,  - -  the purchase of Louisiana ,  --  the embargo ,  --  the use of the militia in time of war ,  --  the system of internal improvements ,  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manufactures have been successively opposed as unconstitutional . It is , however , an important fact , that this last measure , the protection of manufactures , has but of late years been opposed , on that ground . By the first Congress , and many succeeding Congresses , it was not so regarded ; and I have already attempted to show , that , but for the firm belief and ardent hope that the Federal Constitution would protect and encourage the manufactures of the United States , it would never have been adopted . For this address , he received the gold medal of the Institute . At the first session of the twenty-first Congress , he prepared the minority report on the apportionment bill , in which he sustained Mr. Webster 's amendment . This he also advocated in a speech delivered on the passage of that bill . At the same session , he made a most elaborate speech on the tariff , in which he demonstrated , from a laborious examination of the results of the census , that the southern states were not injured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doctrine that the producer , and not the consumer , pays the duty . He also prepared the address of the National Republican Convention , which met at Worcester in October last . And in his speech before his townsmen in Charlestown , at the subsequent election in November he stated , that , if , in the impending crisis of the country , General Jackson should plant himself on the bulwarks of the Constitution , he would receive a warmer support from his opponents , than from a large class of his friends . This prediction , which has been so signally verified , was expressed by him in still stronger terms , many months previous , in his letters to his friends . Such is a brief , and by no means complete , sketch of the indefatigable labors of Mr. Everett . No man in this country has had greater advantages for education , and no one has improved his opportunities more diligently and successfully . His genius and talents fit him to shine in every sphere of life . His temper , his manners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is always // ready , at the expense of his time and utmost exertions , to benefit and instruct his fellow-citizens , and to aid and advance every proper enterprize . Notwithstanding his incessant labor , he is ever ready for any new call . No man can be more entirely devoted to his duties . His speeches are always made at the most appropriate times , and he uniformly brings to the debate new and important views . His * of eloquence is at once dignified and impressive-his language pure and elegant . He seldom , in his longest speeches , has recurrence to notes . He commands a breathless attention ; and his recent eloquent and most appropriate address at Fanueil Hall on the subject of the Bunker-Hill Monument-at Bunker-Hill on the visit of General Jackson-and at Worcester on the Fourth of July , are but fair specimens of what may ever be expected from him . Mr. Everett , during his short and brilliant career ,  --  notwithstanding the reproaches with which he has been visited for the expression of opinions at variance with those of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adherence to the principles which he considers essential to the security and prosperity of the state , and to the peace and happiness of the social community . Whatever conflicts may happen among the people , in consequence of differences of opinion on matters of inferior import and limited or local concern , it will be impossible that they should not look up to him as to one qualified to represent and protect their most important interests  --  to advocate their rights when denied , and to defend them when assailed  --  and to reflect back upon his constituents , with tenfold lustre , all the honors they confer . There is no office in their power to give , to which he may not aspire without arrogance , nor a station in the government , which he might not fill without hazarding the loss of personal honor or public respect.
