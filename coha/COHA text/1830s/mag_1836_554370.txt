txt THE present return of Halley 's comet seems a fit occasion for some remarks upon this class of heavenly bodies , and upon that wonderful science which has revealed to us the secret mechanism of their motions . How different the impression now produced upon the public mind , from that which was manifested five revolutions ago , in 1456 , when all good christians were solemnly called upon by their acknowledged head , the Pope , to curse the Comet together with the Turks , whose arms then threatened the subjugation of the fairest portions of christendom . We of the present day , have our eyes indeed directed to the same object , but with a state of mind how different ? We are not taken by surprise ; we are not alarmed at the novel spectacle ; we were fully prepared for it , were expecting it almost impatiently ; we had indicated the time when , and the spot where it was to make its first appearance ; had traced among the stars , the path it was to describe ; foretold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general increase of its magnitude and brightness ; when it was tobe seen with the telescope , and when with the naked eye . All these minute particulars , and many more have long been before the world . They have been presented in every variety of form , adapted to the comprehension of different classes of readers . What a responsibility is thus assumed , on the part of those who have undertaken to make the future present ? What confidence is thus manifested in the truth of those principles which have led to such astonishing predictions ? With what a firm and unhesitating faith have these predictions been received ? Who has doubted whether or not a comet would appear at this time , attended by those peculiar phenomena by which it has been distinguished ? is any one surprised at what has actually // occurred ; that in every essential particular the prediction has been verified ? It may be said , perhaps , that nine persons out of ten have not thought about the matter , and have given themselves no concern whether the comet made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to what was foretold . But we would ask whence this indifference and unconcern ? How happens it that men 's minds are not now agitated as they were formerly ? Who has taught us , that unusual appearances are no occasion for alarm and terror ? That they are not to be regarded as symptoms of derangement or interruptions of established order , or tokens of the displeasure of the Almighty ? Is not this absence of all anxiety and concern on the part of the unlearned one of the beneficial results , and not the least , which has attended the successful study of the stars ? From year to year we are taught in our almanacs , which are perhaps more widely diffused than any other class of publications , not only the regular and stated occurrences of particular seasons , but rare and extraordinary events in the heavens , as eclipses of the sun and moon , the obscuration of a star or planet , and now and then the return of a comet to the sun , after long wandering in the remote regions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the minutest detail as to time , place , and circumstance , and followed as they have now been , for so many years , with the most exact fulfilment , have had an almost miraculous influence upon the public mind . The most illiterate are capable of appreciating this evidence , this undeniable and irrefragable proof of the high advancement of that science , which has thus enabled us to penetrate the future , and to forewarn mankind of events that are to come . The history of this branch of astronomy , dates back only about two centuries . The accounts of comets that have come down to us from earlier times , although somewhat numerous , and in many cases relating to extraordinary celestial objects , are nevertheless so vague , and in all probability so exaggerated , as to he of little value . While the opinion prevailed , that comets were temporary fires lighted up in our own atmosphere , that is , of the same nature with those transient meteors that attract a momentary gaze and disappear , no exact observations were made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hypothesis so hastily and generally received . It appears not a little strange to us of the present day , that it // did not occur to men so acute , and sagacious as Aristotle and others , who evidently had paid some attention to this subject , that meteors , and all atmospherical objects are to be seen only over a small extent of the earth 's surface , and that they are seen in opposite directions from places not very remote from each other . The great meteor , for instance , which exploded over Weston , in the state of Connecticut , in 1807 , seemed to be in a southwesterly direction , to persons in the neighborhood of Boston , whereas to a spectator near Philadelphia , it appeared in the opposite part of the heavens ; and it was below the horizon , or wholly invisible , to persons situated at the distance of only a few hundred miles . Now it is very well known , that when a comet presents itself , it is not only seen over an extent of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same place in the heavens . It appears in the same constellation , and near the same star . The path of the present comet , for instance , traced among the stars , is essentially the same to European and American observers . It is hence manifest , without having recourse to any exact observations , that comets can not be very near the earth , as the ancient astronomers supposed ; that they must be far removed out of our atmosphere even to the region of the planets . This important circumstance was first fully ascertained by Tycho Brahe ; and being well established , it was sufficient of itself to overthrow the ancient doctrine on this subject . One reason , no doubt , why this crude opinion prevailed so long , was the belief in the existence of solid crystal orbs su pporting the planets , and *vheeling one within the other . The idea of large bodies , like what we now understand the comets to be , intersecting and traversing those solid spheres of crystal , was wholly inadmissible and irreconcilable with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the tendency of error to propagate itself . Comets being thus recognised as very distant bodies like the planets , the next inquiry was to ascertain the paths they described , and the laws which govern their motions . The keen and penetrating eye of Newton was now directed to this subject , and comets at once assumed the dignity of planets , revolving round the same central body , describing the same kind of curves , preserved in their places by the same forces , subjected to the same laws , and differing only , or principally in this : that their orbits are more oval , or more elongated , and // lie in all manner of directions . This bold position was put to the test , in the case of the remarkable comet of 1680 , which presented itself at this critical juncture , as if to vindicate this class of bodies of which it was so splendid a representative . The genius of Newton triumphed in this as in all his great enterprises ; and comets now began to be regarded as an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sublime theory beyond all question , and to convince the world of its truth , it was only necessary to identify a comet as one which bad before appeared , or , in other words , to foretel the return of one of these bodies , and delineate beforehand its path through the heavens . This nice and difficult task was undertaken and accomplished by Halley . By comparing a comet which appeared in 1682 , and which he saw himself , with one which was observed in 1607 , they seemed to describe one and the same orbit. * It was not to be supposed tbat two comets.would follow each other in identically the same path roun&amp;the sun . It was fairly presumed therefore , that these were not two separate comets , hut different appearances of one and the same comet ; and that the interval between 1607 and 1682 , or about 75 years , was the time employed to complete a revolution . This conclusion was rendered still more probable by going back about 75 years further , namely to 1531 , when we find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down to us , evidently pursued the same track through the heavens , which was described by that of 1607 , and that of 1602. if any doubt remained of the identity of these comets , it must certainly be removed , when we are told further , that at another interval of the same length , that is to say , in the year 1456 , there is a record of a comet whose path seemed evidently to correspond with those already referred to . An orbit is recognised to be the same with a former one , when it has in all respects the same position in the heavens , that is , when there is an agreement in the following particulars . 1 . The perihelion distance , or distance of the point of nearest approach to the sun . 2 . The position of this point or longitude of the perihelion . 3 The inclination of the plane of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. 4 . The position of the intersection of these planes , or the longitude of the node . 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to east like the planets or the reverse . The comet of 1682 , for instance , had its orbit determined as follows ; Perihelion Longitude of Inch Longitude rection. nation . node Di f the distance . the perihelion . o 0 . 58 Sun 's 301* 36 ' 170 42 ' 50*48* Retrograde. distance from the earth , being 1 . The following are the corresponding particulars for the comet of 1607. 0.58 302* 16 ' l7* 2 ' 50* 21 ' Retrograde. // With such evidence before him , Halley ventured to infer that the comet of 1692 revolved round the sun , in about seventy-five or seventy-six years , and that consequently it might be expected to appear again , after the lapse of another such period . He accordingly had the courage and the good fortune to predict that this same comet would return towards the close of the year 1758 , or the beginning of 1759 . The time of a revolution seemed to be liable to considerable variation , which might be attributed , with great probability , to the attraction of the planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as precisely as the nature of the case would admit , Clairaut undertook to calculate the effect which the larger planets , Jupiter and Saturn would have , in accelerating or retarding the motion of the comet , the result of which was , that the return of the comet to its perihelion , would be delayed by these two planets , about one year and eight months . The time fixed by Clairaut for the comet 's reaching its point of nearest approach to the sun , was the 4th of April . He observed , at the same time , that he might err a month , by neglecting small quantities in the calculation . The comet was first seen near Dresden , by a peasant , on the 25th of December , 1758 , thus verifying the prediction of Halley ; and it passed its point of nearest approach to the sun , the 13th of March , 1759 , within twenty-three days of the time fixed by Clairaut , for the perihelion passage , and accordingly falling within the assigned limits . The fulfilment of this memorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis . It has not only confirmed those who had entered into all the a priori reasoning upon the subject , but it was of a nature to carry conviction to the unlearned and the sceptical , to convert the mass of mankind , and make them firm believers , not only in the new doctrine respecting comets , but in the whole science of modern astronomy . A comet is no longer a meteor , a transient fire in our atmosphere . It is no longer a messenger of evil . It is no longer to be*dreaded as a mysterious and unwelpome intruder among the celestial luminaries . It is to he ranked among the great works of nature . It is not only a curious object to behold , but it affords an interesting subject of contemplation . We delight to trace it through its long journey of three fourths of a century ; and when the eye can no longer distinguish it , to follow it in imagination , as it pursues its upward flight , leaving planet after planet far behind , penetrating the unexplored depths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ceasing its ascent , till it has doubled the distance of the most remote of the planetary bodies . Other comets are at length found , as might he expected , to possess the character of revolving bodies . A comet appeared in 1818 , which was recognised as one which had been observ* ed several times before . Its orbit was of so small an extent , compared with that of most comets , as to admit of its period , or time of a complete revolution , being computed . This was ascertained by Encke , to he about three years and a third , and its return was predicted to take place in June 1822 . As .. tronomers were apprised at the same time , tl ) at its situation in the heavens , would he such as to render it invisible in Europe and this country ; but that it would be seen by the inhabitants of New South Wales . it actually returned according to the prediction ; and after sufficient time had elapsed for intelligence to arrive from that quarter of the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made by Mr. Rumker , an expe .. rienced astronomer , at Paramata , completely justifying the anticipations of the sagacious Encke . This name has therefore already become familiar to us , like that of Halley , as a convenient means of designating a comet , with which we are continually becoming more and more acquainted , and through it , with the whole class to which it belongs . As it completes a revolution in about three years and a third , it has returned several times since 1822 , namely , in 1825 , 1828 , 1832 , and in the month of August of the year just closed . These frequent returns have been applied to a valuable purpose . They have served to teach us that the celestial spaces are in all probability not absolutely void , as we have been accustomed to regard them . There is the strongest reason for believing that this comet is resisted by an ether or some extremely rare me dium . At each successive return , the evidence has accumulated , till at last the position assumed seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supposed medium has been , by checking the motion of the comet , in the direction of a tan* gent to its orbit , to cause the attraction toward the sun to predominate , whereby the path described is continually contracted into a sort of spiral , the time of a revolution at the same time being continually diminished . The amount of this diminution is found to be about two days each revolution , after making allowance , with all possible precision , for the disturbing influ* ence of the planets . No other effect has been observed // to take place , after the most careful scrutiny , except that which would necessarily arise from the alleged cause . Another comet is now supposed to afford additional evidence on this all important point , which gives an extraordinary interest , to each successive return of those comets whose periods are known . " It can not he doubted , " says Sir John Herschel , " that many more will be discovered , and by their resistance , questions will come to be decided , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisting medium which surrounds the sun ? Is it at rest or in motion ? If the latter , in what direction does it move ? Circularly round the sun , or traversing space . If circularly , in what plane ? It is obvious that a circular or vorticose motion of the ether would accelerate some comets and retard others , according as their revolution was , relative to such motion , direct or retrograde . Supposing the neighborhood of the sun to be filled with a material fluid , it is not conceivable that the circulation of the planets in it for ages , should not have impressed upon it some degree of rotation , in their own direction , and thus may preserve them from the extreme effects of accumulated resistance . " * Another comet , known as Biela 's , appeared in 1826 . It is recognised as being the same which was observed in 1805 and in 1772 . It was found to have a period of six years and thi'ee quarters . Its return was accordingly predicted to take place in October , 1832 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place assigned . it is remarkable for its near approach , not to the earth itself , but to the earth 's orbit , the least distance being less than the sum of the semidiameters of the comet and the earth , so that if the earth had happened to be in that point , at the same time with the comet , it would certainly have been involved , to a greater or a less degree , in the nebulous matter of the comet . The earth , in fact , reached this point , a month later than the comet , and did not , at any time , come within about fifty millions of miles , or half the distance of the earth from the sun . This comet , at its greatest distance from the sun , departs about six times the earth 's distance , or somewhat beyond the orbit of Jupiter . Its next return will take place in 1838 . It is thus abundantly proved that comets are revolving bodies like the planets , and that they obey the same great laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marked difference in their physical constitution . Comets appear to be composed of a substance extremely light compared with that of the planets . Thus Halley 's comet which , as we have seen , was detained a year and eight months by the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn , seems to have had little or no reciprocal influence upon either of these planets . A still more striking instance to the same purpose , occurs in a comet which appeared in 1770 , which , according to the highest authority , had been revolving in an orbit that did not admit of its being seen from the earth , completing a revolution in about fifty years ; but passing in 1767 within a short distance of Jupiter , its course was entirely changed , so as to bring it near to the earth in 1770 , and cause it to complete one revolution about the sun in the short period of about five years and a half . Coming near to Jupiter a second time , in the remote part of its course , its orbit is again shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one of these cases the comet is proved to have passed so near to Jupiter , that its attraction to this planet was two hundred times greater than its attraction to the sun . Still , it not only had no sensible effect upon the planet itself , but it did not even disturb the motion of its satellites , although it passed between them and the body of Jupiter . This cornet came nearer to the earth than any other whose path is known . Its least distance was about six times that of the moon . It was retarded in consequence , about two days , by the earth 's attraction . If the comet had the same quantity of matter with the earth , it must have affected the length of our year to the amount of nearly three hours ; but it did not exert the least perceptible influence . If the year had suffer .. ed an alteration to the amount of two seconds , it would probably have been detected . It is hence inferred that the quantity of matter contained in this comet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the earth . What is here stated with respect to the lightness of comets , agrees very well with the result of actual observation . Many comets have appeared that seem to be destitute of any nucleus or solid , compact mass at the centre . They are apparently composed of a matter resembling the thinnest vapor , so that the light of the faintest star which is obscured by the least perceptible fog , scarcely suffers any diminution by penetrating many thousand miles of this substance . The comets of Eneke // and Biela , and some others , seem to be thus constituted . In those cases where there are signs of a solid nucleus , it is for the most part of small extent . It has been estimated in two instances at less than thirty miles in diameter . The comets of 1807 and 1811 were supposed by Sir W. Herschel to have each a diameter of about five hundred miles . Even where there is the appearance of a compact mass at the centre , there is still surrounding it , the same nebulous appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cases , the whole matter of the comet . This nebulous appearance , instead of being of a uniform or a progressively increasing brightness from the circumference inward , is often apparentlycomposed of one or more rings or strata , many thousand miles in thickness , alternating with fainter portions , an appearance not unlike what would be presented to a spectator viewing from a distance our earth with its different layers of clouds , one above another separated by portions of transparent atmosphere . A remarkable circumstance has been observed in two or three instances , which consists in the great contraction of the body of the comet as it approaches the sun . Encke 's comet was carefully examined at different distances from the sun , varying from about one hundred and fifty to fifty millions of miles . In the former case , its diameter was twenty-five times as great as in the latter , and its bulk , of course , was reduced to about one sixteen thousandth part by a reduction of its distance to one third part . This enormous change in its dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density of the sun 's atmosphere , the gaseous matter of the comet , being , as is supposed , more and more condensed as it penetrates the denser strata of this supposE ( l medium , just as a balloon is enlarged or contracted , according as it is situated in a denser or rarer part of the earth 's atmosphere . Others suppose , that as the parts of the nebulous matter of the comet are distant , and held together by so feeble a power , they revolve in a degree independently of one another , each having its own perihelion , whereby they are brought nearer to each other , as they approach the sun , and separate again farther and farther as they depart from it . Another hypothesis is that the nebulous matter of the comet , like fog or common vapor , which disappears before the rising sun , ceases to be visible , in like manner , as the comet approaches its perihelion , in consequence of the heat to which it is exposed , and that it is restored to its sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the solar rays . // But the most obvious and striking characteristic of comets , especially to the majority of observers , is the luminous train , called the tail , with which they are generally attended . We say generally , since this is not hy any means a constant appendage . Many comets have appeared , as those of Eneke and Biela , that seemed to be as round as the planets . Others again , as the present comet for instance , have exhihited a train only in certain parts of their course and not in others : sometimes it is visible only in certain parts of the earth , and in certain states of the atmosphere . Where it exists at all it seems to increase as the comet approaches the sun , and to be more conspicuous , and of greater extent after the comet has passed its perihelion than before . It is also remarked that the direction of this luminous train is , for the most part , in a line oppo* site to the sun . There are remarkable exceptions , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be at right and gles to a line joining the comet and sun . In its common position the train is often curved more or less , the extreme parts being left as it were a little behind , while the preceding or convex portion is ohserved to be somewhat brighter than the rest , as though there were some rare medium which condensed the luminous matter and slightly impeded its motion . Where the train is not curved , it is often remarked that the light is faintest in the middle and strongest towards the edges , as though it were a hollow cylinder , or truncated cone . The tail is sometimes divided into two or more branches , lying in some cases the same way , hut often more or less inclined to each other . The comet of 1744 had six tails , opening and diverging like the sticks of a fan , but curved at the same time like a sickle . They were each about 40 broad , and from 30* to 440 long . The light was so strong , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been observed of all lengths less than 1000 . The absolute lengths have been computed in many instances , and found to vary from a few millions to one hundred millions of miles . Nothing that deserves the name of an explanation has yet been offered , respecting the constitution and manner of production of this curious phenomenon . The hypothesis most in vogue , is that which ascribes it to the mechanical impulse of the solar rays , penetrating such an extent of vaporous matter very feebly held together by the small central attraction ; just // as a discharge of shot through a mass of cotton or eider down may he supposed to carry a portion of this light substance with it , to different distances . This notion is of course wholly inapplicable to those cases where the luminous train does not lie in the direction of the sun 's rays . It is , moreover , less entitled to consideration , now that light itself , instead of being an emanation of particles , is beginning to be more generally considered , as depending upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very ether indicated by Encke 's comet , as already mentioned . It seems to be taken for granted , that this train is a material substance , and that this substance is of the same nature with the nebulous atmosphere of the comet ; and that it once made a part of that atmosphere . But boxy is it separated and borne along to such enormous distances ? What power retains it , and keeps it in its relative place , when , as it should seem , the attraction exerted by such an inconsiderable mass as that of a comet , is wholly insufficient ? What should cause the extremity of the tail , to move ten or twenty times as fast as the comet itself , when it is so many times farther from the sun , as it must do in order to keep the same position with respect to the central body ? If it is said in reply , that it is perpetually renewed by every new emission of solar light , we beg leave to ask what becomes of these long trains , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they not continue to reflect the light that falls upon them , long after they have been generated ? thus producing a broad luminous tract throughout the space over which the tail has swept . It is indeed , generally admitted , that more or less of the luminous train is left behind , and wholly detached from all connexion with the body , whence it proceeded . This is rendered probable , not only for the reasons above suggested ; but also from the fact that in several instances this appendage is found to become shorter and shorter , and less and less conspicuous , at each successive return . Not only the train , but the body of the comet seems to be wasting away , as in the case of Biela 's , which at its last return could scarcely be discerned with a good ten feet telescope , in the most skilful hands ; and was actually invisible to the inhabitants of this continent ; for want of sufficient aid to the natural sight . If comets are thus destined to part with the matter of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // strewed with this highly rarified , and all but immaterial substance , we have arrived at a probable source of that medium , which seems to have been detected by the motions of Encke 's comet . We may remark also , that the substance surrounding the sun , and lying in the direction of its equator , and extending many millions of miles , giving rise to what is called the zodiacal light , * may have the same origin , that is , may be composed of the tails of innumerable comets.t Indeed , the sun itself may be said to have a tail or train extending in opposite directions , borrowed , perhaps , by little and little from each passing comet ; and this train may in some degree resemble that of a comet , and be a conspicuous object to a spectator situated in such a manner as to admit of its being seen unmixed and unobseured by the light of his own atmosphere . It will be inferred , we are aware , from what we have said , that comets may , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed into the sun 's atmosphere , and thus cease to be comets any longer . There is also another way in which they may terminate their existence as comets . This very medium , this solar atmosphere , strewed with the wreck of we know not how many of these ill fated bodies , seems fitted to prove destructive to many more . Eucke 's comet , by its short period and frequent returns , affords the best opportunity hitherto presented , ofjudging of the consequences that must result from such a state of things . This comet is evidently approaching nearer and nearer to the sun , each revolution . There is no cause known to astronomers , that can save it from its impending fate ; and hereafter , when we shall have become familiar with the return of comets , and are well acquainted with their diminishing periods , it may become an object of emulation to astronomers , to calculate and foretell the time when a comet shall terminate its career by falling into the sun . The comet of 1680 has already approached so near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter distant when in perihelion . * This light is of a pyramidal or leaf-like shape , having the sun for its basis and the ecliptic , or rather the solar equator for its axis , or line of direction . It is faint like the tail ot a comet , or the milky way , and is for the most part confounded with the twilight , except in low latitudes , where it is more frequently seen . But in the month of April , in the evening , or in October , in the morning , it makes so large an angle with the horizon in the temperate latitudes , and extends so high , that it may he seen after the twilight has ceased in the evening , and before it begins in the morning . // It appeared in Newton 's time , and no doubt seems to have existed in the mind of that great man , that it would at some future epoch , cease to revolve . This opinion he retained to the latest period of his life , and he seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elapse before such a catastrophe would take place ; " possibly " he says , " after five or six revolutions. ** This idea of the destiny of comets , that they were designed ultimately to fall into the sun , and be consumed , was the more readily received formerly , when the sun was regarded as a mass of ignited matter , that required replenishing like our domnestic fires . Light itself , moreover , being supposed to be an emission of particles , it seemed to be necessary to find some means of supplying this continual exhaustion of the sun 's substance . Other and more remote phenomena were referred to as strikingly analogous to the case in question . Several of the fixed stars had , at different times , suddenly burst forth with great splendor , so as to surpass even Jupiter and Venus , and in some instances to be visible in the day time . These stars , it was supposed , oxved their increased brilliancy to a fresh supply of fuel in the form of a precipitated comet . Such are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has produced . But among astronomers of the present time , who allow this tendency in cometary bodies toward the sun , without being able to point out any sufficient check , some maintain that matter so exceedingly rare , and indeed matter of any kind and of any form with which we are acquainted , must in all probability be completely volatalized by the solar heat , and absorbed into the solar atmosphere , long before it could reach the body of the sun . It is believed that some comets already give indications of a rapid approach to this sort of dissolution . Another fruitful subject of speculation relates to the possibility or probability of a comet 's coming so near the earth , as to occasion a great revolution in the physical condition of our globe . The nearest approach of one of these bodies that has hitherto taken place , so far as our knowledge extends , was that of the comet of 1770 , as already mentioned . The least distance , in this case , was no less than 1,456,840 miles . No effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly slight one , if it had existed , must have been detected . // A much nearer approach than this , is liable to take place , from the known position of the orbits of other comets whose elements have been calculated . The great comet of 1*i80 , so remarkable in other respects , is also distinguished as coming near to the earth 's path . Its least distance is about twice that of the moon , or 440,000 miles . Its attractive force , therefore , would be only one fourth of that of the moon , on the supposition that it contained as much matter . Even this force would be exerted only for a short time , not long enough , probably , to produce any sensible disturbance in the waters of the ocean . The effect of the moon in causing the tides , is ( he accumulated result of a long continued effort , with comparatively little change in the position of the attracting body , or the direction of its action . With all the force that the moon actually exerts , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disturbing the ocean , if it were to dart by us with the rapidity of the comet under consideration . Biela 's comet has already been described as coming so near the earth 's track , as to be liable actually to involve a part of the earth at least , in its nebulous atmosphere . Let us now see what chance there is of the earth 's being , for instance , within half a million miles either way , of the particular point of danger . There being in the circumference of the earth 's orbit six hun-* dred millions of miles , in round numbers ; on the supposition that the comet passed the point in question , once a year , there would be an equal chance for each portion of a million of miles , that the earth would be there at that juncture ; of course , according to the doctrine of chances , the earth may be expected to be within half a million of miles of the point under consideration , once in six hundred years , it being supposed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it actually passes it only once in six years and three quarters , the above period must be increased in the same proportion ; that is , the near approach of the earth and comet , above referred to , can not be supposed to occur more than once in about forty centuries . Allowing the possibilitxr of the event in question , what would be the probable consequences of a near approximation , or even a rencountre ? Not , so far as we can judge , a violent shock or concussion , like that occasioned by one vessel running against another , not a sudden and overwhelminz rush of the waters of the ocean over the land . This comet of Biela , according to the best information we possess , seems to be merely // a collection of the thinnest possible vapor . Let us imagine a person in a balloon approaching a cloud . The object might seem a formidable one ; but the mronaut is plunged in the vaporous mass before he is aware of it . He is sensible of no material change ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscurity in the objects around him , and wonders what has become of the cloud that seemed so menacing in the distance . So it may be with regard to comets . We may have already encountered one of these bodies without ever dreaming of it . We may have been enclosed in its vast envelope without perceiving any change , except , perhaps , some peculiar hue in the atmosphere , or some uncommon tint in the objects about us . We are passing frequently through parts of space that have , in all probability , been visited by the enormous train of some comet , and which , we have reason to believe , still retain traces of this substance . It is hardly possible to conceive that the earth should have escaped all contact with an element so widely diffused , or that it should fail to attract and appropriate to itself some portion of this matter . We see the zodaical light , sup posed to be identical with the substance in question , embracing the orbits of Mercury and Venus , and of course enveloping these planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the consequences that we seem to dread from the introduction of matter so foreign . There is little reason to believe that the earth is exempt froin the same lot , and little ground to apprehend evil from a condition thatseems the necessary result of the original constitution of thesystem to which we belong . What the tail of a comet is , it were vain to conjecture . Some future chemist may perhaps tell us . But whatever it be , whether watery vapor or any other vapor , or one of the permanent gases , or something different from all these , and wholly unlike any of our ai*riforin substances , there is little reason to suppose that it would , on the whole , be injurious . Even if it were deleterious in itself , if it were the most virulent poison , still , according to all that we know of it , it is so exceedingly rare , and would constitute so very small a proportion as an ingredient of the air we breathe , that no evil could be apprehended from it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by volcanoes and discharged into our atmosphere , may often be found to exist in much greater quantity , compared with the vital principle , especially in the vicinity of the volcano , than we are liable to be exposed to , from the largest // influx from a comet* s train . Such an accession of matter to our globe , although it is believed to have actually takei place , perhaps more than once , has not as yet , been distinctly and satifactorily recot*nised . There are several instances on record , of a peculiar state of the atmosphere , that has been ascribed to the presence of matter from this source . The following are Mr. Arago 's statements and reasoning upon this subject . " The fog of 1788 began nearly on the same day ( the 18th of June ) in places very distant from each other , as Paris , Avignon , Turin , Padna ; " It extended from the northern coast of Africa to Sweden ; it was also observed in a great part of North America ; " It lasted more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the lower regions , did not appear to be its vehicle , because in some places it came on with a north wind , and in others with a *outh or east wind ; " Travellers found it on the highest summits of the Alps ; " The abundant rains which fell in June and July , and the highest winds , did not disperse it ; " In Languedoc , its density was occasionally so great that the sun did not become visible , in the morning , till it was 152* above the horizon ; it was very red the rest of the day , and might be looked at with the naked eye . " This fog or smoke , as some meteorologists have called it , had a disagreeable odor . " The property by which it was particularly distinguished from common fogs , was its being , by all accounts , very dry , whereas most fogs are moist . At Geneva , S*nebier found that the hair hygrometer of Saussure , which in real fogs stands at 1000 , ranged in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even 570 . " Besides all this , there was one very remarkable quality in the fog or smoke of 1783 ; it appeared to possess a phosphoric property , a light of its own . I find , at least in the accounts of some observers , that it afforded , even at midnight , a light which they compare to that of the full moon , and which was sufficient to enable one to see objects distinctly at a distance of two hundred yards . To remove all doubts as to the source of this light , it is recorded that at the time there was a new moon . " Such is the state of the facts ; let us now see whether , in order to explain them , it will be necessary to admit , that in 1783 the earth was immersed in the tail of a comet . " The fog of 1783 was neither so constant , nor so thick , as to prevent the stars being seen every night , in all the places where it occurred . Admitting therefore that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is but one way of explaining why the head of that comet was never seen , and this is , by supposing , that it rose and set almost at the same time with the sun ; that the superior light of that luminary rendered it invisible ; and that this conjunction of the sun and comet lasted more than a month . " At a time when the proper motions of comets appeared subject to no rule , when every one disposed of them as he pleased , considering them as mere meteors , the supposition we have just made might be admitted ; but now that comets are known to all astronomers to be heavenly bodies , as obedient as the planets to the laws of Kepler ; now that the mutual dependence of distance and velocity is known ; now that observation and theory combine to prove that all these bodies necessarily move in their orbits with a rapidity that increases as they approach the sun , it would be contrary to all established principles to admit that a comet , interposed between the sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner as to appear constantly near it for more than a month , to a spectator on the earth ! It is in vain to attempt to e*tplain the difficulty attending an exact conjunction , by supposing the tail very large . If it were as large as that of 1744 , the objection would remain in all its force . The dry fog of 1783 , then , whatever may have been said of it , was not the tail of a comet , " - pp. 88-91 . A dry fog , similar to the one above described , was noticed in different quarters of the globe , in 1331 . It was observed on the coast of Africa on the 3d of August , in the south of France on the 10th , and at New Yorkon the 15th of the same month . This fog was so thick , that the sun might be looked at all day , without any colored glass or other protection to the eye ; and , in some places , the sun remained invisible till it had risen 15* or 20* above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked , that the color was changed to an azure blue , and sometimes to reenish or emerald green . At night the heavens occasionally became clear , so that the stars could be seen . Where this fog was observed and while it continued , there was a very unusual degree of light during the night . In Siberia , at Berlin , and at Genoa , in the month of August , the smallest writing could sometimes be read even at midnight . This phenomenon , however , was not general , even in Europe . At Paris and some other places , it was but faintly perceived , and for a few days only . If a comet , therefore , had passed at this time , between us and the sun , no reason can be given why it was not seen , We are hence obliged to conclude , // as in the former case , that the fog was not attributable to a comet . The following are the remarks of our author upon the agency which this extraordinary fog is supposed by some persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance in Europe , about the same time . " Many authors have chosen to see some connexion between the extraordinary fog of 1831 and the entrance of the cholera morbus into Europe . This opinion reminds me of what an old English traveller , Matthew Dobson , says of the effects of a periodical wind on the west coast of the continent of Africa , which is called the Harmattan . On reading over the original narrative just as I was about to send these pages to the press , I was so struck with several points of resemblance between the properties of the air , where this wind prevails , and that which is filled by the dry fogs of Europe , that I determined to give here a short analysis of that memoir . The reader will observe , that out at sea , some distance from the shore , the Harmattan loses its peculiar qualities ; and he will remember , that in 1783 the dry fog was not perceived in the middle of the Atlantic , although it darkened at the same time the atmosphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fogs of this description are not fatal . " A wind that blows three times each season from the interior of Africa to the Atlantic Ocean , is call the Jilarmattan . On that part of the coast which lies between Cape Verd ( Lat. 150 N. ) and Cape Lopez ( Lat. 1* S. ) , the Harmattan is chiefly felt in December , January , and February . Its direction is between E. S. E. and N. N. E. It commonly lasts two days , sometimes five or six . It is always a moderate wind . " A fog of a particular kind , and thick enough to impede at noon all but the red rays of the sun , always presents itself where the Harmattan blows . The particles , of which this fog is formed , are deposited on the grass , on the leaves of trees , and on the skin of the negroes , in such profusion as to produce a white appearance . Of the nature of these particles we are ignorant ; we only know that the wind carries them but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sea the fog is much lighter ; and , at the distance of three leagues , it disappears entirely , although the Harmattan is still felt in all its force . " The extreme dryness of the ilarmattan is one of its most striking characteristics . When it lasts some time , the branches of orange and citron trees die ; the covers of books ( even when they are shut up in tight trunks , and have additional covering of linen , ) warp as if they had been before a large fire . Pannels of doors , window-shutters , and articles of furniture crack and often // break . The effects of this wind upon the human body are not less remarkable ; the eyes , lips , and palate become dry and painful . If the Harmattan last four or five days togetl*er , the skin of the hands and face comes off ; to prevent this , the natives rub their bodies all over with grease . " After what has been said of the fatal effects of the Harmattan on vegetables , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite the contrary is observed Intermittent fevers are completely cured by the first breath- of the Harmattan . Patients reduced by the excessive bleeding practised in that country , recover their strencrth remittent and epidemic fevers also disappear , as if by enchantment . Such is the salutary influence of this wind , that , while it lasts , infection can not he comrnunmcated even artificially . This assertion rests upon the following fact : " In 1770 , there was an English vessel at Wydah , called the Unity , which was loaded with three hundred negroes . The small pox having appeared among some of them , the owner determined to inoculate the rest . All who were thus operated upon , before the Harmattan began to blow , took the infection . Seventy were inoculated the second day after that wind began to blow , and not one of these had the disease , or the least eruption . However , some weeks afterwards , when the Harmattan no longer blew , these very persons took the disorder . It is also added , that during the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and sixty-nine slaves , who had it , all recovered . " The country over which this remarkable wind passes before it reaches the coast , is for two hundred and forty miles , composed of verdant plains , entirely open , some woods of small extent , and here and there a few rivers and imiconsiderable lakes-pp. 99-103 . Other disasters and indeed all sorts of malign influences , have been attributed to comets by authors every way entitled to respect ; and this has been done without taking the trouble to assign any definite cause for effects of so various a character , or to point out any connexion whatever , depending upon the known laws of the world we live in . Mr. Arago , of course , espouses the cause of comets , and maintains their innocence to our entire satisfaction . We have room for only a few quotations , with which we close the present article . " An English physician , whose name is not unknown to philosophers , Mr. T. Forster , has lately treated particularly of this subject . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian era , the most unhealthy periods are precisely those in which // some great comet has appeared ; that the approach of these bodies to our earth has always been accompanied by earthquakes , eruptions of volcanoes , and atmospheric commotions ; xvhereas , rio comet has ever been seen during the salubrious periods . ' " Those who xviii take the pains to examine critically the long catalogue , given by Mr. Forster , will not , I am sure , be led to the same conclusions . " The whole number of comets mentioned by historians , reckoning from the beginning of the Christian era to the present time , is about five hundred . At the present time , when the heavens are examined attentively and skilfully , when comets that can be seen only by the aid of the telescope are no longer overlooked , the average number of these bodies is more than two for each year . If we agree with Mr. Forster , that their influence begins before they are visible , and continues some time after , we shall never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or epidemic that can occur . This remark is applicable also to the Memoirs of the celebrated Sydenham , who was an advocate for the influence of comets ; to the dissertations of Lubinietski , &amp;c . Mr. Forster has moreover , I ought to say , so extended , in his learned catalogue , the influences of comets , that it would seem there is scarcely a phenomenon which is not to he ascribed to them . " Hot and cold seasons , tempests , hurricanes , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , violent hail-storms , great falls of snow , heavy rains , overfloxvings of rivers , droughts , famines , thick fogs , flies , grasshoppers , plague , dysentery , contagious diseases among animals , &amp;c. , are all registered by Mr. Forster , as consequences of the appearance of some comet , xvhatever may be the continent , the kingdom , the town , or the village so visited . By thus making out for each year a complete catalogue of all the miseries of this lo*ver world , any one might foresee that a comet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its inhabitants suffering under some calamity or other . " By a strange accident , well worthy of remark , the year 16S0 , the year of the most brillh ut of r* , odern comets , the year of its passage so near the earth , is that which has furnished our author with the fewest phenomena . Let us see xvhat is to be found under this date ? A cold iv *nter , followed by a hot and dry summer ; meteors in Gem any . ' As to m. ladies , we find no record whatever ! How then , with such a fact as this before us , can we attach any importance to the accidental coincidences noted in other parts of this table ? How are we to regard this celebrated comet of 16S0 , which , blowing now hot and now cold , increased the frosts of winter , and the heat of summer ? " In 1665 , the city of London was ravaged by the plague . If , with Mr. Forster , we attribute this to the remarkable comet which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , how are we to explain why the same pestilence did not extend to Paris , to Holland , to any of the numerous towns in England except the capital ? This difficulty must be met ; and until it is done away , we shall expose ourselves to the ridicule of every man of sense , if we attempt to make comets the messengers of evil . " Let us now see which are the comets whose tails may have mingled with the earth 's atmosphere ; and then search the histories and chronicles of the same period , to discover whether , at the same time , there were not manifested , in all parts of the earth at once , unusual phenomena . Science may take note of such researches ; though , to tell the truth , the extreme rarity of the matter which composes the tail , would lead one to expect nothing but negative results ; but when an author appends to the date of a comet , like that of 166S , the remark that all the cats in 1/Vestphalia were sick ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the circumstance , very little analogous to the former , to be sure , that an earthquake destroyed in Peru the towns of Lima and Callao ; when he adds that , during the appearance of a third comet , a meteoric stone fell in Scotland , into a high tower and broke the wheels of a clock ; that , during the winter , wild pigeons appeared in large flocks in America ; or still more , that zEtna or Vesuvius threw out torrents of lava , - we must consider him as displaying his learning to little purpose . If , in thus registering contemporary events , he thinks he has established some new relations be tween them , he is as much mistaken as the old woman , mentioned by Bayle , who , never having put her head out of her window without seeing coaches in the Rue St. ionor* , imagined herself to be the cause of their passing . " I wish , for the honor of science , that I could have dispensed with taking any serious notice of the ridiculous ideas I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this exposition will not be without use , for Gregory , Sydenham , and Lubinietski have many followers among us . " Moreover , if you will only listen , in those circles which are called fashionable , to the long discourses of which the approaching comet is the theme , you may decide whether there is any room to congratulate ourselves upon the pretended diffusion of knowledge , which so many perfectionists are pleased to consider as the distinguishing feature of our age . For myself , I have long been cured of these illusions . Under the brilliant but superficial gloss , with which the purely literary studies of our colleges cover all classes of society , we almost always find , to speak plainly , a profound ignorance of those beautiful phenomena , those grand laws of nature , which are our best safeguard from prejudice.
