TO JAMES H. CALDWELL , THE FOUNDER OF THE DRAMA IN THE SOUTHERN STATES , THIS PLAY IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED . THE AUTHOR . PREFACE . When the Author of this Play first witnessed the production of " The Lady of Lyons , " he had , lying dormant upon his desk , in a crude , unfinished state , a brief Drama , which it was his design to produce under the title of " The Jeweller 's Son ; " but a faint resemblance which he thought he could discover between that imperfect production and Mr. Bulwer 's masterly performance , led him to change his design , and from those crude materials to erect the fabric which he now timidly launches forth upon the waves of public opinion ,  --  and that too , even at the hazard he must incur , of being supposed to have taken the ground-work of his design from Mr. Bulwer . In reference to this anticipated charge , he will freely say , that had he never beheld " The Lady of Lyons , " " The Gentleman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism will assuredly acquit him of even the semblance of imitation in the execution of his task . To his numerous friends in Philadelphia , the Author owes a heavy debt of gratitude for the kindness manifested by the enthusiastic reception with which the present performance was greeted by them . His thanks are likewise due to the Ladies and Gentlemen of the American Theatre , whose efforts contributed materially to its success . Philadelphia , August , 1838 DRAMATIS PERSON .

Scene I.  --  An Inn on the suburbs of Lyons . Enter Captain Dupuis and Dorval. , following Landlord , L. H. Landlord . Landlord This way , this way , Messieurs ! What will you please to have ? Dorval . Dorval Nothing at present but the small space you occupy in the apartment . Land . Landlord When you want anything , ring , Monsieur , and I 'll answer the bell myself . Sir , I 'm very fond  --  Dorval . Dorval Of talking , I perceive . Exit Landlord . Upon my soul , this is very pleasant ! Our vehicle broken down , our bones bruised , and to be compelled to walk over this infernal road !  --  Capt . D. Captain Dupuis All to gratify a ridiculous whim of yours ; running after a woman you never saw but once , and of whose name and residence you are totally ignorant . The night 's as dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were it as dark as Erebus I would persist ; with whom did love make darkness an impediment ? I 'm for the goal of matrimony . Capt . D. Captain Dupuis None , in sooth , for none ever pursued it but in the dark . Matrimony , forsooth ! The eternal clatter of a woman 's tongue must be delightful to you , indeed , with her " Where are you going now , my dear ? You had better take advice and stay at home this evening , " ha , ha , ha ! Dorval . Dorval You are always prating against the sex ; but , take my word for it , you 'll be caught some day . Capt . D. Captain Dupuis It must be doomsday , then ! But , zounds , man , you are already contracted  --  you were bartered away over a bottle of the true talisman , when you were but a squalling nudity in the cradle . Dorval . Dorval Do tell me how I can avoid marrying a woman to whom , although I have never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I to find the dear angel who does and ever shall possess my heart . Listen to my father 's letter . ( Reads . ) " Sir , I expect that in compliance with your father 's wish , you will be prepared to lead my old friend 's daughter to the altar , where you can mutually receive those legitimate ties that will at once redeem my word , and give to your arms a wealthy heiress and an affectionate wife . " And so forth . " Your Father . " Compel me to marry a woman I never saw ! Capt . D. Captain Dupuis And from the description you have had , she must be a monster . You say that she has fine eyes , but they are spoiled by her cheeks ; plump lips , but they lose their beauty by a veto put upon them by her teeth ; a fine figure , that would have been , but for an ugly hump on one of her shoulders ! But you only heard this  --  see her , and judge for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dorval Bind ! No , there is but one particular in which I will disobey my father , and that is in the choice of a wife . Capt . D. Captain Dupuis Why , the lady you saw at the opera may be married . Dorval . Dorval So young and lovely ! impossible . Capt . D. Captain Dupuis She may not be worth a franc . Dorval . Dorval I care not ; love predominates . Capt . D. Captain Dupuis With me , if love and money were put in the balance , love would fly uppermost ; for , as women are but temporary playthings , a rich one is the wiser choice , since in her extravagance and folly , she would only draw upon her own resources . Much love and little money , with an extravagant wife , will soon give a gentleman the honour of an acquaintance with the dark walls of a debtor 's prison . Enter Lafitte . Lafitte . Lafitte Ah , Sir , such glorious news ! Dorval . Dorval Speak  --  what is it ? Lafitte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover my breath , and I 'll sum up the whole catastrophe in as few words as possible . Dorval . Dorval Did you see my father , the Count ? Lafitte . Lafitte Yes , and I felt him too ! I accidently went to the inn where he lodges , and asked the landlord if such a person was in the house , but before he had time to answer me , I received , without the least ceremony , one of the hardest blows from your father 's came he ever gave me . " Mercy ! " said I. " Scoundrel ! " said he . " Dear master ! " said I. " Damned rogue ! " cried he . Dorval . Dorval Fool , is this thy glorious news ? Lafitte . Lafitte Lord , no  --  but you would n't let me tell you ! Dorval . Dorval Go on . Sirrah , or I 'll try the weight of my cane . Lafitte . Lafitte Do n't , Sir  --  I  --  I 've weighty reasons for declining the operation . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we admired  --  that is , that you admired  --  at the opera . Dorval . Dorval My good fellow , I 'm bound to you forever ! where is she ? Lafitte . Lafitte In one of the prettiest mansions in Lyons , I made myself acquainted with her upon the instant , I discovered her plucking flowers  --  and I kissed her  --  Dorval . Dorval What , Sir ? Lafitte . Lafitte Kissed her waiting maid , Sir ,  --  well , Sir , she called me by my name , and asked me when your marriage was to be solemnized with the rich heiress whom you are contracted to ; so , thinking to serve you , I told her that since you had the felicity of seeing her you had resolved never to see the rich heiress again , and then , in the most eloquent terms , I described her doformities , that horrible hump on her shoulders , how it made her limp  --  ( Imitating. )  --  At this she simpered a little , and said she hoped you would n't be deceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafitte . Lafitte Count De Valcour 's . Capt . D. Captain Dupuis My old friend ! Dorval . Dorval Indeed ! Then you must introduce me . Such a creature  --  such a face  --  form  --  lips  --  ambrosia and nectar ! Capt . D. Captain Dupuis Come along : I 'll help the Count to drink his wine and talk of the affairs of the nation , while you can gaze at fields , trees , and cascades , and whisper soft and love-coined sentences in the ear of your mistress . Exeunt Capt . D. and Dorval . Lafitte . Lafitte And I 'll write a sonnet to Bridget 's eye-brows . Exit . Scene 2.  --  Interior of a small cottage  --  on one side a Jeweller 's workbench , furnished with implements , &; C.  --  Dame discovered ironing  --  sound of a hammer heard at intercals , as if proceeding from an inner apartment . Dame . Dame Ah dear , I shall have to give up work awhile  --  my old bones are aching . Folds the clothes , and places them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Enter Bridget . Dame . Dame Why , Bridget , girl ! out so late ? Bridget . Bridget Yes , Dame , I had an errand to the doctors , and passing your cottage , I thought it would be unneighbourly not to call in . Dame . Dame Thank you , Bridget , but how is your father ? Bridget . Bridget Very ill indeed , and if it was not for the charity of the lady Adelaide , I think we should starve . Dame . Dame I 've heard much of the charity of lady Adelaide . Bridget . Bridget Never was there a more liberal and feeling heart . ' T is now three months since she returned with her father from Italy , and there is not a family around us that has not tasted of his bounty  --  and the best of all , Dame . I am engaged in the family of the Count De Valcour to wait upon the dear lady Adelaide . Oh , dear , what fine gentlemen I shall see !  --  and handsome furniture too  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances  --  and silver plate ! Dame . Dame But who is this Gentleman of Lyons , that I 've heard you say more than once administered to your wants ? Bridget . Bridget Bless you , he is the richest man in the kingdom ! he rides in a chaise with six white horses ; he has only been here a short time , and as we ca n't find out his name , we all call him the Gentleman of Lyons  --  and such a gentleman he is too ! Sound of hammer heard . What , is Julian at work so late ! Dame . Dame Yes , Julian is no idler , Bridget . Bridget . Bridget Do you know that all the girls are in love with him ? and I know ladies who are in their carriage too that smile upon him . But then he is so proud , and when you ask him to join in our rustic dance , he refuses with such scornful lips ,  --  besides , he shuns the company of our neighbour 's sons , who may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heart . Dame . Dame Ah , but he is so kind and so affectionate . Bridget . Bridget Never with me , though I 've wished him to be so ; but  --  Dame . Dame But alas , poor boy ! he soars above his station , and I am afeard his ambition will bring early wrinkles upon his brow , and pale the healthful bloom upon his cheek . A lute heard . Bridget . Bridget Ah , he 's as fond of his pipe as ever . I do wish he would come and play for us sometimes , and would n't be so proud . Enter Julian from Room . Julian . Julian What do I possess that should make me proud , good Bridget . Bridget . Bridget Embarrassed . Why  --  only  --  you  --  you are very handsome , and you ought to be proud  --  and I always honoured your pride , because  --  because  --  it 's growing late , so I 'll bid you good night . Exit Bridget . Dame . Dame My dear boy , heed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever kind . Dame . Dame Son , you made me unhappy to-day when you returned from the city . Julian . Julian How ? Dame . Dame When I inquired what business called you out , you answered me with a frown , and silently commenced your work . Julian . Julian Pardon me , dear mother  --  not for the worth of Lyons would I dim those eyes with sorrow 's tears , or pain the heart that loves me . I carried the bracelet to the house of the lady Dormer ,  --  the rich slave of fashion ,  --  and after knocking full an hour , a minion answered my call , and vilely reproached me for soiling with my foul labourer 's hand the knocker of the door that was only used by the silk cased hand of nobility ! Another hour I waited like a hungry cur upon the threshold of the kitchen ,  --  and at last received my paltry charge . Here it is ; take it , good mother . It is the talisman whose magic influence can buy estate , rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , is the foundation of fame and praise , while honest worth remains obscured by poverty , and creeps unreguarded to the silent tomb . Dame . Dame But then , my son , the prince is levelled with the beggar . Julian . Julian True , true ,  --  king , subject and slave , in charnel houses feed the worm . Dame . Dame Come , my son , you are hungry ? Julian . Julian No , mother , I can not eat . Dame . Dame Let not the slight of those that are better than ourselves fret thee , Julian . Julian . Julian Better ! Better , mother ? The same great hand that made The beggar formed the king  --  the conqueror ! Better ! what are they , nature , more than I ? To wisdom , virtue , genius and to worth , I pay respect and homage  --  those rare gems Of mind  --  of soul  --  these dignities alone Should claim the reverence of man to man : And be the blest possessor of these gifts Arrayed in ermined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poverty  --  Born in the palace or the shepherd 's cot  --  They merit the same honour and regard . Dame . Dame Let me enjoy content  --  ' t is all I ask . Julian . Julian Th ' aspiring hero , clambering The blood-stained rocky steep of hot ambition ,  --  With rude hand laying waste the workmanship Of God ,  --  struggling for fame or power ,  --  In the hop 'd for attainment of his wishes Seeks content of mind . Dame . Dame My son , ambition is a foe to happiness : it leads the mind to plan such acts as never can be consummated . Julian . Julian The great eternal architect of nature , Who sits upon creation 's mighty throne , Never decreed that man should worship man . Must I forever be imprisoned  --  Chained by the galling links of poverty ? The simple worm , wrapped in its wintry covering , Hailing with joy the summer 's bright return , Is free to taste the grateful mountain air Of liberty  --  and yet I am denied The soaring wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dame Thou art strangely altered , son  --  the live-long night I hear thy uneven tread . Alas ! I trust nought to cloud thy brow has happened . Julian . Julian Why , kindest mother , nature 's changed within me The proud  --  the lofty heart of this sad breast Hath melted with the soul-subduing fire Of beauty 's radiant eyes  --  the stars have beamed upon me From the bright firmament of her pure face , And chained my captive heart . I love where love can never be returned ! Were it but known , their silver goblets would Echo their jestings , and contemptuous laughter Would at the festive board in mirth resound : The sneer of scorn would curl on every lip , And the ladies too would join in the proud sport , And with affected gesture mock my love . But oh ! would she , the idol of my soul , Pain with her scorn the heart that fondly loves ? A whispering sound , as from an angel 's lips , Breathes to mine ear a word of hope  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , dismiss this passion from thy breast : bring virtuous resolution to thy aid  --  the best physician to a troubled mind . Julian . Julian I stole to her casement o'er the garden wall , While her blue eyes , turned to the waning crescent In the vault above , seem 'd fill 'd with sentiment , And glowed with love of nature 's handiwork And glory . Calm and lovely was the night  --  All nature 's stormy passions were at rest , And love 's soft eloquence and mild reflection Seem 'd the twin sisters of the peaceful world , I fondly listened , and , as in sweet tones Her voice did wake the chant of other days , Each breeze with her dark tresses joyful play 'd ' Mid the silver glances of the moon , And ever and anon a moaning sigh Would make her alabaster bosom heave . She was not happy  --  grief was in her eye , And on her brow pale sorrow 's queen enthroned sat . Again I heard the honied accents of her tongue , And still I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : but , then , The sapphire bosom of the arch waxed dim , The silvery queen now bade the earth good night , And the broad mirror lamp being now withdrawn ,  --  The casement closed , and all was dark again . Dame . Dame Who is this great lady , my son ? Julian . Julian An angel , beautiful as the heavens ! In mind exalted  --  foe to the rank pride Of vain nobility  --  from wisdom 's garden Who has pluck 'd rare flow'rs that adorn her mind , And with a careful hand has she extracted Those worthless weeds by education planted , That nobles glean from the snow-rock of pride , That lives but a short day ere the sun melts it , And leaves but a falsome vapour to play With heaven 's blasts . Ah , she is rich in worth ! The songsters hymn her deeds of charity And the bright heavens are filled with orisons For her good , that each and every night Do from a thousand ardent tongues ascend ! Dame . Dame Art thou sane ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dame . Dame Exert the energies of thy mind  --  thou hast rare gifts : thy father spent his all to frame thy mind to play thy part through life ,  --  and a mind stored with knowledge that should serve thee well is thine . Think on it , son ; though at her feet you laid a princely dower , she could not wed thee : thy blood is not noble . Think on it , son  --  and so , good night . Exit Dame . Julian . Julian Nature 's pure current courses through my veins , And with a soul As spotless as when from its God it came , A love of country ,  --  an untarnished name ,  --  A life that slander 's tongue dare never touch ,  --  I stand a balance in the scale with kings , With all their boasted blood . My mind 's resolved  --  I 'll try the Alpine heights Where like day 's golden god the jewel shines , And with the silken chord of rosy Cupid There will I angle for the living gem ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my compass break , The sea 's bright coral grove shall be my grave . Cries without.  --  Help ! help ! A scream . Julian . Julian Rushing out . I come ! I come ! Enter Dame . Dame . Dame What cry was that ? my son ,  --  ah , he has gone to learn the cause . Opens door . Julian enters , bearing Madcmoisclle Valcour in his arms . Julian . Julian Quick , mother ,  --  re-light the candle and make fast the door ,  --  water to revive her and a bandage for her wound . Exit Dame . Alas , I see the villain 's hand hath done her harm  --  no breath doth damp the ruby texture of her lips . Re-enter Dame with light  --  Julian holds it to her face . Julian . Julian Powers of heaven ! that angel face ! Does vision mock me ? No , ' t is glorious reality  --  T is Adelaide ! Falls on his knees . Dame . Dame She revives . Adelaide . Lady Adelaide Where am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Where am I ? Ah , ruffian , unhand me ! Father save me from dishonour ! Shricks and falls in the arms of Julian as the curtain falls .  --  Tableau . ACT II . Scene 1 .  --  Julian 's Cottage , as in Act 1 .  --  Dame discovered  --  Enter Valmont and Count . Dame . Dame This way , Messieurs . Count . Count de Valcour My dear child then is safe ? Dame . Dame Yes , my son saved her from the ruffian . I 'll bring her to you . Exit R.H. 1 E. Valmont . Valmont ( Aside . ) Curse on him for his officious meddling ! But for him the prize would have been mine . Count . Count de Valcour By the stream of noble blood that flows through these veins from an unblemished ancestry , knew I the villain that dared this outrage , his coward heart should  --  Valmont . Valmont Perhaps some mercenary wretch who craved the jewels that adorn her person . Count . Count de Valcour Zounds and fury ! This insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelaide . R.H. 1 E. Ade . Lady Adelaide My dear father ! now do I feel that I am safe . ( Embracing . ) Count . Count de Valcour And now do I feel that I am a weak old man ! ( Weeping . ) Rob a father of his only child  --  the only relic of a departed wife . Do you know the desperate fiend that bears so vile a heart ? Ade . Lady Adelaide No , dear father , I was in the garden culling flowers , nor thought of harm , when two men in masks seized and bore me away fainting  --  I knew not where . Count . Count de Valcour The cowardly villains ! Ade . Lady Adelaide I knew not what passed till , recovering my senses , I found myself in the care of this kind old woman . Dame . Dame My son hearing the cry of distress , flew instantly to her rescue . Count . Count de Valcour Where is your brave and generous son , that I may reward him ? Dame . Dame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has not yet returend . Count . Count de Valcour Give him this purse , and say Count de Valcour will ever feel bound to serve him . Such a courageous dog merits valour 's highest reward . Dame . Dame Nay , I must not take the purse  --  my son would shame  --  Count . Count de Valcour But you shall  --  and tell him if he likes I 'll make him my private valet . Val . Valmont Count , the carriage waits . Count . Count de Valcour Dare to rob a father of his child  --  the villain !  --  the rascal !  --  Come , my Adelaide  --  come . Exeunt all but Dame . Dame . Dame Where can Julian thus tarry ? He will be surprised to find the lady gone ; yet , after all , ' t is best he should not see her . Enter Julian . Julian . Julian Ah , mother  --  has the lady yet risen ? Dame . Dame She has gone , my son ,  --  her father came and reclaimed her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Julian Gone !  --  not one look , one smile , to warm my icy heart !  --  not one word to cheer my gloomy soul ? Dame . Dame The Count wished to see you and return his thanks ,  --  and , in spite of every word I could say in refusal , he compelled me to receive for you this purse of gold . Julian . Julian It must be returned : this robs the simple deed of all its worth . Rather would I feed upon the offals of the poorest mendicant in Lyons , than keep the gold bought at so poor a price . Dame . Dame I will return it if you so desire . The Count was very kind , and said in repayment of your services he would make you his private valet . Julian . Julian His valet ! ha , most hononrable office ! To humbly wait  --  to wipe his Countship 's beard ; Attend his nod  --  anticipate his will ; A thing whereon to spit his spleen when angry ; A very echo to his noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I thank thee , nature 's God , I was not form 'd Less noble than his Countship , and will not Be his slave ! Dame . Dame Yet t is a worthy office in so great a house . Julian . Julian With Adelaide forever in my sight ? no , no . Adelaide ! what magic is in that name ! Mother , doest thou remember some eight years ago , there came a stranger to our cottage ? Dame . Dame I do , my son . Julian . Julian I often since have thought upon him ? I met him some ten paces from the house , and marked a tear move down his cheek . He came to inquire for my father , you told me ? Dame . Dame Yes , he was thy father 's friend . Julian . Julian Mother , all last night methought I wander 'd Along with him far over some strange land  --  It seemed an eastern clime  --  the balmy air , With fragrant odours fill 'd , sat upon The perfum 'd bosom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , Her studded arch undim 'd by clondy frown , Show 'd pearls and rubies twinkling in the azure , And heav'nly objects seemed to earth in view ; But soon the scene was changed  --  and lo , a gloom :  --  A cloud of jetty black sat on the face Of night 's fair pilgrim ,  --  and , our path untrack 'd , While the penumbia dimming our strain 'd vision , Comfortless left us in the shroud of darkness . But suddenly a rich flambean , as from The earth , sprang up a meteor of light , And , glaring , sailed along the ambient air . Our steps were echoless ; but soon we reached A palace glittering with a thousand gems : I on its golden threshold stood amaz 'd ,  --  When , lo ! a bed of flowers , that surpass 'd In beauty all the rainbow 's glowing tints , Appear 'd , exhaling richest of perfumes Around us ,  --  And then a fountain with a lamp of gold , And viny arches , hung with silver bells Tuned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd couch of crimson hue sustain 'd The sleeping seraph of this fairy land ; The silken lash and pearly lid had clos 'd In dream 's obliviousness the shining radiance Of those orbs of light ; Her ebon tresses kiss 'd her lily neck , And the soft gale her heaving bosom fann 'd With sweets from violet beds and rosy leaves The lovely sylvan maids had brought . I gaz 'd Entraptur 'd  --  oh , ' t was Adelaide 's sweet form ! I eager caught the hand that listless hung , As hangs the light branch from the weeping willow ,  --  " Behold thy bride ! " the solemn stranger cried . Sleep 's curtain dropp 'd  --  And left me clasping the impassive air ! Dame . Dame You must forget these things . Julain . Julain Mother , you ever evade the mention of that stranger . Did you ever behold him before ? Dame . Dame Yes , when your father lived he often visited us . Julian . Julian A vague recollection at times comes athwart me that I had seen his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son ! ( Aside . ) No , I can not tell him  --  he never would forgive me . Julian . Julian You weep . Dame . Dame Should I not weep to see you thus unhappy ? Julian . Julian Forgive me  --  happiness may yet be mine . The mind is changeful as the elements  --  Now comes a sunshine and a clear blue sky , All calm ,  --  and now again a tempest dimming The glory of the placid brow with clouds . I am going a far journey , my dear mother  --  My last farewell I did design to write thee , But oh , my swelling heart yearned for thy blessing ! Dame . Dame Art going to abandon me in my old age ? Julain . Julain Abandon thee ! what , thee ! the dear companion Of many a dark and adverse year of sorrow ! Ah , now you have touched nature 's weakest part And made a woman of me . ( Weeps . ) Dame . Dame Forgive me ,  --  and may peace be with thee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this key  --  ' twill guide to all Thy son doth own in this unequal world . Many a long and bitter winter night The brow hath sweated , and the limbs grown weary , Beneath the iron task stern fortune set To purchase them . The double duty of Protector and of son my father 's death Did leave me to fulfil ,  --  and to achieve it The judging powers do know hath been my glory . I now must leave thee , in thy age 's winter , To seek a balsam for a wounded heart . Dame . Dame My good , gentle boy , do not leave me . Julian . Julian Each day I linger here it bleeds afresh . My books delight no more  --  and our fair garden , Our cottage too , and all , do wear a gloom , Save one bright light that in perspective shines , And leaves my lonely heart ' twixt hope and fear . Dame . Dame Ah , well-a-day ! Julian . Julian The gold thou wilt return at fitting time , And say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love her would for her dear sake With transport yield his life ! Dame . Dame The money thou hast so hardly earned and saved , take with thee . Julian . Julian Mother , it was for thee I toiled  --  I shall return With health 's clear beaming eyes to thy fond arms . Hope 's golden strings now tune my swelling soul  --  Ambition lights her torch , and , Phoenix like , Soars from the ashes of ill-fortune 's urn . Farewell ! ( Going . ) Dame . Dame Bless me , ere thou goest . ( Falling on her knees at the door . ) Julian . Julian May that great power , who holds the fate of nation 's In his dread palm , still be the widow 's friend . ( Embracing . ) Mother , farewell ! ( Rushes out .  --  Dame remains kneeling till the scene closes . ) Scene II .  --  A splendid Apartment in the Mansion of De Valcour . Enter Adelaide with a letter . Ade . Lady Adelaide Who can be the writer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I received letters traced by the same hand . It is a problem I can not solve . I would that I could see him . I will again peruse it . ( Reads . ) " Lady  --  t is well you know not the presumptuons man who thus addresses you . His name is never echoed in the halls of the great , and poverty sits at the humble threshold of his cottage door . At thy casement , in the still solitude of night , the pale light of the heavens shining in thy face , I have read upon the sweet margin of thy brow , the purity of thy soul  --  then hast thou listened to my lute  --  oh , rapture ! " What magic 's in the words to make my blood thus ebb and flow ? ( Reads . ) " Ere I beheld thee I was happy with my lot  --  my sole ambition was to maintain the noble relic my father left me  --  an honest name . I saw thee , and my soul took wings , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing sail , filled by the inspiring breath of love , drove my bark of hope toward that bright haven where thy enshrined beauty reigned . But the clouds of an adverse fate have burst above my head  --  the star of my destiny is dim my hopes are paralized , and perhaps forever crushed  --  and I now bid a long farewell to home , to friends , and native land . Adelaide ! ere thy beauteous eyes shall scan this scroll , the dark waves of the angry deep will foam around me . Farewell , forever ! " What , tears ! well , let them flow  --  Misfortune pity claims . Alas ! ' t is I Have driven him a wanderer from home ! Who art thou , stranger ! Ah , his noble words Speak him a man of honour ! oh , that I Could hold communion with him ! My heart pictures A rich face , cast in nature 's faultless mould  --  A mind untarnish 'd by vain fashion 's school , That binds her pupils in the chains of pride ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holding his crook  --  the sceptre of the hills  --  Beneath the shadow of some tow'ring oak .

I 'll tear the scroll  --  ' t is dewy with my tears ! No ! I 'll preserve it near my throbbing heart , And breathe a prayer for him , the hapless author . Enter Ernestine , L. H. Ernest . Ernestine My dear Adelaide , I 'm rejoiced to see you safe  --  what a shocking adventure , to be sure ,  --  and how nobly the young man preserved you !  --  quite a hero  --  a very champion ? Ade . Lady Adelaide Of my honour ! Ernest . Ernestine Is he beautiful ? Ade . Lady Adelaide I know not . I have but a vague recollection of his face  --  I saw him but once ; nor should I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernestine Beauty is becoming more marketable every day in Lyons ; in short , next to a tide , it is the strongest recommendation to a lady 's favour . Ade . Lady Adelaide Beauty !  --  the eye may dazzle for a time , And draw from giddy crowds the raptur 'd gaze ; But never can it captive hold the heart ! The fairest rose its od'rous leaflet sheds  --  The richest flower that forms the garden 's boast Must wither ' neath Time 's all-destroying hand ! Thus beauty through its transient season blooms , Till age , like winter , with its blighting power , Usurps the throne where beauty reign 'd supreme ! Ernest . Ernestine Really , Adelaide ! your sentimentality has given us all the vapours ! But , tell me now , what would attract you most ? Ade . Lady Adelaide Soul ! sense  --  mind  --  sentiment  --  a heart of love . Ernest . Ernestine For my part , I think the heart of man is too small to contain half of those endowments . What think you of Valmont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I entreat you . His attention pains me ! Ernest . Ernestine Ha , ha , ha ! He puts his tailors to their utmost to decorate his person ,  --  and I 'm sure he has given several ladies in Lyons the heartache by his attention to you . Ade .

Ernestine What course should I pursue ? A lady of fashion treats those things very lightly ; so I shall laugh at it as a very good joke . I saw him for the first time at the opera last week , and I believe it was the only time he ever saw me . I excited his attention , and I 'm sure he thought me an angel . Ade .
