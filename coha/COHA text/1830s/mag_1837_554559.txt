txt Tuis book undertakes to teach the most important of the arts and sciences ; those of human life , considered in relation to the present and future . This is a philosophy which everybody is obliged to practise , with what success he may , and which , therefore , it behoves every one to study , and which it is our common interest that others should understand as well as ourselves . All the persons thrown together in social and economical relations , may be looked upon as performers in a great concert , in which each one is affected , - is disturbed , vexed , assisted , supported , or delighted , - with the discord or harmony of every other voice and instrument . There is no escaping from the concords arid the dissonances of the numerous company . They will reach , and torment or please us ; in the most exalted positions , the remotest solitudes , and humblest pursuits . We must be auditors to the performances of the others as well as to our own ; there // is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we can make our exit only at the conclusion of the final act ; and even this is hut an entrance to a new scene on another stage , where xve must take the better or worse part , for which we may have fitted ourselves . The severest study of the part we are to perform , then , behooves us , and in this Dr. M'Cormac 's book will render us very material assistance . It is a time when works of this description are more than ever before called for . Men ask more than ever , that pliilosophy may he brought down from the skies and home to their business and bosoms ; that every species of knowledge may be made to bear practically upon their pursuits and welfare . There are many branches and particular heads of this science of living ; as that of the statesman , taught by Mr. Taylor ; that of the young lady , taught in the " Young Lady 's Friend " ; that of the professional man , the merchant , the artisan ; hut there is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is this which Dr. M'Cormac teaches . He begins with the physical condition and relations , in treating of which he has occasion to apply much of the science of his own profession , and that of physiological studies generally , in which , as well as in moral and intellectual philosophy , and general literature , he seems to be competently versed . The plan and object of the work require it to be of a popular cast , adapted to the comprehension of the mass of readers ; the author , therefore , can not pretend to push his researches in any particular branch of knowledge , beyond the hounds already attained ; but he takes the stock that is accumulated to his hand , and elaborates it into his Science of Sciences , the philosophy of living . He treats of the senses , sensation , consciousness , instinct , man 's relation to the lower animals , the human organization , and the various influences upon health and life , production and consumption , as branches of the general economical system of communities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter on the influence of circumstances on the human organization will serve as an example of this part of the work , showing that he descends to practical working-day philosophy . Under this head he treats first of the bodily training of children . " Much depends on the bodily training of children , and on the proper regulation of air , exercise , food , and clothing . Like // plants , they require the heat and light of the sun , otherwise they languish and deteriorate . Inadequate nourishment , foul air , want of exercise , deficient warmth and clothing , along with depressing moral influences , lead to scrofula , rickets , mesenteric and pulmonary consumption , as well as other results not less disastrous . The nutriment of children at the breast , is affected by the poverty of the parent ; by sorrow , violent passions , and excess . There is no substitute for a mother 's milk or a mother 's care ; and children brought up by hand , are apt to perish even under the parent 's eye . In foundling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits the institutions in which poor deserted children are maintained , will be struck with the cheerless aspect which they present . The happy relations of domestic life , and above all that of mother and child , are sadly absent . Undue restraint proves highly detrimental . When habits of repletion and indolence are fostered , they act injuriously on the developement of the frame ; while excessive or premature exertion stunts the growth , and leads to imbecility and disease , if not to early death . Children are yearly destroyed by the improper exhibition of drugs . The infliction of bodily in*jury is one of so barbarous a nature , that it is difficult to believe that any could be guilty of it . The laws do not permit an adult to be assaulted with impunity ; and why a child ? Young people are often mercilessly beaten by cruel or passionate teachers , so that independent of the production of misery and disease , the temper is broken and destroyed for ever . Education , for various reasons , should not be wholly committed to public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care and attention of enlightened parents . Domestic affections are cut off , while the influence of improper companionship is increased . It would be desirable if men of cultivated minds and feelings , could be more generally induced by increased consideration , to take charge of schools . Such would best supply the parent 's place , and neutralize the disadvantages contingent on public instruction . " - pp. 73- 75 . He then remarks upon the effects of heat , cold , and moisture , or climate , and also the kind and quantity of nourishment , upon our organization and animal economy ; from these he passes to diseases , of body and mind , as influencing greatly the condition of men , where , as in numerous other places , he combats phrenology . He speaks of the action and reaction between government and its subjects . " The numbers , wealth , enterprise , and intelligence of a community , influence government , and conversely . Individuals // may do much , but governments by a single act , - by the facilities or the obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - can alter the relations of a whole people . Their power for working good and evil never ceases , and is almost commensurate with that of nature herself . In Turkey , blessed as it is with a fruitful soil and genial climate , the exactions of rulers leave the people miserable . The French peasantry anterior to the revolution , in order to support nature , were accustomed , it is said , to secrete a portion of the produce of their farms in caves under ground . Owing to insufficient employment , absenteeism , the imperfect circulation of capital , the low state of education , and the want of a provision for the poor , a considerable section of the British empire exhibits a state of destitution which it would not be easy to paralleL It devolves upon governments , were they adequately to discharge the trust , to secure a good education for the working classes , to attend to the interests of productive industry , and to elevate the condition of the poor . " - pp . SQ 81 . Again ; the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , not less , the degree or intensity of labor . " Some occupations retard the developement , or distort the structure of the human frame , while others induce disease and premature decay . When children are sent to employments too laborious or too unintermitting for their tender years ; before their joints are knit , or their bones and muscles are developed ; confined , perhaps , in a close and tainted atmosphere , and debarred from the instruction , relaxation , and enjoyment required at their age , how can we expect that their physical conformation or their moral purity should remain unaltered ? They become pale , rickety , distorted , and thin ; lose the grace and symmetry of youth , and at the same time imbibe the seeds of disease and decay . Should they grow up , they do not attain the vigor or health of manhood , while their offspring are still more enfeebled than themselves . The population of manufacturing towns and districts has visibly degenerated . Unwholesome employment , foul air , deficient or vitiated nutriment , and debauchery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry-grinding , stone-cutting , and the like , too often induce such , with fatal certainty . An occupation , in itself not positively un* wholesome , becomes so , when persevered in to the exclusion of exercise and recreation . Tailors , weavers , milliners , and shopkeepers , are often over-tasked , and their hours of rest sadly encroached on . Every one should have a little time to devote to the society of his family and friends , to the preservation of his // health , and to the cultivation and enlargement of his moral and intellectual nature . The life of man is sacrificed to the unrelenting spirit of gain , yet the services which human beings owe to each other , need never prove the source of misery or oppression . Moderate exertion is advantageous , but excessive toil is not less morally than physically injurious . Thus , the well-being of multitudes is done away with , while the life-springs of existence are tainted at their source . " - pp. 81 , 82 . In the next place war abstracts a large portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the promotion of civilization . Emigration and colonization are also introduced by the author in this connexion , as having much to do with the civilization and economical resources of mankind , their aggregate numbers , and their exterior condition and accommodation . So again , the living have been tortured and their numbers thinned by the miserable inflictions practised by men upon their fellows . " Every form of torture that perverted ingenuity could devise , has been employed to rack human sensibilities ; death itself , that seeming climax of evil , has been perpetrated , with every accompaniment of physical and moral suffering . The fagot , the halter , the rack , the dungeon , the axe , and the chalice , bespeak the one ; while persecution , slander , exile , present taunts , and denunciations of future misery , attest the other . How many have been sacrificed to avarice , superstition , envy , and revenge , or to the necessities , real or supposed , of justice ? Yet man owes kindness to man ; and it is not chimerical to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall dare to anticipate the natural period of our dissolution . " - pp. 85 , 86 . The author touches upon the different occasions of the immolation and voluntary destruction of the species , as superstition , crime , war , duelling , murder , circumstances leading to suicide , and slavery . He is everywhere enthusiastic in favor of amelioration . He anticipates the time when capital punishments will cease . He especially reprobates the infliction of punishments upon females . " The infliction of death is more common in some countries than in others ; assuredly , its frequency is a very equivocal evidence of civilization . In all despotic and demoralized states , wherever knowledge and improvement languish , this extreme penalty will be found most summary and frequent , as well as // attended with the most cruel accompaniments . In the East , a messenger with the fatal bowstring , has long been at once the announcement , and the expiation of the displeasure of the sovereign . To treat a political offence , of which the criminality is often a matter of mere convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against human nature , is to confound the distinctions of right and wrong . If crimes , which involve the well-being of the community , are only to be arrested by the destruction of the offender , then are capital punishments unavoidable ; but if this be not the case , they are at once immoral and unnecessary . The most enlightened and virtuous members of every civilized community are against their perpetration ; and it is easy to foresee , - thanks to the unanswerable arguments of a Beccaria , a Livingston , and a Bentham , - that at no distant period , the shedding of human blood will cease to he connected with the judgment-seat . Tuscany for a time , and Russia under the Catherines , proscribed the infliction altogether ; while elsewhere , philanthropists have essayed its suppression , with varying success . The inhumanity of the practice is most conspicuous with regard to women . In this country , a year hardly elapses , in which , by a peculiar unhappiness , some are not executed . Whence this necessity ; are our women more depraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , perhaps too , some poor , penitent creature , - is nothing less than an outrage against the sex and against humanity . Is the bosom whence we draw the life-springs of existence , on which we rest in affliction , and in the communings of affection ,  --  is that bosom to be convulsed by the agonies of a violent death ? Public executions demoralize the spectators , and render them callous to the shedding of human blood . Independent of the mental anguish and physical tortures of the sufferer , the pain that is inflicted on the better portion of the community , is enormous : the guilty and the unfeeling are indifferent , while the humane and the innocent are wrung with anguish and commiseration . The disproportion of the punishment to the offence creates a sympathy for the criminal , any thing but favorable to the interests of justice . These things afford us the strongest incentives to search into the causes of crime , and , by diminishing its amount , to lessen the frequency with the necessity , for the harrowing exhibitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests the question of the necessity of capital punishments by the true criterion , the state of the sentiments , opinions , and habits of the community . It is then a practical question , that can not be settled generally by the same code for // every community , but must be determined particularly in each one . If vices and crimes take a malignant and ferocious cast , as they do at seasons more generally , and in individual instances occasionally , in every community , those who perpetrate the atrocities have no claim to forbearance , and can have nothing to complain of in the infliction of death without unnecessary and wantonly inflicted pain . The only ground of clemency that can be urged in their behalf is , that their depravity amounts to a moral insanity . If an assassin is aiming at your breast with a dagger , if you have a loaded pistol at hand , what force to your mind is there in the general protestation against the shedding of human blood ? If you can ward off the blow , and defend yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly do so . The practical question is , whether you can do so ; and this is a question that the party or the community attacked must judge of ; the philosopher and speculative legislator can render very little assistance in the case , and the matter is of too intense interest to admit of acting upon the impressions of a distant looker on . And then , as to the danger of shocking the kindly and social feelings and sense of justice of the community by the spectacle of capital punishments , there is no doubt weight in this objection ; but how would these feelings be affected , to see the malicious and fiendish murderer of a kind father , an affectionate brother , a confiding friend , passing his life comparatively in comfort , under the humane administration of a penitentiary ? We ought to hope for all the amelioration of society that we can persuade ourselves is possible ; but there are many cases in which it would be quite absurd to act upon a fancied , and at the best , hoped for , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinction in this respect between male and female convicts , mentioiied by the author , it is in some degree a matter of decorum ; some modes of execution would be particularly revolting in the case of a female , to all who do not adopt the notions of Miss Harriet Martinean and a few others , as to the precise kind and mode of equality with the men to which women are entitled . But waving all objection on the score of the impropriety and indecorum of the mode of execution , the question is then the same in respect to the capital punishment of women and of men , namely , the protection of the community , and the satisfying of their sense of justice , and their humanity , which // would seem as much in favor of capital punishment in some cases , as against it in others . The author then instances the beneficial influence of science , literature , and the arts , especially the latter , upon the external condition of mankind , and concludes the chapter with the consideration of the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is evident that these topics must he very rapidly and superficially touched ; hut in each one , he professes rather to give examples by way of illustration , than to exhaust the various subjects , which are , indeed , as will be evident , inexhaustible ; and all that a writer , with the widest range of knowledge at his command , can do , is to point out to his reader trains of reflection , in which the most vigilant observer , for the longest life , will always find something new . In pursuing this course of inquiry through the first division of the work , the author is led , in conclusion , to consider the best means of securing our physical well-being , where he fervently expatiates in the contemplation of the progression and improvement of society by the benignant influence of those great causes which shape our fortunes . This part of the work is in fact nothing more nor less than a rapid glance at the leading topics of political economy , which treats of the means of supplying our *vants with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manufactures , comrnerce , taxation , national debt , and the kindred topics , are all touched upon , hastily , of course , and it is not surprising that the author 's notions upon some of them should be undigested , loose , and theoretical . Still he is right in sentiment and purpose , and persuasive in his argument to lead us to strive and hope for the better , though he may not , in every instance , suggest the most probable way of attaining it . Poverty , want , and misery , and the means and probability of guarding against and relieving them , occupy his thoughts , in this and various other parts of his work . And , on subjects of this description , his ardent philanthropy and sanguine anticipations for the human race , lend a warmth and elevation to his style . He says " Hygienic measures involve a multitude of particulars essential to the preservation of health ; but the laboring classes , from the vicissitudes incident to their position , their ignorance , intemperance , and improvidence , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle than to see them overwhelmed with // indigence on a fertile soil : or what more miserable , than that a creature endowed with the attributes of humanity , should be compelled to beg from door to door , or to consume the meanest refuse ? Every working man ought to he well supplied with wholesome nourishment , clothing , and fuel , as well as with clean and cheerful habitations . Eight hours daily , should be the maximum of severe bodily labor ; the remainder might well he devoted to relaxation and mental improvement . It is difficult for those not engaged in it , to imagine the consuming nature of excessive toil , or how hard it is for those who are exposed to it , - condemned to ignorance , and perhaps to discor*'ifort , sickness , and privation , - to gain that expansion of intellect , and the enlarged benevolence , that would enable them to recognise their own best interests , and to look with sympathy on the progress of their fellows . Did the poor man 's dwelling abound with the comforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he provided with instruction and recreation , he would be less inclined to seek the haunts of idleness and low debauchery . Why not have gardens , libraries , museums , lecture-rooms , picture-galleries , concerts , baths , and public grounds ? Frequent destitution , cold , wet , and hardship , render the working-classes liable to diseases of every kind . They are indeed , the peculiar victims of plague , pestilence , and famine ; and I fear that hygienic measures will prove of inferior efficacy , until society can be subjected to such modifications , as will lead to the supply of all , contingently on their own exertions , with a sufficiency of the material comforts of life , and more especially , with moral and intellectual culture . For this it is , which elevates the con dition of man , and without it his position is degraded and defective . Human beings are not to be moulded at will , like the inferior animals ; nor can they be raised to the station to which they should aspire , until they can comprehend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in their fulfilment . " It would be a libel on the Divine government , were the exercise of our faculties inadequate to the supply of our *vants . The lowest orders of creation are able to procure every thing that is necessary to their sustenance ; and shall the noblest of earth 's denizens be inferior in this respect to the rest ? Shall he who can command the elements , and turn them to his purposes , be unfit to secure his physical well-being ? This indeed is not so ; man ( loes possess every necessary requisite . If he suffer distress , it must arise from the absent cultivation , or the misdirection of his faculties . Were we provided for , like the inferior animals , by instincts , then would our developement cease . Our mental and bodily powers , and the capabilities of the vanous // objects presented by nature , are unexhausted and inexhaustible . Who then , shall place a limit to the improvement of our species ; who shall say when the fruit-bearing earth shall produce no more ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , on the intellectual relations of man , brings the writer into a higher region , and to a greater distance from the proper studies and pursuits of his own profession . But he scales with fearless intrepidity the cloudy peaks of the metaphysical region , and expatiates in the dim heights of identity , space , association , complex ideas , abstraction , generalization , origin of ideas , of language , &amp;c. , not for the purpose of teaching us what was not before known , but by way of surveying our intellectual constitution , as already known , and inquiring into the objects and resources of existence in this relation , and especially , in conclusion , to explore the means of advancement . The subject of education frequently recurs in different parts of the work , as it very naturally must , in one treating of the improvement of individuals and communities . In connexion with this subject , in this part of the volume , he suggests what is often , and can hardly be too often , repeated , namely , that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , and accordingly , what is more specifically called education , only as the necessary initiatory instruction requisite to enable us to instruct ourselves . " While dwelling on a subject so important , we must not omit to observe that education , indispensable though it be , forms but the initiative to that self-instruction , which it should be the business of after life to perfect . The one is the necessary complement of the other . Where there has been a good education in youth , unremnitting self-instruction crowns the process . Without the former , the latter languishes ; but with it , proceeds vigorously , under the combined stimulus of previous knowledge , industrious habits , and maturing faculties . rrhe man who has been well educated , however vast the advantage which he thereby derives , is an imperfect being without the further aid of self-discipline . Neither the operation of external circumstances , the instruction of others , nor any earthly means , will otherwise suffice . The greatest benefit which education can confer , is that of preparing us for the energetic improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it is , we should strive to impress the unspeakable importance of the latter , on every human being who is desirous of realizing the excellences of his nature , as the indispensa // ble condition , without which it is impossible to secure any real or lasting progress . " - pp. 5297 , 293 . In conclusion , the author dwells particularly upon the importance and delights of the cultivation and exercise of powers which form the subject of this part of the work . " If there he any thing certain in our constitution , it is , that moral and intellectual enlightenment is the best guarantee for the prevention of impurity , and the formation of habits of imperturbable excellence . Hence , the necessity of the highest culture , from the earliest dawn of our capabilities , so that when the period arrives in which temptations multiply , the individual will be found unassailable ; or if , unhappily , he yield , it is only for a time , for his endowments can not be lost , and they must eventually set him above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delights of moral and intellectual excellence have been graven on the heart and soul , they can not be obliterated . It is the glorious prerogative of knowledge , that with care and attention , it can not be lost ; it is a possession for ever , which no wrongs on the part of others can take away , and from which death itself can not separate us . It is impossible to urge too strongly , its indispensable utility in the formation of a superior character , or how amply it indemnities us for whatever sorrows , sufferings , or privations the acquisition may have cost us . We may venture to hope , that the admirable individuals who have appeared from time to time , on the theatre of the world , have not exhausted the capabilities of humanity ; and , if we may argue from the past , that there is a progression of virtue and excellence in store for us , of which the contemplation , even in advance , causes the heart to thrill and bound with joy . " - pp. 311 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we come to the moral constitution and relations ; the sentiments , affections , passions , virtues , vices , - all that is most noble , and all that is most vile , in human nature . This part of the work is the most luminous and most delightful ; the author bears an authority with him here ; he takes his positions with more scientific accuracy , and advances with greater security ; he discourses of high moral truths and divine inspirations , and the felt and foreseen immortal destination of man , as one having experience and knowledge , and being transported and borne along with the power of his subject . The wonder is that be should , without qualification , eulogize Paley , and especially l3entham , both of whom , particularly the latter , treat of morals // in as . cool , artificial a way , as Philidore does of chess ; considering morals , no less than chess , to be a matter of mere calculation . Upon this system , if it admits moral obligation , it may be morally as obligatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as on a Christian to cherish him ; for if the question is to be decided by a calculation of utility merely , the calculus might lead the two to opposite results . The innate moral feeling , or moral sense , or instinct , by whatever name called ,  --  the faculty of perceiving and feeling moral distinctions and relations , must be brought into the account in the science of ethics . Not that the moral sense of every individual is a demonstrative criterion , for men would undoubtedly differ , as in matters of propriety and taste ; but in the latter case this does not prove that there is not a true decorum and fitness , and a true beauty , any more than a defect of vision in an individual proves that there is no green color because he can not see it . Men may be morally idiotic , insane , or brutish , as well as intellectually ; but their insensibility or derangement does not negative the authority of the intuitive moral sentiments of a sound and healthy mind . Dr. M'Cormac maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus contributes his efforts to raise the science from the degradation into which it has been sunk by heartless and superficial utilitarianism . He teaches that we must feel moral obligation , as well as calculate it . The feeling may be wrong , because the moral faculties are defective or disordered ; and the calculation may be wrong from an error in fact , or in the process of reasoning ; but if neither be viciously warped or perverted , the results will agree in the truth . We will not follow the author through the divers topics of this part of his work . Of friendship , among the rest , he says , " Whatever may be said , friendship is not common ; the cultivation of the heart and understanding that leads to it , does not sufficiently abound . We should not dignify with this title , the maudlin reciprocity of the wine-cup , or the sordid intercourse of mutual convenience . Most are so engaged with their individual welfare , that they have neither time nor inclination for the higher interests of the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to tender favors ; suspicion repels the one , and selfishness opposes the other . The imperfect sympathies of political or sectarian partisans , can hardly be styled friendship ; the scope is too limited to lead to such a result , // Nevertheless , we do not conciliate the good-will of others as we might ; we expect good offices before they have been earned . The heart is too much wrapped up in itself to permit the sacrifices that create friends ; we require favors in return for trifles , and are disappointed if we do not receive them . If we could but know how precious it is to give , whether we receive or not , we should be amply satisfied . " - p. 341 . The author does not stop at the bourne of our present existence , but , in the conclusion , follows the soul into the mysterious infinite , to which sublunary life is the prelude . " There is much reason for arriving at the conclusion , that the phenomenal world , - our earth , with the endless galaxies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflrii tely inferior in extent and importance to the spiritual , which we can not see , unless in so far as our inward consciousness yields us fugitive and uncertain glimpses of it . A comparison between things dissimilar , is made with difficulty ; but though imperfect , it often serves to place the objects of it in a somewhat stronger light . Yet , when we reflect upon the multitudinous , and perhaps neverending distribution of the stars , and think that each like our own , is a nursery for immortal intelligences ; that it has been so , and will be so , to an extent which we are utterly unable to appreciate ; when we further reflect , that this may not be the sole means to which the Deity has resorted for adding to the denizens of the spiritual universe ; and when we add 10 these , not only that space is unlimited , but that it can oppose no obstacle to the increase of thinking beings , with the same mighty rapidity , and for ever , it overwhelms the soul with unutterable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creatures thus variously produced , we can not imagine , nor is it necessary to inquire ; doubtless , the all-powerful Author of their existence has regulated this with the same consummate wisdom which he everywhere displays . The common bond would seem to be one of intellect and feeling , and must necessarily , though to a widely varying degree , extend to all . In this world we are under a physical , as well as an intellectual and moral obligation ; in the next , we shall be included under one which can have no boundary save that between right and wrong . Whether any delegated agencies shall subsist , it is impossible to know ; that it should be so , however , is not unreasonable to suppose . If so , we may feel assured that it is exclusively for good . The production of gratuitous evil in the world to come , any more than in this , is a supposition which is adverse to all that we are able to conceive , of boundless wisdom and power , as well as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that every created being shall eventually go forward in a perpetual career of improvement . This is altogether irreconcilable with the possibility of permanent misery or sin ; conditions not less opposed to feeling and reason , than to the visible manifestations of Divine goodness . Hereafter , as now , the highest motives to conduct will be grounded on moral trutb , of which the only just criterion must be the will of God . Doubtless also , we shall be thrown , in a greater or less ( degree , on our own guidance , and permitted as at l ) resent , to reap the satisfaction accruing from our own approval and that of others . But what pen can adequately enlarge on the ravishing hope , the glorious expectation of a future , an eternal existence ? To live for ever to increase unceasingly in knowledge and excellence , and to maintain perpetual communion with wisdom and goodness , - as much transcend the powers of man to imagine , as immortality itself transcends mortality . Doubtless , sources of happiness await us , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form little conception wonders , as much unlike any thing which we now behold , as the particulars comprehended under the latter differ from each other . This likewise enhances the expectation ; for if we can picture to ourselves so much that is good and desirable , what must the reality prove ? What infinite delight will there be in surveying the boundless scenes of creation , and in investigating the sources of our knowledge , and the nature of our faculities ? But these are things , as to which we can have no certain knowledge . Some will go further than others ; while not a few will look upon all conjectures respecting scenes so remote as visionary and absurd . Phe opinion of those , however , who are so unhappy as to disbelieve or doubt on the subject of futurity , can be no criterion ; and assuredly , with the well-founded conviction that we shall take our faculties and our knowledge along with us , it can not be itnproper to speculate in reason , on the condition in which these tuay find exercise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of our departed friends , before we rejoin them for ever . And when about to quit this world , it affords joy and satisfaction to those whom we leave behind , to hear us testify our hopes and our assurances as to the future . Were this more frequently done , it would strengthen our convictions , and confirm our principles . Certainly ; the tacit consent with which all mention of death , and of the dead , is avoided , implies any thing but that rational security , and tender hope , with which we should regard futurity . Let us then be men , - let us raise our hearts and souls with implicit reverence and unbounded trust , towards the Master of life , - to Him who is Lord both of the living and the dead , and alike the wise , the just , and // the merciful Arbiter of every form of existence . " - pp. 559 - 56*2 . We have given a mere sketch of this work , which , though not without its faults , is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its faults are a too great expansion of some topics , an occasional adventurous and rather rash theory , and a want of complete division and method , so that the author sometimes labors without advancing , and too often returns upon his track and falls into repetitions . In speaking of writers and their works , he does not always show a very discriminating and exact appreciation . These are inconsiderable imperfections in estimating the general merits of the work , which contains a vast body of just philosophical speculation upon the economy of life , in its diverse relations . It is eminently characterized by an ardent and enlightened philanthropy . The author shows throughout a lively solicitude for the welfare of every human being , and everywhere labors with untiring zeal and strong confidence for the enlightenment of the ignorant , the reclamation of the vicious , the excitement of the stupid and indifferent , the solace of the miserable , and the reanimation of the despairing . He is singularly free from conventional bigotry and sectarian prejudice , scrupulously eschews dogmatism and anathema , and speaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind l ) alliation in respect to the party infected , at the same time faithfully ministering for his disease . He inculcates pious and exalted sentiments and a pure morality , free from all censorious and cynical taint . The style of composition , though discursive and devious in places , is not unfrequently animated and brilliant . It is a work , on the whole , well calculated to accelerate the onward course of civilization.
