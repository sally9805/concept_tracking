txt THIS work has appeared since the publication of our last number , and seems to be rapidly gaining the reputation which it so well deserves . It is an historical romance . Piso , the imagined author of the Letters , is supposed to have visited Palmyra , toward the close of the third century , to have become acquaintcd with Zenobia and her court , to have seen the // city in its glory , and to have witnessed its destruction by Aurelian , ( A. D. 273 . ) The scene , the characters , and the historical events are finely selected ; for they abound with striking images and associations . We are carried back to Palmyra , a city the history of which is unknown , rising in the desert , shown to the world but for a single age , in the height of its almost unparalleled splendor , and then becoming the spoil of a Roman army and its savage leader , who laid waste in a few days what was never to be restored . After this , a cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were almost regarded as fabulous ; till , in the latter part of the seventeenth century , a few English merchants , from the factory at Aleppo , found their way to its wonderful ruins , and brought back a tale , for which they scarcely obtained credit , - which indeed caused their veracity to be questioned . Zenobia , the queen of this city , has been a name for poetry and painting , and history represents her as a woman of extraordinary intellect and beauty , united with great strength of character ; an Asiatic princess , with Grecian refinement and Roman hardihood . Her principal minister , who is very happily introduced in the present work , was the philosopher , Louginus . Her victor , Aurelian , was the son of a Pannonian peasant , originally an adventurer , a common soldier ; who , by his courage , ferocity , bodily strength , power of control , and skill in war , had raised himself to be the military despot of the Roman Empire , and kept himself at its head , almost five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional outbreaks of something like a generous impulse , he was on the whole only less hateful than some of his predecessors , because he did not , like them , mix up his atrocious cruelties with the utter vileness of the most loathsome sensuality . The complete ruin of Palmyra followed its destruction by Aurelian . As regards that city , he might have rivalled the boast of Attila , that the grass grew not where his horse 's hoofs had trod . Lying as an oasis in the desert , between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean , and favored with an abundant supply of water , it rose rapidly to wealth and civilization , as an emporium of the commerce of the East . Its Grecian name , Palmyra , and its Eastern name , Tadmor , were equally expressive of the great number of palm-trees which flourished around it . In the middle of the last century , there was but // one remaining ; the sands of the desert had encroached to its walls , and only a few Arab huts were to be found among its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was visited by the travellers Dawkins and Wood , to whom we are indebted for our principal information respecting its present state . Their published drawings and measurements are satisfactory ; hut are accompanied with only a very brief narrative . After a journey of six days from Aleppo , through the desert , the travellers arrived about noon in view of " Tadmor 's marble wastes . " " The hills opening , " says Mr. Wood , " discovered to us all at once the greatest quantity of ruins we had ever seen , all of white marble ; and beyond them , toward the Euphrates , a flat waste , as far as the eye could reach , without any object , which showed either life or motion . It is scarcely possible to imagine any thing more striking than this view . " The remains of the city lay within a circuit of about three miles , which appeared as if it had been filled with public edifices . The whole ground was covered with heaps of marble ; yet among them the ruins of vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire , " says Wood , which the travellers had seen . Among these two were preeminent ; - one of them , the Temple of the Sun , standing in a court , more than seven hundred feet square , which was enclosed by a wall ; adorned on the outside with pilasters , and originally with a double row of interior columns , forming as it were cloisters the temple itself being in the midst of the area , surrounded by columns fifty feet high ; - the other , an open portico , stretching three quarters of a mile in length , many of the pillars of which are yet standing . All the edifices , of which any considerable ruins are extant , are supposed to have been erected during the period of less than three centuries which intervened between the Christian era and the destruction of the city . The style of architecture is almost throughout Corinthian ; hut the vastness of the buildings has an Egyptian character . It was this city which Piso , the supposed author of the Letters , is imagined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first impressions from its view , in the following passage . We quote a few lines , preceding , descriptive of the desert surrounding this cultivated spot . Upon this boundless desert we now soon entered . The scene which it presented was more dismal than I can describe . // A red , moving sand , - or hard and baked by the heat of a sun , such as Rome never knows , - low , gray rocks just rising here and there above the level of the plain , with now and then the dead and glittering trunk of a vast cedar , whose roots seemed as if they had outlasted centuries ,  --  the bones of camels and elephants , scattered on either hand , dazzling the sight by reason of their excessive whiteness , - at a distance occasionally an Arab of the desert , for a moment surveying our long line , and then darting off to his fastuesses , - these were the objects which , with scarce any variation , met our eyes during the four wearisome days that we dragged ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * " I was still buried in reflection , when I was aroused by the shout of those who led the caravan , and who had attained the summit of a little rising ground , saying , Palmyra ! Palmyra ! ' I urged forward my steed , and in a moment the most wonderful prospect I ever beheld , - no , I can not except even Rome burst upon my sight . Flanked by hills of considerable elevation on the East , the city filled the whole plain below as far as the eye could reach , both toward the North and toward the South . This immense plain was all one vast and boundless city . It seemed to me to be larger than Rome . Yet I knew very well that it could not be , - that it was not . And it was some time before I understood the true character of the scene before me , so as to separate the city from the country , and the country from the city , which here wonderfully interpenetrate each other , and so confound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studded with groups of lofty palm-trees , shooting up among its temples and palaces , and on the other hand , the plain in its immediate vicinity is so thickly adorned with magnificent structures of the purest marble , that it is not easy , nay it is impossible at the distance at which I contemplated the whole , to distinguish the line which divided the one from the other . It was all city and all country , all country and all city . Those which lay before me I was ready to believe were the Elysian Fields . I imagined that I saw under my feet the dwellings of purified men and of gods . Certainly they were too glorious for the mere earth-born . There was a central point , however , which chiefly fixed my attention , where the vast Temple of the Sun , stretched upward its thousand colums of polished marble to the heavens , in its matchless beauty casting into the shade every other work of art of which the world can boast . I have stood before the Parthenon , and have almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a toy by the side of this bright crown of the Eastern // capital . I have been at Milan , at Ephesus , at Alexandria , at Autioch ; but in neither of those renowned cities have I beheld any thing that I can allow to approach in united extent , grandeur , and most consummate beauty , this almost more than work of man . On each side of this , the central point , there rose upward slender pyramids , - pointed obelisks , - domes of the most graceful proportions , columns , arches , and lofty towers , for number and for form , beyond my power to describe . These buildings , as well as the walls of the city , being all either of white marble , or of some stone as white , and being everywhere in their whole extent interspersed , as I have already said , with multitudes of overshadowing palm-trees , perfectly filled and satisfied my sense of beauty , and made me feel for the moment , as if in such a scene I should love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This passage will not excite too higb expectations respecting the work , which is written throughout in a natural , agreeable , well-sustained style , though with a few negligences , here and there , which a slight revision might remove , and , also , as it seemed to us , a few repetitions of the same essential idea or conception . The magnificent architecture of Pahnyra , the Temple of the Sun , and the Long Portico are finely brought into view in other parts of the work . In general , whatever is intended to be conformed to history and fact is represented correctly ; and it may therefore be worth while to mention the error , in the passage quoted , of placing the hills near Palmyra , on the east , instead of the west ; where it appears they stand from the account of Wood . While upon this head , we may as well notice another error of little more importance , but connected with a fact of some curiosity . Piso , in one of his letters , ( Vol. s. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through the arches of a vast aqueduct , which pours into the city a river of the purest water . This is the most striking object , and noblest work of art , without the walls . " So n Roman aqueduct might have been spoken of . But there was , at Palmyra , no aqueduct constructed upon arches . It is a remarkable fact , that its principal stipply of water was through an aqueduct built under ground , which has been broken , says Wood , about half a league from the city . He gives a plan of it , by which its interior appears to have been about four feet in xvidth , by eight feet in depth . This subterranean construction is , as far as we know , unique among ancient watercourses . That the Romans were acquainted with the fact , that water when confined will rise to the height of its source , seems now // to be the prevalent opinion . But the passage of Pliny which has been principally relied upon is a little suspicious . He says ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its source ; " - . flqua in plumbo subit ctltitudi'nem exortus su* . If he were acquainted with the general law of fluids , of which this is an example , why did he not express it in general terms , instead of stating a particular fact . We are reminded of what Horace says of the water , that " strives to burst its case of lead , " tendit rumpere plumbum , when speakiug of that which was conveyed through Rome , in leaden pipes from the reservoirs of the aqueducts . Considering the intellectual habits of the Romans , it would not be strange that a particular phenornenon should be kuown to them , without any inquiry following by which it might be traced to a general law . It should be observed , however , that in a subsequent part of the work , there is mention of the ruins of a subterranean aqueduct , through which Zenobia is represented as escaping from the city when it was environed by the Roman army . But this is described as of much larger dimensions than that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length on the characters and incidents of the " Letters from Palmyra " ; for the work itself is much better worth reading , than such an account as we might give . Zenobia , except that a dazzling haze of romance is thrown round her , appears as she is represented in history . Perhaps we should except also her being drawn as a female warrior , ready to engage personally in battle , as is also her friend Fausta . For ourselves , we could well have spared this trait in the character of either . But our associations with ancient amazons , with the swift-footed Camilla , for instance , are such , that we do not class them with those who make the nearest approach to their bravery in modern times . Generally it may be remarked , that to the higher and more prominent characters , there is ascribed a nobleness and refinement greater , some may think , than the nature of an historical romance requires ; for something of this sort , some idealizing of the personages of history it does require ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art . No character , perhaps , on the whole is more successfully managed than that of Longinus . From a charge that has been brought against Zenobia , of having exposed Longinus to the vengeance of Aurelian , in // order to save herself , a charge that appears in most modern accounts of her , and seems to have gaineti general credit , she is , we think , successfully vindicated by the author of the Letters , in a note to his second volume . We were led in consequence to look at the narrative of Gibbon . It is characteristic of that historian . He thus writes . " When the Syrian queen was brought into the presence of Aurelian , he sternly asked her , lloxv she had presumed to rise in arms against the emperors of Rome . ' The answer of Zenobia was a prudent mixture of respect and firmness . Because I disdained to consider as Roman emperors an Aureolus or a Gallienus . You alone I acknowledge as my conqueror and my sovereign . ' But as female fortitude is commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rrhe courage of Zenobia deserted her in the hour of trial ; she trein bled at the angry clamors of the soldiers , who called aloud for her immediate execution , forgot the generous despair of Cleopatra , which she had proposed to herself as a model , and ignominiously purchased life by the sacrice of her fame and her friends . It was to their counsels , which governed the weakness of her sex , that she imputed the guilt of her ohstinate resistance ; it was on their heads that she directed the vengeance of the cruel Aurelian . The fame of Longinus , who was included among the numerous and perhaps innocent victims of her fear , will survive that of the queen who betrayed , or the tyrant who condemned him . Genius and learning were incapable of moving a fierce unlettered soldier , hut they had served to elevate and harmonize the soul of Longinus . Without uttering a complaint , he calmly followed the executioner , pitying his unhappy mistress , and bestowing comfort on his afflicted friends . " For the answer with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage from Trebellius Pollin . " When , upon her being taken captive by Aurelian , and brought into his presence , he thus addressed her ; Why , Zenobia , have you dared to insult Roman emperors ? she is reported to have said I acknowledge you as an empex'or for you are a conqueror . I did not regard Gallienus , Aureolus , and the others as princes . Thinking Victoria like myself , I wished to share the empire with her , could we be brought into neighbourhood . ' " * This is not very like the prudent mixture of respect and firmness ascribed to her by the // 39 4 modern historian . Nor is it probable that even this answer , which is mentioned by Trebellius only as report , was really made by Zenobia . Victoria or Victorina was the mother of Victorinus , who , amid a rapid succession of assassinations and changes , obtained the command of the army in Gaul , and she appears to have shared in his short-lived power But her name has almost disappeared from history ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably have considered her as rivallin6 herself . The remark of Gibbon , respecting female fortitude , is like a large proportion of those appearing throughout his work in the form of apothegms , which , whether true or false , are trivialities disguised by the formal style of their annunciation . In endurance , woman has shown herself not in* ferior to man . That Zenobia had proposed the generous despair of Cleopatra for her model , is only an embellishment . For the narrative of the death of Longinus , we follow the author of the Letters in quoting the passage on which it rests , from Zosimus , who wrote more than a century after the destruction of Palmyra . " Aurelian , returning to Emesa , sat in judgment upon Zenobia and those who had been connected with her . Then she related the causes of the war , exculpating herself and bringing forward many others as leading her on , she being only a woman . Among them was Longinus , of whom there are writings extant , which afford great profit to such as are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges brought against him , was immediately condemned to death by the king . This he bore so nobly as to comfort those who compassionated his rnisfortune. * ' Such is the story which Gibbon has dressed in modern costume . To the confutation of it in the note before referred to , it may be added , that Zosimus was so ill-informed respecting Zenobia , and so careless of obtaining correct information , that in regard to her death he only gives a report , that , as Aurelian was carrying her with him to Rome , she died either through disease or voluntary hunger ; * though two contetnporary historians ( Trebellius Pollio and Vopiscus ) speak of her as having been led in triumph by the emperor . Zosimus , as if to despatch the whole business at once , proceeds with the same report , as stating that all those who shared in her rebellion , except her son , were drowned in the Hellespont . He Lib . I. c. 59. // had before related , that some of them , at least , were put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have written more than about thirty years after the destruction of Palmyra , says , that the ( lescendants of Zenobia were remaining among the nobility of Rome ; and that it was reported that she lived with her children like a Roman matron ; " Aurehan , " he says , " having given her an estate at Tibur ( Tivoli ) still called by her name , not far from the palace of Adrian . " * We have quoted from the Letters a passage which shows Palmyra at the height of its prosperity . We will contrast it with another which describes its sack and ruin . Piso is 5u1 ) J ) osed to have retired from the city with the family of a noble Roman , resident in Paitnyra , Gracehus , the father of Fausta , shortly before the event , and to be viewing the scene from one of the neighbourin0 heights . " After one day of preparation and one of assault , the city has fallen , and Aurelian again entered in triumph . This time in the spirit of revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , horror-struck , that no quarter is given , but that a general massacre has been ordered , both of soldier and citizen . We can behold whole herds of the defenceless populace escaping from the gates or over the walls , only to be pursued , - hunted , - and slaughtered by the remorseless soldiers . And thousands upon thousands have we seen driven over the walls , or hurled from the battlements of the lofty towers to perish , dashed upon the rocks below . " * * * * * " No sooner had the evening of this fatal day set in , than a new scene of terrific sublimity opened before us , as we beheld flames beginning to ascend from every part of the city . They grew and spread , till they presently appeared to wrap all objects alike in one vast sheet of fire . Towers , pinnacles , and domes , after glittering awhile in the fierce blaze , one after another fell and disappeared in the general ruin . The Temple of the Sun stood long untouched , shining ahoost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shafts and sides reflecting the surrounding fire with an intense brilliancy . We hoped that it might escape , and were certain that it would , unless fired from within , - as , from its insulated position , the flames from the neighbouring buildings could not reach it . But . we watched not long ere from its western extremity the fire broke forth , and warned us that that peerless monument of human genius , like all else , would soon // crumble to the ground . To our amazement , however , and joy , the flames , after having made great progress , were suddenly arrested , and by some cause extinguished , - and the vast pile stood towering in the centre of the desolation , of double size , as it seemed , from the fall and disappearance of so many of the surrounding structures . " * * * * " On the third day after the capture of the city and the massacre of the inhabitants , the army of the conqueror and destroyer ' withdrew from the scene of its glory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of Aurelian while before the city , for I cared not to meet him drenched in the blood of women and children . But as soon as he and his legions were departed , we turned toward the city , as children to visit the dead body of a parent . " No language which I can use , my Curtius , can give you any just conception of the horrors which met our view on the way to the walls and in the city itself . For more than a mile before we reached the gates , the roads , and the fields on either hand , were strewed with the bodies of those who , in their attempts to escape , had been overtaken by the enemy and slain . Many a group of bodies did we notice , evidently those of a family , the parents and the children , who , hoping to reach in company some place of security , had all ,  --  and without resistance , apparently , - fallen a sacrifice to the relentless fury of their pursuers . Immediately in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth was concealed from the eye by the multitudes of the slain , and all objects were stained with the one hue of blood . Upon passing the gates and entering within those walls which I had been accustomed to regard as embracing in their wide and *raceful sweep , the most beautiful city of the world , my eye met nought hut black and smoking ruins , fallen houses and temples , the streets choked with piles of still blazing timbers and the half-burned bodies of the dead . As I penetrated farther into the heart of the city , and to its better-built and more spacious quarters , I found the destruction to be less , - that the principal streets were standing , and many of the more distinguished structures . But everywhere , - in the streets , - upon the porticos of private and public dwellings , - upon the steps and within the very walls of the temples of every faith ,  --  in all places , the most sacred as well as the most common , lay the mangled carcasses of the wretched inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged were there , with their bald or silvered heads , - little children and infants , - women , the young , the beautiful , the good , - all were there slaughtered in every imaginable way , and presenting to the eye // spectacles of horror and of grief enough to break the heart and craze the brain . For one could not but go back to the day and the hour when they died , and suffer with these innocent thousands a part of what they suffered , when , the gates of the city giving way , the infuriated soldiery poured in , and with death written in their faces and clamoring on their tongues , their quiet houses were invaded , and , resisting or unresisting , they all fell together , beneath the murderous knives of the savage foe . What shrieks then rent and filled the air , - what prayers of agony went up to the gods for life to those whose ears on mercy 's side were adders ' , - what piercing supplications that life might be taken and honor spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most harrowing spectacles , where the inmates , delicately nurtured and*knowin g of danger , evil , and wrong only by name and report , had first endured all that nature most abhors , and then there , where their souls had died , were slain by their brutal violators with every circumstance of most demoniac cruelty . Happy for those who , like Gracchus , foresaw the tempest and fled . These calamities have fallen chiefly upon the adherents of Antiochus ; but among them , alas ! were some of the noblest and most honored families of the capital . rJ7 heir bodies now lie blackened and bloated upon their door-stones , - their own halls have become their tombs . " - Vol. ii . pp. 2529 - 233 . To understand what follows , it must be told that Piso had half become a Christian . " The silence of death and of ruin rests over this once and but so lately populous city . As I stood upon a high point which overlooked a large extent of it , I could discern no signs of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard dragging forth the bodies of the slaughtered citizens , and bearing them to be burned or buried . This whole people is extinct . In a single day these hundred thousands have found a common grave . Not one remains to bewail or bury the dead . Where are the anxious crowds , who , when their dwellings have been burned , eagerly rush in as the flames have spent themselves , to sorrow over their smoking altars , and pry with busy search among the hot ashes , as if perchance they may yet rescue some lamented treasure , or bear away , at least , the bones of a parent or child , buried beneath the ruins ? They are not here . It is broad day , and the sun shines bright , but not a living form is seen lingering about these desolated streets and squares . Birds of prey are already hovering round , and alighting without apprehension of disturbance wherever the banquet invites them ; and soon as the shadows of evening shall fall , the hyena of the desert will be here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // afar off upon the tainted breeze the fumes of the rich feast here spread for him . These Roman grave-diggers from the Legion of Bassos , are alone upon the ground to contend with them for their prize . 0 , miserable condition of humanity ! Why is it that to man have been given passions , which he can not tame , and which sink him below the brute ! Why is it that a few ambitious are permitted by the Great RiAer , in the selfish pursuit of their own aggrandizement , to scatter in ruin , desolation , and death , whole kingdoms , - making misery and destruction the steps by which they mount up to their seats of pride ! 0 , gentle doctrine of Christ ! - doctrine of love and of peace , when shall it be that I and all mankind shall know thy truth , and the world smile with a new happiness under thy life-giving reign ! " - Vol. ii . pp. 234 , 235 . This is very powerful description , hut not exaggerated . It only presents to our imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events , that Aurelian himself sums up in a few lines of a letter , * in which no touch of remorse betrays that the writer belonged to our race . " Atirelian Augustus to Ceionius Bassus . Palmyrenes enough have been slain and cut to pieces . We have not spared the women ; we have killed the infants ; we have slnu*htered the old men ; we have destroyed the peasants . To whom shall we leave the country or city ? Those who remain must be spared . For we trust that so few will be corrected by the punishment of so many . " And he then passes on , with the same coolness , to speak of repairing the Temple of the Stin . Vopiscus , who reckons Aurelian among the few excellent emperors from Augustus to Constantius Chlorus , describes this letter as " exhibiting an acknowledgment of the most savage fury ; " confessionent immanissimi furoris ostentans . Gibbon speaks of it with more calmness , and only on a later occasion makes some philosophical remarks upon the character of Aurelian ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a soldier , his nerves yielded not easily to the impression of sympathy and he could sustain without emotion the sight of tortures and death . Trained from his earliest youth in the exercise of arms , he set too small a value on the life of a citizen . " The historian adds , that " His love of justice often became a blind and furious passion . " If so , it was a remarkable transformation . One characteristic of the " Letters from Palmyra , " from // which tbey derive much of their interest , consists in the just views they afford of the condition of mankind during the period to which they relate . Facts are brought distinctly before us , so as to produce a right impression of the age ;  --  the merciless and rapacious character of its continual wars , the widelyspread miseries of private slavery , the absence of a true standard of right , and the religious darkness of the pagan world . Nor are these painful features made too prominent ; a benevolent and cheerful tone of feeling pervades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the holiday joyousness of Palmyra , by the aniiable or generous traits of character ascribed to most of the principal personages , and especially by the light of Christianity , which appears as having risen above the horizon . Ancient history has often heen so written in modern times that the reader , unless he be more than corninonly attentive and thoughtful , will gain no correct notion of its proper subject , of the men of former times of whom it proposes to give an account . lie will learn little more than names , events , and dates . He will have little idea of the real state of civilization , of the forms of society , of the modes of life , the feelings , occupations , and enjoyments of the generality of men , of the passions , vices , impulses , and principles hy which they were governed , of the point to which intellectual culture had attained , and of the extent of its diffusion , or consequently , of the aspect under which human nature presented itself , so widely different from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philosophical comprehension of what he is relating . The facts of the age of which lie treats are insulated in his mind , not grouped together so as to form a consistent and striking picture , not seen in their relations , not viewed comparatively with those of other periods and different states of our race . He has not imagination to discern the details necessarily involved in general statements nor penetration , knowledge of human nature , and moral sensibility to appreciate as he ought the particulars which he brings together . He can not withdraw himself from the circle of the age in which he lives . His modem associations cling round the events and characters of antiquity , and hide their real features . He limits his views to prominent individuals , concerning whom our information is often so uncertain , and overlooks the actual character and state of the mass of men , which , for the most part , there are documents enough to illustrate . As // shown by him , a veil lies over it , beneath which only the common outline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the excellent history of Mitford is of another character . But of the Roman empire we have no truly instructive account , except so far as the late work of Sismondi supplies the deficiency . In the history of Gibbon we doubt whether there are more errors arising merely from want of information or want of care , than might reasonably he expected in so voluminous a work , embracing such a variety of topics . It is the compilation of an industrious scholar . But in treating of the history of Christianity , especially in his earlier volumes , his su ) pressions of the truth , the very disproportioned prominence which he gives to particular facts , his quotations of single passages without the explanation which would change their aspect , his insinuations of what is false without the direct expression of it , his language hovering on the bounds of the ironical and the serious , so that it may be understood in the former sense , and defended in the latter , and his sneerin* and injurious tone , the result of utter incapacity to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of the grossest mis representation . In the other portions of his history , there is the want of a thinking and reasoning spirit to vivify the mass of facts . To the title of philosopher , which he particularly affected , he has no claim . He has given the detail of events , during a long period , with occasional striking expressions , and strokes of wit , but he has not given it history . He has not connected those events with their essential causes ; nor viewed them as characteristic of the condition of man . His work l ) resents a series of changes seemingly accidental ; for the reasoiis are not made apparent , why the course of things might not have been very different from what it was , the same general state of society existing . His moral temperament , likewise , was as defective as his philosophical . It is not merely that he was an infidel , of the French school of Voltaire , nor that a trait of indecency which he could introduce in a note or insinuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him aside from the serious and honorable purposes of history ; but we feel throughout his history the absence of a just estimate of men and things , an absence of moral discrimination and sentiment . Though without an extraordinary number of mistakes arising from mere want of scholarship , his work is a misrepresentation throughout . Every thing is modernized // and discolored . From a superficial reading of it , one may scarcely derive notions of the period of which it treats , more correct than what he would have of the ancient Greeks and Romans , if he imagined that the historical pictures of the French painter , David , actually represented the scenes which are their subject . His work is like an exhibition on the ancient stage . The painted mask , the buskin , the stiffened and heavy folds of the drapery conceal all characteristic lineaments and expression . His style moves on with its formal and pompous march , whatever is to he told . If we may use such a figure , instead of the faint flourish of trumpets at doubtful victories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbaric music , and , blending with all , the continual wail of desolation , we hear only the constant monotonous playing of an organ with a small compass of notes . When the veil or the pall is lifted from the age to which the " Letters from Palmyra " relate , we behold the Roman world overspread with armies . Everywhere are war , seditions , mas sacres , slavery , and cruelty . The Roman armies , formed , like the Free Companions or the troops of the Condottieri , of mercenaries of different nations , and resembling them in ra* pacity and savageness , were the true rulers of the empire . The emperors were those whom they chose for a time to acknowledge as their masters ; either military leaders , like Aurelian , whose fierce and hardy qualities commanded their admiration , and gave them promise of success in war ; or worthless profligates , like Gallienus , who , by unbounded largesses and brihes , purchased from them the privilege of indulging in the most detestable excesses . Among the nobles and the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice , that sole care for safety and selfish gratifications , which can result only from the absence of all sense of morals in a community where life and fortune are constantly at hazard . " *Imavit propinquos , res nostris temporibus comparartda miraculo ; " - " He loved his friends , " says the contemporary historian , Trebellius , " a thing in our age to be compared to a prodigy . " But amid this state of things , which seemed to threaten the dissolution of civil society , a new element had been and was still working . Christianity had been introduced ; and there can not be a contrast more striking than what appeared 4uring the first three centuries of our era , between the pagan // world and the new brotherhood of Christians . In becoming acquainted with the true history of the Christians of this period , we become conversant with men , who , whatever might be their mistakes or failings , or the vices of some of their number , present a wholly different character from that of the inultitudes around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature unfolding . A history that should fairly represent the age , a history , in consequence , unlike that of Gibbon in almost every feature , would constitute one of the most powerful arguments for the divine origin of our religion ; for it would show the impossibility of its having had its source in those causes , which had been and were operating upon the condition of men everywhere , without the sphere of its influence . We have been led into these remarks , because in the volumes before us the contrast between Christianity and paganism is beautifully exhibited . Though never obtrusively brought forward , it runs through the work and constitutes one of its principal charms . Of this no quotations which our limits admit would afford a fair specimen ; and we shall give but a single extract from a very interesting conversation . In the course of the story we are introduced to an individual in extreme old age , a herniit , who , having been a preacher of our religion , had now , that his strength failed him , retired from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who writes the account , in company with Fausta and with Julia , the daughter of Zenobia . The old man is speaking . Till age dried up the sources of my strength , I toiled night and day in all countries and climates , in the face of every danger , in the service of mankind . For it is by serving others , that the law of Christ is fulfilled . This disinterested labor for others constituted the greatness of Jesus Christ . This constitutes true greatness in his followers . I perceive that what I say falls upon your ear as a new and strange doctrine . But it is the doctrine of Christianity . It utterly condemns , therefore , a life of solitary devotion . It is a mischievous influence which is now spreading outward from the example of that Paul , who suffered so much under the persecution of the Emperor Decius , and who then , flying to the solitudes of the Egyptian Thebais , has there in the vigor of his days buried himself in a cave of the earth , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to he , " The farther from man , the nearer to God , " - the reverse of the Christian maxim , " The nearer man , the nearer God . " A disciple of Jesus has truly said ; " He who loves not his brother // whom he hath seen , how shall he love God , whom he hath not seen ? " This , it may be , Roman , is the first sentence you have ever heard from the Christian books . ' I am obliged to confess that it is , ' I replied . I have heretofore lived in an easy indifference toward all religions . The popular religion of my country I early learned to despise . I have perused the philosophers , and examined their systems , from Pythagoras to Seneca , and am now , what I have long been , a disciple of none hut Pyrrho . My researches have taught me only how the more ingeniously to doubt . Wearied at length with a vain inquiry after truth that should satisfy and fill me , I suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I was not even tempted to depart from this resolution when Christianity offered itself to my notice ; for I confounded it with Judaism , and for that , as a Roman , I entertained too profound a contempt to hestow upon it a single thought . I must acknowledge that the reports which I heard , and which I sometimes rea ( l , of the marvellous constancy and serenity of the Christians , under accumulated sufferings and wrongs , interested my feelings in their behalf ; and the thought often arose , " Must there not be truth to support such heroism ? " But the world went on its way , and I with it , and the Christians were forgotten . To a Christian , on my voyage across the Mediterranean , I owe much , for my first knowledge of Christianity , To the Princess Julia I owe a larger debt still . And now from your lips , long accustomed to declare its truths , I have heard what makes me truly desirous to hear the whole of that , which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has afforded so real a satisfaction . ' If you studied the Christian books , ' said the recluse , you would be chiefly struck , perhaps , with the plainness and simplicity of the doctrines there unfolded . You would say that much which you found there , relating to the right conduct of life , you had already found scattered through the books of the Greek and Roman moralists . You would be startled by no strange or appalling truth . You would turn over their leaves in vain in search of such dark and puzzling ingenuities as try the wits of those who resort to the pages of the Tim*us . A child can understand the essential truths of Christ . And the value of Christianity consists not in this , that it puts forth a new , ingenious , and intricate system of philosophy , but that it adds to recognised and familiar truths divine authority . Some things are indeed new ; and much is new , if that may be called so , which , having been neglected as insignificant by other teachers , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential . But the peculiarity of Christianity lies in this , that its voice , whether heard in republishing // an old and familiar doctrine , or announcing a new one , is not the voice of man , but of God . It is a revelation . It is a word from the invisible , unapproachable Spirit of the universe . For this Socrates would have been willing to renounce all his wisdom . Is it not this which we need ? XVe can theorize and conjecture without end , but can not relieve ourselves of our doubts . They *vi1l assail every work of man . We wish to repose in a divine assurance . Phis we have in Christianity . It is a message from God . It puts an end to doubt and conjecture . Wise men of all ages have agreed in the belief of One God ; but not being able to demonstrate his being and his unity , they have had no power to change the popular belieg which has ever tended to polytheism and idolatry . Christianity teaches this truth with the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith of millions . Philosophers have long ago taught that the only safe and happy life is a virtuous life . Christianity repeats this great truth , and adds , that it is such a life alone that conducts to immortality . Philosophers have themselves believed in the doctrine of a future life , and have died hoping to live again ; and it can not be denied that mankind generally have entertained an obscure expectation of a renewed existence after death . The advantage of Christianity consists in this , that it as*ures us of the reality of a future existence , on the word and authority of God himself . Jesus Christ taught , that all men come forth from death , wearing a new spiritual body , and thereafter never die ; and to confirm his teachmo ' he himself being slain , rose from the dead , and showed himself to his followers alive , and while they were yet looking upon him , ascended to some other and higher world . Surely , Roman , though Christianity announced nothing more than these great truths , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the authority of God , it is a vast accession to our knowledge . ' " - Vol. i. pp. 163- 166 . Our general estimate of the " Letters from Palmyra , " appears in what we have already said . It is not a work of an ordinary character . It is the production of a thoughtful , able , imaginative , and above all , a pure and right-minded author , of clear thoughts and sound sense.
