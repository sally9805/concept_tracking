txt Let all those , if any there are , who have not yet fully comprehended the miracle of the American Revolution , read this work ; we do not mean , to get the solution of this miracle , but to comprehend how truly and literally it was one . The history of the Revolution is more commonly read in reference to the operations of the army and the deliberations of Congress at home . There we see and feel the great difficulties , which were to be encountered ; inexperienced and distracted counsels ; an imperfect Constitution ; an ill paid , constantly changing , and at last partially disaffected army ; and a powerful foe , commanding the sea and firmly lodged upon the strongest* point of the coast . We are apt to fix upon the French alliance , as the offset to these appalling difficulties , as the great and main stay of the patriots , and so it was . But we need only turn over the pages of these volumes to learn the truth , that this alliance itself was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great event of the Revolution itself . The alliance saved the United States ; but how hardly was the alliance itself formed , and how often did it seem impossible to realize its fruits ! The rarest conjuncture of persons and things was requisite , and did in fact exist , but accompanied , at the same time , by other agents so ill qualified , and other events so untoward , that it would seem as if the Good and Evil Genius of America had each his alternate day assigned him , in controlling the march of things . In a word , it makes one , who loves his country , *-one who has a mind to comprehend , and a heart to feel the worth of the blessings we inherit ,  - -  actually become grave and even melancholy to read this book . Mr. Morris , in an extract from his diary , ( with several of which the volumes containing his Correspondence are enriched , ) relates that , when the English standards , captured at Yorktown , were borne in triumph through the streets of Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were // rather touched with feelings of solemnity than of exultation . It is impossible to dismiss the same serious impression , in contemplating the perilous exposures of our interests in Europe , and the happy issue of counsels oftentimes the most ill advised , discordant , and rash ; or when wise and seasonable , not unfrequently dashed by unfortunate execution . We know there is a just delicacy and a fastidious timidity in speaking on these themes . We shall preserve this delicacy , hut not yield to any unbecoming timidity , in telling the truth . Let poetry and romance tell their tale of the Revolution . It will bear all their ornaments ; - it deserves them all . Its incidents and its actors are worthy of the highest and most flattering strain of panegyric . It is fit that they should thus be commemorated . It is yet rather too soon to do it ; but they are to constitute our heroic age ; and one on which , we trust , the minds of a late posterity will more fondly dwell , than classical Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelops ' line . ' But this is the province of Poetry and Romance . It is their business to idealize the statues which they erect in the temple of Renown ; to redeem men from their imperfections ; to throw a rich purple robe of glory over their faults , to smooth away the lines , which care has planted in their faded cheeks , and to give them the vigorous port , and roseate bloom of demi-gods . But this is not the business of history . Her work is graver , aye , sadder . It is her business neither to flatter nor to delight ; but to instruct . It is her business to tell the truth ; to tell it calmly , dispassionately , charitably , but fearlessly ; to pass sentence on character , like a merciful , but righteous judge . The history of the American Revolution has not yet been so told it can not yet be . We are too near the age . Some of those concerned in it are still among us ; we can not in decency disturb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or where the original actors have passed off the stage , as nearly all the most distinguished have done , their kindred remain , whose family affections are sacred . But in proportion to the delicacy , with which we ought to approach the task of awarding the meed of praise to those of the distinguished actors of the Revolution , who were at variance with each other during their own life-time , ought to be the satisfaction , with which we welcome those collections of original letters and other documents , of which several have lately been // published , and of which this is by far the most considerable . In these documents alone , the secret , that is , the true history of the Revolution is concerned . The fate of the Revolution was decided by the French alliance . We do not mean to agitate a question of metaphysical politics , whether our Independence would have failed to be established by any other agency ; nor merely to repeat a truism from the schools , that nothing can happen otherwise than it does . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained from France , at an early period of the Revolution , and the subsequent co-operation of her armies and navies , the war of the Revolution could not have been brought to a successful issue . It is impossible to deny this , on any other ground , than that of vague patriotic sentiment , which would lead us to insist that the righteous cause always prospers ; the contrary of which we know to be true . But notwithstanding the great importance of the French alliance , in the revolutionary war , it was brought about with perhaps less preparation , than might have been expected . If courts have the fondness for intrigue ascribed to them , it must nevertheless be admitted , that in this case , the French court had practised a remarkable forbearance toward the English colonies on the North-American coast . Here were twelve or thirteen distant settlements , dependent on England . They were established upon a continent , on which France also had founded colonies ; where she had also vast territorial possessions , which , wrested from her at the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English and Spaniards . The French are , it is known , a people peculiarly apt at forming relations at a distance ; although , if we draw an inference from history , we should conclude them to be less successful in keeping up than in originating such relations . But the eyes of the French Government had never been withdrawn from our continent ; and the wars of 1744 and 1755 , although extending to other states and other interests , had their origin - in the struggles between England and France , in reference to their possessions in America . The breaking out of general hostilities in 1755 , was produced by General Washington 's expedition to the Ohio . The peace of 1763 , as is well known , cost France her possessions on the continent of North America . Scarcely had this peace been concluded , when the political controversy between the English colonies and the British // Government assumed a serious aspect . Mr. Grenville 's plan to tax America dates from 1764 ; and from that time till the breaking out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here then seemed to be an opportunity for France at once to consult her interest and heal her wounded pride . She had carried on more than one war with England , on account of their respective colonial possessions in America , and in these wars the English colonists had fought with equal loyalty and vigor under the British standard . A state of things now arose , when the colonists were becoming more and more disaffected , and when a prospect opened , that they might be made to throw off their allegiance to the British crown . Now in this state of things , it is a matter of some surprise , that the French court should have paid no more attention to this controversy from 1763 to 1775. it is true , we are informed by Dr. Franklin , that he was visited by the French minister at London in 1767 , and that he was very inquisitive in relation to American affairs ; and these circumstances led Dr. Franklin to write to his son in terms like these ; I fancy that intriguing nation would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the coals between Great Britain and her colonies ; but I hope we shall give them no opportunity. ** But it does not appear that any thing was done by France in the interval between the peace of 1763 and 1775 , to justify the character here ascribed to her . We do not recollect any correspondence , private or official , between any Government agent or men of influence in France and leading characters of America . The patriots of America sought the countenance of the opposition in England , but do not appear to have had any connexions in France , whose Government might have been expected , if only in the way of intrigue ,  --  *a sort of necessary element of court life ,  --  to have formed some kind of intercourse with prominent individuals in the colonies . This political phenomenon is not the least characteristic of the degradation of the French cabinet under Louis XV . Under Governments where there is no public political press , and consequently no public political sentiment , the tone of politics depends on the personal character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely absorbed in the vile intrigues of the palace , that they found time for no business not directly // connected with the perpetuation of the crazy machine of their Government from day to day . The great question agitated , was not , whether the American colonies should throw off the British yoke , but whether the dauphiness should be compelled to visit Madame du Barry . Accordingly , from that time down to the period of the accession of Louis XVI. , not a letter had been written that we know of , not an agent on either side had been despatched , in reference to any political connexion between France and the colonies . We should the more xvonder at this , were there not another like example now in existence , and before our eyes . We deem it highly probable , that , by a judicious course of policy pursued for a few years beforehand , the British colonies on this continent could have been so prepared for the war of 1812 , as that , on its declaration , they would have made com* mon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , the same . Their feelings as men must be as prompt as ours to be gratified in the enjoyment of political independence , and to be wounded at being , both in a military and political point of view , garrisoned from a distant and not very conciliatory metropolis . If the question were put to the people of Upper and Lower Canada , of New-Brunswick and NovaScotia , whether they would constitute four States of the American Union , with eight Senators and forty members of Congress , or remain in the dependence of Great Britain , a remote colony for younger sons to fatten upon , there can , we suppose , be but one opinion , as to the answer . But instead of any understanding with the people of the Canadas , previous to the war , and a preparation of their minds to make common cause with us in that struggle , which as an American question was as important to them as to us , the war commenced , on our part , by an invasion of those provinces . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reviving the eleventh article of the Confederation : Canada acceding to this Confederation , and joining in the measures of the United States , shall be admitted to and entitled to all the advantages of this Union . ' Had such a law been passed , and the operations of the war on the frontier been confined to the defensive , it is not impossible that very important consequences , in all respects , must have resulted . We are now at peace with Great Britain , and honor as well as policy forbids our tampering with her subjects . But it is a great public duty of the American // statesman to look forward ,  --  to contemplate the unfortunate probability of future wars , and the relations of the colonial possessions of the British Government to the United States and the mother country , whenever a state of war shall arise . It is his duty to guard against all sources of alienation and bitterness between this country and the neighboring and kindred population beyond the northern boundary . He ought to feel , in all its force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an extension of the limits of the United States to the north , to preserve a safe balance of its growth to the south . For these reasons , the march of events in the Canadas ought to be carefully watched ; - their parties and controversies understood ; - all causes of irritation avoided ; - all means of conciliation sought ; - intercourse , commercial , politi- ' cal , and personal , cultivated in every manner , consistent with the principles of honor toward the Government of Great Britain , with which we are at peace ; and thus a good foundation laid for adopting on the first day of the next war , a provision tantamount to that , we have already cited from the Confederation . But so far from a pursuit of any such policy , we doubt if there be two communities in the world more essentially foreign from each other , than those of the United States and the British possessions on this continent . The intercourse between them is vastly less active , than hetween the United States and England or France ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood at Boston , NewYork , and Philadelphia , than the state of parties in these interesting adjacent provinces . Such a thing as a Canadian newspaper , taken by a citizen of the United States , for the sake of political information , we never heard of . Such a thing as a friendly political correspondence , between individuals of the two countries , we do not believe exists ; and if ten , or twenty , or fifty years hence , ( the longer the better , ) a war should break out , between us and Great Britain , we much *pprebend , that the most efficient preparation for it in the minds of the people in the British provinces , will remain unmade ; and that as little pains will have been taken , on our part , to turn it to advantage , in that quarter , as was made by the French court between 1763 , and the death of Louis XV. , to guide and animate the patriotic cause in this country . But a much higher spirit was infused into the French counsels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast their // eyes immedi*te1y toward the British colonies ; and in 1776 , their condition and the prospects of their struggle with the mother country were minutely discussed by Messrs . Turgot , and De Vergennes , and the leading principles of the French policy , as subsequently acted upon , were developed. * The first steps taken in organizing the foreign relations of the United States in the year 1775 , grew out of the personal connexions of Americans , who were or had been in Europe , particularly Dr. Franklin , who had just returned , and Arthur Lee , who was still in London ; and more especially the former . Dr. Franklin , as is well known , had been resident in England , for many years before the Revolution ; nor did he return to the country , till after the commencement of hostilities . He had filled the place of agent for Pennsylvania and Massachusetts , New-Jersey and Georgia , and had thus been brought very prominently before the English public , as the champion of America . The result of his examination before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was eminently calculated to affect the judgments and the imaginations of liberal and independent men , and to produce an impression of the extraordinary sagacity and patriotism of Franklin . These were qualities possessed by other distinguished American patriots of the day ; but the peculiar position of Dr. Franklin , as the representative of some of the Provincial Governments in London , brought him forward more conspicuously in this connexion , than any other citizen of the colonies . There is nothing invidious in the remark , that , at the commencement of the Revolution , Dr. Franklin was better known in Europe , than any North-American . He stood on a footing of intimacy with leading ' characters in Great Britain , and of personal acquaintance with many more . There were men at home of equal talent , and of greater efficiency as popular leaders ; many who , in positions as difficult , though of a different kind , had done as much to lead on the march of the Revolution , but who failed then and have consequently ever since failed , to acquire their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded to . Franklin 's name had pervaded the European world as the champion and representative of America , before those of the Adamses , of Henry , Otis , and Lee were beard of , beyond the Atlantic . So permanent are strong im // pressions once struck upon the public , as well as the private mind , that , while the name of Franklin has remained , and justly , in possession of its original celebrity , a Writer in the London Quarterly Review , ( writing probably from the attic story of an inner court , in one of the least secularized colleges at Oxford , ) has asked , within a few years , who ever heard of Patrick Henry ? But it would be unjust to Dr. Franklin , not to add , that he owed not a little of his political celebrity to his European reputation as a philosopher . He had the rare good fortune to vindicate awl appropriate to himself one of those fe*w great conceptions , of which a score can scarcely be enumerated in the history of the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their truth , confer of themselves immortal glory on a favored few of our race . No one can accuse us of exaggeration , if we place Dr. Franklin 's verification of the identity of the electric fluid and lightning , on a level with the Copernican theory or the Newtonian system . The peculiar field of his experiments on this subject , and the character of the elements dealt with are such , in fact , as to give to them a celebrity , beyond their actual importance as hitherto experienced . Copernicus had suggested and Newton demonstrated the true theory of the heavens , and the laws that guide their luminaries on their distant and almost boundless orbits ; but theirs was the meditation of the closet , calmly and studiously combining the results of the quiet and midnight observations of the astronomer . With the mass of mankind , the region of electric phenomena , the region of clouds and thunderstorms is as remote , as the orbit of Saturn . There is but one sky ; and the lightning is there , as high , and vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the same reason that the phases of the moon are more interesting to us than those of Jupiter 's satellites , Dr. Franklin 's experiments , by which , within our own atmosphere , the phenomena of the heavens and earth are brought together into actual contact , arrested the attention of the world , and gave to him a reputation of the most lofty and brilliant kind . The entire benefit of this reputation of Dr. Franklin accrued to the United States at the opening of the Revolution . They possessed the advantage of an access to the public mind of Europe , through the medium of one of the VOL. xxxIII. - No. 73. 58 // most popular scientific names of the age . No concurrence of circumstances so favorable could have been otherwise effected ; and it needs only to be added , that it took place in the person of a man possessing that practical prudence , knowledge of men , and skill in affairs , which would render any individual highly useful , even though destitute both of the political and scientific reputation of Dr. Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dignity of a venerable age , the strength of an unimpaired constitution , and the weight of a virtuous life , it must be admitted , that among the happy auspices of the opening Revolution , few are more signal , than that it found Dr. Franklin disposed and prepared to embark heart and soul in the cause ;  --  a man , whom ' in the language of Lord Chatham in the British House of Peers , all Europe holds in the highest estimation for his knowledge and wisdom ; whom she ranks with her Boyles and Newtons ; who is an honor , not to the English nation only , but to human nature . ' A good deal of important business properly connected with the foreign relations , and even the diplomacy of the country , was transacted by the entire body of Congress at its first convening , and before any kind of organization had taken place , for the distribution of affairs into separate departments . Thus on the 1st of October , 1774 , Messrs . R. H. Lee , J. Adams , Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Committee to prepare a loyal address to his Majesty ; and on the 11th of October , R. H. Lee , R. R. Livingston , and ilVir . Jay , were appointed a Committee to prepare an address to the people of Great Britain , which was adopted on the 14th of the month . The first of these addresses was the production of R. H. Lee , and Mr. Dickinson , who was afterwards added to the Committee ; the second was drafted by Mr. Jay . If any particular circumstance be sought for , apart from his general merit and standing in Congress , to account for Mr. Lee 's selection and position on these Committees , we might find it , perhaps , in the fact of the residence of two of his brothers abroad , one of them , Arthur , a provincial agent and the diligent correspondent of Samuel Adams and other American patriots . There were other memorials and addresses , such as those to the people of Canada , to the people of Ireland , and a second to the people of Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continental Congress . It may be interesting to observe , that the first petition to the King was re // ferred to Parliament at the opening of the session of 1775 , but it came in undistinguished among other letters and papers from America . Understanding it to he before the House of Commons , the provincial agents , Messrs . Bollen , Franklin , and Arthur Lee , presented a petition of their own to he heard in support of that of the colonies . Sir George Saville took charge of their petition , hut on a question of receiving it , it was rejected hy a great majority after debate. * At length , on the 29th of October , 1775 , a Committee of five was appointed , for the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Britain , Ireland , and other parts of the world ; and that they lay their correspondence before Congress , when directed . ' An additional resolution provided for defraying the expenses incident to this correspondence , and the payment of the agents who may be sent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Virginia , Dr. Franklin , Mr. Johnson , of Maryland , Mr. Dickinson , and Mr. Jay . In the absence of the secret history of the day , it is out of our power to indicate the particular circumstance , which led to the choice of Mr. Harrison , as the chairman of this Corn-. mittee . He was , perhaps , the mover of the resolution . The operations of this Committee were no doubt considerably emharrassed , by the undecided political condition of the colonies . They had not thrown off their allegiance to England and whatever the wishes or opinions of individuals , in or out of Congress , may have been , they had not avoxved it as their object to effect a dismemberment of the empire . It was plain , that until their relations to Great Britain were ascertained , they could make no definite application to a foreign power . At the same time , the degree of countenance , which they might hope from foreign powers , might materially affect the course of Congress in reference to the great question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee of Correspondence appear to have been taken , with a view to obtaining information , how far they could hope for countenance from any of the Continental powers of Europe . On the 12th of December , // same time , written to M. Dumas , at the Hague ; they also desired Mr. Lee to correspond with M. Dumas . In the letter to Mr. Lee , the Committee say , it would be agreeable to Congress to know the disposition of foreign powers towards us , and we hope this object will engage your attention . We need not hint , that great circumspection and impenetrable secrecy are necessary . ' This letter is signed by B. Franklin , John Dickinson , and John Jay . About a week after the date of this letter , we find one from Dr. Franklin to M. Dumas . Though subscribed by Franklin alone , it is written on behalf of the Committee . M. Charles William Frederic Dumas was a native of Switzerland , but established in Holland as a man of letters , apparently in connexion with the booksellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparks , in the introductory note to his Correspondence , as a person of deep learning , versed in the ancient classics , and skilled in several modern languages , a warm friend of liberty , and an early defender of the American cause . ' Dr. Franklin had made his acquaintance in Holland , previous to his return to America , and a private correspondence had been entered into by M. Dumas with Dr. Franklin during the year 1775 . In the course of this correspondence , M. Dumas transmitted to America , for the libraries of Congress and Cambridge College , copies of his edition of Vattel , published in 1770 . On the establishment of the Committee of Correspondence , M. Dumas was written to by Dr. Franklin , and requested to become their agent . The following extract from the letter of Franklin , of December 19th , 1775 , will show the opinions and wishes entertained at that time , in reference to the foreign relations of the United States . We are threatened from England with a very powerful force , to come next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our power to prevent that force , and we hope we shall be able to defend ourselves . But as the events of war are always uncertain , possibly , after another campaign , we may find it necessary to ask aid of some foreign power . It gives us great pleasure to learn from you , that all Europe wishes us the best success in the maintenance of our liberty . But we wish to know , whether any one of them , from principles of humanity , disposed magnanimously to step in , for the relief of an oppressed people , or whether if , as it seems likely to happen , we should be obliged to break off all connexion with Britain , and declare our* // selves an independent people , there is any State or power in Europe , who would be willing to enter into an alliance with us , for the benefit of our commerce ; which amounted , before the war , to near seven millions sterling per annum , and must continually increase , as our people increase most rapidly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us and our cause , and in your sagacity and ability for business , the Committee of Congress , appointed for the purpose of establishing and conducting a correspondence with our friends in Europe , of which Committee I have the honor to be a member , have directed me to request of you , that as you are situated at the Hague , where Ambassadors from all the Courts reside , you will make use of the opportunity , which that situation affords you , of discovering , if possible , the disposition of the several *urts with respect to such assistance , or alliance , if we should apply for the one or propose for the other . As it may possibly be necessary , in particular instances , that you should , for this purpose , confer directly with some great Ministers , and show them this letter as your credential , we only recommend it to your discretion , that you proceed therein with such caution , as to keep the same from the knowledge of the English Ambassador , and prevent any public appearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business ; as thereby we imagine many inconveniences may be avoided , and your means of rendering us service increased . ' In pursuance of these instructions , M. Dumas approached the French Ambassador at the Hague , and laid before him a translation of the letter of the Committee , and a memorial showing how important it was to France , to prevent the subjugation of the colonies . The French Ambassador demanded specifically , what the colonies wished of France , and M. Dumas replied , 10 . The interference and good offices of France , to bring about a reconciliation with England , on conditions to secure the liberties of the colonies ; and 20 . Failing this , an alliance between the colonies and the House of Bourbon , for the sake of exclusive commercial advantages . By the House of Bourbon , ' M. Dumas probably meant to comprehend the two Governments of France and Spain . This , with the exception of the contemporaneous movement of Arthur Lee in London , was jhe first authentic overture made to the French Government on behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as could have been expected . The reply of the French Ambassador , ( of course after having taken the instruc tions of his court , ) was in the following terms // As to your first demand , the mediation of the King can not take place , whilst the colonies are *ubjects of the King of England , who besides would not accept it . As to your second demand , the King is a true knight , his word is sacred . He has given it to the English , to live in peace with them . He will hold to it . While France is not at war with the English , he will not ally himself against them with the colonies , and will not furnish aids to the latter . But , on the other hand , for the same reason , the Americans have the same protection and liberty , as all other English , to resort to France , to export thence merchandize , arms , and munitions of war , without however forming magazines of them in France , which is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonies have no need that either France or Spain should enter into this war . Gomm*'ce alone will furnish the Americans all that they want to defend themselves . ' * In a short period after the date of this communication , Silas Deane went to Europe , in the service of the United States , and was followed in the same year , by Dr. Franklin . It was not therefore left to M. Dumas to pursue the intercourse , which he had so respectably begun , with the court of France . He continued , however , a valuable correspondent and agent of Congress . On Mr. Adams 's arrival in Holland , as the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States , IVI . Dumas was employed by him as secretary , translator , and interpreter ; and appears in this capacity to have rendered very important services . No talent and fidelity on the part of the minister , eminent as he was in both respects , could have supplied the place of the local knowledge of men and things , and the acquaintance with foreign languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of the United States , under the infincnee of an enthusiastic devotion to the cause . When Mr. Adams left the Netherlands to take a part at Paris in the negotiations for peace , M. Dumas was left by him Ghargi d'dffaires of the United States , at the Hague . In this capacity , lie cxc banged with the Dutch Government the ratification of the treaty , which had been negotiated by Mr. Adams . Mr. Sparks closes his notice of M. Durnas , with the following just reflections It will be seen by M. Dumas 's Correspondence , that his services were unremitted , assiduous. and important , and performed with a singular devotedness to the interests of the United States , // and with a warm and undeviating attachment to the rights and liberties for which they were contending . Congress seems not to have well understood the extent or merits of his labors . He was obliged often to complain of the meagre compensation which he received , and of the extreme difficulty with which he and his small family contrived to subsist on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as worthy of better returns , but with little effect . This indifference to his worth and services while living , renders it the more just that his services should be honored with the respect and gratitude of posterity . ' The letters of M. Dumas are contained in the latter half of the ninth volume of the work before us , and constitute one of the most curious and least familiar portions of the work . It will have been remarked , that the French ambassador at the Hague , in his reply to the overtures of M. Dumas , on behalf of the United States , expressed himself in a singular manner , as to the importance to the United States of a participation in the war , on the part of the house of Bourbon . The colonies have no need , that either France or Spain should enter into this war . Commerce alone will furnish the Americans with all they want to defend themselves . ' This strange sentiment may probably receive its explanation from an event , which took place about the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munitions , and clothing , under the form of a commercial transaction ; an event not yet entirely cleared , either of its mystery or its embarrassment , and which was , for a long time , a prominent topic in the consideration of the foreign relations of the United States . In pursuance of the instructions above mentioned , Arthur Lee had sought conferences with the French ambassador in London , on the subject of the affairs of the colonies . It is probable that substantially the same answer was given to Mr. Lee , which had been given to M. Dumas ; but the work before us does not contain any despatch from Lee , written at the time , and stating the answer of the French court . It appears , however , by subsequent letters of Arthur Lee , to the Committee of Correspondence , that in April or May , 1776 , he was waited upon in London , by Caron do Beaumarchais , who told Mr. Lee , that he came as an agent of the French court , and with the wish of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Beaumarchais informed // Mr. Lee , that the court of France wished to send an aid to America , of two hundred thousand pounds , in specie , arms , and ammunition , and that all they wanted was to know , through what Island to make the remittance , and that Congress should be apprized of it . They settled on Cape Fran*ois , as the place ; and at a second meeting , Beaumarchais requested Mr. Lee to procure a small quantity of tobacco , or some other produce , to be sent to the West Indies , to give it the air of a mercantile transaction , repeating over and over again , that it was for a cover only , and not for payment , as the remittance was gratuitous . With the verhal communication of this mysterious overture to the Committee of Correspondence , hy means of the messenger who had brought out the letters of the Committee , Mr. Lee 's agency in this affair appears to have ceased . Early in March , 1776 , Silas Deane was sent out to France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political agent . He was a member of Congress , and appears to have been in Europe before the commencement of the war . It is mentioned by Gordon , as a circumstance unfavorable to his character , that on his nomination , at a later period , as minister to France , jointly with Dr. Franklin and Mr. Jefferson , the delegates from his own State of Connecticut voted against him . As the proceedings of Congress were secret , and the ballots in this and similar elections have never been published , Gordon 's information on this as on runny other points , may be incorrect . On Deane 's arrival at Paris , fortified as he was by letters of introduction from Dr. Franklin , he found irumediate access to those persons in that place , who were friendly to America , and shortly to the Count dc Vergennes . This minister held to Mr. Deane a language of precisely the same tenor , as that which we have before quoted from the letter of M. Dumas . Deane was soon waited on by Beaumarchais , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Count de Vergennes . A plan was soon arranged between them , in consequence of which large supplies of arms , munitions , and clothing , were shipped by Beaumarchais to America . On the 18th of August , 1776 , he wrote a letter himself to the Committee of Secret Correspondence , commencing in the following lofty strain : The respectful esteem , that I bear towards that brave people , who so well defend their liberty under your conduct , has induced me to form a plan for concurring in this great work , by establishing // an extensive commercial house , solely for the purpose of serving you in Europe ; there to supply you with necessaries of every sort , to furnish you expeditiously and certainly with all articles , clothes , linen , powder , ammunition , muskets , cannon , or even gold for the payment of your troops , and in general , every thing that can be useful for the honorable war , in which you are engaged . Your deputies , gentlemen , will find in me a sure friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffers , and every means of facilitating their operations , whether of a public or secret nature . I will , if possible , remove all obstacles , that may oppose your wishes from the politics of Europe . ' In the conclusion of the same letter , he says ; Look upon my house , then , gentlemen , from henceforward as the chief of all useful operations to you in Europe , and my person as one of the most zealous partisans of your cause , the soul of your success , and a man most deeply impressed with respectful esteem , &amp;c . ' This letter was signed by the fictitious name of Ilortalez &amp; Co. , under which the business of the Committee with Beaumarchais was transacted . The person addressing the Committee of Congress in this singular tone , was neither a merchant , a man of fortune , nor a politician ; hut a man of pleasure , a xvit , and a dramatic writer , till this time known only as the author of the . Mariage de Figaro. * It was at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by Congress , that these supplies were furnished by the King of France , as a subsidy to the United States , and without the intention of demanding payment . Eight cargoes were shipped , in the course of 1776 and 1777 , and the returns made of tobacco bore but a small proportion to the articles sent to America , and were supposed to he designed only to furnish a commercial cover to the transaction . As Beaumarchais , however , began to press for larger remittances by way of payment , Congress directed Dr. Franklin and A. Lee to seek for categorical information of the minister on the subject . This they did , and the minister informed them , that no part of the supplies was given by the king ; and that Beaurnarchais had only been permitted to take them from the arsenals to be replaced or paid for . This declaration , of course , * North American Review , Vol . X. p. 315 . VOL . XXXIII. - NO. 73. 59 // required the acquiescence of Congress , and they proceeded to admit Beaumarchais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay him by remittances of tobacco and bills on Dr. Franklin , in the whole to the amount of three millions and a half of livres . Great difficulties , however , arose in a final settlement of his accounts , which did not take place till 1805 . The United States , by their accounting officers , then acknowledged a balance due to the estate of Caron de Beaumarchais of two million seven hundred thousand livres , or about half a million of dollars . This debt was for the supplies furnished by Beaumarchais , and admitted never to have been paid for , by the United States . But from this sum , ascertained and admitted to be due by the United States , the accounting officers of the Treasury deducted the sum of one million of livres , with interest from the 10th of June , 1776 . The balance due , after this deduction , was paid to the heirs of Beaumarchais ,  --  who have demanded also , from that time to this , the re-payment of the one million of livres with interest , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , with good reason . As this is a point interesting to the honor of the nation , and as the claim has too long by many persons been taken for granted to be groundless , without examination , we very briefly state our view of the subject . In 1805 , then , the United States admitted that they owed Beaumarchais two million seven hundred thousand livres , on account of military supplies in the Revolution . But the United States debited Beaumarchais with one million of livres and interest from the 10th of June , 1776 . This deduction was made , because , ( as was alleged on the part of the United States , ) that sum of money was on the 10th of June , 1776 , paid to Beaumarchais , by order of Louis XVI. , for the service of the United States , for which million of livres Beaumarchais had never accounted to Congress . There is no doubt , from documents which have from time to time come to light , that this sum was so advanced by the King of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and with great earnestness , protested that this sum was applied for a secret political service , on account of the United States ; that it was not expended in the purchase of any part of the supplies ; and that Beaumarchais promptly accounted for it to the king , to whom alone he was accountable . With what show of justice , then , can the United States // credit themselves with this money in part payment of the supplies ? This is the short , if not the long of the case . In 1816 , Mr. Gallatin wrote on this subject to the Duke of Richelien , in the following terms : Without asking for the disclosure of the true application of that million , and without anticipating what species of proof will satisfy Congress , I may say that a simple but explicit negative declaration , on the part of his majesty 's Government , that the said million was not applied to the purchase of the supplies furnished by M. de Beaumarchais to the United States , would have removed the doubts entertained by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the account was settled there . ' Mr. Gallatin himself was the officer at the head of the Treasury , when that account was settled . To this observation of Mr. Gallatin , the Duke of Richelieu rejoined : I am therefore warranted , sir , after a fresh examination of the facts , in persisting in the declarations above stated , and in considering it as *a matter of certainty , that the million paid on the 10th of June was not applied to the purchase of the shipments made to the United States , at that period , by M. de Beaumarchais . ' On the 31st of January , 1817 , Mr. Madison sent a special message to Congress , in which he recommended the payment of this claim , in the following terms : Considering that the sum of which the million of livres in question made a part , was a gratuitous grant from the French Government to the United States , that that part of the grant was put into the hands of M. de Beaumarchais , as its agent , and not as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for by him to the French Government ,  --  1 recommend the case to the favorable attention of the Legislature , whose authority alone can decide it . ' The only question is , will we believe the official and often repeated assurance of the French Government , that the million advanced by her on the 10th of June , 1776 , was not applied to the payment of the supplies ? If we put faith in these assurances , we have no right to charge that million in Beaumarchais ' account for supplies furnished the United States , and his heirs are entitled to re-payment of it , with interest from June 10th , 1775. // The affair in other respects is vexatiously mysterious ; and what was done with the million may be a very curious piece of secret history . Nay , those who choose may believe , as we know many intelligent men do believe , that notwithstanding the disclaimer of the French Government , the million was nevertheless applied to the purchase of the supplies . But this is a very ungracious ground for Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Beauinarchais ' long urged claim . This consideration is strengthened by reflecting , that France did , in the Revolution , grant the United States large subsidies of money . She says ,  --  We gave you nine million of livres in money , of which one was applied by us to a secret service , on your account . The United States reply ,  --  No , you gave us eight millions in cash , and one in supplies ; and though the individual who furnished the supplies , says he furnished them all on his own account , ( as we admit he did the greater part , ) and you , the French Government , confirm his statement , yet we believe neither of you , and are resolved to debit him with this million . So far is this from being a language , which it becomes the American Congress to hold , that we maintain the entire subsidy ought to be re-paid to France . It imports the national honor very nearly , to pay off this last pecuniary debt of the Revolution. * But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the spring of 1776 . The French Government had then adopted its course ;  --  to maintain an apparent neutrality ; to give no open countenance to the rebels ; but secretly to render them efficient aid . This course , however recommended by reasons of state , was certainly not a very ingenuous one , and was attended by practical embarrassments and inconveniences . This long , perplexing , and offensive controversy relative to the claim of Beaumarchais , is itself proof enough of the justice of this remark . But we must take human nature as we find it . The country , in its extremity , went to France for aid . That aid we obtained in the most efficient manner , and it does not * Since the above was written , it is stated in the public papers , that a convention has been concluded with the French Government , in which provision is made by the United States for paying the claim of the heirs of Beaumarchais . It is further stated in those papers , that this claim is reduced , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half . We should be very sorry to find this true ; the claim is for a specific sum , unjustly withheld from Beaumarchais ' estate in 1805 , and ought all to be paid . // become us to criticise too nicely the mode in which it was administered . The Declaration of Independence in July , removed one great embarrassment in the way of an intercourse with foreign powers , and as it was at the same time found that France was willing to befriend us , the resolution was adopted by Congress of sending an authorized Commission to her court . This step was taken in September , 1776 . Dr. Franklin , Silas Deane , and Thomas Jefferson were appointed Commissioners to France , with authority to negotiate treaties with other foreign powers . Mr. Jefferson excused himself from domestic reasons , and Arthur Lee , still at London , was substituted in his place . Our opinion of this selection , as far as Dr. Franklin was concerned , may be inferred from what we have already said . It was no doubt the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being already on the spot . He possessed , at the time , the confidence of Franklin and of some of the best members of Congress ; but the progress and close of his mission were unfortunate , and his career terminated in a manner discreditable to himself and the country . Justice compels us to say , after the perusal of his correspondence and that of his colleagues , that the charges against him , urged by the Messrs . Lee and their friends in Congress , were never substantiated . A bitter feud arose between Franklin and Lee , in which Deane was involved on the side of Dr. Franklin . Deane ( and Franklin less distinctly ) was charged with peculation , and having made unauthorized and embarrassing contracts with French officers to enter into the service of the United States . An attempt was made in Congress to recall him , in a manner implying censure , but it failed ; and the resolution adopted placed the measure of recall on the ground , that it is of the greatest importance that Congress should , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affairs in Europe . ' Before hearing of his recall , Deane , in conjunction with his colleagues , had signed the treaty of alliance with France . This all-important transaction dates from February , 1778 . Deane repaired to Philadelphia , on his return to America ; and there , for two years , solicited , urged , and demanded an examination into his conduct . As far as we can now judge , Congress injuriously omitted to enter into such an examination . After detaining him a long time in Philadelphia , they passed a vote allowing the payment of his expenses dur // ing the period of that detention , but never came to a resolution of censure or approbation of his conduct . In 1780 , he returned to France , where he remained more than a year in destitute circumstances , attempting to settle his accounts . He claimed a large sum of the United States , which does not appear to have been allowed . He was accused , after this period and not without show of justice , of disaffection to the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaffection was probably produced by an exaggerated sense of the wrongs , which he had suffered from the party in Congress and the country at large who were opposed to him . This would furnish but a poor excuse for his treachery . No man in public life has any right to promise himself , even if successful , an exemption from the extremest injustice and abuse . If he fail in any degree of success , the most arduous efforts , and the purest motives are no protection from crying injustice and the grossest calumny . If such wrongs were to drive men into treason , half the statesmen in the country would have an apology for disaffection . Deane 's disaffection , however just his causes of complaint , argues therefore a levity and unsoundness of character . After the peace , he lived in England ; and it is said , engaged in the unworthy occupation of assisting Lord Sheffield in his work on American commerce , the object of which was to do the new States as much injury as possible in the opinions and hopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary want both of information and sagacity , evinced in this work on the subject of American commerce , would form a strong reason for doubting whether Deane could have contributed essentially to its preparation . His letters , as published in the collection before us , are those of a well-informed , and intelligent person ; and in his anticipations particularly of the growth of the Western country , he went , in precision and reach of view , beyond the standard of his day . In Deane 's official letters we are brought for the first time into direct connexion with the Count de Vergennes , * a minister whose name ought ever to be held in grateful recollection in America . Whether the policy , which he pursued , was the * When Deane was recalled , the Count de Vergennes wrote him a letter expressing in the strongest terms the satisfaction of the Court , at the manner in which he had discharged his duty as a minister of America . Dr. Franklin , unsolicited , djd the same thing . // boldest , which he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judging ; certainly not without access to the most secret archives of the French Court , at that period . But having adopted it , it is but justice to this minister to admit , that he pursued it with singular equanimity , firmness , and temper . The American Congress fairly threw itself and all its concerns abroad , and many indeed of its troubles at home , on the shoulders of the Count de Vergennes . By a standing instruction , our ministers abroad were directed to take the advice of the French Court ; and as the greatest part of the money supplies , which were raised for the support of the war , came from France , it is easy to perceive that the calls upon the time and attention of the minister must have been incessant . To all these difficulties were added the real novelty of the position of France , in reference to Great Britain and the Colonies , and the inexperience of Congress and most of the agents of Congress in Europe . All the thousand troubles connected with the solicitation and reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , the fitting out in French ports of armed ships on American account , the adjudication of prizes , the discontents of French officers returning from America , the clamors of the neutral powers against France , for the conduct or misconduct of our privateers , the dissensions of our own ministers ,  --  all these and a hundred other vexations , superadded to the main burden of carrying on the war , devolved upon the Count de Vergennes . The volumes before us are filled with the details , of these matters . No ordinary combination of good qualities could have enabled the minister to support the burden . We fear we must add , that under no Government like the British or ours , would it have been possible to support it long , if opposed by a powerful party operating through Parliament or Congress , and the press . The system might have gone on , but the minister must have sunk , harassed and worn down by the weight of so many cares and perplexities . But strong in the good-natured acquiescence of the King , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratified animosity of the people to England , and in the public opinion of Europe , the Count de Vergennes administered the Government with a skill and success , rarely allotted to statesmen even of a higher order of mind . His personal qualities come in for no little share of the praise . The patience and good-nature of the man helped out the politician // and the minister ; and we advise all irritable gentlemen , who are made wretched at the loss of a county election , or the removal of a post-master , to read the letters of the Count de Vergennes , at a time when the whole political system of Europe and America gravitated to the central point in his cabinet . The English writers accuse him of a want of judgment , in nourishing the spirit of revolt . He acted , they say , against the interests of the European system and in the cause of Revolution , and sowed the seeds which sprung up into such a wild and fatal growth in France . Wise after the event . The Count de Vergennes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought ,  --  alike in England and France ,  --  a fatal blow at the natural enemy of his country . We speak of course the language of the politicians of both . It was as impossible to foresee that this would connect itself with a Revolution shortly to follow it in France , as to predict the aspect of the clouds for a twelvemonth in advance . If the Count de Vergennes showed a want of sagacity on this score , the British Government showed it equally , in taking his policy in such ill part ; for it proved beneficial in the best sense to them . The policy of the minister was bold , decisive , and successful . No one can deny that . The degree of credit it may receive for generosity is a matter , on which men will differ , according to their system of thinking on the springs of political action . We conceive the Count de Vergennes to have been a liberal , warmhearted , and high-minded minister ,  --  and we tremble even now at the thought of what might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the opposite cast controlled the counsels of France at this period . Had France been ruled by a North , and England by a Vergennes , our independence might have fallen to be celebrated on the Greek calends . It is not the least tribute to the merit of Deane , that he had the credit of engaging the services of Lafayette in the cause of the Colonies . The stipulation for this object , bears date the 7th of December , 1776 , and is in the following terms . The desire , which the Marquis de Ia Fayette shows of serving among the troops of the United States of North America , and the interest which he takes in the justice of their cause , make him wish to distinguish himself in this war , and to render himself as useful as he possibly can . But not thinking that he can obtain leave of his family to pass the seas and to serve in a foreign country , till he can go as a general officer , I have thought I could // not better serve my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by granting to him , in the name of the very honorable Congress , the rank of Major-General , which I beg the States to confirm and ratify to him , and to deliver him the commission to hold and take rank from this day with the general officers of the same degree . His high birth , his alliances , the great dignities which his family holds at this court , his considerable estates in this realm , his personal merit , his reputation , his disinterestedness , and above all , his zeal for the liberty of our provinces are such , as to induce me alone to promise him the rank of Major-General , in the name of the United States . In witness of which , I have signed the present this 7th day of December , 1776 . SILAS DEANE . ' At the same time , Deane promised a Major-General 's commission to Baron de KaIb , and subordinate rank to other officers . The Baron de Kalb , as is well known , was a brave and excellent officer , who fell nobly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with M. du Coudray and other officers , subsequently entered into , in which he doubtless transcended his powers ; but his sagacity and address in promoting the purpose of Lafayette to engage in our cause are worthy of all praise ; and connect his name in an enviable manner , could any notoriety be desirable for a blighted fame ,  --  with one of the most brilliant incidents in our history . Such the connexion of Lafayette with our cause is unquestionably to be esteemed . It is a topic not yet exhausted ; it will bear again and again to be studied and scanned . Chivalry does not record a more beautiful example of heroism or principle ; of personal gallantry ; of enthusiasm for worthy objects ; of youthful wisdom and conduct , united to all the factitious and external advantages , which so seldom adorn real merit , but are so often accepted as its substitute , and so frequently choke its growth and exercise . Mr. Sparks has wisely consecrated a portion of one of the volumes of this collection ( the tenth ) to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . On his return to France , in 1781 , be was requested by Congress to confer with our Ministers abroad , and they were directed to consult him . Under this request , he made a journey to Spain , and rendered important services to Mr. Jay in his longsuffering negotiations with that ungenerous and selfish court . The variety of the avocations which Lafayette assumed , the diligence of his correspondence , and the prudence and vigor // of his conduct , are amply illustrated in the collection of his letters in the present work , and they exhibit to new advantage the character of this wonderful man . There have been those , who deny him the name of great . Let them point out another individual of the age , who has borne the test of a career as long and services as various ; - whose conduct has been as uniform , whose manners as pure , whose success as brilliant , and we will add , whose glory is as bright as his . But we find ourselves drawing near the close of oar limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which belong to a review of this work . One of these unquestionably is , the sincerity of the friendship of the French court in the negotiations for peace , and the opposite opinions of Dr. Franklin and of his colleagues on that subject . This is one of the great vexed questions of our revolutionary history . Mr. Sparks leans strongly to the complete espousal of Dr. Franklin 's views and the consequent vindication of the French policy , against the doubts of its sincerity , entertained at the time , by Messrs . Adams and Jay , and their friends in America . The question is obviously twofold , although the two points involved in it are closely connected with each other . One is the imputed desigii , on the part of France , at the close of the war , to unite with England in excluding us from the Newfoundland fishery , and to restrict our Western boundary to a line drawn far east of the Mississippi ; and the other is the connivance of Dr. Franklin in this policy of France , or if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect to counteract it . If the first imputation be without sufficient foundation , the second , of course , falls to the ground ; but although the first should be established , the second does not of necessity follow . It must also be admitted , that Dr. Frankun 's opinion of the sincerity of the French court is a strong argument against its imputed treachery . We have not space to go fully into the discussion ; but we own ourselves strongly disposed to the bright side of the question . We have the highest admiration of the talent , the political courage , the living ardor , and the unspotted purity of John Adams , the Colossus of Independence . ' None can exceed us in respect for the Spartan firmness , the matchless circumspection , the dignified patience of Jay . But these sentiments may be reconciled with the highest respect for Franklin 's sagacity , integrity , and patriotism , and for the sincerity of the French court . There // is no proof , that France was playing us false . The degree of countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative to the Western boundary was not greater , than is fairly explicable from the political and family alliance between the two courts of France and Spain . Whatever was gained by the United States , on the Western frontier , was lost to the King of Spain , the uncle and the ally of the King of France . Under these circumstances , it surely is going too far to complain of France , for urging the demands of Spain on our candid consideration* Farther than this , we do not find that France went . The suspicions contained in Mr. Jay 's letter of the 17th November , 178*2 , * relative to the object of M. Rayneval 's mission to England , seem to us to be satisfactorily met and answered in Mr. Sparks 's note appended to Mr. Jay 's letter . The letter of M. de Marbois is the strongest document against the sincerity of the French Court . But it is to be remembered , that this was a letter in French and in cypher , intercepted by the British , by them d*cyphered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Paris , to make an impression upon their minds . No candid person needs to be told , that this is a very unsafe medium of communication . We do not understand , that M. de Marbois has ever either admitted or denied the authenticity of the letter . There is great good sense in the view , which was taken of it by R. R. Livingston , the Secretary of Foreign Affairs at the time , in his letter to Mr. Jay of the 4th of January , 1783 . I am persuaded , ' says he , the last hope of Britain is founded on the distrusts they may sow among their enemies . I wish you had , in a private letter in cypher , informed me how you got at the letter of Marbois , and why it was copied into English . I more particularly wish to know , whether it passed through the hands of the British Commissioners . If it has , it will he of some consequence to see the original , not that I doubt its authenticity , but it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least doubt that this is exactly the truth . The addition of a very few words , such as those italicised at the close of the last paragraph but one in the letter , as printed in Pitkins ' History , * would give an emphasis and import to jt , vh*ch it might not have originally had . * Diplomatic Correspondence , Vol . VIII . p. 163 , and 208 , + Volume II . p. 531. // But granting it to be every word authentic , what is it , and what does it amount to ? It is a letter to the French Minister written by a young man , * the secretary of the French Legation , and Charg6 d'dffaires at Philadelphia , in the temporary absence of M. de la Luzerne . In this letter on the general politics of the colonies , M. Marbois imputes to Samuel Adams , and the party which he was supposed to lead , a disposition to prolong the war , prompted by a general and habitual spirit of opposing every thing ; and charges him with taking advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fisheries , to stimulate Congress to insist on terms , in reference to that interest , which Great Britain , it was believed , would not accede to . To counteract this policy imputed to Samuel Adams , and for the sake of removing obstacles in the way of peace , M. de Marbois recommends to the Minister , ( if it be to M. de Vergennes that the letter was addressed , for there is nothing in its contents to require that supposition , and its tone and manner are quite too familiar for a youthful secretary of Legation writing to the Minister , ) to intimate to Congress , that the King of France would not support them in their claims to the Newfoundland fishery . Is there any proof , that this suggestion , even on the part of Marbois , proceeded from any thing else than a sincere desire of removing obstacles to peace ? Independence secured , be mighty as a Frenchman , honestly doubt the expediency of prolonging the war , for the sake of enabling the Eastern States to fish on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Marbois were hostile , is there any proof , that the French Ministry adopted or acted on them ? Here again we can not but express our entire assent to Mr. R. R. Livingston 's view of the subject . Writing under all the strength of the impression produced by the first receipt of the letter , lie considers it of no importance : As to the letter of Marbois , ' says he , I am not surprised at it , since he always endeavors to persuade us , that our claim to the fisheries was not well founded . Yet one thing is very remarkable , and I hope evinces the determination of France to serve us on this point . The advice given to discourage the hope is certainly judicious ; and yet we find no steps taken in consequence of it . On the contrary , we have been repeatedly told , in // formal communications since that period , " that the king would do every thing for us that circumstances will admit , and that nothing but dire necessity shall induce him to relinquish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he does not imagine such necessity will exist . " This communication was made on the 21st of last November , from letters of M. de Vergennes of 7th September , previous to our success at Yorktown , and has been renewed at different periods since . * * This letter of Marbois , and the conduct of the court of France , evince the difference between a great politician and a little one . France can , by prohibiting the importation of fish , supply herself ; she can not do more . Our exclusion from the fishery would only be beneficial to England , &amp;c . ' In short , the war was extremely burdensome to France . Her finances were in a state of complete dilapidation , and yet she was daily called on , by the United States , in the most importunate manner , for the entire money supplies necessary to carry it on , and which she was obliged to furnish out of a revenue inadequate to the regular expenses of her own Governinent , to say nothing of her own war expenditure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vergennes should ardently desire peace , and be willing to obtain it on any terms not inconsistent with the honor of France and America . We are fully disposed , with Mr. Livingston*to regard this feeling as the key of the French policy , pending the negotiations . Mr. Livingston remarks ; From the general tenor of these letters those of the Count de Vergennes I can discover nothing but an anxious desire for peace , which might very naturally lead him to wish that objections , which he did not conceive essential in the first instance , ( after having declared to Great Britain that no peace could be made till our independence was acknowledged , ) should not break off a negotiatioti , which must end in the attainment of an object which they have as much at heart as we. * But granting , what we do not believe , that France was insincere and unfriendly , what proof or probability is there , that Dr. Franklin was guilty either of treacherous connivance or ignorance scarcely less criminal , on the subject of her policy . Without enlarging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an article in a former number of this Journal , * written by // Mr. Sparks , the indefatigable and judicious editor of the work before us , to whose researches into the revolutionary history of America , as contained in the archives of this country , of France , and of England , the public is under the highest obligations . That article contains , on page 17 , an extract from a letter of Mr. Oswald to Lord Shelburne , containing a report of a conference between Mr. Oswald and Dr. Franklin , on the conditions of a treaty of peace . In this conference , Dr. Franklin read to Mr. Oswald a written memorandum of points necessary to be granted , ' and points advisable to be granted . The fourth of the points necessary to be granted is , a freedom of fishing on the banks of Newfoundland . ' This letter was written before Mr. Oswald had seen Mr. Jay , and three months and a half before Mr. Adams joined our negotiators at Paris . But it would seem that this point ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We mean that of Messrs . Adams and Jay ; testimony for the first time made public , we believe , in the present work . It will be borne in mind , that Messrs . Adams and Jay coincided in opinion as to the wish of the French court , and its disposition to compel America to conclude a peace on disadvantageous terms ; that Dr. Franklin differed from them on this point , and that between Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams there was a want of friendly feelings . On the 10th of September , 1783 , Dr. Franklin addressed letters , of which the following is a copy , to Messrs . Jay and Adams . Sni ,  --  I have received a letter from a respectable person in America , containing the following words , namely ; " It is confi*dently reported , propagated , and believed by some among us , that the court of France was at the bottom against our obtaining the fishery and the territory in that great extent , in which both arc secured to us by the treaty ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not oppose this design against us ; and that it was entirely owing to the firmness , sagacity , and disinterestedness of Mr. Adams , with whom Mr. Jay united , that we have obtained these important advantages . " It is not my purpose to dispute any share of the honor of that treaty , which the friends of my colleagues may be disposed to give them , but having now spent fifty years of my life in public offices and trusts , and having still one ambition left , that of carrying the character of fidelity at least to the grave with me , I can not allow that I vrs behind any of them in zeal and faithfulfless . I theref*rc think , that I ought not to suffer an accusation , // which falls little short of treason to my country , to pass without notice , when the means of effectual vindication are at hand . You , sir , were a witness of my conduct in that affair . To you and my other colleagues I appeal , by sending to each a similar letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness to do a brother Commissioner justice , by certificates , that will entirely destroy the effect of that accusation . ' Mr. Jay 's answer to this letter is expressed in the following ample terms : Passy , September 11 , 1783 . I have been favored with your letter of yesterday , and will answer it explicitly . I have no reason whatever to believe , that you were averse to our obtaining the full extent of boundary and fishery secured to us by the treaty . Your conduct respecting them , throughout the negotiation , indicated a strong and steady attachment to both these objects , and in my opinion promoted the attainment of them . I remember , that in a conversation which M. de Rayneval , the first secretary of Count de Vergennes , had with you and me in the summer of 1782 , you contended for our full right to the fishery , and argued it on various principles . Your letters to me when in Spain , considered our territory as extending to the Mississippi , and expressed your opinion against ceding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . In short , sir , I do not recollect the least difference of opinion between us respecting the boundaries or fisheries . On the contrary , we were unanimous and united , in adhering to and insisting on them . Nor did I perceive the least disposition in either of us , to recede from our claims , or to be satisfied with less than we obtained . ' Mr. Adams , in his reply bearing date the 13th , after reciting the charge against Dr. Franklin , as contained in Franklin 's letter above quoted , proceeds as follows : It is unnecessary for me to say any thing on this subject , more than to quote the words , which I wrote on the evening of the 30th of November , 1782 , and which have been received and read in Congress , namely ; " As soon as I arrived in Paris , I waited on Mr. Jay , and learned from him the rise and progress of the negotiation . Nothing that has happened since the beginning of the controversy in 1761 , has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that entire coincidence of principles and opinion between him and me . In about three days , // I went out to Passy , and spent the evening with Dr. Franklin , and entered largely into conversation with him , upon the course and present state of our foreign affairs . I told him my opinion without reserve of the policy of this court , and of the principles , wisdom , and firmness , with which Mr. Jay had conducted the negotiation , in his sickness and my absence , and that I was determined to support Mr. Jay to the utmost of my power , in pursuit of the same system . The Doctor heard me patiently , and said nothing . " At the first conference we had afterwards with Mr. Oswald , in considering one point and another , Dr. Franklin turned to Mr. Jay and said , " I am of your opinion , and will go on with these gentlemen , without consulting the court . " He has accordingly met us in most of our conferences , and has gone on with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able and useful both by his sagacity and reputation , in the whole negotiation . " ' Taken even singly , we do not see what need be added to the strength of this attestation . In conjunction with the letter of Mr. Jay , in which the same coincidence of views between Jay and Franklin is avowed , which Mr. Adams sets forth as existing between himself and Mr. Jay , we do not see in what stronger terms , and from what authority so competent , the imputation against Dr. Franklin could be repelled . We own that we take pleasure in coming to this conclusion . It vindicates the honor and the fair fame of a man , whose repu1uion is a rich portion of the moral treasure of America . The whole matter then as between Dr. Franklin and his colleagues , will resolve itself into a difference of opinion , on the sincerity of the French court ; a difference of opinion unquestionably most honest . If we go farther , as we have already observed that our best consideration of the subject obliges us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judgment of Dr. Franklin , of the American secretary , and the majority of Congress was correct , we shall impute to Messrs . Adams and Jay nothing but an honest error in opinion , while we shall have the satisfaction of believing in the honor and probity of our first ally , to whose aid we are so deeply indebted for the success of the Revolution , and on whose motives we ought to rejoice to place the most friendly interpretation . A part of the fourth , the whole of the fifth and sixth , and a part of the seventh volumes of this work are appropriated to the correspondence of John Adams . As it is twice the amount of the correspondence of any of our other public agents abroad , // so it is proportionably rich in instruction in the political history of the times . Mr. Adams was appointed one of our commissioners to France on the 28th of November , 1777 , when Silas Deane was recalled . At the close of the year 1778 , Congress determined to have but one minister at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Adams returned to America , and arrived at Boston , on the 3d of August , 1779 , in the French frigate La Sensible , the vessel which brought M. de la Luzerne . On the 27th of the next month he was elected by Congress as a Minister Plenipotentiary , to negotiate a treaty of peace with Great Britain , whenever she should be disposed to put an end to the war . He arrived in the month of December in Europe . In June , 1780 , Mr. Adams was authorized to negotiate a loan for ten millions of dollars in Holland ; and in December of the same year was commissioned to negotiate a treaty of friendship and commerce with the United Provinces , and appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the States-General and the Prince of Orange . On the 14th of June , 1782 , four additional Commissioners , Franklin , Jay , Laurens , and Jeffersoii , were associated with Mr. Adams , to negotiate a peace with Great Britain . On the 8th of October , 1782 , Mr. Adams succeeded in bringing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and Holland , and was publicly received as the Minister of the former . Thus left at liberty , he proceeded to Paris , where Messrs . Jay and Franklin had been employed for three or four months in the negotiations for peace . He united his efforts with theirs , and on the 30th of November had the honor , as the senior Commissioner , to sign his name first to the preliminary treaty . He also took part in the discussions of the definitive treaty , and was the first signer of that instrument . He passed the winter of 1784 in Holland , and in February , 1785 , was appointed first Minister of the United States to the court of St. James . Returning in 1788 , he was elected first Vice-President of the United States . During this entire period , his correspondence was kept up with untiring industry . It is enriched with intelligence then important , from all parts of Europe , and with numerous state papers , not now easily to be found elsewhere . In his negotiations with Holland , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and acting as he did , in Opposition to the advice of the French court , which he was directed to convoL. xxxsu. - No. 73. 61 // suit , he deserves the undivided credit of having brought that negotiation to a successful issue ; as he did also the negotiation for a loan of money in the same country . None of the agents of the United States was longer employed in the foreign service , but one ( Dr. Franklin ) as long ; none exceeded him in industry , zeal , patriotism , and general intelligence ; none was more successful ; and none higher in the estimate of his countrymen . Mr. Jay 's letters from Spain and France are among the most valurtble parts of this collection . They are perhaps the ablest specimens of a guarded diplomatic style , which the work presents ; as prudence seems in fact to have been a prominent trait in his character . The letters of Mr. Jay from Spain , however , can not be read without feelings of unmeasured indignation against that cold , selfish , illiberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less enviable position . Mr. Jay was commissioned to obtain subsidies or a loan in Spain ; and Congress in the extremity of their wants , proceeded to the most irregular , and as the event proved , distressing step of drawing on Mr. Jay for one hundred thousand pounds , on the strength of his commission , and without the least ground to believe that he would succeed . Perceiving the distress in which Mr. Jay and the United States were placed , Count Florida Blanca attempted , by holding out a fallacious hope of supplying their wants , to extort concessions as to the navigation of the Mississippi and the Western boundary ; and had the almost incredible meanness to demand in return for the aids he proposed to furnish us , a re-inforcement of ships of war for the Spanish navy . After all , one hundred and fifty thousand dollars was the utmost amount , which Mr. Jay could wring from the Spanish court , by importunities , which it is impossible to read without shame for ourselves , and scorn and contempt for the paltry spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do justice to the French ministry , needs only contrast the conduct of the two courts . We ought , before we hurry from this part of the subject , to observe that the letters of Mr. Carmichael , who went out as secretary to Mr. Jay , and succeeded him at Madrid as Clrarg6 d ' . /Iffaires , are written with great ability , and evince an exceedingly active , able , and adroit diplomatist . They compare advantageously with the best contents of the work . We are constrained reluctantly to pass over the correspondence of Chancellor Livingston and of the French Ministers , // Gerard and M. de la Luzerne , with the single remark , that it does great credit to these gentlemen , and forms an instructive section of the work . Neither are we able to dwell particularly on those portions of it which contain the letters of the Messrs . Lees , Izard and Dana . But we must do an act of hasty justice to Robert Morris , the superintendent of the finances of the United States . Mr. Sparks has collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . They throw much light on the crazy condition of the finances of the country , and on the singular merit of Mr. Morris . This indeed stood on general admission before ; but we are inclined to think , that the reader of these volumes will come to the conclusion , that as Morris had the sagacity to single out and call into the financial service the talents of the youthful Hamilton , so he proved himself in the worst times of the Revolution a financier in no degree unworthy to stand on an equal footing with him , who has justly been called the father of the credit of the United States . His correspondence is not exclusively confined to finance , but extends to various topics , connected with the conduct of the war and the interests of America . The present collection forms one of a series of valuable works , which have been published , in pursuance of a resolution of Congress , of March 27th , 1818 . It has been preceded hy the Journal of the Convention which formed the Constitution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Congress ; the former in one , the latter in four volumes . In the original resolution , the foreign correspondence of the old Congress was directed to be published only to the year 1783 . At this point , therefore , the present work is abruptly brought to a close . It is evidently very desirable to have the correspondence of our diplomatic agents abroad , between the peace of 1783 and the adoption of the Constitution . This would comprehend the correspondence of Mr. Jefferson from Paris , and that of Mr. Adams from London , both we presume highly valuable , particularly the latter on the subject of the colonial trade . A resolution was reported to the House of Representatives at the last session of Congress , authorizing the Secretary of State to continue the work to the period of the adoption of the Constitution , under the editorship of Mr. Sparks . It is highly desirable that such a resolution should pass , as we trust it will , at a future session of Congress . Meantime we must not omit , in closing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our thanks to Mr. Sparks , for the manner in which he has discharged his duty , in preparing it for the press . He has reduced the vast mass of materials to convenient order , and supplied from other and authentic sources the lamentable chasms in the files of the Department of State . It is well known , that no other individual in the country has enjoyed equal opportunities to fit himself for an enterprise of this kind . We sincerely hope that he will be authorized to carry it on to its appropriate close . Three or four volumes more , we presume , will be sufficient for this purpose , and for an ample index to the whole work . Appropriations for purposes like these are , we know , obtained with some difficulty from Congress . But there is no expenditure of the public money more creditable to the country , or more likely to contribute to the general respectability of the public service . If there were no other consideration to recommend it , we owe it to the generation of patriots who achieved our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are perishing , the monuments of their talent , for their honor and our instruction.
